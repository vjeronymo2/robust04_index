			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Nato planners draw up Bosnia air-strike targets A LIST of Serbian targets for allied air strikes in Bosnia was being finalised yesterday by military planners at Nato headquarters in Belgium. But officials indicated that the allies were a long way from agreeing precisely what action by Serbs in the former Yugoslav republic would trigger air strikes - or what would avert them. Under the terms of the military agreement approved by the Nato council on Monday, air strikes can only begin if they have been specifically requested and approved by both United Nations and Nato leaders and if the Serbs have been given a clear warning, which effectively rules out 'surprise' attacks. Nato planners have outlined various military options for action. The type of operations understood to be under consideration include: the bombing of artillery positions around Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital; attacks on supply routes from Serbia; attacks on Serb command and control positions and possibly attacks on the Serbian stronghold of Pale near Sarajevo. Military experts yesterday stressed that initially the most likely course of action would be strikes around Sarajevo. Dr Jonathan Eyal, of the Royal United Services Institute, an independent think-tank, said: 'If the Canadians and others have signed up, it is unlikely that they have agreed to anything more than bombing around Sarajevo, given that their troops are out in Srebrenica.' French and British diplomatic sources yesterday indicated that attacks on UN troops remained the most likely reason for air strikes, and indicated that in spite of the political significance that Mt Igman has assumed, a renewed Serb assault on the mountain would not necessarily prompt action. However, US officials have indicated that continued expansion of Serb territory could be a reason for action.</p>

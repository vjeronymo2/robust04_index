[Hawatimah] As soon as we received word about the massacre,  the DFLP urged our people inside the occupied homeland and  abroad to observe a general strike for three days. I declared  this personally over the radio. Our people's response was  excellent. Confrontations are still going on. They covered all  of the 1948-occupied territory, from the Galilee to the Negev.  This is in addition to the occupied Palestinian territory in  the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and eastern Jerusalem. In the  diaspora, demonstrations, marches, and protests have not stopped.    We have also called for a halt to the negotiations on the  Palestinian-Israeli track until the settlements are dismantled,  in line with Security Council Resolutions 465, 605, 507, and  726. These resolutions were issued during the Carter, Reagan,  and Bush presidencies. We also urged that the settlers be  disarmed and that international protection be provided for the  Palestinians in the occupied territories, as happened in  Sarajevo. [passage omitted]    In addition to these political steps, the intifadah will  continue to resist occupation and settlement activity. Also,  armed fedayeen resistance to the occupation troops and the  settlers will continue. [passage omitted]    [Salihah] Do you support fedayeen operations against the  settlers? How will you react militarily?    [Hawatimah] We have stated clearly that the crime will not  go unpunished. The punishment will definitely be against the  settlers who are armed to the teeth in full view of the  occupation. The crimes of the settlers are the outcome of the  current political climate and Rabin's hawkish policy. Rabin  insists on having everything: territory, crossings, and  security. He is also pursuing settlement activity. He  earmarked $100 million in 1994 to expand the settlements. This  is in addition to the ideology preached by the Israeli rabbis,  urging settlement and expansion and making the Palestinian  territory a disputed land. Therefore, our fedayeen operations  will necessarily target the settlers. Every settler is a target  of the strugglers of the Red Star Battalions, the DFLP's armed  wing. The past stands witness that we are faithful to what we  declare. The coming days will see appropriate reactions to this  horrendous massacre. [passage omitted]</p>

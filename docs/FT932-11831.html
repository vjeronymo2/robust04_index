			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading A QUIETER but still heavy day's trading in the futures yesterday brought hints that the selling pressure of recent sessions may be easing, writes Christopher Price. The June contract on the FT-SE 100 opened weakly at 2,783 as worries persisted over the interest of US speculators and the bearish sentiment over the UK equity market. However, the contract then hit another bout of sustained selling and June tumbled to a day's low of 2,767. This level brought out the buyers, dealers reporting that these included some of the previous day's biggest sellers - suggesting that at least some of the bearish view of the market may have been exhausted. June rallied throughout the rest of the day, suffering continuing short periods of volatility. It finished at 2,788, two points ahead of the cash market but around 4 points below its fair value level. Volume was a bulky 13,300 contracts. One seasoned dealer said the contract was likely to trade within a 70-point range in the short term, with selling pressure probable up to a level of 2,820 and buying at the 2,750 mark. Traded options were busier, with several stocks recording large trades. BTR led the way with 5,560 contracts dealt, followed by Shell (5,005), Hillsdown (5,004) and Lonrho (3,368). The overall total was 47,286 lots, of which 11,862 were in the FT-SE 100 option.</p>

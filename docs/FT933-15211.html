			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / International Company News: Investment banks rush down Mexico way - State sell-offs and corporate shake-ups are proving irresistible US and European investment banks are flocking to Mexico, drawn by privatisations and the wholesale restructuring of Mexican businesses brought about by free trade pressures. From almost nothing five years ago, corporate finance activity in Mexico was worth almost Dollars 17bn last year, making Mexico by far the biggest market in Latin America. Virtually every important international investment bank - led by J. P. Morgan, Citibank and Goldman Sachs in the US, and in the UK by N. M. Rothschild and S. G. Warburg - has teams of bankers devoted to Mexico, either working out of representative offices, or from near-permanent suites in five-star hotels. Mexico prohibits international investment banks (apart from Citicorp) from setting up subsidiaries in Mexico - although this will change when and if the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement is approved by US Congress. Until now the most lucrative business has been privatisation. Goldman Sachs advised on the Dollars 5.4bn privatisation of Mexico's telephone company, Telefonos de Mexico; CS First Boston on the Dollars 12.4bn privatisation of the 18 banks; and S. G. Warburg on the steel mills sell-off. Scores of other banks, such as Baring Securities, muscled in on the deals as co-managers of equity issues. While the official privatisation programme is being wound up, the banks have been turning to private financing of Mexico's public infrastructure, offering the government advice on attracting private investment to electricity, roads, water, and other former state responsibilities. Such investment is likely to run into tens of billions of dollars over the next decade. N. M. Rothschild and partners have just opened a Mexican incorporated financial boutique to take advantage of such project finance opportunities, in which it has long experience in Europe and South America. 'We will now be able to expand on-shore activities significantly, which we were reluctant to do from the base of a representative office,' says Mr Charles Alexander, head of Latin America for the bank. Rapid changes in Mexican corporate strategy are fuelling demand for mergers and acquisitions work. Mexican companies, open to free trade for six years, are having to increase productivity to compete with foreign rivals. 'What happened in Europe after 1986 is happening in Mexico. Companies realise that with cross-border competition they needed to concentrate on what they do best, look for partners, and sell off peripheral businesses,' says Justin Manson, of Morgan Stanley. Undisputed leader in cross-border mergers and acquisitions is JP Morgan. It advised PepsiCo in its Dollars 320m acquisition of 80 per cent of the biscuit company Gamesa, Cemex on its Dollars 1.8bn purchase of the Spanish companies Sanson and Valenciana, and investors from Femsa on its Dollars 2.55bn purchase of 51 per cent of Bancomer. Unlike other banks, JP Morgan stayed in Mexico through the lean 1980s, building a presence. Such M&amp;A work has expanded significantly as Mexican companies look for partners, and as foreigners search for easy ways to enter the potentially lucrative Mexican consumer market. In the past 14 months, Cadbury Schweppes has bought the water arm of Femsa; Anheuser-Busch 18 per cent of Modelo, the brewer, for Dollars 477m; and Coca-Cola 30 per cent of the soft drinks division of Femsa for Dollars 195m. These acquisitions have been concentrated in distribution-intensive consumer product industries, where barriers to entry for foreign companies are hard to surmount. However, JP Morgan and other banks believe approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement will draw US firms looking to secure joint ventures in the manufacturing sector, and take advantage of cheap Mexican labour to export back to the US. While such joint ventures are expected to hold the greatest potential, last year there were more Mexican acquisitions of foreign companies than of Mexican companies by foreign concerns. The Cemex purchase of the Spanish cement companies and others pushed the value of such transactions to Dollars 2.8bn in 1992. These purchases reflect growing internationalisation of Mexican business, as free trade encourages large companies, such as Televisa, Cemex and Vitro, to compete globally. 'Some Mexican companies have essentially out-grown their market,' says Mr Richard Duron, head of Latin American M&amp;A for JP Morgan. 'You could expect many more of these deals.' Growing international competition has sustained the boom in Mexican international equity and debt offerings, as companies have sought to raise cheap dollar debt to upgrade plants and compete with international rivals. Last year, Mexico raised Dollars 7.2bn in debt and equity markets, according to Morgan Stanley, against Dollars 6.7bn in 1991, and a mere Dollars 252m in 1988. Mr Paul Zuckerman, head of Latin America for SG Warburg, says: 'Big companies have become subject to international competition. If they want to operate internationally they have to fund themselves on a competitive basis.'</p>

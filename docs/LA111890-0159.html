			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MONEY NOT ENOUGH  </P> <P> So Elizabeth Anne Broderick is accused of killing her ex-husband and his new  "younger" wife.  </P> <P> Never mind they "killed" Mrs. Broderick, legally, through a system controlled  mostly by male lawmakers, attorneys and judges.  </P> <P> Adultery is running rampant and acceptable. Women chase married men without a  thought of the destruction looming for an entire family.  </P> <P> Since a wife's consent is no longer needed for divorce, she is just pushed  aside and is expected to peacefully endure the loss of the man she loves, a  family, her friends, social contacts, the loss of her longtime marriage, safety  and everything she worked toward during her entire marriage.  </P> <P> Community property is 50-50 you say? Only if you can find it. Often husbands  hide assets.  </P> <P> Ex-husbands continue up the corporate ladder, their high earning power and  pension intact, while women, out of the work world for many years, begin again  at $6 an hour.  </P> <P> Despite Mrs. Broderick's high spousal support, money doesn't "buy off" the  destruction of a lifetime of dreams and the loneliness to come.  </P> <P> DIANNE NELSON  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

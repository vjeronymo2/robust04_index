			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Dublin urges London to legitimise unity goal: Tim Coone examines the painstakingly crafted wording intended to lead to a settlement in Ulster THE LEAKED document published by the Irish Press in Dublin yesterday, which sets out the Irish government's view on a possible peace settlement in Northern Ireland, is a draft counterpart to an earlier, equivalent British government paper which remains secret. Both papers were prepared after talks between civil servants from both governments over the past two months. Final drafts from both sides are expected to provide the basis for a statement from the British and Irish prime ministers, tentatively scheduled for early December. This would provide a blueprint for a peace settlement in Northern Ireland and a basis for resuming round-table political talks in the province. The document is not a final draft, and has not been politically cleared at the top level. Indeed Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, yesterday said it had no connection with the peace process. Nonetheless the document is the clearest indication yet of what is seen in Dublin as a basis for a political settlement. It also indicates the concessions Dublin is seeking from the British government in return for dropping its territorial claim to the province. Its main points are: Both governments must 'be open to change' in their 'constitutional doctrines' relating to Ulster to reflect more accurately the divided loyalties there, and would be required to 'encourage the process of agreement among all the people who inhabit the island'. Both governments would recognise 'the legitimacy of the two major traditions that exist in Ireland  - those who wish for no change in the present status of Northern Ireland, and those who wish for a sovereign united Ireland achieved by peaceful means and by agreement'. A downgrading of Dublin's constitutional claim to Northern Ireland  - to an aspiration  - would be balanced by Britain acknowledging 'the full legitimacy and value of the goal of Irish unity by agreement, cherished by the greater number of people living in Ireland'. 'Objective meaningful expression and opportunity' to the aspiration of unification would be created through new Anglo-Irish structures and by incorporation of special provisions into any new devolved government structures in Northern Ireland. A new devolved administration in the province 'would assume executive and legislative responsibilities over a wide range of subjects (but) must secure widespread acceptance throughout both communities'. New north-south institutions mandated by both parliaments 'to discharge or oversee a range of executive functions' to be 'administered uniformly throughout the island'. These functions could be expanded by agreement with the new devolved administration. These institutions would provide the framework for north-south co-operation, especially 'for developing an integrated approach for the whole island in respect of the challenges and opportunities of the EC'. They would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny, 'including any new inter-parliamentary forum which may be set up by agreement between elected representatives north and south'. A standing UK-Irish conference would 'guarantee and monitor' a new agreement, and would have 'contingency powers of intervention and redress' in the event that devolved power structures in the province failed to abide by their obligations. Majority consent in Northern Ireland to any change in its status would be constitutionally guaranteed by the republic in a new agreement. The majority in Northern Ireland are fully recognised to have a right 'to withhold consent for any such change unless and until they are persuaded by democratic political means only, free from coercion and violence'. Negotiations on a political settlement would be only between those 'committed exclusively to constitutional methods and not with organisations who use, threaten or support violence for political ends'. Organisations which have 'demonstrably expressed their commitment to the democratic process by renouncing violence' would be entitled to a role in negotiations. Any new agreement would require endorsement by 'the people'  - an oblique reference to an all-Ireland referendum. It is thought the document has elements of the peace plans formulated by Mr John Hume, Social Democratic and Labour party leader, and Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein leader.</p>

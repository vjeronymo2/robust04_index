			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BLUES AND BLACKHAWKS, BEST IN NHL, TIE AT 6-6  </P> <P> The St. Louis Blues looked to be cruising Wednesday night, when they built a  three-goal lead after one period against the Chicago Blackhawks.  </P> <P> But it took a goal by Jeff Brown with 4 minutes 43 seconds left in regulation  for the Blues to salvage a 6-6 tie at Chicago in a game between the NHL's top  two teams.  </P> <P> The Blackhawks, who trailed, 3-0, after one period and 5-3 after two, went  ahead, 6-5, with 8:06 remaining, when Adam Creighton and Wayne Presley scored  seven seconds apart. Steve Larmer had cut the deficit to, 5-4, by beating  Vincent Riendeau with a short wrist shot at 6:08 for his 25th goal of the  season.  </P> <P> Brown tied it when he picked up a loose puck and beat Ed Belfour with a slap  shot from the top of the left circle.  </P> <P> The Blackhawks, who were shut out by the Blues last Saturday, 5-0, had a power  play in the overtime, but Doug Wilson's shot from point-blank range hit the  post.  </P> <P> The Blues trail the Blackhawks, 53-48, in the Norris Division and the overall  NHL standings, but St. Louis has four games in hand.  </P> <P> Brett Hull, the NHL's top goal-scorer, got his 37th in 36 games and 12th  power-play goal, when he beat Belfour with a 25-foot wrist shot for a 4-1 lead.  Hull has goals in five of his last six games.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 7, Washington 3 -- Paul Coffey scored twice in 39 seconds during a  five-goal first period at Landover, Md., to help extend the Capitals' winless  streak to a season-high six games.  </P> <P> Coffey's 15th and 16th goals began a spree in which the Penguins scored four  times in a span of 2:16. Bryan Trottier got the third goal, the 1,369th of his  16-year career, to move into a sixth-place tie with John Bucyk on the NHL's  all-time scoring list.  </P> <P> The Penguins, who scored on four of their first five shots against Mike Liut,  improved to 7-1 in their last eight games.  </P> <P> Hartford 4, Quebec 1 -- The line of Ron Francis, Rob Brown and Pat Verbeek  combined for nine points -- a goal and two assists each -- to lead the Whalers  at Quebec.  </P> <P> Hartford goalie Peter Sidorkiewicz stopped 32 shots and had a shutout until  Tony McKegney scored at 6:12 of the third period.  </P> <P> Quebec failed to score in seven power-play chances, including three in the  first period.  </P> <P> Boston 3, Buffalo 3 -- Benoit Hogue scored the tying goal late in the second  period and the Sabres, though outshot, 35-16, by the Bruins, hung on for the  tie at Buffalo, N.Y.  </P> <P> Sabre goalie Clint Malarchuk preserved the tie with 7:40 remaining in  regulation, when he got a toe on Dave Poulin's breakaway shot. The shot hit  both posts before the net was dislodged.  </P> <P> Bruin goaltender Andy Moog extended his unbeaten streak to eight games.  </P> <P> Winnipeg 6, Minnesota 4 -- Ed Olczyk had two goals and an assist at  Bloomington, Minn., as the Jets ended a four-game losing streak.  </P> <P> Olczyk left the the game early in the third period after sustaining a bruised  left shoulder on a hard hit by Minnesota's Brian Propp.  </P></p>

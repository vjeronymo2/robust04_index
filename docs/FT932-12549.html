			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / EC moves to save ancient woodland THE GOVERNMENT has been given two months to respond to European Commission objections to plans for an east London river crossing, which will cut through the 8,000-year-old Oxleas Wood. If the government does not give a satisfactory response it will face action in the European Court of Justice. Environmentalists and Euro-MPs campaigning to save Oxleas Wood are worried that if the government insists on going to court, work on the road may start before the case can be resolved. Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the EC environment commissioner, told campaigners yesterday that he had sent London a 'reasoned opinion' last week, laying out Brussels' complaints. The Commission believes the government should have carried out an assessment of the plan's environmental impact, in line with EC legislation, before deciding the line of the new road. The Department of the Environment has always claimed that the Oxleas Wood procedure started before the EC directive came into force, and that the environmental concerns were taken into account. The Commission announced in January that it was not satisfied with the government's reply to its initial letter. EC action to halt the project is almost the last hope of campaigners, whose legal challenge to the work was defeated in the British High Court in February. Mr Paleokrassas met interested parties yesterday to discuss the issue. But he did not mention the possibility of a European Court injunction. Mr Peter Price, Conservative MEP for south-east London, who led the delegation, said yesterday that he understood that advance work on the site  -which could involve damage to the wood itself - might start early next year, but a court judgment would be unlikely before the summer. 'I'm very concerned about the timetable,' he said.</p>

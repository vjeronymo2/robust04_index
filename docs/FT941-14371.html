			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hopes for economic boost help Nikkei over 19,000 Hopes of an imminent announcement of economic stimulus by the government supported sentiment, and late afternoon buying by foreign and domestic investors pushed the Nikkei average above the 19,000 level for the first time since November 2, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index ended 524.85, or 2.8 per cent, ahead at 19,039.40 after a day's low of 18,515.65 and high of 19,118.81. The Topix index of all first section stocks advanced 29.76, or 1.9 per cent, to 1,541.15. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 7.02 to 1,280.56. The Nikkei faced small-lot profit-taking during the early morning. However, an overnight rise in the Nikkei futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange led the Osaka futures higher, triggering arbitrage buying. The underlying cash market rebounded on active demand by foreigners and domestic institutions, also spurring covering of short positions, especially in banks. Volume was 400m shares, up from 285m. Rises overwhelmed declines by 933 to 136, with 102 issues unchanged. The Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended Hanwa stocks after reports of the president's resignation. Market participants, however, said the suspension had little effect on the stock market. Hanwa, known for its extensive financial investments during the late 1980s, yesterday announced the resignation of Mr Shigeru Kita, its president. The TSE later declared that it would start an insider trading investigation on dealings in Hanwa shares, which have been moving erratically recently. The expected passage of the political reform bill through the upper house encouraged hopes of the government's announcement of an economic stimulus package, and an income tax cut which has faced delays due to the political situation. Banks were higher in active trading. Sumitomo Bank gained Y90 at Y2,100 and Industrial Bank of Japan Y70 at Y2,970. The rise in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone for the 15th consecutive day encouraged investors. The issue climbed Y5,000 to Y844,000. Oki Electric rose Y24 to a new high of Y608, as did Sony, which advanced Y100 to Y5,930. In Osaka, the OSE average added 313.02 at 20,914.02 in volume of 36.5m shares. Rohm, a semiconductor device maker, moved ahead Y110 to Y3,570 on active buying. Roundup Pacific Rim markets moved in sharply divergent directions. HONG KONG closed markedly higher amid optimism on bank results and Hong Kong Telecom's share price prospects. The Hang Seng index finished 346.08, or 3.1 per cent, ahead at 11,363.77, off a late high of 11,400.39 as the vice-chairman of Nomura International, Mineo Murai, said Japanese investment in Hong Kong stocks was likely to rise in 1994 on the back of optimism over China's economic growth. Turnover remained moderate, at HKDollars 8.42bn against Tuesday's adjusted HKDollars 8.79bn. MANILA surged 5.2 per cent on the strength of blue chips, which were boosted by gains in other Asian markets. The composite index added 151.31 at 3,062.28. PLDT, Dollars 1 3/4 higher at Dollars 74 1/4 overnight in New York, appreciated 100 pesos to 2,180 pesos. TAIWAN finished slightly higher after a late wave of buying focused on the heavily weighted financial sector. The weighted index, which opened easier and hit a low of 5,796, closed 33.90 ahead at 5,910.33. Turnover, however, fell to TDollars 70.94bn from Tuesday's TDollars 98.83bn as many buyers remained cautious, unsure whether the market's downtrend had ended. AUSTRALIA overcame early falls to close at a new post-1987 crash high as investors chased leading stocks. The advance was attributed to a shortage of scrip in a number of stocks and stronger overseas markets. The All Ordinaries index, down 3.3 points in the morning, ended 16.1 up at 2,248.2. SEOUL continued to rise on the back of healthy demand for blue chips, which have recovered nearly 70 per cent of the loss which followed government market-cooling steps last Friday. The composite stock index put on 14.10 at 887.16, but low-priced shares continued to tumble on worries of worsening liquidity. SINGAPORE was nudged higher by selective institutional buying, but overall sentiment remains cautious after recent declines. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 22.89, or 1 per cent, to 2,303.30. JAKARTA firmed in moderate trading as local investors focused on large-capitalisation stocks. The market index gained 3.98 at 595.99. BOMBAY steadied in late trading after a 3.2 per cent fall during the official session as local investors and financial institutions continued selling and overseas funds cut back on buying. The BSE 30 index lost 125.11 at 3,825.91. KUALA LUMPUR fell 2.6 per cent in thin trade as investors remained wary after the recent volatility. The composite index shed 28.44 to 1,081.78. BANGKOK weakened 1.2 per cent in thin trading as profit-taking more than wiped out early gains, with local funds hesitant to adopt new strategies while foreign institutional funds continue to sell. The SET index dipped 17.29 to 1,459.74 in modest turnover of Bt11.99bn. SHANGHAI A shares finished sharply lower and brokers predicted that the slide would continue as institutions bailed out of the market. The A index dropped 27.64 to 825.60 in a market driven by more rumours than usual: it was even suggested that stock exchange president Wei Wenyunn was about to submit his resignation.</p>

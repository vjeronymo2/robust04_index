			<p>Drug   Users   <F P=102> 94WD0285A Kuala Lumpur BERITA HARIAN in Malay 23 Feb 94 p 19 </F> <F P=103> 94WD0285A </F> <F P=104>  Kuala Lumpur BERITA HARIAN </F> <F P=105>  Malay </F> CSO     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, 22 Feb--Supplies of drugs that are  easily obtained around the capital any time of day or night make  the city a gathering place for drug users from all over the  country.    This situation has enabled authorities to arrest many users  in each operation it conducts, but limited detention facilities  present authorities with problems in holding users longer for  rehabilitation.    Ramil Abdul Samad, president of the Association of Former  Drug Users (PENGASIH), said that the influx of users is because  the capital for more than 10 years has been the center of the  drug trade.    He said the drug traffic around the capital has become the  focus of users from Pahang, Terengganu, Kelantan, Melaka, Negeri  Sembilan, and Johor, whereas users from the north gather in  Pulau Pinang to get supplies.    "Users from those areas gather in the capital because of the  ease in obtaining supplies, and they become vagrants living in  dark lanes and under bridges," he said.    He explained that limited detention space forced the  Enforcement Directorate of the Kuala Lumpur City Council (DBKL)  to release 40 of the 56 vagrants detained at the beginning of  this week.    In a joint operation by police and the Public Welfare  Department (JKM), vagrants were arrested in the act of injecting  drugs into their own bodies or in a state of hallucination after  taking drugs. Some of them were among those released.    Ramli said that districts around the capital where  small-scale drug traffickers gather to provide supplies to users  include Puduraya, Bukit Bintang, Petaling Street, and the Chow  Kit area.</p>

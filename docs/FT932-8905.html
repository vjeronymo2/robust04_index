			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Haider held back in Austria election AUSTRIAN right-wing populist Jorg Haider suffered a rare setback yesterday in provincial elections in Lower Austria, the country's largest province, writes Ian Rodger. His Freedom party took only 12.1 per cent of the vote, up 2.7 percentage points on its showing in the last Lower Austria election but well below its near-20 per cent tally in other recent polls. The setback was partly due to a breakthrough by the Liberal Forum, formed only three months ago by Mrs Heide Schmidt and other Freedom party defectors. The Forum won 5.1 per cent, for three seats in the 56-seat legislature, gaining most of its support in middle-class Vienna suburbs. Mr Haider's party increased its seats from five to seven. The conservative Austrian People's party (oVP) and the Social Democratic party (SPo) both lost ground. The oVP lost three of its 29 seats - and its absolute majority - as its share of the popular vote slid to 44.1 per cent. The SPo slipped to 34 per cent and gave up two of its 22 seats.</p>

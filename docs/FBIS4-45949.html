			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Manoj Joshi: "Rao Trying To Please Both Sides?"] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, April 28--The government's confused and  even contradictory response to the London talks underscores the  dilemma of the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao. Sources in  the external affairs ministry say that in his one-to-one  discussions with Mr Strobe Talbott, he conceded the U.S. demand  for a multi-lateral conference. However, U.S. counterparts are  claiming that the Prime Minister was quite definite in his  commitment while Indian officials claim that the acceptance was  conditional, the composition, agenda and modalities only being  thrashed out now in the secret talks, now public knowledge.    Most observers accept that Mr Rao will knowingly never do  anything against the country's interests, but many of them feel  that the Prime Minister is attempting to undertake the  near-impossible task of finessing a policy that will satisfy  both the United States and Indian interests. The talks in  London, the changed composition of the delegation indicate that  Mr Rao thinks he can pull it off.    One section of the government believes that Mr Krishnan's  brief is to stall for time and draw out the United States in  discussions on modalities, composition and so on, and allow the  Prime Minister to complete his U.S. visit.    However, another segment of the bureaucracy advocates  caution, arguing that the U.S. does not function in this manner  and will certainly obtain clear-cut Indian commitments before Mr  Rao reaches Washington, so as to make the Indian Prime  Minister's visit a substantive one from President Bill Clinton's  side. Mr Clinton will then be able to tell the U.S. Congress  that notwithstanding failures on other foreign policy fronts,  India and Pakistan have been brought around to accept the U.S.  non-proliferation agenda.    It may be recalled that in similar circumstances, in October  1987, the United States had brought pressure to bear upon India  to accept port calls from U.S. Navy ships involved in coercing  Iran.    A few weeks prior to Rajiv Gandhi's American visit, the  United States requested the visit of the USS  Enterprise to Bombay. But when this was turned down on  grounds that it went against India's policy of allowing ships  carrying nuclear arms into Indian ports, the United States  modified its request asking that only the cruise missile armed  USS Missouri be permitted. When this too was turned  down on similar grounds, the United States sent two other  frigates, which in their own way began the process that ended in  the Indo-U.S. joint naval exercise in 1992.    On second thoughts, the `secret' talks between India and the  United States in London to decide, "the concept and agenda" for  the multilateral talks on disarmament, appear even more curious.  Yesterday in Parliament, the minister of state for external  affairs, Mr R.L. Bhatia told the Lok Sabha that this was the  fourth round of bilateral official talks between India and the  United States. However, the official spokesman declared that it  was only "another round of bilateral discussions."    In response to a question, U.S. officials in New Delhi  accepted that these were indeed official talks, but made it  clear that they wished to "stay away from the numbers game," and  refrained from commenting on whether this was the "fourth," or  just "another" round of talks. This coyness conceals more  substantive issues.    The three rounds of bilateral talks between India and the  United States in February and May 1992 and September 1993--were  between two equal parties discussing security and strategic  issues. The London "secret" talks are a spin-off of these talks,  which seek to create a multilateral format to resolve the South  Asian "problem," by capping and eliminating India and Pakistan's  nuclear and missile programmes. Here these two countries come  under one category of "problem" states and the others--the  United States, U.K., France, Russia, China, Japan and  Germany--will be the guarantors of the Indo-Pakistani capping  agreement. Needless to say, this goes not only against the grain  of not just stated policy, but also Indian security interests.    United States' officials are being quite careful to note  that  not only are the talks official, since they are being conducted  by U.S. officials like the deputy assistant secretary of state,  Mr Robert Einhorn and Mr Norman Wulff, the acting assistant  director of the non-proliferation bureau, but their presence  together means that the key requirement of inter-agency  consultation has been met.    In our case, such subtleties do not matter. There appears to  have been no effort to consult the armed forces or the Ministry  of Defence, leave alone the Ministry of External Affairs. Even  more curious is the status of the leader of the Indian  delegation. "Distinguished," "senior" and "experienced" are the  adjectives being used to describe this former diplomat, but they  cannot hide the fact that he is a retired official and is thus  not quite accountable for his views or conduct to the government.    While the official spokesman says that such appointments are  the prerogative of the government and that Mr Krishnan enjoys  its confidence, it still does not answer all the queries about  his mandate and status as well as the manner in which serving  officials accompanying him are to deal with him.    Had he been given the status of a special envoy, such  questions need not have risen. But then, it is clear by now,  that the entire episode has been shoddily handled by the  government that pointing to one issue is of little consequence.</p>

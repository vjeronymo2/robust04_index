			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / International Company News: Top S Korean banks show wide profit fluctuations SOUTH Korea's 13 main commercial banks reported a 30.2 per cent rise in combined net profits to Won351bn (Dollars 434m) for the first half of 1993 helped by disposals of securities. The banks' total operating profits rose by 12.4 per cent to Won1,113bn. However, there are wide differences in individual performances. Korea First, Hanil, Cho Hung, and Korea Exchange posted large profit increases. Commercial Bank of Korea, Bank of Seoul and KorAm reported sharp declines in earnings as their loan loss provisions grew due to a record number of bankruptcies. Meanwhile, the Office of Bank Supervision issued a rare warning to CBK, criticising it for imprudent lending to Hanyang, a construction company that went into receivership in May. Korea First Bank had the largest net profits among the 13 banks with Won80.9bn, a 77 per cent increase. KFB attributed the profit rise to rationalisation measures, including reducing its staff and branch network, saving Won40bn per year. In addition, it had net gains of Won25bn on the sale of securities during the first half. Hanil Bank was the second most profitable bank with net profits of Won64bn, a 32.5 per cent increase, as it sold shares that produced Won31.8bn in capital gains. But the biggest profit increases were posted by Korea Exchange with a 310.9 per cent rise to Won41.5bn and Cho Hung with a 282.5 per cent jump to Won48.2bn. Shinhan remained one of Korea's most profitable banks with Won54.7bn in net earnings, although this represented a 16.9 per cent drop. The Bank of Seoul was least profitable with Won600m in net earnings, a 86.7 per cent decline, as loan-loss provisions increased to Won85bn from Won25bn a year ago. Net earnings at CBK shrunk by 20.2 per cent to Won9.9bn as its expanded loan-loss provisions of Won85bn outweighed the Won44.5bn it gained from the selling of securities. The profitability of CBK is expected to deteriorate further during the second half of the year since it holds about Won900bn in non-performing loans to Hanyang. KorAm's net profits fell by 58.9 per cent to Won5.8bn as it increased loan-loss provisions to Won12.6bn from Won1.3bn.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata with three </F> deans of the press corps and unidentified correspondents at the  prime minister's official residence in Tokyo -- live]    [Text] [Hata] Now, we will open the news conference.  Before fielding questions at this news conference, I would like  to say one thing. Former Prime Minister Hosokawa announced his  resignation on 8 April and I do not want to mention what has  happened since he made that announcement. I was elected prime  minister at sessions of both houses of the Diet on 25 April.  Looking back at the past eight months, I believe that the  coalition government created a new politics in Japan, and I have  taken pride in creating such new politics in our nation.  Therefore, I have called on the Social Democratic Party of  Japan [SDPJ] to join my coalition government and cooperate with  it. This morning, I met with SDPJ Chairman Murayama and SDPJ  Secretary General Kubo, but regrettably, we failed to reach an  agreement on together forming a new coalition government. I  would like to apologize to the people for delaying the formation  of my cabinet. In any case, I have now assumed important duties  as prime minister at this difficult time. What is more, my  cabinet is a minority coalition government and I anticipate that  my cabinet will face many difficulties. I think that I and my  cabinet members will cooperate with each other and do our best  to move Japan forward. In that sense, I would like to ask all  of you to give us guidance and understanding.    [First dean of the press corps] Mr. Prime Minister.    [Hata] Yes?    [First dean of the press corps] First, the deans of the  press  corps will ask questions, and then other reporters will ask  their respective questions. I would like to hold this news  conference that way. As the prime minister just said, it was  regrettable that the SDPJ broke away from the coalition  government. With the SDPJ staying out of the coalition  government, the Hata cabinet will become a minority coalition  government for the first time in 39 years. I anticipate that  the Hata cabinet will encounter many difficulties in the future.  I also anticipate that the Hata cabinet will find it difficult  to run the Diet, and to get the Diet to pass bills. The  instability of the Hata government will have an impact on  Japan's politics and the people's lives. Mr. Prime Minister, I  would like to ask your resolve, intention, and strategy to cope  with these difficulties.    [Hata] As you just pointed out, with the SDPJ breaking away  from the coalition government, my cabinet has now become a  minority coalition government. I believe that my cabinet will  face many difficulties in the future. With regard to the budget  for fiscal 1994, when I met with SDPJ Chairman Murayama and the  secretary general, they said that since they worked with us in  mapping out the budget draft, they would cooperate with us as  much as possible from the viewpoint that such cooperation is  good for our nation. As for the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP],  members of the LDP are my colleagues who ran the government for  a long time. Our coalition government will be at odds with the  LDP over some issues. Although the SDPJ quit the coalition  government, my coalition government will carry out policies on  the basis of a set of agreements previously reached among the  ruling coalition parties, and I think that I will be able to ask  the LDP to cooperate with my coalition government in carrying  out policies. I will seek such cooperation from the LDP at  every opportunity.    [First dean of the press corps] I have heard that the LDP  and  the SDPJ have announced that they would cooperate with each  other in confronting the coalition government. If those  opposition parties do as they announced, the coalition  government can only get the budget to pass in the Diet, but it  would not be able to do anything without their cooperation. I  think the coalition government will be reduced to a cabinet  charged with only handling the budget, and then general  elections will be held after the House of Representatives is  dissolved. Mr. Prime Minister, you have taken pains to  introduce the combined system of proportional representation and  single-seat constituency while promoting political reform. Mr.  Prime Minister, do you anticipate a situation where a bill on  the demarcation of constituencies is shelved and then the House  of Representatives is dissolved? How are you going to deal with  such a situation?    [Hata] As for your question, during today's meeting, SDPJ  Chairman Murayama and SDPJ Secretary General Kubo told me the  SDPJ will not back away from reforms. The Hosokawa coalition  government initiated the political reform for the first time in  70 years, and the people have supported the initiative. In the  past, the SDPJ cooperated with us in promoting political reform  while overcoming truly painful and tough difficulties. If  political reform is set back, Japan's politics would be made to  look ridiculous and there would be no genuine politics in Japan.  Originally, the Diet was a venue where politicians with varying  positions held debates. Policy debates are held to move forward  our nation and people. Many of the LDP members take the view  that political reform should be promoted. As for the political  reform bill, almost all LDP members supported it, and the bill  was passed in the Diet. Given this history, I am convinced I  will be able to obtain cooperation from each political party in  getting the bill on reforming the current tax system to pass in  the Diet. I believe we are not in a situation where the House  of Representatives needs to be dissolved.    [Correspondent] A conclusion will be drawn on how to reform  the current tax system in June, and I think that reforming the  current tax system will become the most important task for the  coalition government. With the SDPJ breaking away from the  coalition government, however, the ruling coalition parties  would have difficulty pushing for reform of the current tax  system. The coalition government also would find it difficult  to raise the consumption tax. Mr. Prime Minister, how will you  take political responsibility if and when a bill on reforming  the current tax system is rejected by the Diet? How are you  going to cut taxes next year?    [Hata] I would like to answer your last question. The ruling  coalition parties have decided to cut income tax for only one  year in the course of discussing how to reform the current tax  system when the Hosokawa government was in power. I believe  that the people and the coalition partners invariably feel the  need to continue cutting income tax forever. Cutting income tax  will incur a fall in the fiscal revenues. The prolonged  recession has resulted in a fall in fiscal revenues. If the  income tax continues to be cut, it will cause other major fiscal  problems. It is impossible to deal with the fiscal deficit by  issuing deficit-covering bonds. In any case, the budget for  fiscal 1994 will register a deficit of more than 200 trillion  yen this summer. While Japan is becoming a senior-citizen  society, nobody wants taxes increased to deal with such a  society. When we think that we will have to practice  responsible politics, we have to discuss how to reform the  current tax system by the end of June. I think the coalition  government needs to do its best to get a bill on reforming the  tax system to pass in the Diet. I would like to refrain from  predicting whether the bill will be passed or not in the Diet.  In order to make Japan stable in the future, debates should be  held on how to increase the people's tax burden. I believe that  if such debates are not held, the issue of reforming the current  tax system will be deferred until later. As I said in my  statement, I intend to seek the people's understanding of the  need to reform the current tax system while appealing to them.  I also think I need to indicate to the people that reforming  the current tax system will improve their lives.    [Correspondent] This is not related to the previous  question. Under the current circumstances in which tension has  been mounting regarding the issue of suspected DPRK nuclear arms  development, former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has been  thinking about Japan's defense and has undertaken efforts to  have his ideas reflected in the fiscal year 1995 budget during  informal meetings on defense issues. Mr. Prime Minister, do you  intend to continue along this line?    [Hata] Yes, I do. Regarding this issue, the problem of what  to do about national security in the post-Cold War era is being  discussed by people from the private sector in the informal  meetings which you have mentioned. Broad discussions on the  entire issue should of course be conducted, but I feel we should  have second thoughts about deciding to do one thing or another  without first arriving at a conclusion. In any case, we will  deal with the issue of the budget while having thorough  discussions, on the results of which we plan to place great  emphasis.    [Correspondent] Concerning the currently stalled  Japanese-U.S. framework trade talks, what is your outlook  regarding resumption of the talks? Do you have any plans toward  breaking the impasse, such as you yourself visiting the United  States or sending the foreign minister?    [Hata] As for breaking the impasse, I recently held a  meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in  Marrakech. We agreed to keep our doors open at all times and  mutually acknowledged our problems. Therefore, we now plan to  consider taking advantage of such opportunities to be able to  always conduct debates in a calm manner. In any case, the  biggest reason that we started the framework trade talks was the  fact that Japan had a huge trade surplus. This does not merely  concern Japanese-U.S. relations, but, for example, it also means  Japan has a huge current account surplus with the EU and other  countries. Therefore, when the framework trade talks broke down  in the early hours of 11 February, I told members of relevant  government ministries and agencies that this does not mean Japan  and the United States would do one thing or another because  matters have been settled, but rather that even though  negotiations have broken down, Japan, after all, needs to open  its markets. This is what the Hosokawa administration has  advocated since its inauguration. Japan should then be  invigorated in the process, resulting in improving the  livelihood of the Japanese people. Therefore, we should take  the initiative to carry this out. It has been decided that we  will include in the outline of the economic reform, which was  announced on 29 March, plans designed to ease or remove the  government regulations in June and plans to form a committee on  administrative reform that would include members from the  private sector. In the process of carrying out such plans, we  must of course hold discussions with the United States. The  time is not right for me to visit the United States. Anyhow, I  would like to study this in the future. After all, Japan and  the United States must understand each other regarding economic  issues. The two nations have been cooperating on political and  security issues and global issues, such as the environment and  AIDS. However, if they fail to get along on economic issues,  the peoples of both nations will become frustrated. The  exchange of harsh words between the two nations have given rise  to anti-American or anti-Japanese sentiments in the past as  well. Therefore, no matter how well the two nations may seem to  be getting along, we feel it is necessary to promptly work  toward bringing about a situation where both nations can  cooperate with each other regarding economic ties. This will  not only be beneficial to our nation, but it should also serve  to indicate one possible direction to the peoples of other  countries of the world, who are anxiously watching the  situation. I would also like to confirm that what Japan and the  United States talk about will not only be beneficial for the two  nations, but that the results of such talks should be spread  equally among other countries of the world.    [Correspondent] Regarding the situation on the Korean  peninsula, I think it is basically understood that the issue  would be settled through dialogue. However, when U.S. Defense  Secretary William Perry visited Japan recently, he indicated the  possibility of imposing sanctions against the DPRK through  multilateral efforts under a framework other than the United  Nations in case this cannot be carried out by the United  Nations. Do you intend to endorse this idea?    [Hata] Regarding this issue, as you may now be well  aware, I regret to say it has been reported to the United  Nations that the International Atomic Energy Agency was unable  to conduct a thorough inspection. Even under such  circumstances, the United Nations discussed the matter primarily  within the UN Security Council. It decided that, at this stage,  instead of adopting a resolution for imposing sanctions or other  measures, it would issue a statement urging the DPRK to first of  all allow thorough inspections of its nuclear facilities and  calling on both the DRPK and the ROK to exchange special envoys  and declare the Korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons.  Therefore, I believe that at this time, it is of utmost  importance that we ask the DPRK to respond to the international  community and open its heart to erase such suspicions. For this  reason, we naturally would like to continue urging other nations  to try to maintain holding adequate talks with the DPRK.  Generally speaking, however, if the United Nations makes a  certain decision, I feel Japan should offer to cooperate within  the limits of the Constitution. Regarding the last part of your  question, this is not the appropriate time to discuss such an  issue.    [Correspondent] In that connection, regarding the revision  of  laws within the framework of the Constitution in case of  emergencies, to what extent do you intend to deal with the issue  of enacting emergency legislation?    [Hata] This does not concern only the issue of DPRK's  suspected nuclear arms development. There naturally may be  discussion of issues such as our country's security and  stability or contingency plans in the event that something  should happen. At this time, however, we have no plans about  what to do immediately in such a case.    [Correspondent] That concludes questions by the deans of the  press corps. Other correspondents may feel free to ask  questions now.    [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister.    [Hata] Go ahead.    [Correspondent] Regarding the formation of a unified  parliamentary group which triggered the breakup of the  coalition, we feel that was a very clever move. We also believe  that it runs counter to the political stance you have taken thus  far. Were you not able to restrain such moves after you became  prime minister and were you not angered by them? Can you tell  us about this?    [Hata] Concerning this problem, I have frankly told members  of the SDPJ that I regret that this has happened after they had  cast their votes for me, particularly when I was in the midst of  selecting cabinet ministers. Since there are many parties in  the coalition alliance, I have always felt it would be better if  there could be improved mobility in dealing with various  problems and if everyone could conduct debates in as few places  as possible. Frankly speaking, however, I did not know it had  gone this far. At the time I learned about it, I was in the  midst of carrying out official duties instead of being involved  with the affairs of my party. In that sense, there was a  problem. However, by the time I heard about it, I was told that  the SDPJ had already approved of the idea, and that Komeito  [Clean Government Party], too, had approved it. Moreover, there  were rumors at that time that the SDPJ would be joining the  upper house parliamentary group Shin Ryokufukai. Under such  circumstances, I felt at that instant that it was wonderful that  things were proceeding so smoothly. In reality, however, as  talks proceeded, I became aware that there were  misunderstandings. I regret to say that by that time, things had  already gone too far. Regarding this point, I felt it necessary  to make sincere apologies to the SDPJ, and that is exactly what  I tried to convey to the SDPJ today.    [Correspondent] In that regard, I believe a lot of public  confidence in the political system was lost due to such  falterings. What do you intend to do to regain the people's  confidence?    [Hata] All right. Concerning this point -- naturally it  must be about the fact that this is a coalition government.  Frankly speaking, I feel the difficulties facing a coalition  government have been exposed. However, I do not feel that those  who came up with ideas or put their ideas into action did so  with evil intentions. I wonder why talks could not have been  held in such a manner that everyone could understand each other  within the framework I have mentioned earlier. On this point, I  have made sincere apologies to the SDPJ, as I already mentioned.  Therefore, such misunderstandings should be avoided from now  on, although people always have misgivings about many things.  Being obsessed with something can often lead a person to make  mistakes. Regarding such points, it is thus necessary to create  an environment in which frank discussion can be held,  particularly in case of a unified parliamentary group. It is  more so when it comes to supporting a minority government. In  that sense, I strongly feel we need to strive harder to create a  place for conveying our thoughts to each other.    [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister.    [Hata] Go ahead.    [Correspondent] It seems Sakigake [Harbinger Party] and the  SDPJ pulled out from the coalition alliance because of the  ruling coalition parties' decision-making process. In the  future, do you have any plans to reconsider the current  decision-making process centering around the party  representatives' caucus, or do you have any new plans to replace  this process?    [Hata] Well, it is true that we disagreed during the  process of reaching policy agreement. However, I think we felt  we disagreed because we had candid arguments expressing what  each party or individual felt. Those who, we thought, were at  loggerheads with each other, were beginning to form fiduciary  relations or friendships among themselves. It is true that we  were not in accord. However, I think it appeared very clear to  the people what we were arguing about. Every one of us has a  different background and different beliefs. Therefore, it was  natural for us to argue with each other. After the arguments,  however, we felt for sure that we could find a new direction.  We are all politicians who are responsible for guiding the  country. I strongly felt that I had to do what I had to do even  at the risk of sacrificing my private feelings    When I was talking with American officials, they told me  that  they had frequent arguments with European and Canadian  officials. They told me not to take it too seriously even if I  had heated discussions with others. Despite heated discussions,  they mutually feel friendship when they meet next time.  Therefore, I think it is important to have freer arguments.    [Correspondent] The coalition became a minority immediately  you were elected for the post of premier. I think the people  remain unconvinced of the fact that your administration is  supported by the minority coalition. I think many people feel  it is a matter of course for your administration to dissolve the  cabinet immediately after approving the budget, and to seek the  judgment of the people. What do you think of such an opinion?    [Hata] As I have been explaining, the discord was created by  mutual misunderstanding. When I met them, I told SDPJ Chairman  Murayama and Secretary General Kubo that we still have not given  up hope of having the SDPJ in the coalition again.    We mutually crossed the barriers and cooperated with each  other during the past eight months. The SDPJ was not the only  party who made compromises. We made concessions too. We are  beginning to use words which we hardly ever used when we were  members of the Liberal Democratic Party. For example, a company  building becomes big as the company grows bigger. However, its  employees may still spend two hours or two and a half hours, or  some people many spend four or five hours, for commuting. Among  other things, we realize that we have to deal with such issues.    Therefore, needless to say, our door is still open as I told  the SDPJ leaders today. I told them we will continue our  efforts to help them understand us better. I also told them we  will continue our efforts to form a new coalition. We will not  carry out state affairs by taking the decision, which we have  been discussing, as the final conclusion. We would prefer to  try to seek a chance to join hands once again.    As I look back at the things that have happened during the  past eight months, it is true that we did some things which  angered the SDPJ. However, we need to forthrightly apologize to  the SDPJ for the mistakes we made, and to realize the  significance of the coalition we had in the past eight months.  We also should realize that Japan's new course is about to be  formed as a result of our mutual concessions. While explaining  this point, we will try to assume a stance which will enable us  to somehow gain cooperation from the SDPJ. For that purpose, I  will do my best.    [Correspondent] Certainly, the formation of the  parliamentary group "Kaishin" helped lead to the departure of  the Social Democratic Party of Japan from the coalition. But  this was only one reason. For the past eight months, the SDPJ's  distrust of other coalition partners has deepened, and the  formation of Kaishin made the party decide to secede from the  coalition. This is what SDPJ members and many people have said.  Thus, I believe differences in opinion on the formation of the  parliamentary group are not the only reason that the SDPJ had to  secede from the coalition and the Hata cabinet has become a  minority ruling government. There were many cases in the past  in which the SDPJ and other coalition partners failed to reach  an agreement. I think the coalition government should have a  sense of remorse about this.    [Hata] We have a sense of remorse over our acts. But I do  not think that we failed to reach an agreement on everything.  Among SDPJ members who have agreed to support the coalition  government, some are very angry about the formation of Kaishin.  We should take this fact seriously. We have to reflect on this  fact. We have faced many difficult issues for the past eight  months. When we faced these difficulties, strong leadership was  required to overcome them. SDPJ Secretary General Kubo said  that it was very tough to tide over one problem -- the  difficulty of achieving tax reform -- after all of the other  difficulties. I fully understand his comment. I think it is  important that while reflecting on past mistakes, we should  create an environment wherein decisions can be made through  negotiations. I still have not given up. We have achieved many  things in the past eight months, although it was a very short  period. This will be historically acclaimed in the future. I  believe other people also think this way.    [Correspondent] In describing your relations with Shinseito  Chief Secretary Ichiro Ozawa, you recently said that Ozawa is  the person who draws up scenarios and you are the one who acts  on them. Mr. Ozawa commented on the formation of the new cabinet  this afternoon, saying [words indistinct]. Does this division  of roles still exist? Or since you have become the prime  minister, will you draw up scenarios by yourself?    [Hata] Maybe because of the news media's access to a large  amount of information, you all tend to report as truthful  everything people say, as if their statements were always a  reflection of reality. When I was asked by correspondents about  my relations with Ozawa at a time I was about to ride on a  bullet train after canvassing, I told them that you cannot do  things by yourself. You can draw up scenarios, but actors do  not always act on scenarios. Actors may choose their favorite  scenarios and sometimes ask writers to rewrite them. I said  this to them. It seems that you have taken what I carelessly  said the wrong way.    At least, I have been in the political world for 25 years  and have been faced with problems in completely different  fields. I have had much experience with role-playing based on  scenarios of my own design.    When I was foreign minister, I could not do anything but  attend to my official duties. You must have someone to take  care of party affairs. My relations with Ozawa are something  like that. Somebody said that I consulted with him over the  issue of the cabinet lineup. In former times, a prime minister,  when forming his cabinet, always consulted with the party  secretary general. You cannot do things by yourself. A rumor  has it that we yelled at each other in a bathroom. We did not  do any such thing. However, since we have been friends for 25  years, we can actually help each other by yelling at each other.  He does not interfere with the things I do. On other occasions,  he may ask me to help him out. I would like you to understand  that our relations are like this.    [Correspondent] The new cabinet is supported by a minority  ruling coalition, and you yourself said earlier that the  situation was very severe for you. Some of the people are  worried that your administration may be short-lived. How would  you respond to that?    [Hata] Well, I do not believe that people are saying that.  I know the news media have said that the new cabinet will not  last long. Anyway, if we steadily implement our policies, and  if the people think what we are doing is right, we will be able  to gain the people's understanding. At the same time, I  strongly hope to create circumstances in which the Social  Democratic Party of Japan can agree on our policies and  cooperate with us in carrying them out.    [Correspondent] I have the feeling that because the SDPJ  left the coalition, the Hata cabinet might take the same  political stance as the Liberal Democratic Party. Could you  explain differences between the Hata government's political  techniques and styles and those adopted by the LDP-led  governments of the past?    [Hata] The coalition is composed of Komeito, the Democratic  Socialist Party, and other parties which were opposition parties  eight months ago. Therefore, it is impossible for us to adopt  the same political stance as the LDP did when it was in power.  I want to stress that the coalition government, established  eight months ago, was the first such government in 38 years.  Under the Hosokawa coalition government, I had to make hasty  decisions in time for deadlines set to deal with various issues.  At that time, I was criticized as being high-handed and hard on  others. I think that as the coalition government gradually  matures, we will begin to respect others' opinions and styles,  to compromise with each other, and to seek new things. In  short, we will begin to seek new measures to improve the living  standards of the people. As I said earlier, the Hosokawa  coalition government began to pay attention to issues concerning  the environment and working people, which the LDP did not. I  think this is the result of our 8-month-long learning process,  and I evaluate this highly.    [Correspondent] What will be the priority tasks to be  tackled by the Hata government? I am sure there are many urgent  tasks.    [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, what tasks will your  coalition government emphasize?    [Hata] The political reform bill was passed in the Diet, and  it is necessary to establish the major elements of political  reform. We need to do that. I think that one of the coalition  government's major tasks is to create a new political system in  Japan. Although it is said that Japan's economy is now showing  some signs of recovery, its recovery is not certain. Looking at  the unemployment rate, we cannot be optimistic about the  economic recovery. Japan's politics and enterprises are doing  something to help foster economic recovery. I believe the  coalition government is now expected to abolish or ease  regulations, promote administrative reform, and establish an  open information system. Therefore, the coalition government  will have to work on those issues. As I said just a while ago,  the coalition government will have to work on addressing the  issue of the ratio of direct to indirect taxes in total tax  revenues. The coalition government will also have to work on  cutting the income tax while pursuing a welfare policy. The  coalition government will have to upgrade the current social  structure to prepare for a society of senior citizens. The  coalition government has those tasks. I believe that it is  important to make known the current situation to the people and  ask them to share burdens to deal with the issues. What I  realized while serving as finance minister and foreign minister  is that all of the nations of the world -- including  industrialized nations, nations in transition from planned  economies to capitalist economies, developing countries trying  to take off, and other developing countries -- pin high  expectations on Japan. They do not expect only money from  Japan. They ask Japan to transfer technology and other know-how  and cooperate with them in other fields. Japan should make  international contributions in response to other countries'  requests. Japan should also help with the reconstruction of  war-ravaged nations and provide aid to nations plagued by  conflict. This is what the outside world expects from Japan. I  believe that if Japan fails to play a proper role in the world  and make international contributions, it will be impossible for  the nation to further develop itself. I think that those are  tasks the coalition government should take on in the future.    [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, on the day when former  Prime Minister Hosokawa announced his resignation, you asked  what Japan will be like and said that you were fretting about  Japan's future. What sort of message does the coalition  government intend to send to the rest of the world?    [Hata] As I stated briefly a while ago, I intend to help the  international community understand that Japan is an open nation.  At the same time, Japan inflicted mental wounds on people in  many nations during the past war, and some of those people lost  their lives. I believe that Japan must engage in candid  soul-searching regarding what it did to those people. Japan has  so far followed the path of peace while engaging in such  soul-searching. All nations of the world have understood what  Japan has done, and they have supplied Japan with resources  while seeking manufactured goods from our country. Japan has  become the industrialized nation it is thanks to their  cooperation. Japan would not have been able to become the  industrialized nation it is if all the nations of the world had  not understood our country. As I said a while ago, Japan should  aggressively provide aid to developing countries and other  nations trying to transform themselves. I believe that Japan is  being asked to make clear that it intends to make international  contributions toward world peace.    [Correspondent] Last year, the ruling coalition parties  succeeded in seizing power from the LDP because of their  cohesion. This time, however, the ruling coalition parties  succeeded in remaining in power despite their minority role in  the Diet. Mr. Prime Minister, what do you think of this  contradiction?    [Hata] The SDPJ broke away from the coalition government  over the issue of forming a parliamentary group. SDPJ Chairman  Murayama and SDPJ Secretary General Kubo told me that the SDPJ  will cooperate with the coalition government in dealing with  such issues as political reform and the budget. As I said at  the outset of this news conference, the LDP supported the  coalition government on major policies in the Diet. Looking  back at various things that have taken place in the past, I am  convinced that when I strive for the sake of our nation to  transcend the power struggle and I work to move our nation  forward, the SDPJ and the LDP will cooperate with me.</p>

A spokesman for the security forces told ACAN-EFE that  unidentified persons inside a vehicle fired at the diplomatic  mission as they drove by. No one was injured, and there was no  property damage.    Embassy guards did not repel the attack, which took place at  around 2330 (0530 GMT Friday), when the city was still without  power as a result of three downed high tension towers in  different areas of the outskirts of the city. No organization  has claimed responsibility for the attack.</p>

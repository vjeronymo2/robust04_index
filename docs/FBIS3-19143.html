			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Democratic Alliance leader Ferdinando </F> Adornato by Alberto Leiss in Rome; date not given: "Adornato  Answers Serra: We All Stand Together, But To Govern" -- first  paragraph is L'UNITA introduction]    [Text] "Relax, Ferdinando," wrote [satirical journalist]  Michele Serra in L'UNITA the other day. His reluctance to join  up with Rete and Communist Renewal is a "neurosis" that  threatens to degenerate into an "obsession." "Take your mind  off Bertinotti and Orlando and try to focus on the students who  vote for Rete and the factory workers in the north who vote for  Communist Renewal." We met the target of the article,  Ferdinando Adornato, during his election campaign in Umbria. He  had no intention whatsoever, he said immediately, of quarreling  with Serra.    [Leiss] So there is no neurotic obsession?    [Adornato] We in AD [Democratic Alliance] were the ones who  promoted a climate that would allow different forces to stand  together. We said, "Being different is not an obstacle, it is a  source of enrichment." When we proposed a single symbol for a  single alliance, they accused us of wanting to dissolve the  parties. Then that is exactly how things went....    [Leiss] Then why all this insistence on keeping Orlando and  Bertinotti out of government, out of a future "Democratic Party?"    [Adornato] Different political traditions can stand  together,  but not diverging political platforms. I am convinced that the  progressives' job is to govern, not to continue playing at  opposition. I think that this is also of interest to the  students and factory workers with whom Serra suggests I take up.  Many of them vote for the League, for Fini, and for Berlusconi.  Does this mean we should be talking to them as well?    [Leiss] Is a more moderate position needed to get through to  these voters?    [Adornato] No. Proposals for radical changes are what is  needed. For example, we must sweep away the old method whereby  the parties took possession of the state and society. But  politics should speak a temperate language and make sure that  rationality wins over the prevailing climate of brawling and  bawling.    [Leiss] Away with the parties. Nevertheless, when it came to  presenting candidates and collecting signatures, it emerged that  a bit of organization is not a bad thing.    [Adornato] What I am talking about is the end of the single  public spending party, of a political system that cut civic  society out completely. There must be organized political  forms, of course there must, and we are working to achieve a  great democratic party taking in the Catholics who jump off the  centrist fence, the nonreligious, the environmentalists, the  democratic left ....    [Leiss] Without Rete and Communist Renewal? Do the Italian  situation and tradition not suggest a federative "path" showing  greater respect for the various individual elements?    [Adornato] We are not precluding anyone. We can all change,  especially now that the ideological preconceptions have gone by  the board. If anything, it is Rete and Communist Renewal that  express positions tainted by ideological attitudes. I, too, am  in favor of federative stages, indeed, it is what is already  happening, is it not?    [Leiss] Does not the brawling spring from turning [politics]  into too much of a show, a factor for which another "neurotic  obsession," with television, is responsible?    [Adornato] I agree with you there. At times they tell me I  appear too earnest. I appreciate that a bit of a show does no  harm, but politics is a serious matter.    [Leiss] Does the fault lie with the media or with the  political leaders?    [Adornato] There is something of a vicious circle between  politics and the media, which push the Sgarbi [controversial  talk show host and deputy] model. But this Grand Hotel with all  its chandeliers runs the risk of having nothing real to tell the  voters.    [Leiss] What is there to tell them?    [Adornato] At 15 days from the poll, the progressives must  be  made aware that the problem is not merely one of beating  Berlusconi. I am not at all worried by the opinion polls that  show Forza Italia in the lead. The only ones capable of  providing a reliable government to rebuild the country are the  progressives, and the emphasis must be placed on their platform,  to give it substance and credibility.    [Leiss] How, for example?    [Adornato] We shall be seeking to explain in Rome tomorrow,  at the event promoted by the Italian intellectuals who have  launched the "Ragiona Italia" [Reflect Italy] appeal, in the  Sala Umberto. The speakers will include the Norberto Bobbios and  Umberto Ecos of this world, who propose the country should  follow the path of reason, not the Bossi-Fini-Berlusconi union,  which has no underlying principles. What Italy needs is a new  pact between the professions, business, and the world of work to  take the place of the old deal between evaders and those  benefiting from state support, a pact that will promote the  market and development but will not cut off the lifeline of  solidarity.    [Leiss] A pact in favor of a "constituent government?" Is  Occhetto right to criticize this formula as outdated?    [Adornato] I agree that the electorate must vote first, then  the discussion can begin. The progressives can win. And the  formula of the old political system is obsolete.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Eduardo Ishii Ito, executive secretary of </F> the Ministry of the Presidency's International Technical  Cooperation, CTI, agency, by unidentified EL PERUANO reporter;  place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [EL PERUANO] What is CTI's  situation in Peru now that conversations with the U.S.  Government have resumed?    [Ishii] Our International Technical Cooperation is going  through a process of growth and clear evolution at a time when  we are resuming full diplomatic relations at the ambassadorial  level.    [EL PERUANO] Regarding the national drug prevention and  control plan, what agreements have been reached with U.S.  Ambassador Alvin Adams? What is the implementation schedule?    [Ishii] The U.S. ambassador met the president of the  commission responsible for drawing up the drug control and  prevention master plan. He offered his cooperation, in the  methodological aspect, for writing the draft of the document  that will be presented at the end of February in accordance with  deadlines established by law. [passage omitted]    [EL PERUANO] What agreements are being implemented and what  ones are in a process of approval by the CTI in Peru?    [Ishii] During 1993 we created joint commissions to  negotiate  and program important projects for the country's development. We  arranged intergovernmental meetings with Germany, Spain, the  Netherlands, and the EEC. We also arranged other preparatory  meetings for negotiating diverse projects. This year we will  have joint commissions with Switzerland, Great Britain, Spain,  the Netherlands, and other countries. [passage omitted]    [EL PERUANO] Is there a certain method or system developed  by  the CTI in Peru that is being copied by other countries? How  does that system operate?    [Ishii] Technical cooperation in Peru has developed and  implemented diverse ways of implementing projects, particularly  in emergency zones. The implementation of small social interest  projects (Pepicos) and the creation of cooperation funds, which  gather and convert donations of food, equipment, and machinery  into cash, are important. We have used those funds to implement  sustainable development projects in areas where the government  has very little influence. We also must stress that project  implementation is direct, that is, it is carried out by those  will benefit from the program.    [EL PERUANO] How large is U.S. participation in the fight  against drugs?    [Ishii] There are U.S. personnel in the country. They are  deployed in the Upper Huallaga region. This support is in answer  to bilateral agreements between the United States and Peru.    [EL PERUANO] Are there any suggestions for Peru and other  countries to form a common strategy at the world or hemispheric  level within the new guidelines established by the United States  to fight drug trafficking?    [Ishii] The Peruvian Government has a defined position  regarding the fight against drugs because it is a problem  affecting all countries, consumers and producers alike, one way  or another. This means that we must form a common strategy to  fight drug trafficking.    [EL PERUANO] How much did the CTI receive during 1993? How  much does it expect to receive during 1994?    [Ishii] During 1993 the CTI received nearly $400 million.  This year we expect to receive approximately $500 million.</p>

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Construction Contracts: Aberdeen harbour scheme The development of a new multi-berth facility at Aberdeen harbour has taken a significant step forward with the placing of the main construction contract. Valued at almost Pounds 8.5m, the contract has been placed by Aberdeen Harbour Board with BIRSE CONSTRUCTION. Work on the contract will begin early in 1993 for completion towards the end of the year and will employ up to 100 workers at its peak. The project includes dredging and removing 250,000 cu metres of material, pouring more than 100,000 cu metres of concrete and the installation of 6,500 tonnes of steel piles. The Pounds 11m redevelopment of the former shipyard site will create more than 500 metres of quay and five deep-water berths, increasing Aberdeen's capacity to handle shipping by 10 per cent. A new transit shed will also be built as part of the contract.</p>

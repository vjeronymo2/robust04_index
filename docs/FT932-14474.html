			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Management: Head office upheaval - Unilever's plans have been misunderstood When a corporate giant heralds a 'review' of its head office, the outside world takes it as a clear signal that sharp cuts are in the offing. Expectations are inflamed if the company says that one of the purposes of the review is 'to achieve the most cost-effective provision of essential services'. The precedents are legion: the blitzing of US General Electric's headquarters staff in the 1980s; a cut of more than two-thirds in British Petroleum's since 1990; and, most recently, a halving of the new ICI's head office over the next two years, in the wake of its demerger. The latter comes on top of a cut of more than 10 per cent since 1991. With such exemplars in mind, outsiders were inevitably disappointed when the head office review initiated by Unilever last summer culminated more than two months ago in what seemed at first sight to be just a tidying-up exercise of the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group's unusual dual-centre headquarters. On a comparative basis, it entailed a net jobs cut of only 10 per cent in the core of the HQ, which has been rechristened 'the corporate centre' and will now number 1,075. Its London arm is being reduced by 120 posts, to 675. In Rotterdam the Dutch branch will be enlarged very slightly, to 400 people. On the surface, the closest the reshaping has come to drama is in the decision to transfer almost 600 of the jobs which were previously classified as part of the group's 'headquarters' to the various operating companies (260 jobs) and national managements (330 jobs). But real drama may yet emerge. In an HQ which has not changed substantially for decades, the working lives of its staff will now become more demanding. More fundamentally, the key justification for Unilever's head office - the ability to shape corporate strategy - may be given its sternest test in the next few years. Not surprisingly, the February statement about 'reshaping' provoked irritation among investment analysts and others in the City of London. A common complaint was that, unlike BP in particular, Unilever had not decided to cut its headcount sharply by 'outsourcing' such support services as accounting, tax and legal affairs. Michael Fox, the senior manager who headed the review team, claims - controversially - that the term 'is normally associated with cleaning and maintenance'. On what he calls 'higher-level' activities, he says 'we don't see it as a significant opportunity for us'. Hans Eggerstedt, Unilever's finance director, is dismissive of City attitudes to head-office cuts. 'Macho' announcements of the halving of HQ headcounts may excite people, but they are 'misleading', he claims. 'The City should be interested in the total performance of the business, not in the means,' he urges. Fox says only about half of Unilever's new corporate centre consists of 'functional departments' such as personnel, finance, tax and legal staff. It was on this half that the review concentrated and from which all the 120 job cuts are coming; in that sense, it represents a reduction of 20 rather than 10 per cent. The rest of the centre consists, first, of the 'office of the (twin) chairmen' which is being enlarged from 14 to about 20 in order to strengthen its 'strategic support' role. Beneath that come the regional and product 'management groups', the latter are known more popularly in Unilever-ese as 'co-ordinations'. These are, in effect, the top tier of the four individual businesses: food, detergents, personal products and specialty chemicals. The string of detailed functional changes include: The removal of much duplication and overlap between departments in London and Rotterdam. The amalgamation of many senior roles to provide 'single-point responsibility' spanning the North Sea and the globe. Reporting lines will be simplified accordingly in various other parts of the centre. An insistence that each department should justify fully its existence, define its role and estimate the value it adds. The introduction of much tougher departmental and individual performance measures plus the concept of 'continuous improvement' in productivity and service to internal 'customers'. The likelihood of further job cuts later, at least in the functions. But some of the management groups may have to be enlarged, says Fox. An attempt to start changing the entrenched top-down 'control' culture of London and Rotterdam towards something more self-driven and consultative. Beyond these issues of internal effectiveness and culture lies more fundamental questions which will be exposed to greater outside scrutiny  - notably from investors - now that the centre's role has been made more transparent by the dispersal of activities which are not really corporate. That, in turn, is likely to expose Unilever to future pressure on the most basic and threatening question that anyone - including potential predators - could ask about its centre: what strategic value does it really add in a corporate sense, over and above that created in the four businesses? Recently the international management of the businesses has been strengthened and with it their strategic muscle. Various steps have been taken to ensure cross-fertilisation between them occurs more naturally, rather than having to be mediated by head office. So what more does the corporate centre now provide than financial muscle and  -especially vital within such a multinational company - personnel development which spans businesses and countries? Eggerstedt says the reshaping is intended partly to reduce further the barriers between the different management groups, and enable synergies to 'flow easily' across them. And he says 'a major part of the discussion' has been around the need to improve Unilever's ability 'to develop a corporate strategy'. That would seem to be an admission that this has been less than fully effective in the past. It cannot have been helped by the frequent confusion of head office managers between their corporate and other roles. The very size of the previous head office structure - almost 1,800 on its widest definition - was also a handicap to easy communication. So the redefinition of managerial and support roles within the new centre's various departments should help matters. But no amount of reorganisation will recreate a proactive strategic role for Unilever's centre if the degree of leadership it provided in the past is no longer needed by its businesses.</p>

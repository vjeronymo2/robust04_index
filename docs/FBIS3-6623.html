			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama by SANKEI </F> SHIMBUN political editor Nobuaki Hanaoka; place and date not  given]    [Text] [Hanaoka] The central political world is being  sliced open by a corruption scandal involving politicians and  construction companies. In the past, when something like this  happened, the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] launched  fierce attacks against the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. Your  party is so quiet this time.    [Murayama] Would that make any difference? Anyway, the  SDPJ's stand of wanting to root out corruption has not changed a  bit. Diet members receive so many requests from organizations  and individuals to help them, but they must by all means avoid  getting involved in money matters.    [Hanaoka] What will your party do to delve into the scandal?    [Murayama] I think that the recent construction corruption  scandal has deep roots. The Diet should look into the truth of  the matter to see whether people higher up are involved. On the  other hand, the Diet also needs to pass the 1994 budget. We  should do this so as to not allow the matter to impede the  Diet's deliberations nf the budget bill.    [Hanaoka] The SDPJ played a major role in the recent soap  opera of a cabinet reshuffle. But don't you think it would be  embarrassing if a prime minister and his chief cabinet secretary  said different things?    [Murayama] Having a prime minister and his chief cabinet  secretary not be able to speak frankly is not desirable. But  you know the proverb, "After rain comes fair weather."    [Hanaoka] People say that the bipolarization of power within  the coalition has become clear following intraparty clashes over  the cabinet reshuffle and the national welfare tax. Do you  think that this bipolar structure will become fixed?    [Murayama] That is not what happened. It was coincidence  that the views of the SDPJ, the Democratic Socialist Party  [DSP], and Sakigake [Harbinger] came to agree. No, there will  not be two polarized forces confronting each other within the  coalition.    [Hanaoka] Is it correct that your party will not accept  increasing the consumption tax rate under any circumstance?    [Murayama] We have not said that the consumption tax can  never be increased under any circumstance. What must happen  first is for the government to present a clear vision on welfare  to the people. If the vision is acceptable to the people and if  the tax is to be made a specific tax for the purpose of funding  pensions, we will accept the increase. When that is done, it  will also be necessary to revise some unfair conditions in the  existing tax system. We are not objecting to everything.    [Hanaoka] How do you visualize the upcoming realignment of  the political world?    [Murayama] We need to view the matter from three angles:  maintaining the coalition government, cooperation in the  elections, and the political world's reorganization. The basic  condition is that we must not allow the LDP to return to power.  Having different political ideals is no reason for the  coalition parties to be unable to cooperate. All electoral  districts will require flexible yet bold cooperation by the  parties based on this basic guideline. First of all, we would  like to form a structure wherein the coalition parties can  cooperate in the elections.    [Hanaoka] What is the possibility of the coalition parties  developing into a new, new party?    [Murayama] When political ideals differ, it is difficult to  expect that. Besides, there is the possibility that the  framework of the coalition government will change as a result of  the next election.    [Hanaoka] Within the SDPJ, there are the left-wing group,  which opposed the political reform bills, as well as the  right-wing group, which supported them. The party appears to  have the explosive possibility of breaking up at any time.    [Murayama] I regret that act of going against the party's  agreement and voting against the political reform bills. The  principle is that decisions which are reached after proper  intraparty discussions should be respected. But the people who  do not respect the decisions cannot be helped. There is now a  general agreement in thinking that the liberals of the SDPJ and  of the DSP should come together under one umbrella.    [Hanaoka] The words -- the liberals of the SDPJ and the DSP  -- sound good, but isn't liberalism a concept of emphasizing  protection of the weak and having big government?    [Murayama] No, you should not put it that way. Helping the  weak is not something only the central government can do. That  can be done by transferring more power to the local governments  and having them do it. Anyway, one role of the SDPJ and DSP  liberals is to secure social justice, which will enable the weak  and the strong to coexist.    [Hanaoka] What course will the SDPJ and DSP liberals take to  become unified?    [Murayama] First, the SDPJ must escape the old shell of the  1955 regime of Japanese politics. We will have to see in which  direction the party will change. In the course of changing, it  is possible that the party will turn into a new party. I think  that the political world will change several times while  undergoing the simultaneous upper house and local government  elections and the general elections. Forming a new party to  contest the next general election would be one choice, even  though I cannot imagine the possibility of the SDPJ getting  together with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] or the LDP.    [Hanaoka] Within the LDP, there are some who hope that the  next general election will be held under the current medium-size  electoral district system. Is it not what the SDPJ wants  really, too?    [Murayama] No political vacuum must be allowed to occur. If  a situation arises wherein the prime minister is convinced that  the only way left for him is to dissolve the Diet and hold a  general election, then that will be unavoidable.    [Hanaoka] You have recently appeared on several television  variety programs. You must be a popular man.    [Murayama] I don't have much more time in which to be in  politics. What I have to is to help the party overcome this  difficult time, create a new foundation, and then pass the baton  to new people.</p>

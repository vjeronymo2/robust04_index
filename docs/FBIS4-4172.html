			<p>BFN     [Text] Accompanied by Li Chengren, deputy head of the  International Liaison Department of the CPC Central Committee,  Hong Ha, secretary of the Secretariat of the Vietnamese  Communist Party, arrived in Tianjin on 19 April for a visit. At  noon at the Lishunde Hotel, Gao Dezhan, member of the CPC  Central Committee and secretary of the municipal party  committee, met with Secretary Hong Ha and his party.    At the meeting, on behalf of the Tianjin Municipal party  committee, Gao Dezhan first expressed his welcome to the  delegation. He said: We are very glad to know that Vietnam is  conducting innovations to speed up the pace of economic  construction. The cooperative ties between our two parties and  between our two countries are developing smoothly. Now, our  country is further carrying out reform in an all-around manner,  opening itself to the outside world, and promoting the progress  of the modernization drive. Under these circumstances, it is of  extreme importance to strengthen the cooperation between the two  parties and between the two countries. He introduced to the  delegation the basic situation of Tianjin. According to the  guidelines of the central authorities and the actual conditions  of the municipality, Tianjin is further speeding up the pace of  reform and construction and further expanding the scale of  opening itself to all directions. Our goal is to build Tianjin  into a technologically advanced industrial base; a north China  commercial, trade, and monetary center; and a large  international port city opening itself in all directions. The  work in various spheres of Tianjin is very good. However, there  are many difficulties. The municipal party committee, the  municipal government, and all people of the municipality are  carrying forward the spirit of waging an arduous struggle and  blazing new trails and making efforts to elevate economic  construction, as well the spiritual civilization, to a new  height. We experienced that the key to achieving this is to  improve the leadership of the party, to strengthen party  building, and to promote the work in various spheres. The  Vietnamese Communist Party and the personages of the enterprise  circles in Vietnam are welcomed to visit Tianjin, to hold  economic and trade cooperation talks with us, and to extensively  establish contacts. He wished that the cooperative ties between  the two parties and between the two countries would further be  developed.    Secretary Hong Ha said: I used to understand Tianjin from  papers, periodicals, and books. This is my first visit to  Tianjin. I am very glad. The Vietnamese are very fond of  Tianjin's products. Some Vietnamese students and technical  cadres have studied in Tianjin. The Tianjin steel tube company,  which I visited today, left a deep impression on me. He said:  At the time of developing the cooperative ties with the Chinese  party and China, Vietnam is extremely willing to develop the  cooperative ties in the economic sphere with Tianjin. Tianjin  has great potential. With many enterprises and famous products,  Tianjin can develop cooperation with Vietnam. He is willing to  promote the cooperation between all localities in Vietnam and  Tianjin.    Zheng Zhiying, standing committee member and secretary  general of the municipal party committee; Geng Jianhua, chairman  of the municipal foreign affairs office; and Dang Nghiem Hoang,  Vietnamese ambassador to China, were present at the meeting.</p>

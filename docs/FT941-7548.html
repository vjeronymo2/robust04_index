			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Motives for metals group rescue Sir, John Craven's article (Management: 'Testimony to the German system', February 18) concerning the rescue of Metallgesellschaft is very disturbing. Were it not for the involvement of commercial banks as lenders to and investors in Metallgesellschaft, there would be no need for the Dollars 1bn plus bailout so hastily arranged in recent weeks. Moreover, Mr Craven makes only the weakest justification of the company's deliverance from the liquidators by raising the uncomfortable spectre of lost jobs. He dares discuss the situation based upon economic utility since the lenders' ability to protect their secured interests as creditors was compromised by their conflicting role as shareholders. No rational person wants to see a company fail or workers put out of their jobs, yet the rescue of Metallgesellschaft poses a basic economic and moral dilemma. Investment bankers often mouth platitudes about 'free market' discipline, but when a large private company in which they hold equity stakes fails, these same bankers fall back upon the political expedience of corporate statism. If Metallgesellschaft had 5,800 employees instead of 10 times that number, and the banks involved were lenders rather than investors too, would Mr Craven be so eager to fashion a rescue? Clearly the answer is no. We cannot all equally enjoy the benefits of free-market capitalism without the taint of favouritism and cronyism unless failure comes as readily as success. Other firms and their employees that operate in the industries in which Metallgesellschaft also participates are penalised by the preferential treatment shown this company, which happens to have bankers on its governing board as investors and creditors. This is especially true in industries such as metals and mining, in which over-capacity has severely reduced profitability in recent years. The real issue here is not simply conflict of interest. The discussion should revolve around whether it is appropriate in the first instance for a bank to use funds raised from depositors and guaranteed by an explicit government bank safety net to finance and, in this case, replace the equity of a commercial company, particularly one that squandered its equity through reckless speculation in volatile energy markets. Surely this politically motivated rescue is no example for the future of a stable, healthy and transparent free-market political economy, as Mr Craven seems to suggest.

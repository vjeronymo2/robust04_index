			<p>BFN     [Text] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani received the Croatian  prime minister Nikica Valentic today.    At the meeting, the president stressed the need for  strengthening solidarity and further cooperation among the  states in the Balkan region in order to confront aggressors and  to consolidate peace and stability in that region. Condemning  the aggression of the Serbs against Bosnia-Herzegovina, he said:  Undoubtedly the fates of the Balkan region states are tied  together, and peace and friendship in the region is to the  benefit of all those states, just as cooperation and unity in  the face of any aggression and sectarianism are to the detriment  of enemies and aggressors and also guarantee the future  stability and tranquillity of the region.    Hashemi-Rafsanjani considered the grounds for cooperation  between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Croatia  to be positive, and expressed the hope that the results of talks  between the Croatian delegation and our country's officials  smooth the way for further expansion of economic, commercial,  and political ties between the two countries.    During the meeting, where First Deputy President Habibi was  also present, the Croatian prime minister, declaring his  country's support for the territorial integrity of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, described the policy of the Serbian forces -  who are supported by the superpowers - as aggressive and said:  In history Croats and Bosnians have fought side by side against  aggressors and have always lived in harmony. He added: The  Croatian Government will make all efforts to eliminate the  slight disputes between the Muslims and Croats in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, since peace and stability in that region  will be to the benefit of the two nations and other states.    The Croatian prime minister considered the results of his  visit to Iran to be a turning point in the bilateral ties and  expressed the hope that through the normalization of the  conditions in the Balkan region and the punishment of the  Serbian aggressors in that region through international forums  the trend of expansion of ties between the Balkan states -  especially Croatia - with Iran is accelerated.    At the meeting the Croatian prime minister extended an  official invitation from his country's president to Mr.  Hashemi-Rafsanjani to visit that country. The president,  accepting the invitation, expressed the hope to visit Croatia  and Bosnia at an opportune moment when the conditions are  normalized in those two countries.</p>

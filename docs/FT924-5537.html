			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Market-Testing in Whitehall: Council reforms ahead of Whitehall COMPARED with local government, Whitehall is still in the competitive-tendering stone age. For the past five years, the government's compulsory competitive tendering (CCT) legislation has obliged local authorities to put their main blue-collar services out to tender and many have tendered white-collar services too. Few authorities have taken contracting out as far as Berkshire county council. Externalisation, in the Berkshire jargon, is its way of life. Contracts of an annual value of more than Pounds 35m have been awarded to outside contractors in the past five years. Mr Tony Allen, the council's chief executive, said: 'It started in 1988 with my ambition to get a grip on the management of the place rather than to market-test services for the sake of it. But the whole process changed direction once the government set its CCT timetable and obliged us to get on with it anyway.' Frontline as well as support services have been put out to tender - well beyond the requirements of the legislation. Grounds maintenance, computer support, supplies, cleaning, school meals, vehicle maintenance, architectural design, quantity surveying, school music tuition, staff training, highway maintenance and emergency services and forestry are all out to the private sector. The county is contracting out highways and planning and making a start on financial services. The process has been controversial. Most of it took place under a Tory administration and when the Conservatives lost their majority in a by-election earlier this year, a halt was called to the contracting-out of frontline services such as libraries and homes for the elderly. Mr Allen respects the politicians' preferences but has no doubt that for support services, at least, the benefits of tendering are undeniable. 'That is even true of services which we run efficiently,' he said. 'Our own local-government market is a shrinking one. Therefore if you have got a good business, it will do better in an external market.' When the internal team won the county's school meals contract, the county sought to sharpen up the management and sold it to the BET group. Most local authorities consider it a victory if the internal team wins a contract. Not Berkshire. In more than 90 per cent of cases, private contractors have employed the former council staff when taking on a contract, almost invariably on similar conditions of service. 'For that reason the process has not been acrimonious,' Mr Allen said. 'I have been surprised at how quickly attitudes have changed: we've never dubbed the process privatisation. It's externalisation - about changing the management, not the service or necessarily the staff.' The county's policy with each service to be tendered has been to separate the staff concerned with strategy and to put the rest in a 'trading agency' pending 'externalisation'. All services in trading agencies - which include finance functions - will be subject to market testing. Mr Allen said there were no differences of principle with contracting-out in central government. 'And they have just as great a need to create more space for strategic planning - the greatest benefit of externalisation. For too long we have all been dominated by production planning problems.'</p>

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Property: Why it pays to join the new Elizabethans - Why modern housing is currently a bargain in terms of price and quality RUSH OUT and buy an Elizabethan property now and you will be well insulated from draughts, have electricity points galore and also get the nearest thing to a cost-price building that you will see this side of the end of the century. You may even meet the builder as he hands over a mortgage discount, a straight cash saving, or throws in the fixtures and fittings at no extra cost. It has to be an Elizabeth the Second property, of course. Homes built during the reign of the present Queen's ancestral namesake come with built-in draughts and cost a great deal more to buy and run. New homes, on the other hand, are now bargains. 'Greenfield' developments in areas without existing housing have become sufficiently rare to underpin the generality that housebuilders have to compete against a massive overhang of available but unsold used local property. Their three main options are to compete on grounds of quality, ease of purchase or price. At the start of the housing recession it was the last two competitive options that attracted the builders' attention. They did not have a lot of choice with their existing stock other than to promote as innovative a mix of special offers on price and ease of purchase deals as they could. Those builders that have stayed in business have had to deal with the switch from the sellers' market of pre-1988, when pretty well everything that could be built could be sold, to the subsequent buyer-famine. In the past 18 months we have seen every inducement to buy, from free cars in the garage to the 50-50 part paid now, part paid later deals, as well as every conceivable variation on the theme of 'soft' purchase loan finance. Render all these sales options down to their basics and they represents price discounts in different packaging. But it has been packaging with a purpose, since each offer has been designed to appeal to each builder's target market. This price war has tended to overshadow the extent to which new homes have been sold in competition with older properties in terms of quality. Yet the quality of a new home does now show through to sale values. 'Newness' justifies a premium value in most consumer markets and you might well assume that new housing would cost more than old. But in a market in which old normally means 'first to the best sites' and where age acquires the benefit of vintage status, there is nothing automatic about this premium. There is some truth to the argument that housebuilders have no choice but to sell their output at a premium to nearby used homes. The builders cannot pay 1960s wages or buy building materials at 1970s prices, and even though residential development site costs have fallen by as much as 50 per cent from the peak of the market, inflation does impose its own floor on builders' pricing policy. But the prime factor in retaining a premium for new homes has been the building industry's efforts to turn out a progressively better standard of property. The housebuilding industry is constantly awarding itself prizes for the best sites, best homes, best designs, best security systems, best insulation, best landscaped houses and flats. But it is an incestuous congratulatory system. As an industry, builders still have a poor public image. The folk memory of row-upon-row of estate boxes slicing through the countryside will take generations to overcome. And the low rate of demolition of old houses - fewer than 20,000 last year - means that the the cheap and uncheerful mass market housing of the 1960s and 70s is hanging around much longer than anyone expected to embarrass the builder. Only in Britain could a national house price index such as the Nationwide's seriously describe its price category for 'modern' housing in terms of properties built 'post-1944.' It is tough to win buyers on grounds of quality against the background of a predominantly old housing stock where 'modern' means middle-aged and 'new' means being plastered with 'special offer' signs. Yet the Halifax Building Society's house price index suggests that despite builders' discounts, new homes have retained their price premium over old across the UK. Setting average against average on the Halifax price guide, buyers of new homes pay Pounds 72,830 for their property while the average existing home sells for Pounds 62,117. That is a national average premium of 17 per cent, which is down on but not that far below the average new-to-old premium maintained throughout the 1980s. The Nationwide's figures draw on a sample suggesting average new home prices of Pounds 61,462 against Pounds 54,176 for older homes and Pounds 57,671 as a national average for all homes, which implies that the current premium for 'newness' is nearer 6 per cent. If you look closer at the Nationwide's figures they suggest that their broadly defined 'modern' homes now sell for more than the average new one. That would accord with the logical assumption that housebuilders must come top of any list of 'realistic' vendors in today's market. Add that all up and it makes a persuasive case for buying a new home, especially in those parts of the UK where building work has been cut back more than average. In the entire 600 sq mile area of Greater London only 9,080 new homes were started last year, less than half the mid-1980s average and 17 per cent down on the already sharply reduced totals for 1989. The point is even more clearly illustrated by the figures for completions. No more than 12,440 new homes were added to the London housing stock last year, 25 per cent down on the 1989 total. That shows the housebuilders' final competitive approach. While price discounts, ease of payment plans and arguments in favour of new quality over old help to draw buyers to completed new homes, the ultimate price control is supply. And as that dries up, so will the bargains.</p>

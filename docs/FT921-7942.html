			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Book Review: A state of enarchie POWERBROKERS: AN INSIDERS' GUIDE TO THE FRENCH FINANCIAL ELITE Leslie Mitchell de Quillacq Lafferty Publications Pounds 500 Pity the poor Enarchs. The graduates of France's elite Ecole Nationale d'Administration (ENA) enter the school hoping to learn how to run the country, or to chair a big company. They leave it only to find themselves pilloried by the French press and haunted by the government's threat to banish their alma mater from Paris to Strasbourg. Now the Enarchs' role in the French financial establishment has been scrutinised by Leslie Mitchell de Quillacq in Powerbrokers. This book is not just concerned with Enarchs, but with the background of everyone who occupies a powerful position in French finance, most of whom happened to study at ENA. 'The path to influence and status in the French financial sector is clear,' concludes the author. 'It's best to be born into an upper-class family and go to a top Parisian lycee, then to the Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris (Science Po), and then to ENA, where it is necessary to graduate in the top 10 in order to become a member of the Inspection des Finances (part of the inner circle of the Finance Ministry). This should be followed by a stint in the French Treasury and time in a ministerial cabinet to get the requisite political patronage.' None of this is new. It only takes a cursory acquaintance with the men - they are almost all men - who run France's big banks and insurance groups to realise that their lives have run in tandem since they first bashed each other over the head with their Babar books at the age of three. But Mitchell de Quillacq does work out who really matters in this world by applying a system devised by Professor Charles Kadushin of the Yale School of Management. The method involved compiling a list of all the people in senior positions within France's financial institutions. They were then asked who else should be on the list. Each interviewee was asked to name the 20 people whom they believed to be the elite. They were also asked who had influenced them personally and whom they considered to be their friends. The author was left with a list of 124 people, two of them women. She then compiled two 'top 20s' - one of the 'elite', the other of the 'wielders of influence' - weighted according to the number of votes received by the voter so that 'the elite, in effect, chose the elite and the influential'. There were a total of 27 names (all male) in the two top 20s (that is, there were names on each list that did not appear on the other). Both were topped by Mr Jean Peyrelevade, once assistant director of the private office of Mr Pierre Mauroy, the former Socialist prime minister and now chairman of Union des Assurances de Paris, the state-owned insurance group. Mr Claude Bebear, his counterpart at the private-sector insurer Axa, was second in the elite list followed by Mr Michel David-Weill, the senior partner of Lazard Freres, the Paris-based merchant bank. Two other bankers - Mr Andre Levy-Lang of Paribas and Mr Michel Pebereau, the chairman of Credit Commercial de France - came second and third respectively in terms of 'influence'. Having identified the 124, Mitchell de Quillacq could then calculate exactly how many of them really did conform to the educational cliche of a stint at Science Po followed by a spell at ENA. The short answer is almost all. Two-thirds of the top 27 went to Science Po as did half of the 124. The same proportions of both groups went to ENA. Almost all Enarchs went on to join the civil service, later moving into a ministerial cabinet or private office. Perhaps the best illustration of the narrowness of background of France's financial elite is that half the top 27 and two-fifths of the 124 went to one of three Parisian lycees: Louis le Grand, Henri IV or Janson de Sailly. Mitchell de Quillacq undoubtedly succeeds in identifying who wields the power in French finance and the common strands in their histories. What she does not do is examine whether ENA's influence is any more pervasive in France than that of other elite institutions' elsewhere. Think of Tokyo University in Japan, Oxbridge in the UK or the Ivy League in the US. Nor does she analyse the effect of filling the top positions in France's financial establishment from such a tightly defined pool of people. The reader is left with very little idea as to whether this is good or bad, and as to what sort of people they are other than that they probably went to ENA.</p>

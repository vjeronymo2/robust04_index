			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: BZW launches index warrants BZW Securities yesterday launched the first listed warrants that allow investors to trade the spread between the German DAX stock index and the French CAC40 Index. The DAX closed at 2048 and the CAC at 2199.7 yesterday, bringing the spread to 151.7 points. The gap was at 124 points when the warrants were issued, but widened after the Bundesbank cut its key rates by  1/2 point. The move is expected to spark near-term French rate cuts, and so spur the French stock market. In recent weeks, the DAX has outperformed the CAC, causing the spread between the two indices to narrow, close to its 96-point low for the last two years. The warrants are aimed at investors who expect the French index to outperform its German counterpart and expect the spread to widen rapidly to over 200 points. The warrants, which expire on December 21, were issued at DM60 and closed at DM70 bid. One warrant entitles the holder to receive an amount in D-Marks equivalent to the difference, if positive, between the spread of CAC40 over the DAX and the strike of 144.</p>

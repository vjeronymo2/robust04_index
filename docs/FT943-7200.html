			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Takeover talk peps Wellcome The market has the scent of a big takeover in the pharmaceuticals sector and refuses to let go. Yesterday there was a whiff of very big game being hunted by Glaxo, the UK leader, with Wellcome pinpointed as prime target. A story in the US press said Glaxo had secured a Dollars 16bn line of credit. This gave rise to suggestions that it might be looking at either Eli Lilly, the new owner of prized pharmacy benefit manager PCS, Warner Lambert or Wellcome. Although analysts and dealers were sceptical they were running through the numbers and suggesting that Lilly would have a take-out price of Dollars 70 to Dollars 75 a share and Lambert of over Dollars 100. Wertheim Schroder had already suggested that Wellcome might be bought at 900p a share and was stoking interest in the sector yesterday with a piece of research arguing for a strong overweight stance. Analyst Dr Jonathan Gelles argued that investors should be up to three times overweight but should perhaps switch from SmithKline which was suffering from a 'thwarted strategy' and erosion of profits by generic rivals to Tagamet, its anti-ulcer treatment. Glaxo shares rose 6 to 645p and Wellcome 9 to 709p while SmithKline was flat at 448p.</p>

			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Belfast airport to be sold next year THE government yesterday confirmed that it would sell Northern Ireland's largest airport, Belfast's Aldergrove. A six-week consultation period will be followed by legislation in autumn. The government's advisers hope the sale will take place in the summer of 1994 and will fetch between Pounds 25m and Pounds 40m. The sale will probably be to a single buyer or a consortium rather than by flotation, which would cost too much in relation to the likely proceeds. Aldergrove, also called Belfast International, is owned by Northern Ireland Airports and handled about 2.17m passengers last year, making it the UK's seventh largest airport. It made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.14m on turnover of Pounds 21m and last month announced the start of scheduled services to New York. Possible bidders include Canadian transport group Bombardier, which owns both Short Brothers, the Ulster aircraft manufacturer, and Belfast City airport. Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, yesterday announced completion of plans to dispose of Farnborough airfield. They include the development of a new site for the government's Defence Research Agency, a new aviation museum and a hotel overlooking the aerodrome. The Farnborough air show would continue, he said.</p>

			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> U.S. THEATER SUPERFICIAL -- MILLER  </P> <P> Playwright Arthur Miller, in London for rehearsals of his play "The Price,"  which opens next month, accused U.S. theater of being superficial.  </P> <P> Contrasting unsubsidized theater in the United States with the state-aided  British theater, Miller said Wednesday that American theater has often  degenerated into a search for titillating ways to fill unsubsidized and  expensive seats.  </P> <P> "Theaters in the States are finding it very difficult to continue because they  feel they have got to constantly excite audiences in a most superficial way,"  the 74-year-old playwright told reporters.  </P> <P> Speaking during a break in rehearsals for "The Price" at the Young Vic theater,  he said standards in British theater could fall if subsidies were reduced or  stopped.  </P> <P> The issue is a hot topic in Britain, where Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's  government is accused by critics of starving state-aided theaters and other  arts of sufficient public funding. Her Conservative government favors funding  of the arts by private business sponsorship.  </P></p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / International Company News: Norske Skog loses French mill's permit NORSKE Skogindustrier, one of Norway's biggest pulp and paper producers, may be forced to close Papeteries de Golbey, a French newsprint mill, on environmental grounds, writes Karen Fossli. The local authorities in Nancy have withdrawn the company's permit for emissions dispensation, said Norske Skog, which has a 49 per cent stake in the plant. Papeteries was opened last December and Norske Skog has invested NKr3bn (Dollars 468.7m) in it. The other main shareholder is E. Holzman, the German company, with 35 per cent. Christiania Bank and Fokus Bank, two of Norway's three biggest banks, each own a 2 per cent stake. Norske Skog said that the mill was not being closed down because of current emissions violations. He explained that the permit was withdrawn because French environmental organisations claimed that insufficient impact studies were undertaken by the company in order to secure the emissions dispensation permit. Mr Tingstad said that the company had spent NKr400m on emissions reduction equipment and that it was seeking a temporary emissions dispensation permit.</p>

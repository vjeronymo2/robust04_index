			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jalal Talabani, leader of the Patriotic </F> Union of Kurdistan, by George Nawfal in Paris on 21  April--recorded]    [Text] [Nawfal] The first question is on your intensive  talks in France with French officials. Have you come out with  encouraging results?    [Talabani] My meetings with French officials have been  successful, fruitful, and encouraging. We met with Defense  Minister Francois Leotard and Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and  discussed with them issued of interest to Iraq and Iraqi  Kurdistan. The results in my view were very positive.    [Nawfal] Have you won practical support?    [Talabani] Yes, we realized definite and clear things. For  instance, Leotard emphasized France's continuing contribution to  the forces that are protecting the people of Iraqi Kurdistan and  pledged to continue offering humanitarian, economic aid to the  Iraqi Kurdistan region.    As for Alain Juppe, he emphasized to us France's clear and  firm policy toward the Kurdish people and the need to give them  their political and democratic rights within unified Iraq. As  you are aware, France, like us in the Iraqi Kurdistan Front,  opposes partitioning Iraq but emphasizes the need for the Kurds  to enjoy the broadest form possible of self rule for the Kurdish  people within Iraq. Juppe assured us that France wants Iraq to  fully abide by all UN Security Council resolutions, especially  Resolution 688 concerning the Kurdish people's rights, and that  France will not lift the economic sanction on Iraq unless Iraq  abides by all international resolutions and unless it agrees to  allow the Kurdish people to enjoy their legitimate rights within  a unified Iraq.    [Nawfal] We would like to ask you about conditions in Iraqi  Kurdistan.    [Talabani] Conditions in Iraqi Kurdistan are developing and  improving despite the difficult economic and social problems.  Despite the presence of 300,000 displaced Kurds from the Karkuk  area, to which the Iraqi Government refused to allow them to  return, and despite the presence of tens of thousands of victims  of the notorious arrest campaign, economic conditions are  improving because the Kurdish peasants returned to their  villages and began to rebuild them. The crops will be good this  year, God willing. The Kurdish people have begun to plant and  produce. The democratically elected Kurdish administration have  started to electrify hospitals, schools, and other services.  Our special security organizations are developing. For  instance, the sabotage network sent by the Iraqi government to  assassinate foreign nationals recently has been busted.  Therefore, several sabotage and assassination networks, which  the Iraqi government supported with arms and money, have been  wiped out.    [Nawfal] But how can you manage? Are you in control from the  security viewpoint, despite all the recent events?    [Talabani] We are in better control that others.    [Nawfal] What do you mean by others?    [Talabani] I mean our neighbors, for instance. Compare our  conditions with Tehran, where they have explosions and booby  trapped cars every day. With Baghdad, or southern Iraq, where  they have daily explosions. Of course, I mean that we should  not be compared with Afghanistan and Somalia. We are very much  superior in this regard. I mean that even compared to our  neighbors, the security conditions are improving in Iraqi  Kurdistan. I do not claim that they are ideal, but I am aware  of the meaning of the phrase Improving conditions. We hope this  improvement will increase in the future. But as you know, we in  the east, even in the European countries, we cannot prevent  crimes and assassinations and explosions completely. But in  Iraqi Kurdistan we realized great successes in foiling many  bombings attempts and the killing of innocent people.    [Nawfal] In northern Iraq, you are playing host to  non-Kurdish Iraqi opposition groups. How do you deal with them?    [Talabani] Yes, sir, we in Iraqi Kurdistan have an open,  democratic society and we are proud of realizing a model  democracy. Everybody enjoys democratic freedoms--the freedom of  party work, of the media, and of politics. Because Iraqi  Kurdistan is part of the Iraqi state, other Iraqi  brothers--Arabs, Turkomans, and other Iraqi citizens--have the  right to come to Iraqi Kurdistan and work there. For instance,  in Iraqi Kurdistan there is the headquarters of the unified  Iraqi National Congress [INC], which includes many important  groups of the Iraqi opposition and which is continuing unrest  for the democratic alternative in Iraq. Our shiite brothers and  other parties, even the parties that do not belong to the INC,  have the right to work. We have invited our brothers in the  Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, the dissident Iraqi regional  leadership, and the Islamic al-Da'wah Party, who are outside the  INC to come to Kurdistan and work there.    I even would like to give you an exclusive news item. Sharif  'Ali, who is claiming the throne of Iraq, sent me a letter,  sometime back, asking to be allowed to open an office in  Kurdistan. We have agreed to and welcomed this request. We  would like the Iraqi Movement for Constitutional Monarchy  [al-harakah al-malakiyah al- dusturiyah fi al-'iraq] to have the  right to pursue democratic activity in accordance with the  Koranic verse: So announce the good news to my servants, those  who listen to the word and follow the best of it.    [Nawfal] Thank you for this revelation. Many reports speak  of contacts between Baghdad and Kurdish groups to hold  agreements with Baghdad. We do not know how true they are.  What is your opinion? How true are they?    [Talabani] These reports are completely baseless because the  Iraqi Government does not think seriously of establishing a  dialogue with the Kurds and the Kurds do not want this.    [Nawfal] I mean a group of Kurds, not all of them.    [Talabani] These reports are not true. Today I was asked by  Juppe and I answered ... [pauses] when we emerged together, a  Turkish reporter asked our opinion of the Turkish attempt to  mediate between the Kurdish leadership and the Iraqi Government  because Mr. Sanberk, the Turkish Foreign Ministry under  secretary, stated upon his return from Baghdad that he proposed  this to the Iraqi officials who expressed a desire to have a  dialogue with the Kurds to solve this problem. My answer was  that Resolution 688 is the correct basis because this resolution  includes the need for Iraq to abide by the rights, democratic  freedoms, and human rights for all Iraqi citizens, including the  Kurds, and asks the Iraqi Government to negotiate and hold a  dialogue with Iraqi citizens to realize these rights. If the  Iraqi Government is serious, it must implement this resolution,  and hold a dialogue with the Iraqi people, including the Kurds,  to resolve the issues in a peaceful political manner.    [Nawfal] Thank you, Mr. Jalal Talabani.    [Talabani] Thank you, brother.</p>

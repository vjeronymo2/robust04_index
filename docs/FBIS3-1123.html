Bulger] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg March 19 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom  Party [IFP] central committee said on Saturday [19 March] it  rejected President F W de Klerk's suggestion that it take part  in provincial elections in Natal/kwaZulu. It also rejected a  suggestion that IFP members be included in the candidate lists  of the National Party.    The central committee said in Ulundi the IFP stood by the  constitutional demands it made in December, 1993 and that it  would not enter the elections until its bottom-line  constitutional demands were met.    The IFP also decided to establish a national action  committee  to devise programmes to give people constructive ways of  opposing the interim constitution.</p>

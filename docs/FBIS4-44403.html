			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "More and More People Want Independence"] </F>   [Text] A Gallup poll on the question of independence for  Taiwan, published yesterday, revealed that after the  "Ch'ien-tao-hu Incident," 27 percent of all ROC residents favor  independence for Taiwan. This indicates that the people's  inclination toward an independent Taiwan has been growing year  by year, while the proportion of those opposed to independence,  for the first time, fell below the 50 percent mark to 45.5  percent. Analyzed by backgrounds, the poll shows that support  for independence is extremely strong in the southern part of  Taiwan, namely 36.7 percent, while those opposing independence  are in an inferior position of only 36.4 percent. This was the  first time in public opinion polls on Taiwan that supporters of  Taiwan independence outscored those in opposition to  independence.    The results of this public opinion poll possibly show the  direction of present public opinion on Taiwan. However, since  25.4 percent of the population indicated that they would not  say, had no opinion, or did not know; and because public opinion  polls are inherently hardly ever 100 percent indicative of the  true opinions of people when questioned on such a subject as the  independence of Taiwan, there may be a margin of error. We may  therefore only say that there is a trend of increasing support  for Taiwan independence, and that this value --the hopes of the  population of Taiwan to become an independent sovereign  state--is increasing year by year.    The people questioned in the said poll of course were also  influenced by the "Ch'ien-tao-hu Incident" and by the  dictatorial way the Chinese Communist authorities handled the  case. However, a more weighty factor must be attributed to the  fact that people on Taiwan, after the lifting of martial law,  have pondered the gains in the unification-independence argument  in view of the international standing of Taiwan and the future  prospects of the country. It all boils down to three big factors  here: The diplomatic predicament Taiwan finds itself in has the  people most fervently wish that the status of the country be  made evident as such in the international community. The way  relations between the two sides of the strait have developed,  the people of Taiwan recognize more accurately the disparity in  their political-economic systems and in social and cultural  respects, and wishes for reunification of China have dampened.  Finally, it is also most important to note the progress in  democratization and pluralism on Taiwan which has greatly raised  their consciousness of self-rule, as manifested in that their  ideas on state and nation tend of course toward becoming a  dignified and respected state and nation by themselves, which,  in turn, engenders the idea of being one life community by  themselves.    We are not surprised by the growing tendency for  independence  among the Taiwanese population, as revealed in the Gallup poll;  it is a natural result of the democratization of the country.  However, this kind of a public opinion trend deserves to be  faced squarely by all political parties and political regimes.  It is precisely as President Lee Teng-hui once emphasized: The  sovereignty of a country rests with its people, and the position  and development of the state must also be adjusted according to  the direction of public opinion. The most important factor that  will have an impact on Taiwan's future will, we are afraid, not  be any one-way consideration of unification or independence, but  rather, finally, the independent choice of the 11 million  people. We hope the government and the public will combine all  their common wisdom, will then gradually readjust the present  state policy for unification, and will set their minds on a less  disputed developmental road for the state.</p>

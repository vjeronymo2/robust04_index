			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: Norway approves plan for Uni NORWAY has approved a NKr4.5bn (Dollars 667m) recapitalisation plan for Uni Storebrand and cleared the way for the country's largest insurance group to be released from public administration. Uni was forced into public administration last year with NKr3.8bn in short-term borrowings after it had built up a 28.3 per cent stake in its Swedish rival, Skandia. The finance ministry said Uni could be freed from public administration as soon as terms of the slightly altered rescue plan were met. According to Uni's administration board, the company could return to free activity in about a month. The revised rescue package calls for a NKr2.8bn share issue, writing down the face value of existing Uni shares to NKr0.05 from NKr20, and a NKr1.8bn bond issue. The issues have been guaranteed full subscription by a Norwegian investment consortium. The consortium - comprising Norway's state pension fund, Orkla, the diversified Norwegian group with main interests in branded food products, and Tiger Management, a US investment group - can hold up to 15 per cent of Uni for a maximum of three years with restricted voting rights. The finance ministry said that Uni's holding in Skandia would be spun off into a separate, wholly-owned company. It said Uni needed to sell the Skandia shares for at least NKr1.4bn. Last month Uni announced a 1993 first-quarter profit, before allocations, of NKr150m, against a corresponding NKr151m loss. The insurer forecast a good result for 1993 as a whole.</p>

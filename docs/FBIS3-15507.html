The esteemed Indian guest is flying home on Sunday [6  March] morning.    India maintains deep interest in military and technical  cooperation with Russia, General Joshi emphasised talking to  ITAR-TASS. Our army is equipped with 70 per cent of arms made  in Soviet union, and lately we are experiencing problems in its  modernization and ensuring supplies of spare parts, the general  noted.    The Indian military commander said that Russia has  commitments in the sphere of defence from the former Soviet  Union, including supplies of military equipment and spare parts  for it. He also spoke of India's interest in acquiring the most  up-to date weapons.    Commander-in-chief of the Russian Army Colonel-General  Vladimir Semyonov, who also took part in the talk, said that the  Russian side will help the Indian Army equip T-72 tanks with new  engines and arms and also modernize other military ware.  According to the Russian commander-in-chief, the Indian side  has displayed interest in helicopters, hovercraft and  particularly in control and reconnaissance systems. Certain  kinds of arms India will, possibly, take on lease for 2-3 years  for an appropriate fee, he said.</p>

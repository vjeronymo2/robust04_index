"The action constituted interference in China's  internal affairs in disregard of the Chinese law," Foreign  Minister Qian Qichen said in a clear reference to the meeting  between Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights John  Shattuck and celebrated dissident Wei Jingsheng in Beijing on  February 27.    China was "deeply disappointed" by the incident, Foreign  Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin quoted Qian as telling Christopher  during talks here which Shattuck himself attended.</p>

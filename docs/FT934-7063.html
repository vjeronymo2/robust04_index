			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Payment to Names to be debated today The Lloyd's council, the governing body of the insurance market, is expected to consider today a proposed structure for an out-of-court settlement to the legal actions by loss-making Names against their agents. Several thousand Names - individuals whose assets support the market - are claiming more than Pounds 3.5bn in compensation. The deal allows for a 'bespoke' offer for each Name involved, the amount of compensation varying according to which syndicates the loss-making Names belong to, as well as a series of other factors. Lloyd's has still to complete its work on obtaining funds for the deal, but it is understood that errors and omissions insurers, which cover agencies against legal awards for negligence, are prepared to contribute at least Pounds 300m and possibly as much as Pounds 400m. Further funds will come from donations from agents and brokers, which the market estimates could amount to as much as Pounds 75m. Lloyd's will also make a contribution - possibly as much as Pounds 500m - from its own central fund, which pays claims when Names are unable to meet their obligations. It is expected that details of the offer will be posted to Names over the next two to three weeks. They are expected to vote on the deal early in the new year. Middleton plea, Page 17</p>

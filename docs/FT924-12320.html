			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Wolseley The world's biggest plumbing distributor has every right to be considered a household name. But it may astonish many to learn that Wolseley's market capitalisation yesterday overtook Blue Circle's, and that it is now second only in size to Redland in the UK building materials sector. Last year's 14 per cent surge in pre-tax profits and 13 per cent rise in earnings per share was a remarkable showing. It left the chairman almost apologetic as analysts scurried to upgrade their forecasts for the current year. Far more embarrassing, though, is the position of other companies as they trot out the old excuses about recession and depressed markets. Wolseley in its quiet way appears to have demonstrated that a class management act can buck even the most dreadful trends.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Ibrahim al-Ruba'i, deputy </F> director of medical services at the military hospital, by an  unidentified correspondent; date and place not given--recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] Please proceed, Dr. Ibrahim.    [Al-Ruba'i] You are welcome. To begin with, I would like to  thank you for your interest in this issue. In fact, what  happened last night was a very horrible event. As usual, we  sent cars, along with doctors and nurses, for an inspection. At  the same time, approximately 35 killed or wounded people were  evacuated. This figure includes nine dead children, women, old  men, and youths. Naturally, the injuries varied from serious to  slight injuries. All are now at the General Military Hospital.    [Correspondent] Dr. Ibrahim: Will there be any future  effects from these missiles, or effects on those in the vicinity?    [Al-Ruba'i] Psychological cases do affect people in the  surrounding area. These cases differ from one person to  another, depending, of course, on individual will. Such cases  will be referred to psychiatrists who can diagnose them.    [Correspondent] What about the hospital's capability to  treat the wounded people?    [Al-Ruba'i] Praise be to God, there is good capability.  There is coordination with the brothers in the Ministry of  Health. As soon as we need specialists in some types of  surgery, we refer the cases to the [word indistinct] hospital,  for example, or to the Republican Hospital, or to Kuwait.  However, the opposite can occur. There is a complete [word  indistinct].    [Correspondent] Praise be to God.    [Al-Ruba'i] Praise be to God. May God grant us success.    [Correspondent] May God grant us success and save us from  the catastrophes caused by the gang of apostasy and secession.  May he also grant success to, and champion, our Army, the Army  of Constitutional legitimacy. Thank you very much, Dr. Ibrahim  al- Ruba'i, deputy director of medical services for medical  affairs at the military hospital.    [Al-Ruba'i] You are welcome.</p>

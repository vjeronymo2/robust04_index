			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Perspectives: British papers - the best and the worst / The press in Europe A COLLEAGUE said the other day: 'I suppose you are an expert now.' 'An expert on what?' 'On European papers. You've been writing about them for over a year - you must have read hundreds.' It turns out to be 37; at least, that is the number of titles which have appeared in London. They have come from a dozen countries, but there has been nothing from most of Scandinavia, Portugal, Greece, Bulgaria and Romania, so my expertise is a little sketchy. And not all the 37 have been 'read,' either. Still, a year and a bit of this column has certainly taught me a thing or two. For one thing, when it comes to newspapers, Britain is astonishingly rich compared with the standards of the rest of Europe. It is not just that the British read more of them than anybody else; their papers have resources that others can only envy (and regret the manner in which, sometimes, these resources are used]) The biggest French daily, L'Ouest Republicain, sells only about 1m, and no foreigner has ever heard of it. It seems to be published in Rennes (which is a bit like publishing The Sun in Market Harborough) and has a dozen different editions, each replete with local fatstock prices. In Spain, about one in eight of the population reads a paper. In Germany, most read the tiny local dailies which lay down the law for communities of 50,000 or so. At one time, Russian papers enjoyed vast power and influence; now, the former Communist Party mouthpiece Pravda is reduced to three appearances a week and can hardly afford that. Each paper is unique, though. If you want to be well-informed on every issue under the sun (and elsewhere, for that matter), the Neue Zurcher Zeitung is good value. It might not provide the news of the day that interests you - or anything that interests you at all  - but by the end of a month's reading you will have caught up with everything. The papers I like, however, are those which are often reviled in their own countries. Die Welt has been loathed by liberals and the left in Germany because it is the flagship of the right-wing Springer press, but it is a good read. This might be a purely subjective judgment; Welt looks and feels like a British paper - which it was when it started life under the occupation authorities. It seems, however, to do something quite alien to much of the German press: it produces well-written, concise articles which the readers find interesting. That, in the Frankfurter Allgemeine, would not be as bad as making a joke, but it would seem like lese-majesty. The French papers always seem a bit of a mess, even though Liberation, neatly, has pages the same size as its articles. But the result is that I can never find my way around Libe and a certain monotony sets in. The front page of France-Soir is so awful that it is good. There are always about 18 stories, all continued on page four or 16. The other day, the strapline over the headline ran: 'Tell me what you are afraid of and I'll tell you where you live.' The headline: 'The crime map of France.' But then, British papers are a mess to foreigners. Patrick de Jacquelot, of Les Echos, once asked me why the Financial Times would have a story about Robert Maxwell as its lead, a backgrounder on page three, an editorial 13 pages later, a feature opposite and, finally, a commentary by Lex or someone at the back. In a French or Italian paper, the whole lot would have been on a single page. One daily which has impressed me is El Pais, again disdained by Spanish intellectuals. It is a bit like its French sister, Liberation, in pagination and layout, but it contains more interesting material and really does cover the ground. The nearest British parallel is the Guardian. Pais, though, has one feature that would cause a riot in Hampstead, not to mention uproar in every teachers' common room and social services office in Britain if the Guardian tried such a thing. Each day, the classified advertisements carry two or three columns of what are known in the trade as 'hooker ads.' Prostitutes of both sexes give a concise account of their wares, delivery points, and a phone number. The Germans get near this in their weekend editions, but the Spanish are still reacting against the suffocation of the Franco years. The Italians seem to react against nothing. Their papers have a world-weary feel, produced by people who know that nothing can surprise their readers. In an attempt to excite the jaded palates of its readers, La Reppublica will add a desperate twist to stories which are amazing in their own right, but it never comes off. Of course, it could be just be what you know best, but I still prefer British papers. On holiday abroad, there is no choice between Le Dauphine Libere and a day-old Daily Telegraph. The 'quality' press in the UK is unrivalled. On the other hand, as a Spanish friend once remarked to me: 'The best and the worst of Europe are to be found in Britain.'

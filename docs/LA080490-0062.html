			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GO GRANNY'S GO: TRIALS OF A DESERT COURSE CAN'T STOP WINNING FOURSOME  </P> <P> There was a 44-mile bike race here Friday, and no one dropped of heat stroke or  dehydration.  </P> <P> The finishing times, however, were slow, as 70-kilometer team time trials go.  Especially considering that this was the Junior National championships.  </P> <P> Granny's Gourmet Muffins (Matt Johnson, Seattle; Eric Harris, Boulder, Colo.;  Eric Kaiter, Boston; and Greg Strock, Boulder) took first with a time of  1:32:55.77.  </P> <P> In second place with a time of 1:36:36.14 was SVAA/LeMond (Chris Giedt, Morgan  Hill; Ozzie Hutchins, Fremont; Colby Pearce, Boulder; and Jon Vaughters,  Englewood, Colo.).  </P> <P> It takes a 1:26:30 to qualify for the Junior World championships.  </P> <P> There were reasons for the relatively slow times. Surprisingly, the searing  heat was not No. 1 on the list.  </P> <P> Sure, it got hot out on the course -- after all, Borrego Springs is at the foot  of the Southern California Desert. But it was really nothing, cyclers said,  compared to the terrain.  </P> <P> This was not the flat course of cyclists' dreams. Fast times were just a  fantasy.  </P> <P> "Someone said there were a couple hills," said Pearce of SVAA/LeMond. "But it  was more like a mountain pass."  </P> <P> SVAA/LeMond was the fifth foursome to hit the course (in a time trial, teams  are started at two-minute intervals), but was first to cross the finish line.  </P> <P> In fact, partial results were posted after nine teams came in, and SVAA/LeMond  seemed to have first-place wrapped up with a 40-second advantage over the  second-place team at the time, the Spirits of St. Louis B squad (Matt Gates,  Burlington, Iowa; Jessie Ray, Columbus, Ohio; Andy Wall, Marion, Iowa; and  Chris Yenkey, Salina, Kan.), which crossed at 1:37:16.28.  </P> <P> Well, guess who crossed 10th, after starting in the 17th slot and passing six  teams?  </P> <P> Team Granny's, which consisted of four riders who had not before competed as a  team.  </P> <P> And although communication and team work is of the essence in team time trials,  Team Granny's members insisted their victory was not a surprise.  </P> <P> "Each of us have done a lot of time trials," said Kaiter, the No. 3 rider. "So  we felt it would be pretty easy to get into a groove."  </P></p>

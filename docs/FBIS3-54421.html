			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Shafiq al-Asadi] </F>   [Excerpts] Abu Dhabi--Diplomatic sources in Abu Dhabi [UAE]  have reported that statements by Iranian Interior Minister  Mohammad 'Ali Besharati reflect clear inconsistencies in his  country's position on its dispute with the UAE over three  strategic islands in the Gulf. Besharati described the dispute  between Iran and the UAE over "some islands" as "simple" and to  be solved "by dialogue." He added in a press conference in Doha  yesterday, Saturday, that relations between Iran and the UAE are  "good" and have always been good.    Observers think that Besharati's statements, in spite of the  fact that they represent the moderate side of Tehran's position  on the dispute over the islands, do not offer the truth about  the details of the conflict between the UAE and Iran and are not  a "suitable" position from which to arrive at a peaceful  settlement through direct dialogue.    These observers pointed out that Besharati is talking about  solving the dispute over "some islands" without naming them, and  that it is known that he means the island of Abu Musa, which has  been administrated by a memorandum of understanding between the  two countries since 1971. The Iranian interior minister does not  mean the Greater and Lesser Tunb Islands, which Iran occupied in  1971. In spite of the fact that Besharati's position "is  lacking" and does not offer any practical steps leading to a  direct dialogue with the UAE on the matter of the three islands,  in the opinion of Gulf political circles it is a more advanced  position than that of the Iranian foreign [policy] position.  [passage omitted on Iranian official statement]    Observers indicate that Besharati's statement about good  relations with the UAE is a new element in the Iranian lexicon  and will permit contacts to be made with some parties in the  Iranian leadership in Tehran. It appears that the politicians in  the UAE are well versed in the inconsistencies in Tehran, since  the UAE's ambassador in Tehran, Muhammad Ahmad Bu-Rahimah, has  met with the Iranian interior minister, who affirmed after the  meeting that "the differences with the UAE are simple." However,  political circles in Abu Dhabi do not see such a meeting as a  dialogue with Tehran, because the Iranian position, with all its  factions, is not considered suitable to conduct a direct  dialogue to arrive at a peaceful solution to the islands issue.    UAE Foreign Minister Rashid 'Abdallah al-Nu'aymi states that  any meetings with Iranian officials, among them his meeting with  'Ali Akbar Velayati, the foreign minister, on the international  and regional conference level, are "contacts" and not "a  dialogue." The UAE conditions such a dialogue on Tehran's  decision to deal with the three islands in it. [passage omitted  on history of the dispute]    Political circles state that the position of Iran on the UAE  islands issue will have a great impact in determining the  Iranian role and cooperation with the other countries of the  region in maintaining security and stability. The eight states  that signed "the Damascus declaration" support the UAE's  position on the islands issue and its settlement by peaceful  means. [passage omitted]</p>

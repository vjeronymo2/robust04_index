			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (16): Legacy systems live for ever - Comment: Old database systems never die . . . they simply become 'legacies' A RECENT report from Informix, a database supplier in the open systems market, highlights the home truth that once a company selects its database, it shackled to it, for better or for worse. 'Legacy systems will live forever - or, to put it another way, the data that has already been stored and the database management systems that are already in existence and the applications that are run in most corporations of the world, will be organic and evolve,' says the report. 'They will not be taken out and replaced. Open Systems are the future of computing architectures as opposed to proprietary closed systems.'1 For many companies, the choice of a database is so central to their information technology (IT) strategy that it dictates the choice of everything else, including applications and development language. Years ago, when programs were written largely in Cobol, each program contained its own data. The centralisation of data into a database meant that it could be retrieved, re-used, and shared between applications: a computerised version of the old filing cabinet. This issue of Software At Work concentrates on database products for multi-user and minicomputer systems, the 'mid-range' of the market that includes Unix-based or 'open systems.' Here there is an enormous choice. The software industry's premier directory, The Software Users' Yearbook,2 lists over 200 database products, and there are more to be found under the categories of fourth generation language, and data dictionaries. Many of the 200 are PC products (dealt with in our Autumn 1991 issue). However some of these have 'grown up' to cater for the local area network or multi-user market. At the other end of the scale are mainframe products, such as IBM's IMS and DB/2, limited to one proprietary environment. Other 'mid range' options such as Software AG's Adabas and Computer Associates' IDMS have come down-market from the mainframe environment, and have been re-written in Digital Equipment DEC/ VAX and Unix versions. Yet more - about half a dozen well-known names including Oracle, Ingres and Informix - were built from scratch to run on a variety of different computers, although they are best known in the 'open systems' area. Several concerns emerged from the dozens of telephone interviews carried out with various database users. It was clear that portability - the ability to transfer applications between different makes of computer - played a crucial part in many decisions, hence the emphasis on open systems offerings, (see Unilever case study on page 22). Another common criteria was the ability to support future growth: others were swayed by the need for a strong development language. The common data access language SQL has set the standard here. With SQL, the database need no longer be 'strategic,' argues a report comparing 20 database products from consultancy ButlerBloor. 3 The report covers 20 database products running on IBM, DEC VAX and UNIX computers, as well as covering vendor-specific systems such as Tandem, Unisys, and Hewlett-Packard. ButlerBloor stresses that with SQL, users can keep their applications separate from the data, and the database becomes a mere commodity, removing the danger of being locked into a specific vendor. SQL support was an important element for users in the sample interviewed, especially for those running more than one database product, or creating applications to be used across Europe or globally, rather than in the UK alone. As ever, there is no 'best product,' because everyone has different needs. But user-comments are often illuminating. So, in an addition to the usual format of supplier information, users' comments are shown suffixed to the product details. These 'pros and cons' are appraisals and opinions expressed by users about various databases, where there is a sufficient sample of interviewees. The comments do not necessarily indicate a product endorsement  -or otherwise  - by Software At Work. Pros and cons: some comments may well refer to old versions of the products, so in referring to these 'pros and cons,' it is worth bearing in mind that the decisions they reflect may have been taken some time ago. More recent versions of the products may have superseded particular shortcoming mentioned. Comments shown in bold have been made by more than one user. The absence of adverse ('con') comments does not indicate a perfect product; simply that it did not appear on other interviewees' shortlists. The details of the products themselves are provided by the suppliers, and the FT cannot be responsible for their accuracy. References: 1.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Cuba Is Interested in Increased Italian Investments, </F> Trade, and Tourism" -- PRENSA LATINA headline]    [Text] Rome, 25 May (PL) -- Cuba's new ambassador to Italy,  Mario Rodriguez, affirmed today in this capital that his country  is interested in increased Italian investments, commerce, and  tourism.    During a news conference on the occasion of presenting his  credentials to Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, the Cuban  diplomat said that his mission is to make known and to earn  respect for the situation in his fatherland through a ready  dialogue with the local authorities.    Commenting on his meeting with the Italian president,  Rodriguez said that he was pleasantly impressed by the attention  Scalfaro pays to and the knowledge he has of Cuba and Latin  America.    In explaining the absence of conflicts in bilateral  relations  between the two countries, the ambassador said that annually  Cuba receives 70,000 tourists from Italy, the island's fourth  most important source of tourists, after Canada, Mexico, and  Spain.    Regarding investments, Rodriguez explained that one of every  10 Cubans is either a technician or a professional, something  that represents a guarantee to any nation, and that investors  have legal guarantees that they can export their profits.    Cuba is heading for an economy capable of allowing the  island  to see through a political project that has been obstructed for  35 years by a relentless U.S. economic blockade.    It is absurd to see, he said, how at the end of the century  and after the occurrence of many international changes that  produced political, geopolitical, and economic mutations, the  embargo not only is being maintained, it is also being  encouraged.    Until his designation as ambassador to Italy, Mario  Rodriguez  was vice minister of foreign relations and before that, from  1986 to 1990, he headed the Cuban diplomatic mission in Prague.</p>

			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO SLAYING OF BOY, 8  </P> <P> Gregory Scott Smith pleaded not guilty Monday in Ventura County Superior Court  to murder, kidnaping and arson charges in the death of an 8-year-old Northridge  boy.  </P> <P> Smith, 21, of Canoga Park, is scheduled to stand trial on Oct. 22 in the  slaying of Paul Bailly, who disappeared March 23 after his mother dropped him  off at the Darby Avenue Elementary School day-care center in Northridge.  </P> <P> Paul's body was found on fire several hours later in a field in the Santa  Susana Knolls area south of Simi Valley. Prosecutors allege that Smith kidnaped  Paul, gagged him with duct tape and strangled him, then set fire to his body.  </P> <P> Smith worked at the Darby day-care center until supervisors fired him March 6  for playing roughly with children and sometimes deserting them on the  playground.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris said the trial will last about a month  unless prosecutors decide to seek the death penalty, which could lengthen the  trial to two or three months. Kossoris said his office will decide by July 16  whether to seek the death penalty.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Steven Z. Perren ordered Smith to remain in Ventura County  Jail without bond until his trial.  </P></p>

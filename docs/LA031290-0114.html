			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SIMMONS GROUP EXPLAINS CHALLENGE TO LOCKHEED BOARD  </P> <P> A group seeking to take control of Lockheed Corp. by replacing the directors  with its own nominees charged Sunday that the aerospace firm's 1989  reorganization had been a "failure" and that its business strategy is  "dangerously ambivalent."  </P> <P> A proxy statement, designed to solicit the votes of Lockheed shareholders, was  released by NL Industries, a Houston chemical company controlled by financier  Harold C. Simmons. NL Industries, which supports the rival slate selected and  led by Simmons, used the statement to explain its challenge to the Lockheed  board and to present its own proposals for managing the company.  </P> <P> NL Industries also said it has no current plans to sell or liquidate important  Lockheed assets and denied speculation that it plans to drain off "any  over-funding" from Lockheed's pension plans. Some Wall Street analysts have  speculated that NL might want to return any excess to shareholders in the form  of a special dividend.  </P> <P> Simmons' company owns 18.9% of Lockheed's stock. The proxy fight will be  decided March 29 at Lockheed's annual meeting when shareholders vote on the  competing slates of directors.  </P> <P> Calling for the replacement of the present board, NL Industries' statement said  the Lockheed restructuring plan -- put into effect last April -- had failed to  make the aerospace firm more competitive.  </P> <P> The statement referred to a slide in the value of the company's stock and said  it was associated with an earnings decline at Lockheed. The stock price, which  reached a 12-month high of $54.75 in the third quarter of 1989, closed at  $35.625 Friday. The company posted earnings of $2 million on sales of $9.9  billion in 1989, compared to a profit of $624 million on sales of $10.4 billion  the year before.  </P> <P> Major causes of the earnings decline were losses in 1989 of more than $400  million on the P-7A Navy patrol aircraft program and on Lockheed's production  of the wings for the C-17 military transport plane for which McDonnell Douglas  is the prime contractor.  </P> <P> Lockheed has attributed both losses to "industrywide" woes relating to  fixed-price development contracts with the government -- pacts that do not  allow contractors to recoup losses from cost overruns. The P-7A and C-17 are  both fixed-price projects.  </P> <P> Lockheed officials had no immediate comment Sunday on the proxy statement, but  they had earlier cited their April, 1989, restructuring program as a strategy  for improving earnings. Lockheed Chairman Daniel M. Tellep said in a recent  letter to shareholders that the cornerstone of the restructuring is increasing  the efficiency of the company's core defense and aeronautics business.  </P> <P> Under the program, Tellep has said, he expects to cope with cuts in defense  spending by generating more revenue in commercial operations, thereby reducing  the company's reliance on defense-related spending. Lockheed now obtains 75% of  its revenues from Defense Department contracts.  </P> <P> However, NL Industries President J. Landis Martin said Sunday that the  diversification effort diverts the attention of Lockheed executives from their  "core" businesses of contracting for the Department of Defense and the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration.  </P> <P> "We don't think they're imposing enough control over the core -- particularly  on the aeronautical division," Martin said in a telephone interview after the  proxy statement was released.  </P> <P> The proxy statement also weighed in on Lockheed's diversification plan, calling  it "dangerously ambivalent."  </P> <P> NL Industries "believes that now, more than ever, Lockheed must focus on  improving quality, lowering costs and enhancing confidence in its core space,  missiles and aeronautical businesses," the statement said.  </P> <P> Martin, in the interview, was particularly critical of Lockheed's operations in  computer graphics and commercial airplane modification and repair, calling them  financial "under-performers."  </P> <P> "There are too many companies in that (computer graphics) business, and many  companies have been there for a long time," he said. "It's too competitive  already."  </P> <P> Martin said that if NL's slate wins control of Lockheed on March 29, it will  first try to improve Lockheed's operations outside the defense and aeronautics  fields. He added, however, that if a turnaround could not be achieved, the  operations could be sold.  </P></p>

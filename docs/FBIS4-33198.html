			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Huang Kwang-chun, Lo Kwang-jen and Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Guatemala City, June 2 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan,  heading a 21-member entourage, arrived in Guatemala Thursday [2  June] evening from El Salvador for a four-day official visit.    Lien was greeted by Guatemalan Vice President Arturo  Herbruger Asturias and other senior Guatemalan officials at the  airport.    Herbruger said in his welcoming speech that Lien's visit  symbolizes strong ties between the Republic of China [ROC] and  Guatemala.    Lien said he appreciates the hospitality the Guatemalan  Government has extended to him and his entourage. "I hope  cooperation between our two countries can be further  strengthened for our mutual benefit," he added.    Lien later attended a dinner given by local overseas Chinese  groups in his honor.    Lien will meet with Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon  Carpio Friday to discuss matters of mutual concern. A  ministerial-level meeting will also be held, with the  participation of senior officials from the two countries.    ROC Economic Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang and Sun  Ming-hsien,  chairman of the Council of Agriculture, will discuss ways to  boost bilateral cooperation in various fields with their  Guatemalan counterparts.    Lien and De Leon will give a joint news conference Friday  evening to explain future cooperative projects between the two  countries.    Guatemala is the second leg of Lien's current Central  American tour. He just ended a four-day visit to El Salvador  where he attended the inauguration of new Salvadoran president,  Armando Calderon Sol.    Lien will leave here for New York Sunday for a two-day  private visit. Some sources said Lien may also stop in Mexico  on his way to New York, but the rumor could not be confirmed.    The ROC does not maintain diplomatic ties with Mexico or the  United States. Lien said his New York trip is purely for  private purposes.</p>

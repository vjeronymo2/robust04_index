			<p>Pyongyang     media treatment of ROK President Kim Yong-sam's New  Year press conference suggests that the North is attempting to  balance its desire to excoriate the South with a need to avoid  foreclosing inter-Korean dialogue.  Although Pyongyang media  reacted sharply to Kim's remarks, which were carried live by  Seoul KBS-1 television on 6 January, Pyongyang's comment was  remarkable in its failure to address the key question of North-  South talks--an omission seemingly calculated to allow for  maneuvering room for the North Korean leadership.  Thus,  Pyongyang radio on 7 January, for instance, showed its disdain  for the South Korean leader by calling him a "puppet traitor" and  "vicious betrayer who does not care about the destiny of the  nation," but focused its attention on Kim's domestic agenda and  his remarks on the nuclear issue.  Although the ROK president  again claimed that inter-Korean dialogue must take place before  U.S.-DPRK high-level talks could resume, hinted at the  possibility of economic assistance to the North once the nuclear  issue is resolved, and rejected any "concessions" to secure an  inter-Korean summit, monitored Pyongyang media have so far  steered clear of these topics.     In another indication of Pyongyang's effort to leave the door  open for talks with Seoul, the North Korean news agency KCNA on 8  January stopped short of rejecting inter-Korean dialogue while  criticizing recent remarks on this subject by South Korean  Unification Minister Yi Yong-tok.  KCNA claimed that Yi had  stated that the South "will not respond unconditionally even if  the North proposes a North-South dialogue," and depicted his  reported remarks as a "grave" and "base" attempt to "foil DPRK-  U.S. talks."  However, it merely contended that Seoul's  insistence on making inter-Korean dialogue a "precondition" for  the DPRK-U.S. talks is serving as a "brake" on dialogue between  Pyongyang and Washington.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz </F> by Mariola Balicka and Marek Zieleniewski; place and date not  given: "An Attack on the Future"]    [Text] [WPROST] The Democratic Left Alliance candidate  for the post of deputy prime minister and finance minister is  Dariusz Rosati, who once dissociated himself from the so-called  Balcerowicz line toward the end of the Bielecki government but  today claims he supports your views. What can one expect from  Rosati?    [Balcerowicz] I know Dariusz Rosati. He is an ambitious and  capable man, with quite a good economic education, by Polish  standards. The fact that he admits to having changed his mind  puts him in a good light because not many people have the  courage to do that. I think his change of heart was caused by  the fact that Poland has experienced the biggest economic  success out of all of the postsocialist countries, some of which  were in a similar situation to ours and others in an even better  one. Rosati is certainly intellectually qualified to lead the  Polish economy in the right direction. Much depends on whether  he will want to maintain Poland on the rapid development path,  or whether he will do anything just to maintain his post. The  political circumstances accompanying his mission are another  issue. I think the experience with his predecessor, Marek  Borowski [fired by Pawlak for exceeding his authority],  strengthens his chances rather than weakens them.    [WPROST] What is the chief danger to the economic reforms?  Is it the striking Solidarity's attitude of making demands, or  is it the Polish Peasant Party's [PSL] bid to win comfortable  jobs for its members?    [Balcerowicz] The danger is whether Poland can continue its  fast economic development. This depends on political stability,  a strong convertible zloty, and far-reaching institutional  changes, especially an acceleration of privatization.  Solidarity's postulates clash with all of the rules of  accelerated economic development. This is not the first time  this has happened. In 1993, the union upset the political  situation and overthrew the Suchocka government without  realizing the consequences of this action. However, in today's  Solidarity, which has not much in common with the Solidarity of  the past, I detect a clear group of union activists who are  little more than politicians in a trade union disguise. They  once tried to enter the Sejm as trade unionists, not as members  of a party. Therefore, their current protests are an  extraparliamentary attempt to remain on the political scene. But  I hope their activity will bear little fruit. As far as the PSL  is concerned, this is a unified party, but not as far as its  program is concerned. There are major differences within the PSL  concerning the program. How else can one explain the fact that  the PSL's most vociferous members, who prided themselves on  supporting private farming under the People's Republic, are now  reluctant about privatization? For the sake of Poland, one  hopes that the PSL becomes unified in every single respect and  that it joins the right side.    [WPROST] If you were in the opposition, would you vote for  the budget?    [Balcerowicz] Being a political "outsider" [previous word  in English], I have the luxury of not having to bother with such  thoughts. But I can tell you I would be happier if the budget  deficit were smaller.    [WPROST] Speaking on behalf of the Democratic Union, Hanna  Suchocka has accused the government of "lacking a long-term  economic concept," a description she also applied to the present  budget. But can a budget that is so heavily burdened with  expenditures on social security and the servicing of public  debts have any room for an "economic concept"?    [Balcerowicz] One should remember that Poland and the other  countries of this region emerged from socialism with a very high  proportion of budget incomes and expenditures out of the  national income. In capitalist countries with a similar level of  development as Poland's, this proportion is not so high,  although it has been gradually rising since the 1930's,  resulting in the spread of social-democratic trends in economic  policy. On the other hand, the Asian tigers have a very low  proportion of budget incomes and expenditures out of their  national income, as a result of which these tigers are becoming  richer; the rich capitalism of the West cannot bear this burden,  and, under the influence of the economic crisis, the social  democratic model undergoes revisions. The conclusion for us, who  still have a long way to go before we attain developed  capitalism, is that the implementation of a social-democratic  type of policy, aimed not at increasing the distribution of  global incomes and expenditures but at maintaining them at their  present levels, would be a harmful anachronism. By pursuing that  path, we would quickly waste the chance of rapid development.    [WPROST] But Professor Stanislaw Gomulka has accused you,  as former finance minister, of having social democratic  leanings, illustrated by your preference to spend budget funds  on the social services.    [Balcerowicz] I have no deliberate inclinations like that. I  merely failed to stop certain moves in pensions policy in time,  as a result of which budget spending exploded, the budget  deficit increased, and investment outlay was reduced, all in  1991. This also had unfavorable political consequences because,  when one increases spending and then decreases it, one ends up  with a politically undesirable "give and take" image. We failed  to push through the adjustments we undertook in 1991 because of  the election campaign. It is paradoxical that, despite the fact  that pensions in Poland have risen faster than in any other  country in Europe, the opposition of 1991 succeeded in  convincing society that the pensioners were the most  economically threatened sector of society.    [WPROST] Do you agree that today's Cabinet is footing the  bill incurred by the previous governments, which permitted a  huge budget deficit to arise and failed to reform the social  security system?    [Balcerowicz] Definitely not. After all, in the previous  Sejm, the political grouping from which the present government  stems tried to block changes to the pensions system and demanded  even further spending. This grouping tried to compel the  government to print an extra 20 trillion zlotys in 1993 to  finance this extra spending. President Walesa put a stop to it  just in time, after he had received a warning letter from a  group of economists to which I belonged. So this group has no  right whatsoever to complain.    [WPROST] You once appeared on television in a program on  agricultural policy, and you mentioned social justice. I must  admit it sounded rather funny coming from you.    [Balcerowicz] That just shows how strong the stereotypes  about me are. Indeed, I do not use the term "social justice,"  which is abused so often for political purposes. But that does  not mean I do not appreciate the problem of social justice. In  that program, I said that the EEC's agrarian policy, which most  of our peasant parties wish to emulate, is wasteful and socially  unjust because it involves raising the prices of agricultural  produce above market levels by means of state intervention. To  do this, first of all so-called intervention prices, called  minimum prices in Poland, are introduced, and. later on,  mechanisms are introduced that make it impossible to reduce  these prices. The purpose behind all of this is to block  imports, with the aim of equalizing payments. As a result, the  prices of food rise, resulting in a fall in the demand for food,  especially on the part of the poorest sectors of society. At the  same time, the increase in prices causes an increase in  production costs and the emergence of food surpluses. To get rid  of these surpluses, one must subsidize exports, in this way  wasting money that could be better spent on other things, such  as filling the culture gaps in rural areas. This system is  socially unjust because, first, the high prices affect the  poorest consumers, and, second, the advantages fall mainly to  rich farmers because a farmer with, say, 50 hectares gets 10  times more than a farmer with just 5 hectares. Therefore, the  increase in prices has to be divided by the size of production.  For these very reasons, the West is trying to abandon the policy  of antimarket agricultural protectionism and is warning us  against getting involved in it.    [WPROST] According to the press, you might run for the  chairmanship of the new party that is due to be formed as a  result of the merger between the Democratic Union and the  Liberal-Democratic Congress. How far can your political  ambitions go if you claim to be a political "outsider"?    [Balcerowicz] My greatest ambition is the success of the  Polish economic reforms. I have a very personal interest in  that. That is why I have been trying to influence public opinion  since 1991, because I think that a reduction in society's  susceptibility to demagoguery is vital to the success of  democracy and the market reforms. Unfortunately, our Polish  society is considerably susceptible to demagoguery because of  the mass of negative experience and its exposure in recent years  to a barrage of extremist populism.</p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / People: Lucas fills the Edwards gap Lucas, the aerospace and car components group recently shaken by some top management turbulence, has moved swiftly to replace Tony Edwards, the head of its aerospace division who abruptly decided two weeks ago to move to TI Group. The company has appointed Frank Turner, an old hand at Rolls-Royce, the aero-engine and industrial power group, to take over as managing director of its aerospace activities. Turner, the current director of Rolls-Royce's civil engine business and a well-known figure in the aerospace industry, will also join the Lucas board at the end of this month. Aged 49, the Yorkshire-born Turner (above), has spent his entire working life with Rolls-Royce. He started as an apprentice and moved on to become project manager of the RB211 engine assembly in the early 1970s. Before becoming director of the company's civil engine business, his posts included financial controller manufacturing, general manager production, director of manufacturing for civil engines, director, company manufacturing engineering, and of industrial and marine. A strong marketing man, he was closely involved in Rolls-Royce's efforts to expand its civil engine range and increase its market share at the expense of the UK company's two US rivals, Pratt &amp; Whitney and General Electric.</p>

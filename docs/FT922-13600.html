			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Kashmir peace talks may no longer be an impossibility: Both the military and political sands may be shifting towards a compromise IN SRINAGAR, the Indian Kashmir capital increasingly run-down due to nearly three years of fighting by armed Kashmir separatists and Indian security forces, the government is seeking to woo the militants into talks. Heavily sandbagged bunkers at street corners manned by Indian troops bristling with weapons are a reminder that this is a city still at war and one from which tourists have fled. On the outskirts of the town, young militants toting automatic weapons parade their defiance of what they call Indian occupation. But Indian strategy is shifting from the display of force and brutality that was intended to intimidate Kashmiris but which united them in resentment of India. 'We want to slowly take the lid off' and revive political activity, says Mr G C Saxena, the governor. In what was probably the most significant political gesture since the conflict began, he recently announced the release of five Kashmiri opposition leaders who had been held without trial. His hope is that they will show the people of the Moslem-dominated Kashmiri Valley that political means, rather than force, are the best way to achieve political goals. 'These are serious politicians,' he says, 'and they know there is no way they can rise to power on the shoulders of terrorists.' Both the militant groups and the opposition leaders are dismissive of talks with the government. 'We say this is a disputed place and that the people must be given the right of self-determination,' says Mr Abdul Ghani Lone, leader of the People's Conference and one of the five released. 'The Indians say it is an integral part of India. So there is no meeting point.' The government's estimate is that the militants command 5,000 armed men within the Valley (of whom a third are inactive) and 3,000 waiting in Pakistan. Informed Kashmiri observers put the pro-Pakistani Hizbol Mujahideen (the largest militant force) at 24,000, followed by Il Jihad at 22,000. On this reckoning, the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), the most popular of the groups in Srinagar and which wants independence rather than accession to Pakistan, has only 4,000 men. Though the number of militants remains large, on whatever basis the counting, the ground is shifting beneath their feet. The JKLF recently suffered the humiliation of having to call off a march into Pakistan Kashmir because of insufficient support. Its leader, Amanullah Khan, and several of his colleagues were arrested by the Pakistan government, without whose support it would be difficult for the militants to operate. There have been several incidents of popular revulsion at the excesses committed as the militant groups splintered and became more indisciplined. More than 300 Moslems demonstrated in protest in Srinagar recently after two militants killed a Hindu family of three after first raping the mother and daughter. Last week's crowded Srinagar streets and heavily laden fruit stalls, as people stepped out to buy for the Eid holidays, suggested a town with something of an itch to return to normal life. Even the most pro-Islamic, pro-Pakistan groups such as the Hizbol Mujahideen, which is the militant wing of the Jamaat-i-Islam, have cause to worry. The Jamaat is no longer part of the ruling coalition in Pakistan, and the administration of Mr Nawaz Sharif, prime minister, is wary of the Jamaat extending its influence in Kashmir. The governor's hope is that both militant groups and opposition leaders will see a change of mood in the Valley and that their room for manoeuvre is limited by the larger issues of Indo-Pakistani relations and international pressures on the countries to settle their differences. 'Let us see how the situation develops,' he says with a determination to exploit any opening. On the face of it, the prospects for negotiations look slim. Three of the leaders released last week - Sayed Ali Shah Gilani, the head of the Jamaat-i-Islam, Maulana Abbas Ansari, the Kashmiri Shiite leader, and Professor Adullah Ghani - are hardline pan-Islamic, pro-Pakistani politicians. Their distrust of India is likely to have been reinforced by two years of incarceration and the death or imprisonment of many colleagues, friends and relations. Conservative estimates are that 3,000 Kashmiris have died in the three-year struggle. Anti-Indian sentiment remains strong in the Valley and periodically explodes in the wake of incidents of brutality by the Indian security forces. Mr Saxena has been successful in reducing the number of these by getting the police to show restraint, thereby creating the more relaxed atmosphere in Srinagar in which he launched his initiative by releasing the five. Kashmiri emotions could easily flare up again in the wake of fresh brutality, either accidental or provoked by groups with little interest in seeing negotiations take place. But there are also external pressures that favour talks and which are likely to grow. Pakistan has been scared by the possibility of an independence movement spilling over to Pakistan occupied Kashmir. Both India and Pakistan are under strong pressure from the US and other western governments to agree to a nuclear non-proliferation regime, curb military spending and reduce tensions between the two countries. Progress over Kashmir would be a sine qua non of any confidence-building package. In India's case, a powerful inducement to compromise, and one already dangled before it, would be the offer of a permanent seat in the UN Security Council. Other signs of a shift in Indian opinion over Kashmir have been the growing number of articles in the Indian press proposing responses to Kashmiri demands that range from Trieste-style custodianship to opening the border. Substantive talks still seem a long way off. But they no longer look impossible.</p>

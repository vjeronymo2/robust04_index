			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Bar None From Anthem: Comedienne Roseanne Barr coyly joins husband Tom Arnold  and talk-show host Sally Jessy Raphael in singing the National Anthem on  Raphael's syndicated TV show that will air from sea to shining sea today (2  p.m. on KCAL Channel 9).  </P> <P> On the program, taped Monday in New York, Barr and Arnold try to set the record  straight about Barr's controversial rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner"  last week before a San Diego Padres baseball game. Arnold, referring to  President Bush's comment that Barr's singing had been "disgraceful," said, "I  think the President should thank Roseanne. She took the spotlight off his new  taxes and his son's savings and loan scandal." ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

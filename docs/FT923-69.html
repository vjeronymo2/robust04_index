			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: Chairman pumps life into US tyre group - John Griffiths talks with Stanley Gault who has wasted little time in changing direction at Goodyear LESS than two years ago, Goodyear Tire and Rubber's employees were contemplating their company's rapidly-deflating fortunes with dismay. A 1987 net profit of Dollars 770.9m had plunged by 1990 to a loss of Dollars 40m. Savage job cuts were under way among the worldwide workforce of more than 100,000 people, and Goodyear was being demoted from first place to third in the world hierarchy of tyre manufacturers. Today, Goodyear is rolling away from recession almost as rapidly as the company skidded into it. It achieved record first-half sales of Dollars 5.8bn and a leap in first-half net earnings to a well-above-forecast Dollars 176m. This week, the company indicated there would be further third-quarter gains in both sales and profits. Goodyear is being helped by a recovery slowly gaining pace in world tyre markets. But long-serving executives at the headquarters in Akron, Ohio, say that no less significant is the shake-up instituted by Mr Stanley Gault, chairman, since taking office in June last year. It is a shake-up not without tensions: tomorrow, Mr Oren Shaffer, long-serving chief financial officer, is to resign to pursue other interests. Unlike most of his predecessors Mr Gault, 66, is no dyed-in-the-treads tyre man. He spent 10 years as chairman and chief executive of Rubbermaid, the Ohio toys-to-furniture group, before joining Goodyear. However, the bulk of his 31-year career had been spent with General Electric, where he became senior vice-president in charge of GE's industrial products and components sectors. Mr Gault has wasted little time in altering Goodyear's course, while not overtly criticising his predecessors at Akron. Nothing could better symbolise his strongly marketing-oriented approach than the announcement in March that Goodyear-branded tyres would be sold through North America's biggest retailing chain, Sears, Roebuck. However, Mr Gault's edict was heresy to the managers of Goodyear-owned replacement tyre depots and independent dealers through which the company's tyres had been sold exclusively in North America. He has no problems defending the decision. Goodyear's share of the large North American replacement car tyre market had fallen from 15 per cent to 12 per cent in the previous three years. The dedicated outlets had a reputation for being expensive and the market was changing, with brand loyalties fading. Sears, Roebuck, moreover, is North America's single largest tyre retailer, selling nearly 10m units a year. 'In other words, we haven't had tyres for sale in the places where people want to buy them,' says Mr Gault. His concern about the replacement market is well-founded. It is three times larger than the original equipment sector and, although highly competitive, offers better margins. Goodyear has since reclaimed one percentage point of its lost market share and added more than 1,000 employees to the North American retail market this year. The 2.5m Goodyear tyres Mr Gault hopes Sears will sell annually would restore nearly two percentage points. The deal with Sears covers supplies of own-label tyres produced by Goodyear's more downmarket subsidiary, Kelly -Springfield. For these, distribution deals have been concluded with Wal-Mart another mass retailer, and with Big O, an independent tyre retailing chain. Goodyear has added another 3,300 outlets selling Goodyear or Goodyear-produced tyres in North America - a 35 per cent increase. Goodyear's profits are being helped by the tyre industry's determined effort this year to break the long, recession-induced squeeze on margins by announcing price increases of up to 7 per cent. No one expects it all to stick. However, Mr Philip Wylie, Barclays de Zoete Wedd analyst and author of a recent Economist Intelligence Unit report on the world tyre industry, estimates that about half should be retained, with a further lift coming from a long-delayed upturn in US vehicle production. Mr Gault has brought to the market some new products perceived as providing Goodyear with a technological edge. Most notable is the Aquatred, a tyre with a large central groove, which gives the impression of two tyres mounted on one wheel. It is claimed to have superior grip on wet roads. Much of Mr Gault's first year has been devoted to morale-improving missions to plants as the number of employees has shrunk to 97,000 and Goodyear has continued to seek productivity improvements. In 1991, 7,000 jobs were lost worldwide. The company will continue to reduce manning levels wherever possible, Mr Gault insists, but the harshest cuts - 15,000 over the past four years - are said to be over. The aim is to improve operating margins; reduce further the debt burden incurred in fighting off Sir James Goldsmith's takeover bid in the late 1980s and maintain tight control of capital spending. Excluding restructuring items, Goodyear's operating margin improved to 9.2 per cent in the first half of this year, from 6.2 per cent in the same period of 1991. Mr Gault hopes the debt burden will fall to below Dollars 2bn by the end of this year, down from Dollars 3.7bn in last year's first quarter - and two years ahead of schedule. He acknowledges there is little prospect of selling off the multi-billion dollar All American Pipeline, Goodyear's most ill-advised diversification project of the 1980s. However, its operating losses in the first half of this year were cut to Dollars 13.5m, about one-third of year-ago levels and Mr Gault holds out the prospect of it soon making a profit. Goodyear's European operations have been slimmed down, and in this region at least 'there is not a lot of restructuring left for us to do'. Indeed, Goodyear plans a Dollars 12.5m investment next year at its Luxembourg truck tyre plant. Expansion is also planned for Thailand, the Philippines, Taiwan, Indonesia and other Pacific Rim countries. Mr Gault is philosophical about Goodyear's demotion as the world's biggest tyremaker by both Michelin of France and Japan's Bridgestone. Both, he suggests, are saddled with bigger debt burdens than they bargained for with their respective acquisition of Uniroyal-Goodrich and Firestone.</p>

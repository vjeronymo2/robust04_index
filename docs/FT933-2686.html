			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Arts: Uchida launches piano season - Music London's Wigmore Hall is setting out on the new season with confidence in its step. From the experience of the past year following its refurbishment, it knows that audiences are attracted by the new facilities and is in the position to plan an ambitious programme, notably of singers and pianists. The 'International Piano Season' was launched on Wednesday with a recital by Mitsuko Uchida. Thanks to its fine acoustics and intimate atmosphere the Wigmore has always attracted some top pianists, but this selection seems especially impressive: Ousset, Pires, Schiff, Alexeyev and Donohoe among the 18 to be heard, promising to rival the South Bank's old Sunday afternoon series. If all are as good as Uchida's opening recital, they surely will. The atmosphere was relaxed, the musicianship rewarding, the encores generous. One sensed that Miss Uchida loves the hall, even if her affection does not extend to its piano. When it re-opened, the Wigmore proudly invested in a new Bosendorfer, but she spurned that gleaming new instrument (I take it the Bosendorfer was the piano unceremoniously shunted to the back of the platform) and played on the Steinway. What to make of this change? Uchida is not a pianist to call on the Steinway's ringing power, at least not at this venue; perhaps she thought it wiser to steer clear of its brittle, aristocratic rival for this programme. Her opening Haydn Sonata, Hob XVI in D, was anything but chilly or formal. The playing relished every witty harmonic surprise, every dramatic about-turn, using the full range of the Steinway's colours. When Andras Schiff played Schubert's unfinished C Major Sonata, D840, in his Schubert cycle at the Wigmore, he made a point of including the extra fragments. Uchida just played the usual pair of movements, but ironically her performance felt the more complete of the two. Where Schiff had alternated between hushed calm and violent outbursts, Uchida showed how the one grew out of the other, fusing into a deeper, more involving musical personality. That was the feature that distinguished the whole evening: a desire not to settle into one frame of mind for long stretches at a time, but always to sense shifts of feeling, new emphases, different colours. For Schumann's Kreisleriana, which runs from poetry to passion and back again within a page or two, Uchida's darting intellect was well nigh ideal. In the closing minutes the music came close to running away with her, but better that than caution. May all the Wigmore pianists have her adventurousness of spirit.</p>

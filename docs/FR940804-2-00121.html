At and after the meeting, Gianotti offered to buy or barter time to get his programs distributed by defendant, but KBL refused to quote him a price. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 21. KBL is and was owned directly or indirectly by TCI.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 22. TCI directly or indirectly (through its subsidiary TCI of Pennsylvania, Inc.) dominated the Metropolitan Pittsburgh cable television market by having approximately half the cable television subscribers in the said market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 23. Because KBL was owned by TCI and/or Liberty (the two of which were related) which had more than half the cable subscribers in this area, KBL could and did exercise market power over collegiate sports television programming in the Metropolitan Pittsburgh area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 24.

If TCI of Pennsylvania had carried Sportschannel, Sportschannel would have competed with KBL for rights to regional sports events.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) KBL reasonably believed it could impose a seat fee on commercial establishments such as bars which provide a television set for its patrons to watch programs on KBL and actually did impose such a fee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) KBL refused to deal with Gianotti on programming it previously found acceptable for the sole purpose of eliminating him as an intermediary between sports programming sources such as the University of Pittsburgh and other programming sources on the one side and KBL and the cable television systems on the other.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) KBL and/or TCI is now attempting to acquire the Pittsburgh Pirates so that it can control broadcast, telecast and cable casting of Pirate games.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) TCI became a co-owner of K-Prime Partners, Limited Partnership also known as Primestar on February 8, 1990, in an effort to dominate video sports programming.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) TCI through its subsidiary TCI of Pennsylvania, Inc., has had the only cable television service within the City of Pittsburgh between 1984 and the present.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) In December, 1993, TCI of Pennsylvania had approximately 385,000 cable television subscribers in the Metropolitan Pittsburgh area, more than half the total subscribers in this area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) TCI directly or indirectly through a subsidiary bought the City of Pittsburgh cable television franchise from Warner Cable Corp. in 1984 for approximately $93,400,000.00.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) The Chief Executive Officer of TCI is John Malone, who also owns 50.4% of the common stock of Liberty Media, Inc., a Colorado business corporation. TCI and Liberty Media through their various subsidiaries have 10 million cable television subscribers, more than 25% of the total number of cable television subscribers of the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k) John Malone, TCI and Liberty Media during the past two decades have embarked on a course of conduct designed to control cable television and by acquiring control over programming sources, technology and franchises.

This acquisition enabled KBL to sell rights to certain games to broadcast stations such as KDKA&hyph;TV and to institute pay-per-view as to certain games.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (n) KBL also acquired exclusive television broadcasting rights to the Pittsburgh Pirates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (o) KBL, after contracting with the University of Pittsburgh for men's basketball, was able to charge an additional fee to cable system operators for such programming, a fee over and above the regular charge for KBL programming  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 25. John Malone, through TCI and its subsidiaries and liberty Media and its subsidiaries has engaged in an effort to exercise monopolistic control over programming sources by the above acquisitions and by encouraging independent programming sources, such as The Learning Channel, to merge into entities over which they have control such as, The Discovery Channel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 26. The elimination of GTV as a programming source enabled KBL, an entity controlled by Malone, TCI and/or Liberty Media, to deal directly with the University of Pittsburgh on terms favorable to defendants for basketball by tying the acceptance of minor sports programming to basketball.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> IN ITALY, GANGSTERS REACH OUT;  </P> <P> THE RECRUITS OF THE BIG THREE ORGANIZED CRIME CARTELS ARE EVER YOUNGER. SO ARE  MANY OF THEIR VICTIMS.  </P> <P> The bishop of Acerra is a spare, courageous and endangered man who lives in a  neighborhood where festering scars from a 1980 earthquake mirror the  degradation of his flock.  </P> <P> Two churches face one another across Acerra's main piazza. One is a fissured  ruin. The other, the cathedral, is protected by a fence. Between them, grimy  street kids play soccer. Many are illiterate, and some are already accomplished  criminals.  </P> <P> "The boys talk admiringly about gang leaders the way we might talk about John  Kennedy -- how many bodyguards he's got, how many machine guns," said Bishop  Antonio Riboldi.  </P> <P> In a poor and desperate part of Italy that one senior official from Rome has  publicly termed "an unlivable monster," Riboldi said it is past time to stop  the rot. "Fear is no longer a good enough excuse. Whoever does not denounce  lawlessness becomes its accomplice."  </P> <P> Acerra, a slum of 50,000, lies in the decayed hinterland of Naples, spawning  ground -- and killing ground -- of La Camorra, one of the three branches of the  organized crime cartel that loots a nation unable to control it.  </P> <P> While Italy celebrates a robust First World economy and the current presidency  of the European Community, its children are bleeding, victims of an atavistic  underworld that transcends frontiers of time and morality.  </P> <P> In the aftermath of accelerating gangland savagery here in the Italian south,  the bishop's pain is echoed in a national outcry: Basta -- Enough! There are  new anti-crime programs and promises aplenty. But, as ever, the bad guys are  winning.  </P> <P> For many Italians, the crisis is not simply one of crime, or even of violence.  On trial, they say, are the rule of law, and national values.  </P> <P> Designer-dressed Italy has never been richer or more democratic, but in some  parts of its south the state's writ ends abruptly at the borders of shoot-first  gangland fiefdoms. Fully one-quarter of the children of Acerra are not enrolled  in school, and nearly half of all young people can find no honest work, their  bishop says.  </P> <P> "It is clear that there are places in Italy where the presence, or at least the  functioning, of state institutions has become enfeebled," laments President  Francesco Cossiga.  </P> <P> La Camorra, like its outlaw kin, the Mafia in Sicily and the 'Ndrangheta in  Calabria, is ruthless and relentless, but even Neapolitans inured to its  predations are stunned by a current anarchic struggle for power in which  gangland recruits, like their prey, are ever younger.  </P> <P> "Baby killers," the Italian press calls them, using the English words. A  15-year-old murdered a 12-year-old witness to a Camorra execution attempt one  day last month. One shot to the back of the neck killed Andrea Esposito.  </P> <P> Less than 24 hours later, 8-year-old Paolo Longobardi, who happened to be home  when Camorra killers came for his father, also died of bullet wounds.  </P> <P> "They are beasts, no more than wild animals," said Naples Police Chief Vito  Mattera.  </P> <P> The Mafia and the 'Ndrangheta have been settling accounts as well this fall: an  anti-Mafia judge murdered in Agrigento, Sicily; broad swaths of Calabria  terrorized by one-a-day 'Ndrangheta killers. In Calabria, 9-year-old Elisabetta  Gagliardi died instantly last month, an incidental casualty of her mother's  assassination.  </P> <P> By tradition, Italy is not a violent country: There will be fewer homicides  among the 60 million Italians this year than in the 14 1/2 million of New York  City. In the world of organized crime, though, violence is an appalling staple.  Of 1,055 homicides in Italy through the first eight months of this year, there  were 250 in Sicily, 213 in Calabria, and 209 in the Campania region headed by  Naples.  </P> <P> "That there are zones of Italy presided over by the Camorra, the 'Ndrangheta  and the Mafia is true, but it is also true that there are police there as well,  good police. But we alone are not the state," said Matteo Cinque, chief of  criminal police for the Campania region.  </P> <P> Counterattacking, the government of Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti promises  more money, more police, a toughened and streamlined justice system, more and  better-protected judges, stricter gun laws and tighter fiscal control on  municipalities where gangland infiltration is suspected.  </P> <P> But Italians such as Calabrian farmer Carlo de Biaso, whose orchard was  decimated by vandals after he refused to pay protection money, have heard it  all before.  </P> <P> In the belt of despair around Naples, where 2 million people live amid some of  Italy's most grinding poverty, there is a pathetic procession of slum towns  where elected officials are beholden to the Camorra. Nominal members of Italian  political parties, they are in fact elected on the Camorra ticket.  </P> <P> In Calabria, seven women judges, impartial outsiders, were named with great  fanfare last March to help fight crime in the besieged town of Locri. One never  went, and four of the remaining six are asking for transfers back north.  </P> <P> Locri is no fun: Somebody blew up the town hall not long ago, and last month an  outdoor platform mysteriously burned down before a scheduled anti-crime rally.  One senior police official was murdered, and the present carabinieri commander  can't find baby sitters for his young children -- too dangerous, say local  girls.  </P> <P> Specializing in kidnaping and extortion, the 'Ndrangheta is a network of clans  based on large families, 152 by recent police count, with 5,200 members and  15,000 "friends." About 80% of all crimes of violence in the Calabria region  over the last 18 months have occurred in Locri and the 105 other towns in  Reggio Calabria province. In the more than 200 'Ndrangheta murders in Calabria  this year, there has not been a single arrest.  </P> <P> In Sicily, where the centrally controlled Cosa Nostra is Italy's largest,  richest and best-known criminal enterprise, investigators seemed to be making  headway in 1987 when testimony from renegade members helped bring hundreds of  Mafia bosses and soldiers to trial.  </P> <P> Since then, though, justice has stumbled badly. Judges began to fight among  themselves. Killings were unanswered by arrests. Momentum shifted back to the  Mafia, richly astride a vast, multinational empire of legal and illegal  businesses. Flush with profits from heroin, the Mafia kills and intimidates  selectively in Sicily.  </P> <P> Last month, Mafia killers assassinated Magistrate Rosario Livantino, 38, in  Agrigento, and parked a car with 120 pounds of explosives outside the police  headquarters in Catania where there had been a series of annoying arrests. More  polished than its colleagues in Calabria or Campania, the Sicilian mob  delivered its message not by exploding the car but by calling a television  station to warn of its cargo.  </P> <P> "Mafia culture is worse than Hitler's doctrine," said Agrigento Archbishop  Carmelo Ferraro in the funeral oration for the slain magistrate. "They call it  honor, but it is clothed in contempt, ferocity, betrayal. By the fruits you  shall know the tree. It's time to remind ourselves that there is no room for  compromise and delay. Society and democracy cannot be supported by arrogant  tyranny."  </P> <P> Once, "men of honor," as gang members like to be known, made a point of keeping  women, children and bystanders well away from their fights with one another and  the lagging law. That has changed, just as in current Italian parlance, the  term "Mafia" that was once reserved for the Sicilian mob is now also used  generically to describe Italian organized crime in all of its violent and  increasingly intertwined guises.  </P> <P> In Rome, Mafia specialist Pino Arlacchi said there is considerable  interconnection among the three, once largely self-contained regional crime  enterprises. "It's all just organized crime now -- the Mafia," he said.  </P> <P> Arlacchi and other observers blame Italy's swelling violence on the changing  nature of organized crime. In less hectic times, clans or families were static,  operating in established and respected territories. Everybody knew who was who  and who was where.  </P> <P> "Now," said Arlacchi, "the clans compete actively for new business, rubbing up  against one another in the marketplace as they jostle for contracts, rackets  and new territory. The violence is a function of the new nature of their  business. What is new is the number of women and children victims. They are a  function of the growing level of violence."  </P> <P> In Campania now, as many as 80 different Camorra clans are battling for space  and prominence, as fierce as rats vying for bits of cheese.  </P> <P> The most diffuse and least organized of Italy's criminal big three, La Camorra  lives off cocaine, contraband, numbers and extortion. After a prosperous decade  in which billions of dollars in largely ineffective Italian government  earthquake aid wound up in criminal pockets, times are leaner now in Campania.  Lacking any overall, Sicilian-style leadership, rival Camorra clans that got  rich when the going was good are now slugging it out.  </P> <P> "The (Sicilian) Mafia shoots high, the Camorra shoots low," said Police Chief  Cinque, meaning that in Sicily, Mafia victims are often carefully targeted  officials.  </P> <P> Around Naples, Camorra clans war from city hall to neighborhood soccer fields.  Police at first thought Andrea Esposito, the 12-year-old working in a bar, had  been killed because he happened to witness a Camorra murder there. Only later  did it become clear that he was the intended victim of a blood feud between  clans.  </P> <P> About one-third of the children of the Campania region fail to finish primary  school, according to Marcello d'Orta, a teacher who has written a best-seller  about the violent fears and dreams of Naples' children.  </P> <P> The street kids are abundant and eager kindling for Camorra recruiters. Judge  Melita Cavallo says the defendants in her Naples juvenile court keep getting  younger. Not long ago, she said, an 8-year-old was brought to court who had  long and savvy experience as a lookout during robberies committed by his  mother's lover.  </P> <P> For the children, crime means freedom, money and respect. For the Camorra,  children are perfect foils. They are easy to impress, they work cheap, their  blood is hot and, under Italy's liberal laws, it is almost impossible to  incarcerate them. An adult cocaine courier might go to jail, but a child  courier is certain to go home. D'Orta recalls one 14-year-old gunman arrested  on three different occasions with three different pistols -- and driven home by  police each time.  </P> <P> "Ten years ago, I could send a child to a reformatory for one year for a purse  snatching. Then it was three months. Now it is a suspended sentence and send  them home," said Cavallo.  </P> <P> Riboldi, an outspoken prelate who has been threatened more than once by the  Camorra, has seen the transformation of children into hardened criminals within  a few years. They start by carrying messages for criminal bosses who distrust  the phones. Then they move upward, one step at a time: numbers running,  muggings, robberies, holdups, drug trafficking, and even killing.  </P> <P> "I have met 12-year-olds as tough as Camorra bosses," said the bishop of  Acerra.  </P> <P> By now, it is no secret to anyone in Italy that the Camorra's adopted children  have been failed by their families, their schools and their national  government.  </P> <P> "If we don't put some pressure on families and on schools, the Mafia will never  be conquered," said President Cossiga while Naples teachers complained of a  shortage of benches and books, blackboards and schools.  </P> <P> Indeed, for concerned Italians in the front line, such lofty musings sound like  another chorus of an old song, too long whistled on the wind.  </P> <P> "At the public level there is no will and no capacity to confront the problem,"  said Judge Cavallo, who left court one day recently anguished by the case of a  16-year-old caught trying to steal a motorbike with a toy pistol in a trembling  hand. It seems the boy's mother had worked an extra job and forsworn vacation  to buy her son a motorbike. Three times she bought one. All three were stolen  by the Camorra's children.  </P></p>

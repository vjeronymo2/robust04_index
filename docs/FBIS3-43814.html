Self-styled interim president Ali Mahdi Mohamed welcomed the  agreement signed Sunday by traditional leaders of his Abgal  subclan and the Habr Gedir of his enemy, factional leader  Mohamed Farah Aidid. "It is the first step in a broad  peacemaking process," he told reporters. But he added: "We have  a long way to go," and described the treaty as "fragile and  delicate."    Issa Mohamed Siad, foreign affairs secretary of General  Aidid's Somali National Alliance (SNA) faction, declined to talk  to reporters. Appearing to reject the treaty, he sent word  through an aide that the SNA would not comment on it "because it  was not a political issue, only an agreement reached at a  traditional clan gathering."    SNA supporter Abdi Abshir Kahiye said the clans could settle  "small, local issues like punishing criminals," but their  authority did not extend to "big political questions."    The treaty, hammered out by 176 clan elders and religious  leaders in three days of talks, calls for the clans to live in  peace, end the division of Mogadishu and return property looted  during the civil war.    But the two warlords themselves neither signed the agreement  nor attended the talks, reserved for clan elders and closed to  politicians.    A vicious power struggle still divides the two men whose  fighters gutted Mogadishu in four months of carnage before the  first US Marines landed in December 1992 to help end a famine  that cost 300,000 lives.    Aidid wants UN troops to quit Somalia. But Ali Mahdi says  they must stay to prevent renewed civil war after US forces  withdraw in March, a decision prompted by the killings of 25  Americans in clashes with Aidid's militiamen. Ali Mahdi said he  would comply with the treaty and remove his militiamen from the  Green Line dividing his north Mogadishu enclave from Aidid's  south Mogadishu stronghold. "I hope Aidid will listen to the  message of peace," Ali Mahdi said, adding that he was encouraged  by the presence at the talks of influential clansmen of Aidid,  currently in the Kenyan capital Nairobi.    But in a sign that peace may still be a distant prospect,  Ali  Mahdi denied SNA officials' claims that Aidid himself held peace  talks in Nairobi with representatives of the Group of 12  factions led by Ali Mahdi. He stressed, however, that faction  leaders were coming under mounting pressure from the  rank-and-file to make peace.    "We are a clan society," Ali Mahdi said. "If the clan of a  given political figure or leader opts for peace and chooses the  road of reconciliation and pacification, I believe that leader  has to comply with the wishes of his people."    Ali Mahdi said the UN's earlier attempts to mediate between  the clan-based factions had failed.    But he stressed that Sunday's treaty was "completely  different" because it marked "the first time that the community  leaders have stepped in with all their weight" since factional  fighting erupted after the 1991 overthrow of dictator Mohamed  Siad Barre.    Ali Mahdi said buses had already started moving freely  across  the Green Line only a day after the treaty was signed.    Somali residents said they saw little change. Some even  reported more gunmen than usual in Mogadishu's shell-blitzed  streets.    Ali Mahdi called for an all-clan "national community  leaders'  conference" to be held in Mogadishu after talks to win the  agreement of other, smaller clans that did not sign the treaty.</p>

Christine Shelly told a news briefing that Secretary of  State  Warren Christopher held lengthy meetings with Chinese top  leaders while he was in Beijing.    During the discussions, the two sides addressed a broad  range  of bilateral issues including human rights, non-proliferation  and trade, she said.    "The secretary presented U.S. views on all of these subjects  to the Chinese leaders," Shelly claimed.    "During the meetings in Beijing, some of the differences on  human rights issues were narrowed," she said. "However, more  work must be done."    "We intend to continue our dialogue and our negotiations  with  China on the human rights issues," she added.    Shelly denied a report in the Washington post today that the  U.S. had softened its trade stand with China and had offered a  compromise plan to China on the renewal of the  most-favored-nation trade status.    "This inaccurately reflects the substance and the tenor of  the secretary's eight hours of discussion with China's leaders  over the last three days," the spokeswoman said.</p>

			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Arts: Five hundred years of careful growth - Architecture The college of the Blessed Virgin Mary, St. John the Evangelist and the Glorious Virgin St. Radegund is better known as Jesus College, Cambridge. When the college was founded in 1496 by John Alcock, Bishop of Ely, he took over the convent buildings, including the priory church which was begun in 1150. Jesus College is fortunate in having a site that is extremely spacious  -the five courts are surrounded by generous gardens and playing fields. Large trees add to the park-like atmosphere and there is a homogeneity about the mainly brick buildings, although the college's architectural history is long and complex. The first glimpse of the college from Jesus Lane is an intriguing one - trees seen over old brick walls, the square tower of the chapel looking almost like a parish church, and then the slender opening that leads to the narrow entrance path, known as 'the chimney'. This is the main pedestrian approach, usually lined with abandoned bicycles, ending at the Tudor gatehouse. It is one of the simplest and best gatehouses in Cambridge, dating from around 1500 and looking at its most romantic when the college flag is flying from the battlemented top. Once a visitor has passed through the gatehouse into first court, one of the architectural conventions of the college is immediately apparent  - the three-sided court: first court, second court, chapel court, and north court are all open on one side. This makes the college seem fluidly connected to its parkland and gardens and adds an intensity to the experience of the fully enclosed, four-sided cloister court. The north side of the original cloister was the refectory of the convent and is now the college hall. There are some fine Early English gothic arches that remain in the cloister from the original Chapter House. The simple brick three-storey ranges typify the Jesus style and different architects at different periods have added buildings in a careful and coherent way. Alfred Waterhouse (of Manchester Town Hall, the Natural History Museum and the Prudential in London's Holborn) added the north range of the second court in 1870 and managed to be disciplined by the convention of low-key brick walls, adding only a slight touch of flamboyance with an asymmetrical tower and spire. In the 1920's and 1930s the architect Morley Horder added connected ranges around the southern end of the chapel court. Horder (1870-1944) is an almost forgotten contemporary of Sir Edwin Lutyens, who is best known for his traditional country houses, particularly in the Cotswolds and Dorset. He was renowned for his Bohemian appearance and for designing a modest house for Lloyd George, but he should be re-examined as he was a master of materials and built, like Lutyens, at a time when English craftsmanship was still practised and taught. He also built Westcott House in Cambridge and the National Institute of Agricultural Botany - an exercise in the Wren manner. His substantial group of stone Italian Renaissance buildings for the University of Nottingham are his best known works. In the 1960s the college added a large new court by the Cambridge architect David Roberts, with student rooms arranged on an echeleon plan to maximise sunlight. It is in a different tradition from the rest of the college and only its distance from the older buildings renders it acceptable. Recently the college announced that it planned to build a new court to commemorate the quincentenary in 1996 of its foundation. The site was selected to the south of the Morley Horder neo-Tudor buildings on what is now a car park and part of the Master's garden. The college, advised by the architect Fellow, Nicholas Ray, prepared a master plan and embarked on the delicate procedure of choosing an architect. A committee of twelve, chaired by the Master, Lord Renfrew, considered 30 or so firms and reached a shortlist of eight. Great care was taken, and the eight firms were interviewed in their offices. Then selected buildings by four of the original eight firms were visited and finally two were chosen to prepare sketch proposals for the development. Selecting an architect is a difficult business and the college procedure seems to have been exemplary. The two firms finally chosen to compete were Edward Cullinan and Partners and Evans and Shalev. Interestingly, the two were briefed together and then paid a reasonable sum to prepare schemes that had to be presented to the college and the whole fellowship. There was a clear majority of Fellows in favour of the Evans and Shalev scheme. Evans and Shalev are now best known for their law courts at Truro (winner of the Financial Times Architecture Award) - a fine contemporary building that is very sensitive to the townscape and context of Truro. They also won the competition to design the Tate Gallery in Cornwall that is under construction on a sensitive and important site in St. Ives. Their scheme for Jesus College is first class and promises to add a very distinguished new court to the college. It deals with the difficulties of the historic context in a sensitive way. The designers have sensed the architectural atmosphere of the college and followed the language of well-proportioned windows in substantial brick walls which are trimmed in real stone. There are pitched roofs behind parapets that align in height with the rest of the college. These architects understand appropriateness - designing what is fitting for the context but with a strong character of its own. There are three phases of the proposed development: firstly a new college library and computing centre, secondly some 60 residential rooms, and thirdly an auditorium to seat 200 with associated music teaching rooms. Limited funds at present have meant that the architects have had to produce designs that allow for a phased development and also for the unlikely possibility that some phases may never be built. The library will be built first. It has a formality and dignity that suits its purpose as well as subtle and potentially beautiful lighting effects from the unusual windows and vaulted ceiling. The circular top-lit stair is reminiscent of the similar space at Truro, where it is a great success. As the college has gone to such trouble to find good architects who have prepared a sensitive and effective design for a difficult site, it is much to be hoped that benefactions will soon be found to build the entire new court to as high a standard as possible. What better way of marking five hundred years of careful college growth on this beautiful Cambridge site?</p>

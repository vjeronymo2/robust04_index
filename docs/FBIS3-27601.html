			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hefei, February 24 (XINHUA) -- East China's Anhui  Province has fostered the development of multi-level labor  markets to exercise control over the formerly disorganized  outflow of rural labor forces to cities and towns.    Improvement of rural productivity has resulted in a labor  surplus in many rural areas. These surplus laborers push into  new areas, especially into cities which seem to promise more  work opportunities and better lives.    Individual introduction used to be the most common way for  farmers to find employment. But the spreading of false  information or even downright swindling commonly left farmers  with losses of money and time.    To eliminate the blind seeking of employment and better  organize the surplus labor force, labor markets have been  established in 16 cities and 68 counties of the province and  more than 400 career-introduction institutions have mushroomed  in rural towns and villages.    Offering a series of services including registration,  arrangement of interview, supervision of signing and  implementation of employment and labor insurance contracts,  those labor markets have successfully satisfied the demands for  laborers in enterprises and accorded employment to many rural  laborers.    Zhang Gongyou, a farmer from Wuwei county, was employed as a  salesman for a Beijing-based commercial enterprise only ten days  after his registration in the county's labor market. He said  happily that the labor market had saved his money and time and  he could hardly believe that seeking a job could be so quick and  easy.    According to officials of the provincial labor bureau, up to  now 600,000 rural laborers, or one-fourth of the total who had  crowded into cities seeking opportunities and temporary jobs,  have been channeled through labor markets.    The Huainan and Huaibei coal mines, which once experienced  much difficulty in hiring enough miners, have managed to employ  20,000 rural contracted laborers thanks to the introduction of  labor markets.    The Anhui Labor Bureau has also for the first time sent  nearly 1,000 laborers to Japan and the Philippines.    The province plans to further strengthen the implementation  of relevant laws and improve quality and effectiveness in  offering labor services to its five million surplus rural  laborers this year, said the labor bureau official.</p>

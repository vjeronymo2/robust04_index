			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lilian Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 24 (CNA) -- Economics Minister P.K.  Chiang Tuesday [24 May] decorated the outgoing director of the  German Trade Office Juergen Franzen for promoting trade and  economic ties between Taiwan and Germany.    Chiang said at the award ceremony that Franzen has  contributed a great deal to trade relations between the two  nations during his eight-year term as director.    Trade between Taiwan and Germany hit U.S.$7.72 billion in  1993.    Chiang said Franzen will be leaving for Singapore in June to  serve as delegate of the German Industry and Commerce for the  Asia Pacific region and Asian director and coordinator of the  Asia Pacific Committee of German Business. He hoped that  Franzen will continue to promote trade between the two nations  and that bilateral trade would hit U.S.$10 billion soon.    Franzen recalled the time when he first came to Taiwan in  1975 as a student. He said that he has witnessed the rapid  economic growth of Taiwan and seen ties between Taiwan and  Germany go from distant to close over the past two decades.    German Ambassador to Sri Lanka Klaus Franke will assume  Franzen's post in June.</p>

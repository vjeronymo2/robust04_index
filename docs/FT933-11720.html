			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Letter: Sad reflection on engineering in UK Sir, I, and I am sure many other industrialists, greatly regret the recent changes at the weekly magazine The Engineer, which throughout its long history has energetically informed those in industry to the benefit of all. The Engineer's virtual demise flies in the face of the burgeoning interest in manufacturing at every level of government. In Germany, where national pride in engineering excellence has proved unshakeable, such a development would be unthinkable. It is hard not to conclude that it reflects the value we in the UK place on engineering and the myriad products it develops and produces. Industry needs publications with real authority and, with respect, this load cannot be carried by the Financial Times alone. Through its investigative journalism The Engineer helped to raise the awareness of industry and place a focus on the dynamism of engineering. The Engineer has provided engineers with a stream of information for the last 137 years. It would take a bizarre sense of timing to conclude that now is an appropriate time to turn off the tap.

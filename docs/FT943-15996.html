			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Boffins aim to clean up with oilseed rape Scientists at the Scottish Agricultural College are working with Calgene, the Californian biotechnology group, to develop an oilseed rape variety for use in detergents such as washing powder for the European market. The work, unveiled at this week's Royal Show, England's biggest agricultural event, involves genetic engineering of rape varieties to change the mixture of oils they contain. If the research results in commercial production it could reduce dependence on imports of coconut and palm oil for detergent manufacture. Britain imports 400,000 tonnes of these oils a year. 'We're to all intents and purposes growing palm trees at Aberdeen,' said Mr Kerr Walker, an agronomist with the college's Agro-Industrial Research Services unit in north-east Scotland. Oilseed rape is one of the most important crops grown in the UK for industrial purposes, which means it can be cultivated on land that farmers are paid to take out of food production. Last year, 500,000 hectares of arable land were set aside in the UK, a figure that could double by 2000. At present only erucic acid is available from rapeseed. This is used in specialised industrial detergents, but is becoming better known as an agent for making polythene wrapping malleable. Calgene, which developed the non-rotting 'Flavr Savr' tomato, has asked the Scottish researchers to investigate varieties with high lauric acid content, which produces oils similar to coconut and palm oil. 'There's interest from other companies,' said Mr Walker. 'They really would like to get their hands on these materials. But the varieties are very definitely Calgene's property and have been patented.' He said the oils could be on the market in North America next year, according to the American Oil Chemists Society. Their commercial development in Britain depends on the gradual relaxation of Department of Environment regulations on the release of genetically engineered organisms. It also requires public acceptance that stringent precautions have been taken to ensure such releases are safe. The genetic engineering involves slotting a small piece of genetic information into the plant cell, which then produces a different oil type. Mr Walker said: 'It's absolutely vital the public are kept informed about this and that it's done slowly and sensitively'.</p>

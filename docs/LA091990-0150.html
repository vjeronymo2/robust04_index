			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MUSTANG RANCH'S NEW 'MADAM' ON BANKRUPTCY COURT'S PAYROLL  </P> <P> A federal bankruptcy trustee is the new "madam" at the Mustang Ranch, and she  says she'll run the legal brothel "like any other business."  </P> <P> But first, Jeri Coppa needs a staff, since the bordello's "working girls" left  before federal officials closed it Tuesday because the owner, Joe Conforte,  missed a payment on his tax bill.  </P> <P> "I will run it like any other business, a bar or a store," Coppa said. "The  point is, an operating business sells better than one that is shut down."  </P> <P> Coppa acted as trustee for a bankrupt brothel near Fallon several years ago. It  never sold and creditors eventually foreclosed.  </P> <P> Conforte, apparently acting on advance notice the bankruptcy court intended to  liquidate his business, had closed the bordello and sent his employees away  before receiving formal notice.  </P> <P> Coppa said the prostitutes are out on the street with nowhere to go and urged  them to return to the 105-room Mustang Ranch, which is located about 12 miles  east of Reno in Storey County, where brothels are legal under county law.  </P> <P> Some customers who showed up at the ranch were surprised to find it closed. "I  guess it's back to the opera," one man joked.  </P> <P> Conforte's much-publicized attempts to sell the brothel through public stock  offerings for about $23 million failed twice in recent years.  </P></p>

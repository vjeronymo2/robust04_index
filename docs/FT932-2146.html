			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Outspoken champion of manufacturing - Chris Tighe on Crabtree's approach to the market ONE OF Britain's most vociferous champions of manufacturing industry will see dealings start on Monday in the shares of Crabtree, the Gateshead-based metal decorating printing press producer of which he is chairman. Mr Karl Watkin has a reputation for outspokenness in criticising what he sees as lack of government commitment to manufacturing. Legend has it that he called Mr Peter Lilley a 'little pillock' when the hapless politician toured Crabtree in his days as Trade and Industry secretary. However, Mr Watkin, 37, whose maxim is 'shy boys get nowt' - has put his effort where his mouth is. Since he and Mr Matt Cooper, his partner, staged a Pounds 3.6m management buy-out of Crabtree from Vickers in 1986, they have turned it from a company losing Pounds 8,000 a day into a profitable exporter selling more than 80 per cent of output to more than 60 countries. For Crabtree's flotation Mr Watkin has warranted that it will make Pounds 3m pre-tax profit in the year ending September. Turnover is expected to be just over Pounds 20m. The company, which counts only Mailander of Germany and Dainippon Ink and Chemicals of Japan as major competitors, designs, produces and installs presses for decorating tinplate and aluminium. An estimated 1,500 machines worldwide provide a profitable income stream from maintenance, repairs and spares. Crabtree's flotation, via a reversal into Somerset Trust, a quoted investment trust, aims to fund acquisitions in the capital equipment sector. Mr Watkin says: 'We're looking for a company with a substantial turnover, Pounds 40m-Pounds 100m, currently washing its face, exporting, but with a potential to be world class.' Somerset's Pounds 19.4m acquisition of Crabtree, plus Pounds 1m of working capital, consists of the issue of Pounds 5m shares to the vendors, plus Pounds 8.4m of loan notes and a Pounds 6m cash payment. Credit Lyonnais Laing's placing of 6.7m new ordinary shares at 150p each, to raise Pounds 10m, was enthusiastically received by institutional investors. The 3-for-1 rights issue of 3.6m shares, also at 150p each, to raise Pounds 5.4m, is fully underwritten by Hill Samuel. The Somerset EGM on Monday to vote on the reverse takeover, under which the trust will be renamed Crabtree Group, is expected to be a formality. Mr Watkin, Mr Cooper and the other existing shareholder, Mr Richard Oury, will hold 12.7 per cent, 7.6 per cent and 2.3 per cent respectively of the enlarged share capital. Mr Stephen Hargrave and Mr Luke Johnson, who acquired 29.9 per cent of Somerset last summer with a view to an acquisition by reverse takeover, will have 2.5 per cent. Mr Watkin and Mr Cooper will remain at the helm of a stren-gthened management team. Recently, Mr Watkin launched a high-profile crusade, Manufacturing Challenge, to urge north-east England manufacturers to double output and treble exports over the next decade. The campaign signifies a shift in his view of who is to blame for Britain's manufacturing decline - not only the government and the banks, but all of us. 'It's just complacency. We've got too fat and lazy. We as a country haven't got a culture that puts manufacturing at the forefront of our minds.' What institutional investors will make of Mr Watkin's bluntness remains to be seen. He acknowledges he now has investors to please but anticipates no problem. 'I'm more than happy so far with what's been said to me by institutional investors,' he says.</p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Repossession orders fall sharply Court orders for mortgage repossession have fallen to their lowest level since 1989, confirming that the worst of the recession in the housing market is over. County courts in England and Wales made 17,522 orders for possession in the first quarter of the year, the Lord Chancellor's Department said yesterday. This compares with 23,646 in the last quarter of 1993 and 26,910 in the first quarter of last year. The number of actions commenced also fell sharply in the fourth quarter of 1993 and the first quarter of this year, when they totalled 21,968. The sharp fall was caused partly by new rules requiring lenders to provide more details before they can win a possession order, the department said. It is thought that lawyers for mortgage lenders had taken time to adjust to the new rules. Even so, Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, said the figures 'show the successful effect of lenders' policies and confirm that the worst of the pain in the housing market is now over. 'As the housing market returns to normal it is important to remain mindful of the lessons learnt the hard way during the recession.' At the depths of the housing market recession in the third quarter of 1991, the courts made 39,798 possession orders. The figures do not show how many homes have been repossessed as not all orders result in the execution of warrants of possession.</p>

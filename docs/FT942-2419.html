			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Militants turn to UN over kidnap Kashmiri militants who kidnapped two Britons are trying to involve United Nations military observers in plans for their release, Reuter reports from Srinagar. Militant representatives yesterday said the pro-Pakistan Harakatul Ansar group, which abducted Kim Housego and David Mackie on June 6 while they were trekking in mountains south-east of Srinagar, wanted to hand the pair over to the UN Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP). The small UN group has been based in both countries since 1949, watching over a tense ceasefire line which cuts through Kashmir after the two neighbours fought two wars over the Himalayan state. No reaction from UNMOGIP was immediately available. Militant sources said Harakatul Ansar also wanted journalists to be present at the release of Housego, 16, and Mackie, 36. Kim Housego's father David, who met the kidnappers last week in the mountains where the abduction took place, said on Saturday they assured him the pair were safe and would be freed in Srinagar, Kashmir's summer capital. They did not say when. Earlier promises to free the Britons have fallen through, with the militants objecting to what they say is Indian military activity in the area. The Indian government is sensitive about UNMOGIP's role, saying it has no mandate to observe a four-year-old uprising against Indian rule in the Moslem majority state. UNMOGIP officers were turned away when they tried to act as neutral observers to an army siege last October at Kashmir's holiest Moslem shrine, where militants and some civilians were holed up. The militants emerged peacefully after a month. The kidnap has been widely condemned by other militant groups who see it as bad publicity for their uprising, in which more than 16,000 are reported to have died.</p>

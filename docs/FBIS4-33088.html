			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 1 Jun (AFP) -- Jose Francisco Pena,  candidate for the social democratic Dominican Revolutionary  Party [PRD], demanded new general elections be held after  denouncing, on Wednesday, that the Central Electoral Board (JCE)  is preparing a new maneuver in the delivery of the electoral  lists to the political parties.    During a news conference in Santo Domingo, Pena Gomez said  the maneuver consists of satisfying the demands of the  opposition parties by giving them a forged voter list with  200,000 less voters, which obviously does not correspond to the  electoral list that was used on election day, 16 May. "What  needs to be done is for the JCE to deliver photocopies of the  lists used at each of the tables on 16 May," according to Pena  Gomez and fellow party member Tirso Mejia Ricart, elections  director of the PRD. These lists can easily be distinguished  because they are sealed with a mark that states: "voted,"  according to the PRD leaders.    Likewise, Pena Gomez said that as part of his party's  international campaign to denounce the electoral fraud, his  candidate for vice president, Fernando Alvarez Bogaert, will  attend the Latin American Foreign Ministers Conference in Belem,  Brazil, to explain the situation. "The damage caused to  continental democracy with the shameful events that took place  during the Dominican election process is serious as can be  proven by the international observers who attended the  elections, including the Christian Democrats," Pena Gomez said.    While the JCE estimates indicate that President Joaquin  Balaguer, from the Reformist Social Democratic Party (PRSC), won  the elections with a 1-percent advantage (30,000 votes) over  Pena Gomez, his followers maintain that fraud took place to  ensure the reelection of Balaguer, twice president and seven  times a candidate.    Pena Gomez added that he had received a letter from Costa  Rican President Jose Maria Figueres informing him that the four  Central American presidents and their respective foreign  ministers had agreed to endorse Alvarez Bogaert's participation  in the conference at Belen, Brazil. The other presidents are  Carlos Roberto Reina of Honduras, Ramiro de Leon Carpio of  Guatemala, and Violeta Chamorro of Nicaragua.    If Dominican Republic Foreign Minister Aristides Taveras  Guzman objects to Alvarez Bogaert's participation to report the  alleged fraud, the Costa Rican foreign minister will present him  as a member of his delegation, Pena Gomez reported. In this  respect, the PRD candidate recalled a previous case when during  Anastasio Somoza's dictatorship in Nicaragua, Father Miguel  D'Escoto participated in a conference as a member of the Costa  Rican delegation.    Finally, Pena Gomez announced that leaders of his party will  be sent on other missions. One mission will go to Jamaica to  request the Caribbean Common Market (Caricom) to not recognize  the possible proclamation of Balaguer as the newly elected  president of the Dominican Republic. Another PRD delegation  will go to the EU to report "the scandalous fraud committed  against the democratic rights of the Dominican people," he  concluded.    Analysts agree that the post-electoral Dominican panorama  continues to "be tangled and complicated."</p>

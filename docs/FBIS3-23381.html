The  Higher Military Court had unanimously sentenced them, together  with a third fugitive defendant named Hamadah Muhammad Lutfi, to  death in case no. 94/2 of the Military Prosecution Office.    The source said that the military prosecution accused the  two  civilians, who belonged to the al-Jihad Organization, of seizing  the opportunity to recruit the conscript in the Armed Forces and  agreed to provide him with some explosives to use for  sabotaging one of the military installations in his unit.    The source added that the two civilians did in fact bring  the  explosives to the conscript but the latter was arrested and the  explosives seized before the operation was carried out. One of  his partners was also arrested while the third remains a  fugitive.    The source noted that the court sentenced the three to death  after being defended by four lawyers. He said that the  sentences were ratified and then the defendants appealed the  sentences. The appeals were turned down and legally rejected  and, therefore, the sentences became final and due for  implementation.    It is recalled that some foreign radios and news agencies  had  given an inaccurate report on this issue.</p>

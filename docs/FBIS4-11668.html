			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Palestinian National Liberation Movement,  Fatah, accused the occupying forces of working to destroy the  peace process by the premeditated assassination of a number of  its cadres in Gaza. The movement, in a statement yesterday  evening, held Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin responsible  for this crime. The following is the full text of the statement:    In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate, a  statement issued by the Palestinian National Liberation  Movement, Fatah:    The new, hideous massacre that the Israeli forces committed  on 28 March 1994 against a number of cadres and leaders of the  Fatah's movement's organizational action in Gaza -- and which  was carried out by an organized and premeditated plot --  confirms a determination to destroy the peace process.    It was a direct assassination in which targets were picked  out and monitored by special forces in order to hit the  officials in charge of organizing our movement and dealing a  blow to their role of struggle, whether on the peace process  level or on the level of future building and development.    Our movement, Fatah, while stressing its denunciation and  condemnation of the crime targetted against them on the eve of  the Cairo meeting aimed at taking measures to restore security  and stability in Hebron, holds the Israeli Army leadership,  headed by Defense and Prime Minister Rabin, responsible for this  crime.    We also strongly condemn the position the Israelis initially  announced when they believed that those assassinated were  members of Hamas and not Fatah. It is an exposed attempt to  cause a division between Fatah and Hamas, jihad and the popular  movement, al-Fidah, al-Nidal, al-Tahrir al-Filistiniyah, and  others of our people's struggling forces.    The attempt to divide the children of our people through  killings and assassinations is rejected in principle. Our  concern for the blood of the sons of our movement is the same  concern for the blood and lives of all strugglers and all our  struggling, steadfast, and persevering people.    The Israeli Government's praise today of the criminal act  and  the precision of its execution proves Rabin's determination to  impose a de facto situation that will impede the continuing  implemention of measures serving the peace process. It is  trying to impose realities on us that would lead to hammering a  wedge between Palestinians and cause trouble between the  children of our people.    Our condemnation of the forces opposing peace imposes upon  us  the duty to protect our people by all means, including  implementation of Resolution 904, which calls for international  protection for our people, to take all cautionary and  precautionary methods, and to make strong denunciations to put a  limit to those criminal acts that legitimize the spilling of  Palestinian blood. We remind our brothers that we face the same  treatment as our Algerian brothers received by the secret army  movement and the settlers in Algeria. It is being repeated on  our Palestinian land with units of the Israeli Army conniving  with armed settlers. [passage omitted]</p>

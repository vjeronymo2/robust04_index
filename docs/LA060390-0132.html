			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHERE THE WHITE WATER CAN STILL BE FOUND IN THE WEST  </P> <P> Information: White-water rafting trips vary widely in price, depending on the  rafter's age, duration of the trip and accommodations. Free information, advice  and bookings are available by telephoning a consultant at Friends of the River  at (415) 771-0400.  </P> <P> Also, information, including prices and schedules, will be mailed to those who  request them from the Western River Guides Assn. message service at (800)  552-3625.  </P> <P> River Classifications: Rivers are classed by degree of danger and difficulty,  as follows:  </P> <P> Class I: Flowing ripples. No problems for anyone.  </P> <P> Class II: Some rapids, obstacles and small falls, but relatively tame.  </P> <P> Class III: Some major white water, with good drops and obstacles. Children OK  but good guide/expertise required.  </P> <P> Class IV: Strong hydraulics, larger drops, adventurous rapids. Precise  maneuvering requires very experienced guide. Ages 14-up only recommended.  </P> <P> Class V: Violent currents and drops, with danger of capsizing. Advance scouting  advised. Not for novices.  </P> <P> Class VI: Don't even think about it.  </P> <P> The West's Best Rafting Rivers:  </P> <P> South Fork American (Class III): West Coast's most popular rafting river may  not be able to be run all year but will have sufficient flows all summer.  </P> <P> Middle Fork American (Classes III to V): Good flows six days a week. For now,  the power company turns off the water on Sundays.  </P> <P> North Fork American (Class IV): With no upstream reservoir, its flow is  finished for the year.  </P> <P> Kern (Class III-IV): Worthwhile flows will be released through June and July;  August seems doubtful.  </P> <P> Kings (Class III): Would rate Class IV with heavy flows, but still has more  water than any other Sierra river and will be good through June.  </P> <P> Tuolumne (Class IV): Power release schedule indicates it will be strong all  summer. The Cherry Creek portion above the regular run rates V-plus, perhaps  the most challenging run in the state.  </P> <P> Merced (Class III-IV): Will probably shut down in early June. Lower flows  increase the technical challenges.  </P> <P> Main (Old) Fork Stanislaus (Class III): This historic Mother Lode river, quiet  for nine years, is making a comeback, with upstream releases to refill the New  Melones Reservoir. Should be good all summer.  </P> <P> North and Lower Forks Stanislaus (Classes IV-V): Through for the year.  </P> <P> Salmon (California/Class V): Had a short run before trickling out.  </P> <P> Trinity/Burnt Ranch Gorge (Class V): Good through June, OK in July, finished by  August.  </P> <P> Upper Klamath (Class IV): Good through summer, except for two-week closure in  mid-July for power plant maintenance.  </P> <P> Lower Klamath (Class I-II): Backed by large reservoir and mandate to protect  the fishery, will be strong all summer.  </P> <P> Rogue (Class III): Far enough north for good snow pack, and flows supported by  fishery mandates.  </P> <P> Colorado/Grand Canyon (Class I-IV): Generally unaffected by drought years, with  normal releases from Lake Powell.  </P> <P> Colorado/Cataract Canyon (Class III): Should run into August, although lower  flows reduce it from Class IV.  </P> <P> Salmon (Idaho/Class IV): Smaller tributaries down, but main river has always  been able to be run all summer.

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Sell note hits Abbey ABBEY National, the building society turned high street bank which came to the market at 130p a share in July 1989, raced up to an all-time high early yesterday before turning off sharply as UBS Phillips &amp; Drew issued a straight 'sell' recommendation on the stock ahead of this morning's preliminary figures. UBS expects Abbey to record an 8 per cent fall in profits to Pounds 570m. Analysts expect the dividend total to be lifted some 10 per cent to around 11.5p. Following the UBS recommendation the shares retreated to 387p, before staging a late rally and closing only a penny off at 397p. Turnover in the stock totalled 4.8m shares. UBS analyst Mr John Wriglesworth said he recommended the sale of the shares for a number of reasons, chiefly recent outperformance that has seen them outpace the market by 10 per cent in the past two weeks. He added: 'Bad debts will remain a big problem and we do not expect house prices to rise this year. Added to that, Abbey's margins will be squeezed by the commercial banks and mortgage specialists. And they will be hit on the savings side by the government.' Mr Wriglesworth said he expected no pleasant surprises in the figures or at the post-results meeting. Gen Accident firm Recent worries that a big rights issue might be on the way from General Accident tended to fade into the background yesterday, giving shares in the composite insurer a substantial boost. The rights issue fears had been triggered by the fund raising carried out by Commercial Union, which launched a Pounds 450m-plus rights issue and the Pounds 100m bond issue made by Royal Insurance. GA closed a net 26 higher at 595p, a rise of 4.6 per cent, compared with the 0.5 per cent rise in the market and a 2.5 per cent increase in the composite insurance sub-sector. The company's preliminary figures are expected this morning, with the market range extending from a Pounds 20m to a Pounds 45m loss, compared with last year's deficit of Pounds 172m. Analysts said the figures could reveal a strong improvement in results from motor insurance following rate increases. Tate &amp; Lyle weak The news that the chief executive at UK sweeteners group Tate &amp; Lyle was to leave the company caused the stock to buck the strong market trend. At the day's worst the shares were down 7 at 430p, although dealers said there was no significant selling at the lower levels. Bargain hunting, together with the strong market, helped the shares recover some of the earlier fall and they closed 3 off at 434p after trade of 2.5m. Several analysts were concerned that the departure signalled deeper trading worries at the group. There was no shortage of strong performers in the financial areas of the market. Standard Chartered delivered another good showing, climbing 17 more to 685p, the highest level since the great crash of October 1987. Standard is scheduled to report preliminary figures on March 10. Lloyds rose 9 to 528p, albeit in relatively light trade. Barclays ended a fraction harder at 425p as the market continued the debate over whether the dividend will be cut on Thursday when the full-year figures are released. The probable flotation of some of its insurance subsidiaries saw Hambros Bank edge up 3 to 316p. A Smith New Court buy recommendation helped Prudential move ahead strongly to finish 8 1/2 up at 324p. Other life shares also did well, Lloyds Abbey closing 4 1/2 ahead at 426p and Legal &amp; General 4 better at 475p. Composite insurances attracted keen buying across the board. Guardian Royal, reporting preliminaries tomorrow, settled 6 higher at 193p. Sun Alliance rose 10 to 333p. Continuing fears that the March 10 figures will see the dividend cut failed to prevent a bounce in Willis Corroon, which ended 5 firmer at 185p. Lloyd Thompson, regarded as the best quality stock in the smaller insurance brokers, advanced 9 more to 290p. Confirmation that Airtours was to raise its offer for its bid target Owners Abroad to 135p a share saw the stock of both companies gain further strength, as several market watchers came to the view that the new offer might be just high enough to clinch the deal. Owners closed 3 up at 134p xd, while Airtours also firmed 3, to 309p, Mr Hamish Dixon at Hoare Govett said: 'I believe the improved offer represents fair value and the bid now stands a better chance of success.' A press suggestion that both Rank Organisation and Carlton Communications may soon face stiff competition for their video copying operations hurt the shares of both companies as each made a dividend payout. Shares in Rank gave up 20 to 667p xd, while those in Carlton retreated 19 to 778p xd. Analysts were, however, sceptical, saying it is an old story, and one said: 'If it is plausible it is a long way off.' Thorn EMI continued Friday's bounce, shrugging off recent weakness, and added 17 at 859p. British Gas touched an all-time high of 303p before easing back to close a net 3 1/2 up at 301 1/2 p, after the call by Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, for a break-up of the company into 12 independently owned regional gas supply companies. De La Rue staged a strong rally after the recent bout of weakness, closing a net 18 higher at 672p. BT moved up 5 1/2 more to 423 1/2 p, with marketmakers sensing that the campaign to sell the government's remaining 21.8 per cent stake - labelled BT III - is beginning to warm up. Ferranti was the market's most heavily traded stock, with 21m shares changing hands following strong hints that the group will be a major beneficiary of the huge Al-Yamamah defence contract with Saudi Arabia. Ferranti closed 1 1/2 firmer at 15 1/4 p. Electrocomponents climbed 8 to 383p and Farnell 3 to 360p after Hoare Govett reaffirmed its strong buy stance on both stocks and upgraded its profits forecast for the latter. Citing good growth in sales during the past six months, Hoare increased its current year forecast for Farnell from Pounds 56m to Pounds 59m and that for next year from Pounds 59m to Pounds 62m. Shares in engineering company James Wilkes jumped 18 to 66p in heavy trading of 2.2m shares as speculation of a bid from Suter swept through the market. Shortly after the market close, it was announced that Suter had indeed been the day's big buyer and now has an 8.9 per cent stake in the engineering group. It said, however, that it had taken no further decisions about further action. Shares in Suter closed unchanged at 135p. Favourable weekend press comment boosted TI Group and the shares moved 8 ahead to 298p in trade of 2m. Shares in British Aerospace were weak and closed at 261p xd as analysts reflected on Friday afternoon's meeting with the company, the second meeting following last week's results. One aerospace watcher reflected: 'The company still has a lot to do with little room to manouevre given the poor balance sheet.' Rolls-Royce eased 1 1/2 to 132p in sympathy. The view that Cadbury Schweppes was not about to buy chocolate maker Terrys, funding the acquisition through a rights issue, continued to gain ground and the shares hardened 5 to 471p, with turnover reaching 3.9m by the close. Many expect good results when the group reports figures next week, but several analysts remain negative and have suggested that current year earnings are likely to suffer as a result of a large rise in raw material prices. Among the food retailers, Hillsdown Holdings and Wm Morrison Supermarkets were wanted. The former, which reports figures next week, added 3 at 161p and the latter gained 3 at 161p.

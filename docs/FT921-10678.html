			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / UK Company News: List of buyers grows for Macdonald Publishing A NUMBER of US and UK publishers have bid for Macdonald Publishing, Maxwell Communication Corporation's loss-making UK publishing company. The list is believed to include Little Brown, the Boston publishing group, Simon &amp; Shuster, Random Century, and Headline and Orion, the company recently set up by Mr Anthony Cheetham, who was forced out of Random last November. Mr Anthony Lomas of Price Waterhouse, the MCC administrator, is hoping to complete a sale within the next two weeks. Macdonald, whose list includes literary biographies, Catherine Cookson novels and Enid Blyton's Noddy books, was in a particularly vulnerable position because it owed its parent Pounds 33m and had been incurring losses of more than Pounds 1m a year. The company said it was trading normally and was virtually up to date with its February printing schedule in spite of the disruption caused by the collapse of the Maxwell empire.</p>

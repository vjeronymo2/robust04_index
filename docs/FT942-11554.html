			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Arts: A misguided 'Weekend' - Theatre Most of Michael Palin's first play, The Weekend, feels just like a TV sitcom; and there's the rub. The TV sitcom gives us the same sit., milked for the same kind of com., week in, week out. Audiences know the way they will laugh, and love the way it caters to their expectations. In particular, they know how they will laugh at One Foot in the Grave; and The Weekend is principally a vehicle for that series's star, Richard Wilson, giving him a not dissimilar role (Stephen) with not dissimilar humour. The basic sit. here is one we have all watched umpteen times - the relatives come for the weekend, the neighbours come for dinner, the family plays Scrabble - and most of the jokes lie in the sarcasm and ill temper displayed by Stephen, the reluctant host. This is Comedy of Vituperation. (One scene begins with Stephen saying, about the impending arrival of his own daughter, son-in-law and granddaughter, 'Maybe the A37 will have been mined by the Iraqis'.) Some touches are uniquely Palin. I love Charlotte (Joanna Forest), the cleaning-lady who prides herself on her left-wing credentials. Of her late mother she says 'She knew all the Fabians; she ironed for Rebecca West.' But Charlotte is the only character with the comic bizarrerie we associate with Palin; and we only see her once. Like so much else here, she is introduced for instant comic effect, and then forgotten. How disappointing to find the author of A Fish Called Wanda and A Private Function writing so conventional a comedy; and so creakily constructed a play. Act One has too many separate scenes, and some of them have no dramatic substance - just jokes. Of course I laughed at some of the lines - eg Stephen's Coward-like description of his wife's bitter lemon: 'Spinstery little poison; it reeks of disapproval'  - but the comic rhythm built up by a succession of one-liners is wearisome. There is, mind you, a twist. After two hours of increasingly unpleasant bile, Stephen lowers his defences to his wife, and reveals why he is so nasty (Palin trying to dig deeper than sitcom.) But Stephen's justification  -the classic self-loathing of the alcoholic - emerges with no great struggle. In the play's final scene (the next morning) Stephen has already begun to make the tea - ie to reform. How neat; how cosy. There is, of course, real daring in the way Wilson never plays for sweetness, making so much of his own venom. And he negotiates the switch from aggression into confessional with exemplary tact. He is almost a comic Jimmy Porter; or a cousin of Basil Fawlty. Yet he is less substantial a character; too obviously johnny-one-note. Angela Thorne, as his longsuffering classy wife Virginia, is pleasant without ever attempting anything we have not seen her achieve before. Marcia Warren does wonders with the neighbour Bridget. 'I love York,' she says bravely over drinks , and adds a little forced smile. 'Terribly, terribly . . . historical. Harrogate's very nice too.' Jonathan Coy handles the embarrassment of the son-in-law Alan extremely well and Julie Peasgood is gamely amiable as daughter Diana, the play's dullest role. Robin Lefevre, directing, has achieved fine ensemble and pacing. The comedy moves jerkily from joke to joke - and too smoothly past its confessional climax - but that, alas, is its playwright's fault. At the Strand Theatre, WC2</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] New details have been revealed today of Bonn's  efforts to change the guidelines on German arms exports.  According to these details, the government, too, is seeking to  make arms exports easier. According to information obtained by  our Bonn office, talks on this have been conducted between the  Defense, Economics, and Foreign Ministries. Yesterday the  Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU]  parliamentary group spoke in favor of easing the export  provisions. The Social Democratic Party announced its  resistance to this. Gerd H. Pelletier reports.    [Pelletier] One day after the move forward by CDU deputies  toward relaxing the arms export provisions, today it was  revealed that the ministries concerned -- defense, economics,  and foreign -- have been dealing with the European harmonization  of the tricky issue for weeks already. The confidential file  has lain at the Federal Chancellery since before the Christmas  period. It says that a ruling on dual-use exports is urgent.  For example, we have the case of the Libyan toxic gas factory  in Rabta, which the German company Imhausen Chemie claimed was a  fertilizer plant. When the deal was uncovered, company head  Hippenstiel was sentenced and regulations on granting export  permits were tightened drastically. All-European guidelines are  being called for in this area. But Ruehe's Defense Ministry  also wants to make it easier for the arms industry to export.    Kinkel's Foreign Ministry, however, would prefer to adhere  to  the Arms Export Control Act of 1982. For example, if the  British partners require the future Eurofighter to be  desertworthy, the German manufacturing partners will know that  it was to be sold outside the NATO area. Must our arms export  restrictions be relaxed for that reason?    [Begin Kinkel recording] For some time we have been  considering in the responsible ministries -- in cooperation  between the Foreign Ministry and the Defense Ministry -- how we  can deal with this sticky issue. We mustn't rush at it. We  will look at the CDU/CSU proposals, which have now been  submitted, in addition to our own ideas, and then decide in good  time. [end recording]    [Pelletier] The arms industry does not want to wait that  long. European reality: The company Eurocopter is a DASA  enterprise with French majority ownership. The German partners  cannot and do not want to know where the French parent company,  Aerospatiale, is selling the combat helicopters. Whatever  happens, it is thought less likely that the European partners  will give in to the cautious German arms export restrictions in  the short or long term. It is more likely that the compromise  will lie in the gradual relaxing of these German provisions.</p>

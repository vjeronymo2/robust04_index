			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Observer: Fail-safe Only in Italy can a transport minister, who fails his driving test, be hailed as some sort of folk hero. One of the very first things that Italy's new transport minister, Raffaele Costa, did on taking up his post was to sit his country's new written driving test along with the rest of his 54-strong parliamentary Transport Commission. He had been deluged with complaints about trick questions and the general difficulty of the examination. So he took the 30-question test, requiring answers of true or false, and got eight questions wrong. No more than four mistakes are allowed if a person is to pass. Costa blames the exam rather than his lack of road knowledge and promises to simplify the questionnaire. His growing band of supporters is hoping that his next posting might be to Italy's finance ministry where he will be required to take on an even more daunting challenge - filling in an Italian tax form without making a mistake.</p>

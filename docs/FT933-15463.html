			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: Acom an acronym for moderation - A cautionary tale of Japanese consumer lending IN explaining the principles of his consumer finance company, Mr Kyosuke Kinoshita, president of Acom, displays the Japanese love of lofty sentiment. It is, he suggests, all in the name: 'A' stands for affection, 'CO' for confidence, and the 'M' for moderate. Regardless of whether Japanese-speaking customers understand the acronym's nuances, the emphasis on caring and confidence is an understandable reaction by Mr Kinoshita against the image of an industry once famed for extortionate interest rates and gangland loan officers. Acom, and two other large consumer finance companies, Promise and Sanyo Shinpan Finance, will help the industry take another large step towards respectability by listing on Tokyo's over-the-counter market in coming weeks. The move will also be a test of strength for the Tokyo stock market. The emphasis on 'moderation' has become even heavier in the aftermath of the boom lending era of the late 1980s, when even venerable Japanese banks lent heavily to less-than-respectable property developers and stock speculators, leaving them with a pile of non-performing loans. Mr Kinoshita said his company, founded in 1978, was careful in its lending during the late 1980s. Property-related loans account for an estimated 7.7 per cent of Acom's total lending, which at the end of March was Y586.3bn (Dollars 5.47bn), an increase of 9.4 per cent over a year earlier. Consumer lending by risk-conscious banks fell 3.2 per cent in the last fiscal year. 'We have a risk system called Man and Machine. We have all the important data in our machines, but it will be the man who finally decides on the loan,' Mr Kinoshita said. 'We check very closely as to why a person needs money. We explain to them what it means to accept credit.' Acom, which estimates that non-performing loans totalled Y17.6bn at end-March, needs this sort of strong screening process since 88.6 per cent of lending is unsecured personal loans. And its collateral-backed business is directly linked to asset markets badly bruised by three years of falling prices. The collateral includes property, securities, paintings and golf club memberships, for which there is a large market in Japan. Share prices are still half their level of December 1989, to judge by the Nikkei average, and the price index for golf memberships has fallen even further. Property prices are still weak. Acom, which also has video, compact disc and furniture rental shops, is retreating from the art-backed lending market, with loans down from Y4.3bn in 1990 to Y600m last year. However, it still retains an obvious interest in fine art - a Renoir, a Matisse and a Monet hang in one of its conference rooms. Atasteful array of French Impressionists is intended to show that the company is very different to the sarakin companies, the last-resort lending shops of the 1970s, whose unsavoury practices prompted the finance ministry to limit interest rates in 1983. Apart from distancing his company from the sarakin, Mr Kinoshita's emphasis on educating customers is also a response to a surge in personal bankruptcies in Japan, particularly among the young. Court filings for bankruptcy rose almost 80 per cent last year. Acom produces a 'money plan' handbook, its cover showing an ideal young couple in the company of a red sports car. Inside there is guidance on 'having a happy life', a cautionary tale about the high costs of consumers' brand consciousness, and an explanation of the importance of planning finances. 'Japan is the same as other countries. There are some people who understand credit and other people who don't,' Mr Kinoshita said. He sees potential for increased lending in regional Japan, where, he says, the effects of the economic downturn are not as noticeable, and competition from larger commercial banks is less intense. There is, however, debate among government economists over whether the downturn in regional areas may be less severe, but longer-lasting, than that of larger cities. Acom's lending to customers outside the Tokyo and Osaka districts accounts for 54 per cent of total lending, while 313 of its 601 offices are in provincial areas. 'I don't think the Japanese economy has yet hit the bottom, but I hope that the next few months will be brighter. The political confusion may delay a recovery. Before this crisis, I thought the recovery would come in the autumn,' said Mr Kinoshita. The timing of the stock market listing, expected to be formally approved next month, will partly depend on the health of the Tokyo market. Investors' response to the listing will be a measure of the industry's attempts to rehabilitate itself, and of perceptions of the company's exposure to the excesses of the late 1980s. 'We have to be careful how we refer to the listing, as only God knows when it will take place. In the end, the market will determine the day.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Morning News" program] </F>   [Text] The municipal government recently made a decision  on strengthening agriculture and developing the rural economy,  under which governments at various levels will be urged to  follow the overall economic guidance and genuinely place  agriculture in a top position, by conscientiously mapping and  carrying out concrete implementation measures to bring the  suburban, rural economy to a new level. The decision consists  of 30 clauses in six parts, namely: (1) Stabilize the  agricultural base by increasing investment; (2) intensify work  on the "vegetable basket" project to ensure urban market supply;  (3) ensure all-around development of the rural economy to  realistically increase peasants' incomes; (4) deepen reform of  the agricultural economy to meet the requirements of a market  economy; (5) persist in actively developing high-yield  agriculture through scientific and technological progress; and  (6) strengthen leadership over rural work by introducing the  administrative chief responsibility system. The decision  emphasizes the necessity of maintaining acreage of grain and  oil-bearing crops and their total production volume, adding that  no one is permitted to arbitrarily change the land use of  protected grain and oil-bearing crop cultivation areas or occupy  them to guarantee fulfillment of contractual state procurement  of grain and oil- bearing crops, and self sufficiency of grain  and oil among suburban peasants. The decision distinctly  imposes a responsibility system under which both county and  district chiefs will be responsible for the production of grain,  oil-bearing crops, and nonstaple food; whereas district chiefs  will be responsible for supplying grain, oil-bearing crops,  vegetables, and nonstaple food to downtown areas. Annual  evaluations will be conducted, the results of which will serve  as an important criterion in gauging leading cadres'  performances.</p>

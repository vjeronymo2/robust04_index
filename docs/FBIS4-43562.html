			<p>BFN     [Text] Regarding the French proposal to intervene in  Rwanda, Paris is still awaiting the backing of the UN Security  Council. A draft resolution is to be presented next week to the  United Nations. This morning, President Francois Mitterrand  spoke in Paris at a UNESCO conference. He supported the idea of  French humanitarian intervention in Rwanda. The French  president said the situation requires urgent measures, even if  the United Nations does not give its blessing to the operation:    [Begin Mitterrand recording] We can no longer wait. Everyone  can see that. There remain a few hospitals, churches, some  sites where not everyone has been massacred. It is therefore  the extreme urgency of the situation which pressed Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe to say that without waiting for the arrival  of the UN force, France, together with those of its European or  African partners who might be willing to help, is prepared to  send a humanitarian protection force aimed at ensuring the  security of the civilian population which has so far avoided  extermination.    This is being organized, it is now a matter of hours or  days.  This is the point we have reached. I must say that two or three  African countries have replied positively, and we are still  waiting for firm responses from European countries. Whatever  happens, we'll do it. I repeat: every hour counts. [end  recording]</p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD SERIES;  </P> <P> OAKLAND ATHLETICS VS. SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS;  </P> <P> PLAYERS ASSN. BACKS UP COMMISSIONER;  </P> <P> UNION: EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR DONALD FEHR SUPPORTS VINCENT'S DECISION TO RESUME THE  WORLD SERIES.  </P> <P> Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent's decision to resume the World Series next  Tuesday at Candlestick Park drew the support of the Major League Baseball  Players Assn., which is noteworthy in that no World Series can be played  without players.  </P> <P> "It certainly seems like the thing to do," said Donald Fehr, executive director  of the players association. "Nobody wants to pull (the World Series) down  unless it's absolutely necessary. Once the appropriate research was done and  the appropriate evaluations made, this is the most logical course to take."  </P> <P> Fehr sat in on Vincent's final meeting before Wednesday's announcement was  made, discussing options with officials from the San Francisco Giants, Oakland  Athletics and both leagues.  </P> <P> Fehr apparently did little more in the meeting than nod in approval of the  commissioner's ruling.  </P> <P> "This is not a situation where people are going to have a lot of different  opinions," Fehr said. "The lead was going to taken by the commissioner's  office. We didn't play a role, if that's your choice of words.  </P> <P> "It's appropriate, at this stage, to make every effort to cooperate with the  commissioner. . . . Given the circumstances, I think this result absolutely  compels itself."  </P> <P> At no time during the meeting was the subject of moving the World Series out of  the Bay Area broached, according to Fehr.  </P> <P> "Those are circumstances you don't want to consider unless there are no other  alternatives," he said. "We're far from there yet.  </P> <P> "After listening to a series of reporters, it appears we'll be able to finish  it here -- hopefully, beginning on Tuesday."  </P> <P> But should it be finished here? The damage and loss of life caused by Tuesday's  earthquake has been staggering, but Fehr said he believes the World Series  deserves to go on, saying baseball can serve as a salve to the stricken Bay  Area community.  </P> <P> "I think everybody wants to see how fast we can recover," he said.  </P> <P> Of course, with winning player shares expected to exceed $90,000 a man should a  complete best-of-seven series be played, there are more considerations here.  </P> <P> Fehr said he had only "indirect" contact with the Oakland and San Francisco  player representatives, Carney Lansford of the A's and Brett Butler of the  Giants, partly because of the limited phone access within the Bay Area.  </P> <P> "It was harder to talk to people locally than it usually is by long distance,"  Fehr said. "(But) my office was in contact with both player representatives."  </P> <P> And their input?  </P> <P> "They essentially had the same questions we all had," Fehr said. "They wanted  to make sure it would be safe and appropriate to play again by next Tuesday."  </P> <P> Fehr also said the players' association, in accordance with the A's and Giants  and ABC television, is planning to make a donation to aid in the relief of the  Bay Area, although he declined to mention a specific figure.  </P> <P> The A's and Giants are both expected to resume workouts today, preparing for a  third World Series game that will be held nine days after the second.  </P> <P> Fehr was asked about the interest level in such a game -- for both players and  fans -- considering the events that have transpired in the interim. "I would  think it will be high," he replied. "People here want to return to normalcy as  soon as we can."  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> OXNARD DROPS BUSING PLAN  </P> <P> Oxnard School District trustees decided to dismantle an 18-year-old,  court-ordered busing plan despite objections from parents and teachers. School  board members, who approved the move by a 3-2 vote, argued that returning to  neighborhood schools will save money and stem white flight in the district,  where the Anglo population has been dropping steadily over the last two  decades. The new plan's opponents contended that it will result in a return to  segregated schools. Oxnard was one of five California cities under a U.S.  District Court mandate to integrate its schools, but the district won a  judicial release from the order in 1987.  </P></p>

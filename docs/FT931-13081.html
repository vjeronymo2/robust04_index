			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Money Markets: Franc futures tumble FRENCH FRANC futures suffered a dramatic fall yesterday, as dealers started to believe that Germany and France would not ease policy as quickly as had been expected, writes James Blitz. The prospects for an immediate and sharp easing in short-term German rates seemed a little more distant yesterday morning, after two weeks of optimism, and this was reflected in higher cash rates for French francs. There were several reasons for bearishness in France. First, the Bank of France kept its officially posted short-term money rates unchanged at its weekly Monday intervention. There had been strong speculation about an easing, now that the French franc is under less pressure in the European Monetary System. Talks on public sector pay between the German government and the oTV trade union also broke down at the weekend - and this could make the Bundesbank more reluctant to cut short term rates. The 1.0 percentage point monthly rise in December's rate of inflation in North-Rhine Westphalia, appears to have depressed some investors, as did the figure for M3 money supply in December, which was up 8.8 per cent on the year. However, some analysts described both figures as far better than the market could have hoped for. All these factors combined to push the March French franc contract down a remarkable 53 basis points, to close at 89.75, as dealers wondered how quickly France will be able to cut rates. This closing level prices 3-month money in two months time at 10.25 per cent. Three month French francs also firmed sharply to 12 1/4 per cent from around 11 3/4 per cent last Friday. One dealer said: 'There must now be pressure on the Bank of France to pass the interest rate rises onto the commercial sector.' In the sterling market, a shortage of Pounds 2.3bn helped push short term money rates higher, in spite of a growing feeling that there will be an early cut in UK base rates. Three-month money closed  1/4 per cent higher on the day at around 7 1/16 per cent. Several dealers said that they had been surprised that the weekend press had not issued strong calls for more cuts in interest rates. This dampened some of the bullishness that had been seen at the end of last week.</p>

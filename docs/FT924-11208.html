			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Observer: Replacing homo Lucas It used to be said in the City there were two types of men; homo sapiens and homo Lucas. Lucas Industries' reputation for inbred management has once again reared its head with the departure of Tony Edwards, who was to have taken over from Sir Anthony Gill as chief executive at the end of the year. In 1989 Lucas brought in two senior managers from the outside; David Hankinson as finance director and Tony Edwards as head of the aerospace division. Shortly, both will have gone. The 62-year-old Sir Anthony is chairman and chief executive, and has effectively been acting as finance director while a replacement for Hankinson was found. In the year in which he would normally have been expected to retire he has also taken on an extra non-executive directorship, at Tarmac. Quite why the board changed its view about the flamboyant Edwards is not clear - though the turn of events may give some quiet satisfaction to Hankinson. Some analysts believe he did not think Edwards was yet ready for the top job, and he left a month after Edwards was confirmed as Sir Anthony's heir apparent. How have the non-executive directors acquitted themselves in all this? Sir Anthony has lined up a formidable array - several through headhunters rather than anything smacking of the old boy network. Six out of ten board members are independent, with a depth and variety of experience ranging from Sir Colin Southgate to senior Credit Lyonnais banker Philippe Souviron. It looks like an ideal Cadbury prescription - but for all that the management succession is less than ideal.</p>

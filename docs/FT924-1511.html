			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt falls back as VW warns of big losses Individual stocks featured in senior bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT continued its painful revision of carmakers' prospective earnings and dividends, and current market ratings. Volkswagen fell DM9 to DM235.50, and Daimler DM6.40 to DM506.60 as the DAX index closed a relatively modest 9.17 lower at 1,472.07. Turnover eased to DM3.5bn from DM3.7m, VW trading in DM225m after DM125m as it talked of substantial fourth quarter losses, effectively confirmed that it will cut this year's dividend and indicated that 1993 could be a good deal worse. Mr Bob Barber, who heads the automotive and capital goods team at James Capel, said that he now expected earnings per share from VW of only DM9 against DM36 in 1991, and forecast a DM400m loss for 1993, with the dividend falling from DM11, through DM6 for this year to DM4. PARIS weakened late in the session on news that Societe Generale was to increase its base rate to 10 per cent from 9.45 per cent from today. The bank said that the increase followed the recent rise in money market rates because of the franc's weakness in the last few weeks. The CAC-40 index closed down 8.10 at 1,736.69, off the day's high of 1,757.45, in turnover of some FFr2.7bn. Societe Generale rose FFr5 on the news to FFr578 while Paribas recovered some of its losses to end down 80 centimes at FFr333. Suez closed down FFr2.50 at FFr231.50. Peugeot dipped FFr5 to FFr555 after the group forecast a 4 per cent fall in European car sales, and Volkswagen warned of larger-than-expected fourth quarter losses. MILAN reversed weakness earlier this week in privatisation stocks, BCI recovering L145 to L4,179, Credito Italiano L224 to L2,735 and Nuovo Pignone L250 to L4,520, the last two strengthening further to L2,875 and L4,620 respectively on the kerb. The Comit index, however, rose only 2.07 to 406.32 amid political nervousness generated by the Craxi affair and the ruling parties' rebuff in local elections. Rinascente soared, closing with a session gain of L685 or 11 per cent to L7,025, and to L7,200 after hours. The Fiat group retailer has been at centre of speculation about a possible sale for some time. ZURICH's SMI index rose nearly 1 per cent, closing 18.8 higher at 2,023.9 in moderate volume. Dealers said that window-dressing of year-end accounts by some brokers was behind some of the day's late buying. BRUSSELS saw some gains in the financial sector with SGB putting on BFr15 to BFr1,810. The Bel-20 index gained 5.22 to 1,106.35. Petrofina, which suffered a 6 per cent fall on Tuesday after announcing that it would cut its dividend 50 per cent, fell a further BFr50 to BFr7,440. Solvay bucked the trend with a gain of BFr150 to BFr11,200. STOCKHOLM saw Astra weakening further following a disappointing analysts' meeting earlier in the week. The Affarsvarlden index shed 14.35 to 864.75 with Astra free shares slipping SKr21 to SKr711. OSLO continued to weaken as high interest rates depressed sentiment. The all share index fell 4.57 to 372.08 in turnover of NKr202m. Among actives Kvaerner A shares lost NKr1 to NKr147, Bergesen A fell NKr3 to NKr98, and Elkem slid NKr3 to NKr28. AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency Index closed 0.4 lower at 103.1. ING put on 50 cents to Fl 53.50 with overseas interest being seen. Elsewhere in the financial sector Aegon fell 80 cents to Fl 72.70 and Amev lost 50 cents to Fl 58.30. VIENNA lost ground after Creditanstalt announced that it planned to cut its 1992 dividend to 6 per cent from 15 per cent in 1991. The ATX index closed down 13.04 or 1.7 per cent at 738.77 while Creditanstalt preferred shares fell Sch14 to Sch421.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- December 16                                         THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           Open         10.30        11.00       12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1032.57       1033.48      1033.41     1035.18 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1111.83       1111.37      1112.53     1113.25  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes          13.00         14.00        15.00       Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1035.66       1036.52      1038.11     1036.62 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1114.79       1114.78      1118.33     1117.67  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Dec 15    Dec 14    Dec 11    Dec 10     Dec 9  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1038.14   1041.18   1044.03   1049.63   1054.06 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1115.23   1116.33   1117.72   1123.58   1133.46  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1038.94; 200 - 1118.33 Low/day: 100 - 1032.47 200 - 1110.58  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

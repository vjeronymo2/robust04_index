If the 1995 presidential elections were held tomorrow, the  incumbent president would obtain 49 percent of the votes, while  Javier Perez de Cuellar would obtain 40 percent. The survey  also shows that only 28 percent of those polled knew what Perez  de Cuellar did for a living.    The POP survey focuses on the ideas voters have about  Fujimori and Perez de Cuellar as presidential candidates for  1995.

They believe the former UN  secretary general has "greater international prestige."</p>

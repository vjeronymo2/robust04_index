			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Threat of split in Japanese faction THE largest faction of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP) was in danger of splitting last night as a former chief cabinet secretary, Mr Keizo Obuchi, was formally chosen as its chairman in spite of continuing opposition to his appointment. Mr Obuchi, 55, is supposed to replace the fallen LDP 'godfather', Mr Shin Kanemaru, who resigned last week. But he will have far less control over the faction than his predecessor and could be quickly replaced in an attempt to keep the 109-member faction together. The selection followed a plea yesterday from Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, for the faction members to reach a conclusion quickly, as the continuing negotiations had been mocked by the Japanese media and inspired protests in front of the party's offices. Mr Miyazawa was particularly concerned that Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, has spent the last week in hotel rooms arguing over the choice of his faction's leader, instead of focusing on the weakening Japanese economy or the troubled banking system. The finance minister is at the centre of the dispute, as he and Mr Ichiro Ozawa, two of the faction's most influential officials, opposed Mr Obuchi and boycotted the announcement of his appointment late last night. Mr Ozawa, a former LDP secretary general, was chosen by Mr Kanemaru as his successor and has wide support from younger members of the faction, who were not directly involved in the appointment of the new chairman. He argued that the five of eight senior officers who chose Mr Obuchi were merely following orders from Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former prime minister, who claims credit for founding the faction and is attempting to reassert his authority. Mr Kanemaru resigned after a month of controversy over his having received a Y500m (Pounds 2.5m) donation from a scandal-tainted parcel delivery company, Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, in violation of the Political Funds Control Law. His resignation was prompted by the public outcry over his lenient treatment by prosecutors, who fined him only Y200,000 and did not directly question him. The lingering dispute over the succession has encouraged further public debate over the role of the LDP's factions, which are small parties in themselves with their own office buildings and staff.</p>

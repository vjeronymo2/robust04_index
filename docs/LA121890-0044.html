			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> MISTRIAL DECLARED IN MURDER CASE  </P> <P> A Ventura County Superior Court judge Monday declared a mistrial for  child-murder defendant Gregory Scott Smith and appointed new lawyers for him  after Smith's public defenders said they also represent a key prosecution  witness in the case.  </P> <P> Because of the conflict of interest, Judge Steven Z. Perren ordered the  dismissal of 72 potential jurors who were already qualified to hear the  death-penalty case.  </P> <P> Smith, 23, of Canoga Park, was to have been tried Jan. 8 on charges of murder,  kidnaping and arson in the death of 8-year-old Paul Bailly of Northridge, whose  gagged and burned body was found in a field near Simi Valley on March 23 after  his disappearance that morning.  </P> <P> Jury selection was to have continued Monday. But Perren's order effectively  postponed the trial until the spring, allowing the new court-appointed defense  attorneys, James M. Farley and Willard P. Wiksell of Ventura, time to prepare.  </P> <P> The conflict that prompted the mistrial involved Tracy Ray Prell, 26, of Simi  Valley, a jailhouse informant in the Smith case who is serving a two-year  sentence for misdemeanor battery and obstructing a peace officer.  </P> <P> The public defender's office has represented Prell in the past and would be  forbidden from cross-examining him at trial, said Assistant Public Defender  Duane Dammeyer.

To this end, the Act directs the Secretary of Agriculture to promulgate regulations establishing standards for the use and development of private land within the HCNRA and grants the Secretary limited condemnation authority to address situations where the standards are not met. The purpose of this subpart is to establish standards that would guide the Secretary's consideration of the use of the limited condemnation authority granted by the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Scope. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The regulations in this subpart establish standards applicable to all private property within the boundaries of the HCNRA, including that within the boundaries of the Rapid, Snake, and Imnaha Wild and Scenic Rivers and the Hells Canyon Wilderness. The regulations in this subpart do not operate to restrict the use and development of private property; rather, they serve to inform the landowner of those uses that are compatible with purposes for which the HCNRA was established. Uses not compatible with these standards could result in the Secretary acquiring land or interests therein without a landowner's consent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations in this subpart, in and of themselves, do not effect a taking of private property, including valid, existing water rights, nor do the standards established in this subpart limit or restrict a private landowner's property use that is compatible with the purposes of the Act. The Responsible Official may use the regulations in this subpart solely to determine whether private land uses or developments are compatible with the purposes and direction of the Act and, if not, to determine whether the Secretary should consider initiating condemnation proceedings to acquire land or scenic easements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;292.21  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Definitions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the purposes of this subpart, the following terms are defined: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Act <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refers to the act of December 31, 1975, which established the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area (89 Stat. 1117; 16 U.S.C. 460gg&hyph;460gg&hyph;13). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Archaeological sites <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  are those sites containing relics, artifacts, and other evidence of past human cultures including historic properties as defined by the National Historic Preservation Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Commercial land <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is land within the HCNRA developed for commercial purposes as of June 13, 1994 and which is assigned to the commercial land category (&sect;292.22). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Condemnation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is the acquisition of lands or interests therein by the Secretary without the consent of the owner.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] A draft new constitution of the Komi republic was  the main subject of discussion at a meeting of the parliament's  presidium with an increased number of participants. The draft  tries to combine in the new basic law the principles of  territorial sovereignty on the basis of Russian federalism. The  articles on freedoms of citizens are being amended to bring them  in line with universally accepted norms. A program for  implementing the law on the Komi republic's state languages  caused debates. The majority of lawmakers regarded a list of  posts that require the knowledge of two languages, Russian and  Komi, as a limitation of civil rights. No agreement was reached  on a list of the premises that should be equipped with systems  for simultaneous translation at the expense of the budget. A  decision was adopted on selling oil shares to people residing in  oil-extracting regions on a preferential basis for money and  vouchers. A strict provision on a procedure for holding  competition for the right to use Komi natural resources was  approved.</p>

			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> BACALL: BROADWAY'S APPEAL LOST  </P> <P> Tony Award-winning actress Lauren Bacall says the theater is still her first  love, but Broadway just isn't the same anymore and she'd rather work in smaller  venues outside New York.  </P> <P> Bacall complained during a talk at Town Hall here Monday that Broadway's  emphasis on reviving old hits in recent years has limited opportunities for  actors.  </P> <P> "I'm tired of revivals. I would rather be on stage in Chicago or in a good  repertory theater in Seattle than be doing some of the things available on  Broadway," she said.  </P> <P> Bacall, who won Tonys for "Applause" and "Woman of the Year," credited her late  husband Humphrey Bogart for her success. He starred opposite her in her first  movie, "To Have and Have Not," in 1944.  </P> <P> "Bogie was the best teacher I had," she said. "He showed me the ropes. Until I  met him, I believed everything I read."  </P></p>

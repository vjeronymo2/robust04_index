			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Mr Continuity set to succeed Salinas The atmosphere at the headquarters of Mexico's ruling party on Sunday night was jubilant; Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the former party leader and favourite of the rank and file, had defeated his rivals to be declared the nominee to succeed President Carlos Salinas next year. While competitors for the nomination may have higher intellectual reputations, none enjoyed Mr Colosio's broad party support, his mix of technical and political skills, nor had they shown such unwavering loyalty to Mr Salinas's economic and political goals. In the end such qualities won the 43-year-old social development minister the presidential nomination, which is traditionally in the gift of the outgoing president. With the Institutional Revolutionary Party in power for the last 64 consecutive years, and more popular than six years ago, Mr Colosio is overwhelming favourite to become president after the election next August. Mr Colosio's total fidelity to the current president and reticence in public about his own ideas have raised questions about whether he has the independence of mind to lead Mexico into the next century. 'It is a huge mystery what he believes in,' said one ministerial colleague from a rival team before his nomination. The minister, like others, argued that Mr Colosio's lack of enemies indicated that he was afraid of making tough decisions. Some question Mr Colosio's record in government, which over the last year has consisted mainly in spending a lot of money on public works projects. But in his acceptance speech on Sunday, Mr Colosio did give some clues as to how he would govern Mexico. He strongly endorsed Mr Salinas's pro-market economic policies: 'I have seen the social cost of mistaken policies and the awakening of hope from correct policies,' he said. 'Discipline in public finance has come never to leave again.' Mr Colosio pledged himself to a continuation of Mr Salinas's anti-poverty programme, which he said would become the backbone of the new government. Many have criticised the programme, including, privately, at least one cabinet member, as too centralised around the president and responsive to political rather than social development needs. The greatest change from Mr Salinas may lie in Mr Colosio's attitude to the capital and the regions. Mr Salinas's economic revolution has been top-down and highly centralised. Governors who have fallen out of favour have been dismissed and states given almost no power to raise their own money. Mr Colosio is from the agricultural north of Mexico, from a small village, Magdalena de Kino in Sonora, not far from the border with Arizona. He is thought to find Mexico City and its domination of Mexico stifling and unhealthy. He says he will give more independence to state governors and perhaps allow them to raise property taxes. He said he would encourage them to deregulate the state economies as had been done at federal level. Like the other leading members of Mr Salinas's cabinet, Mr Colosio is a US-trained technocrat - he has a graduate degree in regional development and urban economics from the University of Pennsylvania. Unlike them he has held elective office, having been both a deputy and a senator. He started working with Mr Salinas in 1979 in the budget ministry and has been a close colleague since. Since last year he had been in charge of the social development ministry - a post he has now formally resigned. The portfolio, which has a multi-billion dollar budget to reduce poverty, improve the environment and build houses and other infrastructure projects, had helped him solidify political alliances across the country. The job has now been given to Mr Carlos Rojas, the under-minister in charge of the government's anti-poverty programme. Mr Colosio's nomination has spawned other political developments. Yesterday it led to the surprise resignation of Mr Manuel Camacho, the powerful mayor of Mexico City one of the closest colleagues of President Salinas. Until Sunday he was considered a leading contender for the presidency. Mr Colosio has appointed Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the education minister, as his campaign manager. Mr Zedillo, who resigned his post, is a Yale-educated economist and former central bank official and budget minister, and his presence is likely to reassure investors of Mr Colosio's support for further economic reforms.</p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Oxbridge heads Civil Service list MORE THAN half of Britain's top civil servants went to Oxford or Cambridge, according to this year's edition of The Whitehall Companion. The collection of 1,150 biographies of leading civil servants shows the Oxbridge share (50.2 per cent) fractionally down on last year's 51 per cent. The next most popular universities - a long way behind - are London, in particular the London School of Economics, Edinburgh, Birmingham and Glasgow. The book shows that the great majority of top civil servants were educated at public and grammar schools, with Eton, Rugby, Marlborough, Winchester and Dulwich College featuring strongly. The Whitehall Companion 1993-94. Dod's Publishing &amp; Research, Harrow, Middlesex, HA1 1BR. Pounds 135.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] The newspaper TISHRIN today addresses the peace  process and the recent statements Yitzhaq Rabin has made about  it. The paper notes that progress in the peace process has long  been contingent upon moves that Israel, rather than the Arab  sides, must make, contrary to the claims in this regard by the  Tel Aviv rulers. Syria and the other concerned Arab sides have  declared their willingness to achieve full, just, and  comprehensive peace grounded in the relevant UN Security Council  resolutions, and the principle of trading land for peace.    TISHRIN adds: During the sixth round of the Washington  bilateral talks, Syria submitted constructive and balanced  proposals to the Israeli negotiators. Had Israel accepted these  proposals, peace would have been achieved in the region.  However, the Tel Aviv rulers, who have been pursuing a policy  of evasion and procrastination, have thwarted all the Washington  rounds of talks, one after another, by their refusal to address  the real issue; that is, Israeli withdrawal from the occupied  territories.    TISHRIN goes on to say: As regards the issue of peace, what  counts is action, rather than words and statements. The Rabin  government has continued to earmark huge funds for the building  and expansion of settlements although Rabin acknowledged the  need to dismantle settlements. What the Rabin government should  do in this regard is to curb settlement activities. Rabin is  well aware that peace with Syria is impossible without the  restoration of the Golan, and that the policy of evasion,  procrastination, and circumvention of complete withdrawal will  only obstruct the Washington talks and delay the achievement of  durable peace in the region. It is insufficient for Rabin to  make statements here or there. If his intentions are sincere,  he must translate them into realities on the ground.    TISHRIN says: The upcoming tour of the region by U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher is providing Israel with  an opportunity to rid the Washington talks of the stalemate  plaguing them. It could do so by reiterating its willingness to  withdraw from the occupied territories, implement the relevant  UN Security Council resolutions to the letter, and subscribe to  the bases and principles of international law.    TISHRIN concludes by saying: Observers hope that the Rabin  statements will be followed by action. They also hope that they  are not just a part of a maneuver prompted by the U.S. secretary  of state's tour of the region, which is designed to end the  stalemate. Moreover, the opportunities for peace are getting  harder to foster day after day. Likewise, it is impossible to  make the slightest progress without a drastic change in the  Israeli position.    The newspaper AL-THAWRAH also comments on the Middle East  peace process and the upcoming tour of the region by U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher. It holds Israel  responsible for the tense regional situation that prompted the  U.S. secretary of state to say that he is not expecting any  striking breakthroughs.    AL-THAWRAH wonders: Does this mean that the U.S. stand  toward Israel's obstruction of the peace talks, as demonstrated  prior to the Geneva summit between President Hafiz al-Asad and  U.S. President Bill Clinton, will be maintained?    The paper says: The U.S. sponsorship of the peace process  must be promoted so it may result in the implementation of the  relevant international resolutions if the desired peace is to be  achieved. Peace cannot be built on usurpation and occupation.  This is what President al-Asad had in mind when he said that  peace cannot be built at the expense of others' territories.  What could prompt the Arabs to work for peace if such peace  were to result in the abandonment of their territories in favor  of Israel?    The paper continues: This is the sound and objective  argument constantly set forth by President al-Asad, particularly  at the Geneva summit. That is why President Bill Clinton said  that Syria is a key regional player that cannot be overlooked,  and underscored its potential contribution to stability,  equilibrium, and peace in the region.    AL-THAWRAH concludes by saying: Israel has wasted two and a  half years of peace talks, abusing U.S. tolerance, as well as  the financial, military, and political support it is receiving.  This has weakened the opportunities for just and comprehensive  peace. Besides, Israel has provided all Arabs with evidence that  it is targeting their lives, territories, and resources. That  is why they have shown greater determination to confront these  challenges, and to demonstrate greater firmness in their  adherence to their rights and territories, as well as a  willingness to make sacrifices to vindicate them.</p>

The United States has constructed a portion of the Bonneville Unit of the CUP (initial phase), including, among other features, Upper Stillwater Dam, Bottle Hollow Dam, Starvation Dam, Currant Creek Dam, Jordanelle Dam, Soldier Creek Dam for the enlarged Strawberry Reservoir, the Syar Tunnel, and the Sixth Water Aqueduct and Tunnel. The Central Utah Water Conservancy District (District) is constructing other features of the Bonneville Unit pursuant to CUPCA. Section 208 of the CUPCA provides that power generation facilities associated with the CUP be developed and operated in accordance with the CRSP Act, which explicitly embodies all Reclamation law except as otherwise provided in the CRSP Act. The District, under its contracts with the United States, has certain operation, maintenance, replacement, and repayment responsibilities and obligations concerning the Bonneville Unit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The United States constructed the SVP, comprising the Strawberry Dam and Reservoir, the Strawberry Tunnel, the Upper Spanish Fork Powerplant and transmission lines, the High Line Canal, the Mapleton and Springville Lateral and related collection, diversion, conveyance, and distribution works, all of which were substantially completed in approximately the year 1915. The Strawberry Water Users Association (Association), under its contracts with the United States, has the right to lease power privileges (subject to approval by Interior) and has operation, maintenance, replacement, and repayment responsibilities and obligations concerning the SVP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interior, in consultation with Western, is considering only a consolidated system for hydroelectric power development in the Diamond Fork area (Project), involving both the CUP and the SVP, through a lease of power privilege. The general authority for lease of power privilege under Reclamation law includes the Town Sites and Power Development Act of 1906 (43 U.S.C. &sect;522) and the Reclamation Project Act of 1939 (43 U.S.C. &sect;485h(c)) (1939 Act). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A lease of power privilege is an alternative to Federal hydroelectric power development. The lease of power privilege would grant to a non-Federal entity(s) the right to utilize, consistent with CUP and SVP purposes, water power head or storage at and/or operationally in conjunction with the CUP and the SVP, for non-Federal electric power generation and sale by the lessee(s). Any lease of power privilege in the Diamond Fork area of the CUP and SVP must accommodate pre-existing legal rights of the District and the Association. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interior would be the lead Federal agency for compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for any lease of power privilege to develop the Project. Issuance of a lease(s) of power privilege for hydroelectric power development in the Diamond Fork area will require compliance with Federal fish, wildlife, recreation, and environmental laws, as determined by Interior. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Western would have the first opportunity to purchase and/or market the power that would be generated by the Project under a lease(s) of power privilege. Under this process, Western would either purchase and market the power as Salt Lake City Area_Integrated Projects (SLCA&hyph;IP) power or market the power independently by first offering it to preference entities and secondly to non-preference entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

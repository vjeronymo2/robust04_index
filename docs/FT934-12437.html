			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Mitsotakis quits as party chief MR Constantine Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister defeated by the socialists in this month's general election, resigned yesterday as leader of the conservative New Democracy party. Mr Mitsotakis, 75, is the first of Greece's veteran political leaders collectively dubbed the 'dinosaurs' to make way for a younger successor. Four former cabinet ministers have declared themselves candidates for the leadership. Mr Mitsotakis announced he would step down two weeks ago, when Mr Andreas Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement won the election by a larger margin than had been expected. Frontrunner in the leadership contest is Mr Miltiades Evert, 54, who has opposed the conservatives' privatisation policy. The new party leader will be elected next week.</p>

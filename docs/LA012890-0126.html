			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OFF-THE-WALL STREET  </P> <P> Is Wall Street dull? No. Are the people who work in Wall Street dull? Probably,  but no more so than any pedestrian.  </P> <P> I have worked with any number of "street" people for the last 22 years and got  to know them fairly well. Analysts, retail brokers, corporate finance syndicate  men, investment bankers, market makers, money managers. Have I left anyone out?  Of all that number there is only one I could say is in any way colorful: Noble  Trenham, who owns First Global Securities. You think I am making that up, don't  you?  </P> <P> Wall Street, on the inside, is intricate, finely tuned, and sensitively  balanced, like a clock. But, as with a clock, we are not interested in what  goes on inside. We just want to look at the face and see what time it is. Wall  Street is like that.  </P> <P> PAUL GROPMAN  </P> <P> SHERMAN OAKS  </P></p>

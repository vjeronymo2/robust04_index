			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALBANIA SCORNS SOVIET REFORMS, MARKS HOLIDAY  </P> <P> Albania, the last bastion of Stalinist communism in Eastern Europe, celebrated  its national day Thursday, declaring that it has no need of Gorbachev-style  reforms and denying reports of a crackdown on unrest.  </P> <P> The Albanian Communist Party newspaper, which Wednesday accused Albanian exiles  of trying to foment a popular uprising and restore the monarchy, dismissed the  perestroika reforms of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  </P> <P> "The prescriptions of the capitalist road, of perestroika and bourgeois  reformism are unacceptable to our people and party," the daily Zeri i Popullit  said.  </P> <P> An editorial marking the 44th anniversary of the founding of the republic said  the Albanian people fully support the policies of Communist leader Ramiz Alia.  </P> <P> "Our country develops and progresses relying completely on its own forces,  being independent from the foreign powers or their economic, military and  political blocs," the paper said.  </P> <P> The popular uprisings in the rest of Eastern Europe have left ultra-orthodox  Albania isolated in its dogged pursuit of Stalinism.  </P> <P> The head of the Orthodox Church in neighboring Greece, meanwhile, warned the  Albanian government that its present policies will lead to bloodshed and its  downfall.  </P> <P> "I am warning the Tirana regime the policy it has followed up to now will lead  to international isolation and certain collapse," Archbishop Seraphim, the  primate of the Orthodox Church in Greece, told a rally in Athens.  </P> <P> After the rally, about 5,000 demonstrators marched through Athens chanting,  "Stop the Murder Now," then went to the Albanian Embassy to demand immediate  religious and political freedom in Albania.  </P> <P> Seraphim said the Albanian government must grant human rights immediately to  its citizens "if it wishes to avoid bloodshed."  </P> <P> About 400,000 ethnic Greeks live in Albania, which has a population of around 3  million.  </P> <P> Greek-Albanian relations have become increasingly tense since Greek Foreign  Minister Antonis Samaras called for religious freedom last month.  </P></p>

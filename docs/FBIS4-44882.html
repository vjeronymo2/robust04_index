			<p>Korean   Company   <F P=102> 943FE0607D Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 31 Mar 94  p 13--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 943FE0607D </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K. will provide Korean firm,  [Kinsei Sanden] with a cogeneration system technology. The  system under consideration is designed to generate power using  heavy gravity oil A as well as to make effective use of waste  heat. Showa Shell will offer design and know-how of the method  of evaluating the system's cost effectiveness. In Asia,  including Korea, cogeneration technology has yet to enjoy a  widespread use. Noting a rapid increase in energy demand, the  company had decided that cogeneration technology shows promise  and begun aiming for building a foothold for entry into the  Korean market.    The petroleum cogeneration system is an electric power  saving  system which, in addition to generating power mainly used in  diesel engines, utilizes waste heat used in meeting demands for  hot water and air conditioning. According to the contract signed  by both parties, Showa Shell Sekiyu will provide the design  techniques for optimal equipment. The figures used for the level  of usage of heat and electricity by building owners and other  types of users are based on assumption. The company also will  allow the use of its own programs specifically developed for  assessing the system's cost effectiveness.    In the area of training, Showa Shell already has received  two  technical trainees from Korea. When a purchase order has been  successfully concluded in Korea, the company will send its own  engineers/technicians if requested by the Korean firm. The term  of the contract on technical cooperation is two years.    Showa Shell installed a 3000kW cogeneration system in a  shopping center, which opened last year in Sagamihara City,  Kanagawa Prefecture, to provide its retail store tenants with  heat and electricity. This was the first time oil was sold in  this way in Japan, directly from the petroleum company to users.  In the future, the similar method will be used in  variously-located regional development projects.    In Asia, economic development is creating a rapid growth in  energy demand, resulting in shortage of electric power supply  which is becoming extremely serious. Although development of  electric sources is moving rapidly, it is not possible to catch  up with demand at present. For this reason, such a distributed  electric source as an oil cogeneration system is attracting  attention, If the Korean venture should prove successful, then  the technology could spread to other regions of Asia.</p>

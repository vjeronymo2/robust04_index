			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Export value up 8.5% last month THE VALUE of UK exports rose 8.5 per cent last month to reach Pounds 9bn, government figures showed yesterday. Imports rose 6.5 per cent in the month to Pounds 10.1bn. In the three months to February the value of exports was 1 per cent higher than in the previous three months and 5.5 per cent higher than a year earlier. The three-monthly trend for imports showed them 1.5 per cent higher than in the previous three-month period and 4 per cent higher than a year before. Last month's deficit in the current account, which covers trade in goods, services and certain transfer payments, was Pounds 750m, about Pounds 250m worse than the market forecast of Pounds 500m. It compared with a revised deficit in January of Pounds 858m. Imports measured in terms of volume rose faster than exports, and the volume of imports excluding oil and erratics in the three months to February rose 3 per cent compared with the three months to November last year while exports rose by only half as much. The visible trade deficit - trade in merchandise goods - improved slightly last month, falling from Pounds 1.2bn in January to just over Pounds 1bn in February. However, this was the second consecutive month in which the visible trade deficit had exceeded Pounds 1bn. The poor figure was caused partly by weaker trade in oil and erratics. The surplus on these two items was only Pounds 72m last month compared with a surplus of Pounds 187m in January. The estimate of the surplus on invisible earnings such as banking, insurance and tourism was held at Pounds 300m. A breakdown of exports and imports measured by value shows that imports of manufactured goods, excluding erratics such as aircraft and precious stones, grew by 2 per cent in the latest three months while exports of manufactured goods rose 2.5 per cent. Imports of finished manufactures, which include consumer durables and cars, grew by 2.5 per cent in the three months to last month, ahead of exports which grew by 2 per cent. Within finished manufactures the outlook for the UK motor industry was bleak. Exports of cars fell 4.5 per cent in the three months to February while imports rose 13 per cent. However, the value of imports of capital goods rose 1.5 per cent in the latest three months compared with the previous three months while exports fell 1 per cent. Mr John Major, the prime minister, said the rise in imports of capital goods was a sign that companies were investing in plant and equipment. The value of chemicals exports, one of the few buoyant sectors of the economy, rose 2.5 per cent in the latest three months compared with the three months to November and by 12 per cent on the year. Imports of food, beverages and tobacco, measured by value, rose by 5.5 per cent in the latest three months and by 13 per cent on the year. Britain's surplus on trade in oil fell slightly in February to Pounds 0.1bn compared with Pounds 0.2bn in January. The fall in exports to the European Community registered in January was reversed last month. Exports to the EC rose 2 per cent in the three months to last month compared with the previous three months and by 5.5 per cent on the year. Exports to north America fell 0.5 per cent. Imports from the EC rose by 2 per cent on the three-monthly basis and by 3 per cent compared with a year ago.</p>

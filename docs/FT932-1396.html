			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / US admits defeat on Dollars 4bn fund for Russia THE US has been forced to concede that the promised Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) fund to assist Russian privatisation will get off to a far more modest start. Officials said yesterday that the best the G7 summit nations were likely to agree in Tokyo next month was about Dollars 500m from themselves and a further Dollars 500m from the international financial institutions. Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, characterised the scaling back as 'a phase one, a very substantial start'. He said that at least the 'principle and importance' of the privatisation fund would be established. But his spokesman, Mr Mike McCurry, frankly conceded that the 'severe financial constraints' of the other G7 nations had been a determining factor. The Dollars 4bn fund, to be financed equally by the G7 and the international financial institutions, had been promised to President Boris Yeltsin by President Bill Clinton at their Vancouver summit early in April on the assumption that all participants agreed on its desirability and size. But subsequent G7 negotiations - and sharp differences of opinion between the US administration and the International Monetary Fund over the rate of disbursement of aid to Russia - had called into doubt the ambitious goals. On Tuesday, Mr Kaban Muto, the Japanese foreign minister, was quoted as saying that a Dollars 4bn fund was 'preposterous' because Russians did not understand the mechanisms of a market economy. Mr McCurry said the US was seeking clarification from Tokyo of Mr Muto's remarks, as may Mr Yeltsin, who is due to attend the Tokyo summit. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the former Russian prime minister now visiting the US, said in Washington yesterday that the privatisation fund was the most important type of aid the West could provide.</p>

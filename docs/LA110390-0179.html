			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: TRANSPORTATION  </P> <P> . . . But Traffic Down: More on the air transportation front:  </P> <P> Because of the yearlong construction jumble at John Wayne Airport, passenger  traffic for the first nine months of 1990 was down 3.2% from the same period in  1989, and the number of takeoffs and landings by big passenger jets was down  2.4%.  </P> <P> In September, however, the passenger count increased 7.1%, to 383,003 from  357,554 a year earlier.  </P> <P> The carriers are apparently packing more people on each plane, however, because  their total operations for the month were up just 3%.  </P> <P> The big business increase seems to be with the air taxi, or commuter airline,  firms. They posted a 19% increase in flight operations in September and a 15.5%  increase for the first nine months -- 24,967 takeoffs and landings versus  21,610 for the first nine months of 1989.  </P> <P> At United Express, the largest commuter carrier at the airport, the September  passenger load shot to 10,859, up 50% from 7,234 in September, 1989, and more  than double the 4,959 passengers carried in September, 1988.  </P></p>

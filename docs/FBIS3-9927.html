			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Guatemalan Defense Minister General Mario </F> Rene Enriquez Morales by unidentified reporters on 22 February;  place not given; from the "Telepress" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] On 22 February, Defense Minister General Mario  Enriquez Morales stated he would defend, with his own life,  constitutional order, and expressed his belief that there are  people interested in disrupting the country's institutions.  Enriquez Morales made this statement when asked about the recent  changes in the so-called security cabinet, particularly the  high-ranking military positions.    [Enriquez] I believe the changes in the Army, as rightly  said  by Gen. Gonzalez Paracena on the commemoration of Tecun Uman's  Day, are routine and we should get used to changes of that sort.  Normally, posts are rotated and changes made each month. When  these changes are implemented at a higher level, however, there  is always some apprehension. I can tell you, however, that there  is nothing extraordinary about these changes, which seek to  strengthen the Army as an institution.    [Reporter] Are destabilization attempts the cause for these  changes?    [Enriquez] The truth is we have been hearing rumors of a  coup  d'etat, destabilization, instability, and ungovernability for a  long time. It seems to me that some people, individually or as a  sector, would be pleased if the constitutional order were  broken. As the defense minister, I want to let everyone know  that I would defend the constitutional order with my own life if  necessary. In addition, the officers of the Guatemalan Army are  already very aware that one of their main roles is to preserve  the constitutional order. I do not want to mention the 25 May  and 1 June events again, but they truly exemplify the Army's new  attitude.    I have also said the democratic process will not be  consolidated by imposing a dictatorship in Guatemala, which is  what many might want. A democratic system may not be perfect,  but it has been proven to be the best system. The problem is  that we have not learned yet to live in a democracy. Sometimes,  we confuse democracy with excess freedom. The reason there are  protests by many sectors of the population is because we demand  only rights and forget our obligations.    [Reporter] What are [words indistinct] that the president  mentioned, such as [word indistinct] the country's institutions,  strengthen the Army's unity, and he also mentioned kidnappings?    [Enriquez] I have told you that we must strengthen the  institutions, and the president, with every reason, has been  very concerned with the inefficiency of the work done by the  security cabinet. A case in point is the resignation of  Government Minister Ortiz Moscoso, to whom I send my regards and  respect. He is a very good and kind person.    It seems there was somewhat of a lack of coordination which  hurt the security the state must provide its citizens. You are  aware that the rate of kidnappings has increased abruptly, many  estates have been invaded and war taxes imposed. In addition,  some social sectors of the country have suffered disappointments  and been disillusioned when they saw that the state's response  did not conform with their expectations or has not been the  appropriate response. As a result, the president must make his  decisions, which, although political in nature, benefit the  population in general.    [Reporter] Did this lack of coordination you mentioned take  place in the National Defense General Staff?    [Enriquez] No, it occurred in the security cabinet. I  believe  there was somewhat of a lack of coordination between the  security forces and the Government Ministry, which affected the  security cabinet. This was not the reason for General Quilo's  removal however.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Enriquez] Gen. Quilo is retiring. He will have his farewell  party and leave with all the honors. I believe the president's  decision regarding the removal of Gen. Quilo is reasonable. Gen.  Quilo is a very good friend of mine.    [Reporter] Would you recommend a military member for the  Government Ministry?    [Enriquez] I believe any citizen who is capable of  fulfilling  the duties of that position would be eligible. The candidate  must also inspire security given the current situation of  uneasiness and disquiet that stems mainly from the high crime  rates in Guatemala. That a military member might become  president is not so farfetched because it is the right of any  citizen. It could be a military member who has retired or  resigned, or it could be a civilian, which is what I tend to  believe the most probable.    [Reporter] Could the Army propose a candidate?    [Gen. Enriquez] The Army should not recommend candidates for  civilian positions. I believe the Army would be wrong to  recommend anyone to the president because he already knows many  people who can cooperate with him. If at any time, however, the  president asks for advice, we would be willing to comply in a  very institutional manner.    [Reporter] What is your opinion on the article published in  THE MIAMI HERALD, which argues that the president and the Army  are very close?    [Enriquez] You must see that they have always said that. You  must recall that former President Vinicio Cerezo, in his  campaign, used to say the Army should return to its barracks,  and after his victory, Cerezo was accused of being too close to  the Army. This should not surprise anyone. The Army is a  disciplined and obedient institution. Once one becomes familiar  with the Army, one gives it the credibility and the respect it  deserves for its loyalty to the institutions, the president, and  the entire democratic system it defends. I repeat, we still have  a long way to go to consolidate our democracy.    [Reporter] Reports have said the Army was going to cooperate  in the investigation of some kidnappings. Are there any clues so  far; what investigations have been conducted?    [Enriquez] I believe the Army is cooperating through the  Intelligence Directorate, and it is participating in joint  actions with this purpose in mind, specifically in the case of  Jorge Carpio Nicolle, although we have many problems in  Guatemala such as kidnappings, war taxes, estates invasions, and  robberies.    This case, however, is special and has caused a stir  worldwide because it involved Carpio Nicolle, who was not only a  professional but also a former presidential candidate, and the  owner of EL GRAFICO newspaper. All cases are dealt with in the  same manner, but regarding this particular case, I believe the  president's decision to appoint representatives from various  sectors to investigate this crime is the right one.

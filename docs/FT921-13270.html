			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Fresh cut for transatlantic fares THE TRANSATLANTIC air fares war burst into life again yesterday as British Airways and American Airlines cut their lowest return fares from London to New York by almost a quarter to Pounds 229. Within hours, their main US rival, United Air Lines, announced a similar cut. American Airlines said it cut fares 'in response to off-tariff prices'. Those tickets are sold by discount travel shops. The Civil Aviation Authority, which vets proposed new fares in the UK, has not yet approved the tickets but senior CAA staff said that the price was unlikely to be blocked.</p>

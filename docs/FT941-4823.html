			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Ticklish business of disclosure  -All may not be best for Hong Kong banks The reporting season for Hong Kong's banks, now virtually complete, has been notable for the extent to which disclosure grabbed the attention of investors. Two of Hong Kong's local banks, Hang Seng Bank and Bank of East Asia, both suffered, the latter because investors got tired of management being high-handed in its refusal to part with any information, and the former because investors did not like what they saw. To add to bankers' worries, there emerged a lobby to end past privileges. The Consumer Council assailed the banks for reaping monopolistic profits from rigging interest rates on small deposits; it also called for greater disclosure of banks' inner reserves. According to Mr Roger Edgley, banking analyst at Crosby Securities: 'Hong Kong has one of the lowest levels of disclosure; even banks in Indonesia reveal more.' Bank of East Asia, celebrating its 75th anniversary this year, got caught by investors' doubts after it unveiled a HKDollars 1bn (USDollars 129m) after-tax profit, some 46 per cent up on 1992's earnings. Given the paucity of information it published, analysts speculated that 1993 earnings had been bolstered by the use of past reserves. Mr David Li, the bank's chief executive, was forced to issue a denial the day after the bank released its results; weeks later he was still having to explain himself. According to Mr Li, 1993 profits were augmented by the unwinding of previous provisions for bad and doubtful debts. Hang Seng's problem was the opposite: too much disclosure for the market's liking. It had always been known that Hang Seng had a portfolio of securities, but not one with a value of HKDollars 12.4bn, including unrealised gains of HKDollars 9.6bn. As one broker wryly observed: 'Buy Hang Seng as a geared play on the market.' More seriously, analysts were concerned that Hang Seng recorded virtually no growth in its underlying banking business, in spite of its position as the premier retail bank in the colony. According to Mr Steven Li, banking analyst with brokers Jardine Fleming, Hang Seng's profit growth was attributable to lower bad debt charges, a one-off reduction in staff costs, and trading profits on the equities portfolio of more than HKDollars 1bn. With bank regulators and investors concerned about banks' exposure to Hong Kong's property market, Hang Seng is set for a period of soul searching, he says. 'Hang Seng has made its money the same way as the rest of Hong Kong, through the property and stock markets. But there are limits to property lending,' he says. The Hong Kong banking sector divides according to size. Hongkong Bank and Hang Seng Bank, its 63 per cent-owned listed subsidiary, dominate the market. Next come the medium-sized banks, led by East Asia and including Dah Sing and Dao Heng. The third sector, the minnows, is where the greatest number of listed banks lie. These small banks enjoyed very strong profits growth on the back of expanding balance sheets. For most, 1993 profits grew by rates in excess of 40 per cent, compared with the majors whose profit growth was in the teens. These high growth rates are, however, relatively easy to sustain for banks which are at an early stage of the growth cycle. Their size also allows them to behave in ways which regulators may find unacceptable in large banks. There is, for example, evidence that some of the small banks are raising funds outside the interbank money market. They are going directly to large corporate clients of competitors and bidding deposits off them, sometimes at rates as high as one percentage point above interbank rates. Hong Kong's benign interest rate outlook is, however, about to change. The US Federal Reserve Board signalled last month a change in the direction of interest rates; Hong Kong cannot remain immune from higher interest rates for long as its currency is linked to the dollar. But Hong Kong is a highly profitable place for sellers of retail financial services. This was underlined by the results of Manhattan Card Co, the recently floated credit card subsidiary of Chase Manhattan Bank in the colony, which posted a 73 per cent rise in net profit to HKDollars 154.7m last year. Hong Kong is a place where people like to spend money.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HONG KONG BANKS: 1993 RESULTS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Net profit     Change on 1992                            HKDollars m                  %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hongkong Bank                   13,593               15.0 Hang Seng Bank                   6,702               17.6 Bank of East Asia                1,006               46.8 Wing Lung                          473               21.0 Dah Sing Financial                 303               41.6 Ka Wah Bank                        205               42.4 IBA                                172               15.1 Union Bank                         116               41.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Company reports  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chai Ling, a student leader of the 1989 pro-democracy </F> movement in Tiananmen Square, now chairing the China Dialogue  Foundation]    [Text] United States President Bill Clinton's China policy  is caught in a dilemma between human rights and trade relations.  Last year he signed an executive order requiring that "China  improve its human rights significantly" before he will renew its  Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trade status.    To show his commitment, he invited several Tiananmen Square  students, including myself, to witness the signing ceremony.    In the past year, the Chinese Government has responded with  some improvements, but there are still many human rights abuses  such as arrests of political dissidents and the use of prison  and slave labour. Now Mr Clinton is considering his next policy  move towards China.    I would like to suggest that, rather than revoking China's  MFN status, he should form a bilateral human rights commission.    As a student leader who survived the Tiananmen massacre, I  strongly believe human rights and economic development are  equally important. Revoking MFN might not necessarily end  China's dictatorship, but it would certainly hurt the people and  the reformers more than the hardliners. Therefore that action  should be kept as a last option.    The roots of China's human rights abuses lie in the lack of  the rule of law. Thus, China "could easily roll back any  concessions it made on human rights", as Wei Jingsheng, one of  our prominent colleagues, has pointed out.    The truth is, unless China starts constitutional reform,  setting up its own checks and balances mechanism within its  system, it is unrealistic to expect outside pressure to change  the situation.    The Chinese Constitution stipulates that the people have the  right of speech, assembly and vote. The problem is how to uphold  the letter of law. The only solution is to urge the Beijing  government to start constitutional reform and to establish the  rule of law. The first step ought to be strengthening the  National People's Congress as a supervisory organ, to pass laws  to stop the government from violating its own constitution and  abusing citizens' rights.    Most importantly, there have been positive statements made  by  China's younger leaders that they are willing to start  constitutional reform.    Chinese President Jiang Zemin, during his meeting with Mr  Clinton in Seattle last year, mentioned that "within the law,  there are some things we can do". On a visit to Europe earlier  this year, Qiao Shi, head of the standing committee of the  National People's Congress (NPC) said: "China needs to learn  from Western countries to protect its citizens."    At the same time, there are signs these leaders favour a  more  constructive approach to U.S.- China relations. As Mr Jiang said  during U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit to  Beijing: "In order to become friends, we must fight first."    This elliptical remark was explained by Lee Kuan Yew,  Singapore's senior minister, in an interview with Time magazine.    According to Mr Lee, Mr Jiang's message was positive: "I  want  to be a friend--so we must have these quarrels. That this was  left out of the reports in China meant that he did not want the  Chinese people to know he was being conciliatory."    In a similar vein, Mr Qiao suggested to House Majority  Leader  Richard Gephardt during his visit to China in January that he  hoped the NPC and Congress would increase co-operation for  healthy U.S.-China relations.    Such positive signals from Chinese leaders have so far been  ignored by the U.S. media. They are the result of President  Clinton's MFN policy. By signalling his support for  constitutional reform inside China and forming a bilateral human  rights commission, the president could contribute to further  improvement of China's human rights situation.    Should China agree to such a commission, that could be  reason  enough to extend MFN status.    This would not only resolve the trade versus human rights  dilemma, it would also hold numerous benefits for U.S.-China  relations.    It would be a forum to solve disagreements and avoid  conflicts due to lack of communication. It would also help plant  a mechanism of checks and balances into the current Chinese  power structure and could potentially lead to China's  democratisation.    Such a commission could hardly be seen as "interfering in  China's domestic affairs" or "forcing Western human rights  standards onto China," rather it would be a two-way forum for  discussion of both countries' human rights problems.    Human rights should no longer be an annual subject of debate  but the focus of a consistent effort to help China establish the  rule of law.    Mr Qiao has already accepted U.S. congressman Tom Foley's  invitation to visit the U.S. Congress. This would be a good  opportunity to discuss this plan with Mr Qiao and to work out a  timetable for setting up this bilateral human rights commission.    In Beijing in 1989 thousands of students and citizens  peacefully demanded that the government establish the rule of  law and stop corruption; respect the constitution with  guaranteed freedom of speech, assembly and vote. It was not an  uprising but a movement similar to the civil rights movement in  the U.S. But a few hardliners ordered in tanks and troops and  massacred thousands of innocent people.    How could this kind of decision possibly be made and carried  out?    Had China had an influential legislature or an independently  elected leader such as Russia's Boris Yeltsin, would this  tragedy have been avoided?    If China set up a mechanism of checks and balances, could  such tragedy be avoided in the future?    It is five years since Tiananmen. After escaping from China,  living in the U.S. and studying at Princeton University, I am  more convinced than ever that China's future is through  constitutional reform. I don't agree with extremist theories  that, once international pressure is increased, the Chinese  Government will collapse overnight or that, once China starts  political reform, chaos will begin.    I am glad I have found that many Chinese people both within  China and overseas agree with me. I also sincerely hope that the  Clinton administration will be able to avoid extremist  approaches and decide upon a China policy that pursues both  human rights and economic interests.    This, I believe, is the solution to the dilemma of  U.S.-China  relations.</p>

			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> A Clarification: Inquiries by the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center  have apparently averted a threat that contents of the State Jewish Museum in  Prague, Czechoslovakia, would be sold at auction in London by Christie's. The  possibility of such a sale were first reported last month, prompting the  Wiesenthal center to ask for clarification of the situation from both the Czech  government and Christie's. The center was concerned because many contents of  the museum were seized by Nazis during World War II from Czech Jews. DANIEL  CERONE  </P></p>

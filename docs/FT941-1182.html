			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Tecs fear cuts to start-up scheme The business start-up scheme, which last year helped more than 30,000 unemployed people to become self-employed, may be severely curtailed in the next few years, local development bodies have warned. The warning comes from training and enterprise councils, which administer government training schemes in England and Wales, and from enterprise agencies, small business advice centres backed by funds from the private and public sectors. In the present financial year the scheme, which offers subsidies of about Pounds 50 a week to unemployed people who want to set up their own businesses, will cost the Department of Employment Pounds 62m. From next month the scheme will transfer into the new single regeneration budget, which brings together programmes from several departments. Budgets for programmes will no longer be ring-fenced and Tecs, along with local authorities and other organisations seeking money for economic development and regeneration, will have to compete for the funds. Tecs and enterprise agencies fear that the business start-up scheme could suffer because of a new government emphasis on helping existing businesses, which offer more prospect for creating jobs. Their fears have been provoked by a cut of up to 50 per cent in budgets for business start-ups in the next financial year, which is being treated as a transitional period. Mr Malcolm Allen, chief executive of Sussex Tec, said: 'There is concern among Tecs that the senior regional directors will choose not to re-finance the scheme because of demands from other areas.' Mr Peter Brown, general manager of the London Enterprise Agency, said: 'Although concentration on job creation through existing businesses is laudable I worry about the transfer of resources away from start-ups which are also a potential job creator.' The Workstart programme, aimed at getting the long-term unemployed back to work, is to be extended by six months, Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, said yesterday. The pilot schemes will now run at least until the end of September, he said in a Commons written reply. The schemes began last summer, offering financial incentives to employers to take on the long-term jobless.</p>

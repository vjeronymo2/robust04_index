			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Gloom gathers over recovery for Japan A fresh set of gloomy Japanese economic indicators yesterday coincided with the second biggest decline in share prices this year. The 3.1 per cent fall in the Nikkei average, to its lowest since early March, came amid gathering gloom over the prospects for economic recovery and corporate earnings next year, although selling for technical reasons played a part. Economists across Tokyo are preparing to downgrade their forecasts for 1994, but are split over whether gross national product will stagnate or grow slightly, after stagnating or falling this year. Disappointment that a recent government report on tax reform failed to set a date or amount for an income tax cut was a factor in yesterday's fall in share prices, analysts said. Mr Jiro Saito, vice-minister at the finance ministry, who attributed the fall to uncertainty over company profits, said the government would not take steps to support the market. The Japanese economy's short-term prospects slipped into reverse in September after having briefly touched the mid-point between growth and decline in August, the Economic Planning Agency, the government's official forecaster, said yesterday. Its latest monthly diffusion index of leading economic indicators, which measures the next six months' outlook, slipped to 36.4 on a scale of 100 in September. In August, the index hovered at 50. Within the index, the main components to switch from forward into reverse were job offers and sales of consumer durables. Corporate confidence continued to wither for the fifth month running. Separately, the agency disclosed more evidence of the weakness of consumer demand, with a 1.7 per cent decline in household spending in real terms in September, compared with the same month last year, the fifth month of decline. Meanwhile, wholesale and retail sales fell by 4.1 per cent year on year in the three months to September, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said. That is the seventh quarter of decline in a row, the longest fall in commercial sales for 20 years. These figures will increase pressure on a divided government to act over income tax. 'If the government does not change its attitude and cut taxes, all we can expect is a stagnant economic situation next year,' Mr Hirohiko Okumura, chief economist at Nomura Research Institute, said. Mr Tom Hill, strategist at SG Warburg Securities in Tokyo, said: 'Everyone has written off this year's decline in the economy. The doubts now are about next year; there is a big split of opinion.' SG Warburg is forecasting a 1 per cent increase in GNP for the next fiscal year. Another factor in the stock market decline was investors' concern that industrial companies have not cut costs severely enough, Mr Peter Tasker, chief strategist at Kleinwort Benson, warned. 'It is OK to hold a lot of surplus staff if there is a turnaround. But if the recovery does not come, this becomes a serious drag on earnings.'</p>

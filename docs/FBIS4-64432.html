			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Bronwen Maddox report: "Fund Urged for Closing Reactors"] </F>   [Text] An independently managed fund, paid for by the  nuclear power industry, should be set up to meet the cost of  scrapping reactors, says a report published today by a  government-commissioned advisory committee.    Taxpayers may still have to pay up to 2.9 billion pounds to  enable Britain's ageing Magnox reactors to be taken out of  service, the 100-page report, by the Science Policy Research  Unit at Sussex University, says.    The study was commissioned by the government's Radioactive  Waste Management Advisory Committee, which advises it on the  methods and costs of dealing with civil nuclear waste.    The high and unpredictable costs of decommissioning nuclear  sites have been one of the nuclear industry's greatest  headaches. The uncertainty was the main reason for the  withdrawal of the nuclear industry from the 1989 electricity  privatisation.    The National Audit Office has estimated that future  decommissioning could eventually cost 18bn pounds and that the  taxpayer might have to foot the bill as well as the nuclear  industry.    The research unit report says that annual provisions of  between 1m pounds and 5m pounds for new plants could be  sufficient to pay for their eventual decommissioning. It points  out that this is a small proportion of the income of 200m pounds  a year which a typical plant generating 1100MW might earn.    Accurate estimates, however, are hard to make until "real  progress is made" towards the construction of a store for  nuclear waste. Plans to develop a store in the rocks underneath  Sellafield in Cumbria have been delayed several times.    The fund would not solve the problem of decommissioning the  Magnox reactors, the report says. "Over a decade's worth of  provisions were effectively `lost' at privatisation of the  electricity industry and expected decommissioning costs have  risen rapidly in real terms over the last decade."    In a separate report the advisory committee says:  "Government  could be the guardian of the fund but public confidence might be  enhanced if the fund was truly independent and retained for the  sole purpose of decommissioning plant."</p>

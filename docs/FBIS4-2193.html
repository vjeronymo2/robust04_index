			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 6 (XINHUA) -- China's management  rules on assessing foreign investment in kind will start taking  effect on May 1, official sources said here today.    Promulgated and issued jointly by the State Administration  for the Inspection of Import and Export Commodities and the  Ministry of Finance, the rules break down into 28 clauses, which  clearly state the aims and application scope of the rules and  other related matters, such as who to appraise, what to appraise  and how to appraise it as well as what the legal  responsibilities are for the parties concerned.    The administration will use spot examinations, technical  surveys and check-ups, value appraising and other methods mapped  out by the rules to assess foreign-supplied equipment, whose  value will be measured according to their existing conditions,  performance indicators, technical parameters and profit-making  power.    The value appraising method is based on three factors: the  market situation, cost and profitability potential.    According to the rules, the administration will refer to the  current market prices for the same or similar assets to decide  the value of foreign assets.    The assessing process will also take into account the  assets'  real condition, life expectancy, functional development,  projected profit-earning power and appropriate discounting rate,  the rules added.    An official from the administration said that  foreign-invested enterprises have flourished in recent years,  and China has so far actually utilized more than 60 billion U.S.  dollars in foreign investment.    However, the official said, the proportion of foreign  investment in kind has been increasing over the years to reach  more than 40 percent of the total at present.    He noted that inaccurate appraisal, overvaluing of foreign  assets, substituting the new with the old and high-quality  assets with low-quality items and other foreign investment  cheats have taken place frequently.    The official said that the healthy development of China's  foreign-invested enterprises will be harmed if such problems are  not solved promptly, adding that fairly and accurately assessing  foreign assets has become a major guarantee for the legal  interests of all parties involved.</p>

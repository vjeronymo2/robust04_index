			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Protection racket targets good guys - The fight against Aids / Campaigns to promote condoms Can Madison Avenue come to the rescue of what one health expert graphically calls 'the slippage between the boardroom and the bedroom'? In a world that has to live with Aids, and where, says the World Health Organisation (WHO), there may be up to 40m HIV infections by the year 2000, the marketing of the once-humble condom has become both vital and fashionable. The new approaches to mass-marketing what the French so meaningfully call a preservatif, range from the condom boutique, like the new Condomania shops opening in Britain, to the concept of 'social marketing' being tried by the Americans in the Third World. With no vaccine against HIV likely to be available soon, the implied demand for condoms is awesome, if sex is to be made 'safe'. Recent US studies suggest that present world demand for condoms is running at about 5bn-6bn a year. But the forecast demand, as anti-Aids campaigns intensify around the world and emphasise that condoms are the only reliable protection, is two to three times that total, anything between 12bn and 17bn a year. The WHO has what it calls 'a tentative priority prevention target' - that by 2000 the whole population of high-risk areas in Africa and Asia should live in communities where condoms are available both readily and at an affordable cost. The problem, say the researchers, is not manufacturing capacity. Enough of that exists. The problems will lie, first, in 'logistics management,' that is, physical distribution from manufacturer to user - 'the slippage between boardroom and bedroom'. This is particularly the case in the poorer countries that are hardest hit by Aids but do not have an efficient wholesale-retail infrastructure. In these countries there is a second problem, that of selling at a price people can afford. At one extreme of the marketing effort are shops like the franchised Condomania boutiques in London, Liverpool and Leeds, all opened within the last five months, where the emphasis is on variety of choice, fashion, packaging and friendly advice. Martin Foreman, founder of the enterprise, says that in the London shop, to his surprise, 60 per cent of customers are women, 30 per cent heterosexual men, and the balance homosexual men. 'In our catalogue, we say that if you think that a condom is a killjoy, you're not experienced.' At the other extreme are the big international organisations that control the condom trade to the areas of high potential demand in Africa and Asia, which have come up with the concept of 'social marketing'. What social marketing means is using normal commercial distribution outlets such as chemists' shops and health centres, but adding to them non-traditional outlets such as market traders, itinerant and 'table-top' hawkers, bars, hotels, local housewives and corner shops, in order to sell condoms that are fed into this enlarged distribution system at a subsidised price. Subsidised, that is, by the international donor community, in particular by USAID, the American government's foreign aid organisation. This approach is then supported by 'Madison Avenue' marketing and promotion techniques. Statistics show that by 1990, of the 264m condoms shipped to Africa, 175m originated with USAID. But now USAID is trying to pull back from this role as Africa's main wholesaler of condoms, and has cut its orders by 20 per cent. One reason is that US-made condoms, which USAID is bound to order under its procurement rules, are three times as expensive as those bought on the open world market by other organisations. So the policy of affordable condoms means getting others to foot more of the bill. But what is an affordable condom? Again, the indefatigable US researchers have been at work, and suggest that a Third World family ought not to have to spend more than 1 per cent of its income on condoms, or else that family will become resistant to the whole idea. In poor countries, that means a very cheap price indeed. In 10 of 29 African countries surveyed, the cost of commercially supplied condoms worked out at 10 per cent of income. That is where 'social marketing' comes in. In Zaire, for example, which had been the shining example of social marketing in practice until the riots and looting there last autumn caused almost all foreigners to be evacuated, a pack of three condoms had been selling for the heavily subsidised price of 10,000 Zaire (the country's unit of currency). At Zaire's inflation-ridden currency rate of about 117,000 Zaire to Pounds 1, that is now about 9p. An organisation called PSI, Population Services International, backed by another government-funded US organisation, Family Health International, had set up warehouses and a fleet of trucks to distribute US-made condoms. The scheme was backed by Madison Avenue techniques such as branding the condoms under the 'Prudence' label, colourful packaging, radio commercials, posters, competitions, music tapes, popular songs, and what it fearlessly called 'condom inflation contests', all part of 'an intensive programme of popular and inter-personal promotion' to reach a 'broader consumer base'. The results, in marketing terms, were impressive. Condoms were being sold at the rate of 15m a year among a population of 33m, about 3.5m in the last month of operation alone. Admittedly, an unknown proportion of these were being smuggled out of Zaire across the river for sale in neighbouring Congo. But that is Africa; you cannot use normal commercial channels and not expect entrepreneurs to do what entrepreneurs in Africa have always done. Now that Zaire has been shut down, there is a new effort to turn the Ivory Coast into the showcase for 'social marketing'. Here again, the statistics look impressive. In March 1991, 14,624 condoms were sold under the 'Prudence' label. By November 1991, the figure had risen to 232,780. This compares, says PSI, with about 600,000 a year through commercial channels. It is not clear whether the black panther logo used on the condom packets is a conscious reference to the US black power movement, or to some form of prowess. The condoms sell for the equivalent of 5p each - more than in Zaire, but still cheap. So far, so good. As Martin Foreman says, this is all a lot more imaginative than lining up the condoms beside the cough mixtures and enemas. Rex Winsbury is publisher of Aids Analysis Africa</p>

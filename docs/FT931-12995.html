			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Labour warns on R&amp;D spending THE UK will suffer because of the sharp fall in spending on research and development in recent years, Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, warned yesterday. Government figures for 1991 showed that in that year alone the UK had lost 10 per cent of its spending and of its workforce in R&amp;D, he said, even before the worst of the recession. The government's own contribution had fallen by 22 per cent. Mr Cook warned that unless ministers acted to increase R&amp;D 'Britain will not be the world's workshop but merely its assembly line'.</p>

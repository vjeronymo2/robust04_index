			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (13): Weak economic pointers and lower corporate earnings sap confidence THE MARCH end to the 1991 financial year failed to give Japanese share prices the boost that had been expected, and the Tokyo stock market closed a disappointing fiscal year with lingering fears that the Nikkei Stock Average could plunge even further. The Nikkei, which in mid-March fell below the 20,000 psychologically important support level for the first time in five years, closed the first quarter at a new five-year low of 19,345.95. It had fallen 18.7 per cent since the beginning of January. Investor confidence suffered, as a result of further evidence of a weakening economy and sharp downward revisions of corporate earnings for the year ended March. Sony, the consumer electronics and entertainment group, announced that its parent company would post net losses for the first time since the company was listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1958. Matsushita Electric Industrial also revised downward its consolidated pre-tax profits for the year to March to a 43 per cent fall. Financial scandal involving leading politicians further unnerved investors. And revelations of stock scandals, in which securities companies had window-dressed clients' accounts by manipulating loss-making investments, also depressed confidence. Meanwhile, an expected interest rate cut by the Bank of Japan failed to materialise. Political pressures on the central bank to cut the official discount rate were seen as having set off the move, widely expected in March. Threats by Mr Shin Kanemaru, the godfather-like figure of the ruling Liberal Democratic party, to sack Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, if the official discount rate was not cut, shocked the financial community. Additional pressure from cabinet members also discouraged market participants. Financial markets reacted coolly to the emergency economic support package, announced by the government on the last day of March. The package's proposals to revitalise the stock market was seen as a re-hash of long-discussed reforms. Most investors believed that the package indicated a lack of commitment on behalf of the government to support the stock market. Since proposed rule changes to allow companies to hold their own shares, calls for higher dividends, and the establishment of large-lot equity investment funds failed to convince, the Tokyo market continues to be haunted by a lack of buyers. Life assurers, traditionally large-lot buyers of equities, are moving from stock investments into direct corporate lending, and investment trusts are seeing sharp declines in new-money inflows. The current weakness is prompting foreign investors, who have been the main buyers of the Tokyo market during the past year, to reassess allocation of overseas investments. In the Pacific Basin, Hong Kong continued its rise, on the back of high liquidity and improving political sentiment on mainland China. The Hang Seng index rose 14.9 per cent on the quarter, to 4,938. However, dealers point out that, as interest rates in the US seem to have hit bottom, the market, which is led by the US through currency links, holds a possibility of a short-term correction. According to Adam Le Mesurier, analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the Thai market is attractive, because of the favourable economic environment. A tight grip on monetary policy has curbed domestic demand and inflationary pressures, leading to an easing in interest rates. The SET index has risen 15.7 per cent, to 823, but still looks promising on a 12-month view.</p>

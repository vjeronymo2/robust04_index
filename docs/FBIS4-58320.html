			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["From the Heart" column by Ghazi al-'Ayyash: "The Internal </F> Blockade"]    [Text] Having come to realize the true objectives of the  external blockade imposed by the United States, Britain, and  world Zionism on Iraq, Iraqi citizens are no longer greatly  affected by this blockade. By their oppressive blockade, the  United States and Britain cannot harm the Iraqi people more than  they did through their unethical and inhuman practices, criminal  aggression, and destruction of Iraq's economic, industrial, and  health infrastructure. Moreover, the Iraqi people possess and  will continue to possess an exceptional ability to hold firm,  endure, and fight. This is because any comparison between  losing their identity and freedom on the one hand, and holding  on to patience and defiance to achieve the objectives for which  they have offered great sacrifices on the other, will make them  choose endless defiance and patience. Actually, what hurts and  pains the Iraqi citizens are the practices of some of their  fellow citizens and the painful internal blockade that they have  been imposing. Driven by greed and a tendency to exploit  others, these people have lost all principles and morals. This  blockade is being exercised by people who once were penniless  and are now rich, who once were hungry and now are overfed.  These people will not be pardoned by their fellow citizens. He  who creates his wealth and luxury from illegal money and at the  expense of others' hunger and need will not enjoy his life, for  it is wrong to believe that sources of wealth are inexhaustible  and that one can do without others.    Certain people's practices against their fellow citizens  have  been exposed and their justifications found unacceptable. They  are like spiders extending their webs to trap the citizens.  Deep in their souls, which are dominated by greed and  parasitism, there exists the same criminal instinct of the  spider, which kills its own offspring.    Certain greengrocers and grocers have turned the highway  pavement around Baghdad into a black market to avoid the prices  fixed by the government. They have emptied the Baghdad markets  of everything. Tomatoes, potatoes, beans, everything is piled up  on the highway pavement. They are not piled up by peasants or  owners of nearby farms, as some may think. Rather, they are  carried from markets and groceries to occupy the highway  pavement, where tomatoes are sold at 35 dinars instead of 20  dinare per kilo, potatoes sold at 75 dinars instead of 30, and  peas at 15 dianrs instead of 10. The quantities of beans that  appeared recently left cold storage plants only after their  prices were raised. The price of anything with a fixed price  has been deliberately raised. The price has also been raised  for any material that citizens tend to buy as a substitute for  the expensive meat. Had the potatoes stored in in cold storage  plants been released, they would have met citizens needs for at  least three months, and would have brought their prices even  lower than the fixed price.    Committees, which would be called "emergency committees,"  should be set up and given extensive authorities to impose tough  punitive measures against violators. Such committees would not  only monitor markets or greengroceries, but also cold storage  plants. Weekly inventories of the contents of such plants  should be carried out. No materials needed by the market should  be allowed to be hoarded there. Such committees should also be  given the authority to take to account any peasants who, upon  the instructions of greengrocers, delay the collection of their  crops to raise their prices. Another type of committees should  be set up to monitor the domestic commodities poured into the  market. There should be a balance between the cost of each  commodity and the price at which it is sold. This is because if  it is left up the managements of factories to specify the  prices, and in view of the continued, unjustified price hikes,  the citizen will be only the victim. Setting up "emergency  committees" relying on citizens' consciences and cooperation  will have a great effect in deterring the hoarders of basic  supplies and vegetables.</p>

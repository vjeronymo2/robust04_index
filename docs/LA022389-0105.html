			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> OFFICER SHOT TEEN 14 TIMES  </P> <P> A 17-year-old boy killed by an Escondido police officer after the two allegedly  struggled for the officer's gun was shot 14 times, according to a San Diego  County coroner's autopsy report. The Police Department had said Robert Scriven  of Escondido was shot at least 11 times, based on the number of bullets  recovered during the autopsy. Officer Martin Hewlett had chased the car theft  suspect into a field on Jan. 2. The two fought, with Hewlett ending up on his  back with the Scriven over him, according to police reports. Hewlett fired 15  rounds from the semi-automatic weapon that carried 16 bullets, police said.  Scriven's death sparked a controversy because of the number of times he was  shot. The district attorney's office is reviewing the case, which is customary  when a police officer is involved in a fatal shooting. The Escondido Police  Department will do its own review.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jinan, April 13 (XINHUA) -- A long, winding  ecological forest belt embracing the easternmost tip of the  Shandong Peninsula in eastern China has taken shape through  decades of efforts by local people.    The coastal green protective line is typically 100 to 2,000  m  wide, with trees of selected species, shrubs and grass.    The belt is playing a great part in preventing the loss of  water and the erosion of soil in the coastal areas.    Every year millions of tourists come here to enjoy  themselves  in the dense woods and on the soft, sandy beaches.    To take advantage of the large stretches of wooded areas,  local governments are planning varieties of forest and island  tourist cooperative projects with foreign businessmen.</p>

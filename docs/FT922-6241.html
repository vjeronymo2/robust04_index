			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Ascom loses Swiss status under ownership rules ASCOM, the Swiss telecommunications equipment group, has become one of the first leading Swiss companies to lose its national status under the country's law limiting property purchases by foreigners. The problem is likely to become more widespread as Swiss companies actively court foreign investors and remove restrictions on share ownership. The so-called Lex Friedrich requires that companies be able to prove that more than half of their capital is held by Swiss nationals. If they are not able to do so, they must submit each attempted property purchase to review. Ascom confronted this challenge several months ago when it tried to buy a few square metres of land for a telecoms installation. The government demanded proof that more than half of Ascom's capital was in Swiss ownership, but the company was unable to provide it. In fact, the directors suspect that a majority is held by foreigners.</p>

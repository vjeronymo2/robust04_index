			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> KELL MAKES APPOINTMENTS TO 3 CIVIC COMMISSIONS  </P> <P> Mayor Ernie Kell has reappointed one member of the Long Beach Harbor Commission  and extended the term of another, keeping the five-member panel intact for at  least another year.  </P> <P> Kell announced this week that he would not replace Commissioner Louise DuVall,  an attorney, citing the need to "maintain the direction and stability of the  port." Instead, she will remain in her spot for about another year before any  change is considered again, Kell said.  </P> <P> DuVall, who has been on the commission since 1979, will serve as its president  this fiscal year.  </P> <P> The City Council this week approved the mayor's reappointment of David L.  Hauser, a real estate agent, to a second six-year term on the commission.  </P> <P> The City Council also gave the go-ahead to new appointments to the city's  Redevelopment Agency board and Planning Commission.  </P> <P> Physician Judson R. Schoendorf and James R. Kennelly were appointed to  four-year terms on the Redevelopment Agency board, which has five members. They  replace Thomas E. Stewart, whose second term ended in May, and Msgr. Ernest  Gualderon, whose second term officially ended in 1987 but was extended another  two years.  </P> <P> Dentist Ebenezer Bush will serve a four-year term on the seven-member Planning  Commission. He replaces Dr. Horace Rains, who served two terms.  </P></p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / C&amp;W units in talks on AT&amp;T alliances Companies controlled by Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK telecommunications group, have been in talks with AT&amp;T, the largest US telecoms operator, about forming an international alliance, despite C&amp;W claims that it is not interested in such a tie-up. Mercury, C&amp;W's UK subsidiary, drew back earlier this month from joining AT&amp;T's Worldsource international partnership, in what an insider called a 'knife-edge' decision. However, Hongkong Telecom, C&amp;W's largest undertaking, is still in talks and may soon join Worldsource. C&amp;W's manoeuvring emerged as AT&amp;T announced an alliance with Unisource, the venture between the Swedish, Dutch and Swiss national telecoms operators. Unisource, of which Telefonica of Spain is an associate member, will take an unspecified equity stake in Worldsource. It will market Worldsource-branded products in Europe, geared to the growing market for one-stop international telecoms services for multinational companies. AT&amp;T's alliance is in fierce competition with two others launched in the past year - a Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.5bn) tie-up between British Telecommunications and MCI, the second largest US operator; and a Dollars 4.2bn alliance, forged last week, between Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom, and Sprint, the third largest US long-distance operator. AT&amp;T had hoped to include Mercury in yesterday's announcement. Although the UK operator would have become only an associate of Worldsource, the concentration of multinationals in London made it attractive to AT&amp;T. Mr Mike Harris, Mercury chief executive, said: 'There was a real problem in getting into bed with AT&amp;T, given their existing international partners.' KDD, the largest Japanese international operator, is an equity member of Worldsource, and Telstra, the Australian national operator, an associate. Both compete with operators in which C&amp;W holds stakes - IDC in Japan and Optus in Australia - and those companies made representations to C&amp;W against Mercury allying with AT&amp;T. Mr John Tonroe, finance director of Hongkong Telecom, in which C&amp;W has a 57.5 per cent stake, said the company was open to joining Worldsource, denying that C&amp;W would veto such a move. Mr Harris acknowledged that Hongkong Telecom might adopt a different strategy to the rest of C&amp;W. Mr Robert Morris, analyst at Goldman Sachs, said: 'C&amp;W really does have a dilemma about how it fits into the emerging international alliances.'

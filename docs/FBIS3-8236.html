Slovene authorities are not allowing Zhirinovskiy to enter  the country although the leader of the Russian Liberal Democrats  has a valid diplomatic passport of the Russian Federation.    It is not clear whether the Slovene authorities will deny  Zhirinovskiy entry, or whether they will let him stay, as is  claimed, for a private visit to Slovenia.</p>

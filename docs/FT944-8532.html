			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Electronics can offer the opportunity to achieve a deeper level of democracy Sir, In his article, 'Virtually real democracy' (November 15), Joe Rogaly highlights some of the undoubted dangers of armchair democracy. However, his argument is based on the incorrect premise that electronic democracy is inherently dangerous. Surely the premise should be that, in a democratic society, greater representation of the electorate is for the underlying good? This is not to say that there are no dangers: the extremes outlined by Rogaly must clearly be avoided. Global interactive media offers enormous opportunity for the voice of the individual to be heard. But, as important, it provides the channel through which the individual can he informed and educated. Not only can it give access to more information in the current one-way format, but interactively, it allows users to pose questions and receive answers, and make comments and air concerns. It also allows them to forge associations nationally and internationally. Surely an enlightened electorate and responsive global democracy is worth striving for. But the era of increased interactivity poses two main challenges to government and the media. First, in the same way as governments of the 19th and 20th centuries were faced with a widening of democracy, so the governments of today and tomorrow must seize the opportunity of deeper democracy. Second, the media will have a far greater responsibility to inform the electorate and to shepherd information - but not to distort or lead. And, with information and the access to it increasingly synonymous with power, the role of government will be to make sure this power is equitably distributed.

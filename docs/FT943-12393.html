			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / France's magistrates embark on the corruption trail with Italian gusto: A rash of publicised probes France's magistrates do not have a picture of President Mitterrand on the wall - they have one of Antonio Di Pietro. This remark by a prominent Paris lawyer reflects the view of some observers that the country's magistrates are being influenced by the example of the high-profile anti-corruption crusade of Milan's magistrates under the leadership of the popular Mr Di Pietro. Indeed, France's recent rash of highly publicised corruption investigations has raised the question of whether the country is becoming a second Italy, not necessarily in the level of corruption but in the vigour with which French magistrates are matching their Italian counterparts in cracking down on white-collar crime. In pursuing cases that involve some of the largest companies in the land and causing earlier this week that most unusual event in France, a ministerial resignation, many French magistrates are influenced by what is happening in Italy, say critics. In the process, legal safeguards are being swept aside, complains Mr Pierre Suard, chairman of the Alcatel Alsthom engineering group. After being freed on FFr1m (Pounds 120,000) bail, after 12 hours of questioning on allegations of misuse of corporate funds and underpaying Alcatel suppliers for work done to his residence, Mr Suard said: 'I don't know whether there is a campaign against big companies, but it seems French legal practices are being violated. In France, investigations should remain secret. If it (the investigation concerning himself) had been, then there would not have been damage to the company and shareholders.' Some go as far as to argue that a new generation of magistrates has at last escaped government control and have decided to take their revenge on an establishment that has long undervalued their work. And others ask who it is that is to blame for the widespread leaking of judicial and police information that is piercing the cloak of secrecy with which French investigations are supposed to be shrouded? At the heart of the controversy are France's 550 juges d'instruction. These investigating magistrates are called in to investigate all felony charges (rape, murder) and any case that is complex (corruption, white-collar crime). They are generally young and not well paid. According to Mr Valery Turcey, secretary general of the the largest union among France's 6,000 magistrates, an investigating magistrate starts in his or her mid-to-late 20s on an ordinary secretary's salary of FFr13,000 a month, rising to FFr20,000 after 10 years. A few come to the job late with useful experience but it is not rewarded in pay terms. They have statutory independence as juges d'instruction, and the judiciary's general independence has been reinforced in the past year by a reform of the Conseil Superieur de la Magistrature which dilutes the power of the executive in determining appointments. Investigating magistrates still know that, to attain the highest reaches of the judiciary, they will have to spend some subsequent stint in the government prosecution service. But many care less what the government thinks of them, if only, as Mr Turcey says, 'there is now a generation of juges d'instruction who feel their career advancement is blocked by a sizeable number of older magistrates'. But Mr Turcey insists that investigating magistrates can use their considerable powers to order police searches, interrogate witnesses, detain defendants, only if and when 'instructed' by state prosecutors and within limits laid down by prosecutors. Mr Pierre Mehaignerie, the justice minister, has for instance been criticised in the press for leaving police to continue their inquiries into improper party funding allegations concerning Compagnie Generale des Eaux, rather than calling in an investigating magistrate. But the main complaint of people caught up in recent cases is the way, as Mr Gilles August of the Paris law firm of Sales Vincent Georges puts it, France's 'inquisitorial system is being exploited by the media'. Secrecy has been of the essence to this 'inquisitorial' system that places the quest for truth over the rights of the individual, compared with the Anglo-Saxon 'adversarial' system which gives a higher priority to the rights of a defendant in a confrontation with the prosecution that is left to juries to decide. Thus, French police and magistrates can question a suspect for 20 hours before the latter has the right to have his lawyer present. Only after a suspect has been formally charged, or 'put under examination' in French legal jargon, can his lawyer have access to the magistrate's dossier. This sometimes leads people to demand to be 'put under examination' so that they or their lawyer can see the evidence an investigating magistrate has compiled against them. Mr Alain Carignon said he resigned as communications minister in the Balladur government on July 17, precisely in order to contest charges, filed yesterday, concerning allegations that Lyonnaise des Eaux, the other big French water company, bankrolled a newspaper that campaigned for his re-election as mayor of Grenoble in return for getting the city's water contract. Mr Turcey says 'it is defendants who started the business of 'media-tising' cases'. Mr Maurice Arreckx, a senator from the Var region in the south, is for instance not yet a defendant, but has a judge on his heels who wants to make him one by bringing charges for corruption. Last Thursday Mr Arreckx used an interview in Le Figaro to proclaim his innocence. In general, Mr Turcey says investigating magistrates are far too busy, each dealing with an average 120 ongoing dossiers at any one time, to want to bring down a lot of time-consuming publicity on their heads by leaking material to the press. But he concedes that investigating magistrates, and the occasional prosecutor such as Mr Eric de Montgolfier, who has held press conferences during his investigation into possible football bribery by Mr Bernard Tapie, sometimes use the press to forestall attempts by their superiors to smother their inquiries. Mr Jean-Pierre, he says, 'would never have got anywhere in his investigations into Socialist party funding if he had not used journalists'. The justice ministry and the Senate are now beginning to consider how to accommodate inexorable media pressure in high-profile cases with the need for some legal secrecy. One solution, suggests Mr Turcey, would be to try to preserve absolute secrecy up to the point at which a suspect is formally charged, and to abandon it thereafter.</p>

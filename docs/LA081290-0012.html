			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALBUM REVIEWS;  </P> <P> **** CHARLES LLOYD "FISH OUT OF WATER" ECM  </P> <P> On this contemplative, sometimes ethereal recording, his first for ECM,  saxophonist-flutist Charles Lloyd, who tends to look inward for musical  direction, reaches a transcendent plateau, interweaving his interest in things  spiritual with the bluesy roots of his native Memphis.  </P> <P> It's this Memphis connection that keeps the session from developing into New  Age atmospherics as Lloyd plays searching, sometimes Coltrane-flavored tenor  with plenty of subtle bluesy touches, all in an airy, understated way.  </P> <P> His flute work on "Tellaro," isn't as successful; though meditative enough, it  too often approaches Paul Horn-ish banality. Pianist Bobo Stenson, bassist  Palle Danielsson and drummer Jon Christensen sound remarkably similar to trios  led by pianist Keith Jarrett, the pianist from the original Lloyd Quartet.

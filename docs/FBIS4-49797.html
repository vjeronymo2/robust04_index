			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" of report delivered on 6 April 1994 by Huang </F> Yuezhong (7806 1471 1813), chairman of the Anhui Provincial  Planning Commission, to the Second Session of the Eighth Anhui  Provincial People's Congress on the implementation of Anhui's  1993 national economic and social development plan and the draft  1994 plan]    [Text] Entrusted by the provincial people's government, I  am delivering a report to the Second Session of the Eighth Anhui  Provincial People's Congress on the implementation of Anhui's  1993 national economic and social development plan and the draft  1994 plan.  <H5>  1. Implementation of the 1993 Plan </H5>   Anhui's gross domestic product [GDP] for 1993 amounted to 94  billion yuan, up 21.6 billion yuan or, when calculated in terms  of comparable prices, increasing 22 percent from 1992. It was 9  percent higher than the original target.    Efforts have been made for attaining comparatively  well-off living standards and the rural economy has been  invigorated in an all-around manner. The added value of  agricultural output was 25.4 billion yuan, up 10 percent. (The  total agricultural output value was 41.7 billion yuan, up 8.5  percent.) Village and town enterprises continued to develop  rapidly, reporting a sales value of 108.45 billion yuan, up  102.2 percent over that of 1992.    Enterprise reform has continued to deepen and  industrial output has increased rapidly. Enterprises  including Maanshan Iron and Steel, Anhui Energy, and Meiling  Corporation have succeeded in conducting reform and listing  their stock to be bought and sold at stock markets. Various  reforms in enterprises and corporations -- including state  ownership under nongovernmental management, collective ownership  under private operation, different ways to form enterprises and  corporations, and experimental shareholding systems -- have been  progressing in a healthy manner. The added value of Anhui's  industrial output was 42.9 billion yuan, up 37 percent over that  of 1992. (The total industrial output value was 140.2 billion  yuan, up 44.6 percent.) Anhui's industries have considerably  raised their economic returns.    Investment structure has been rationally readjusted.  Key construction and technical transformation projects have  increased. Public investments in fixed assets were 28.99  billion yuan, up 35 percent over that of 1992.    Anhui has opened up wider to the outside world and the  total amount of foreign capital actually used in the province  has increased remarkably. Export-oriented economic sectors  gradually became more active as 16 prefectures and cities and  some enterprises have been authorized to export goods on their  own. The establishment of 1,040 new "three types of wholly or  partly foreign- owned" enterprises was approved in 1993, and the  total amount of foreign capital actually used in the province  was $260 million, up 420 percent over that of 1992.    Domestic markets have been prosperous and active.  Anhui has accelerated its pace in price reform.    Anhui has considerably increased its revenues, and has  made new contributions in financial work. Revenues in 1993  totaled 7.32 billion yuan, up 32.8 percent. Anhui's financial  expenses in 1993 were 7.22 billion yuan, down 2.6 percent. The  financial account for 1993 was balanced. At the end of 1993,  the amount of Anhui's public savings at banks was 49.44 billion  yuan, up 10.08 billion yuan over that of 1992. The amount of  various bank loans extended was 71.21 billion yuan, increasing  12.67 billion yuan over that of 1992.    Anhui has accomplished new achievements in science,  technology, and education, and has made further progress in  various social undertakings. In 1993, Anhui organized and  implemented 85 projects to tackle scientific and technological  problems, and accomplished 645 scientific and technological  achievements at or above the provincial and departmental level.  In 1993, Anhui's institutions of higher learning admitted  32,300 students to regular undergraduate and special courses,  increasing 35.6 percent. Its secondary specialized schools  enrolled 44,600 students, up 52.3 percent.    Urban and rural residents have considerably improved  their living standards. The population growth rate was  lower than the national average. According to a random survey,  Anhui urban residents' per capita cash income for living  expenses was 2,025.7 yuan and peasants' net per capita income  was 724 yuan. In 1993, Anhui's natural population growth rate  was 10.67 per thousand.    Some major acute contradictions and problems of 1993 follow:  We have yet to completely smoothen some links in macroeconomic  regulation and administration. Investments in agriculture have  been inadequate and infrastructural facilities in the  agricultural sector are relatively weak. New key industries  have not developed fast enough. Economic benefits still mainly  depend on an increased growth rate. Some enterprises are facing  difficulties in production and operation. Increases in  commodity prices have been too high. Anhui is short of funds.  The development of social undertakings has been slow.    2. Guiding Thoughts and Major Objectives of Anhui's  1994 National Economic and Social Development    Guiding thoughts of Anhui's 1994 economic work follow:  Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's  basic line, we should resolutely implement the party Central  Committee's policy on "seizing opportunities, deepening reform,  opening up wider to the outside world, enhancing development,  and maintaining stability." While ensuring that both quality and  benefits are higher than those of 1992, we should facilitate a  sustained, rapid, and healthy development [chi xu kuai su jian  kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] in the  national economy in an effort to promote all-around social  progress.    The principal goals follow:    -- The GDP should increase 13-15 percent over that of 1993.  Out of the total, primary industries should increase 3.6-3.8  percent (and the total agricultural output value should rise  more than 4 percent); secondary industries should increase  16.6-19 percent (and the total industrial output value should  rise more than 25 percent); and tertiary industries should go up  22-24 percent.    -- We should strive to further improve our tasks in  reversing  losses and increasing profits. Enterprises with a gross  national product [GNP] of 10,000 yuan or above should reduce  energy consumption by 2.25 percent. The marketability rate of  industrial products should be more than 96 percent. Major  indices of economic efficiency -- including the proportion of  profits and taxes as a percentage of total capital, the  frequency of circulation funds, and labor force productivity in  Anhui -- should all be higher than those of 1993.    -- Village and town enterprises should have sales revenues  of  more than 150 billion yuan.    -- Public investments in fixed assets are expected to be 35  billion yuan, increasing 21 percent over those of 1993. This  will include state-owned units' investments of 9.32 billion  yuan, as allocated by the state at the beginning of 1994.    -- Anhui's social commodities retail volume should be 47  billion yuan, or attain a 20-percent increase.    -- Our total foreign trade value should be $1.59 billion, or  up 23.5 percent, of which the export value should be $1.1  billion. The actual use of foreign funds should amount to $480  million, of which, $180 million should be in the form of medium  and long-term foreign loans.    -- Anhui's financial revenues should reach 8.538 billion  yuan, up 16.6 percent over those of 1992, or when calculated in  terms of comparable prices, increasing 9.2 percent from 1992.    -- The rate of the increase in overall social retail  commodities prices should be controlled to be lower than the  national average.    -- Regarding 1993 wages as a base, we should considerably  increase the average wages of staff and workers. Also,  peasants' net per capita income should increase more than 100  yuan from 1993.    -- Anhui's natural population growth rate should be  controlled under 14.96 per thousand as instructed by the state.  <H5>  3. Major Objectives of Anhui's 1994 National Economic and </H5> Social Development  <H5>  (1) We should regard raising peasants' income as the </H5> central task and comprehensively develop the rural economy.    It is necessary to further restructure the agricultural  production framework. We should stress high yields, high  quality, and high efficiency in agriculture; should provide  guidance to village and town enterprises according to various  categories; and should continually accelerate in carrying out  the "1235" [numerals as published] project. Furthermore, we  should strive to promote the rural shareholding joint-venture  system; raise funds, through various channels, to develop  village and town enterprises; make efforts to increase  agricultural investments; and enhance the construction of  agricultural infrastructural projects.    We should strive to raise peasants' incomes by increasing  productivity, and take effective measures to ensure that  benefits such as higher state procurement prices for cotton and  grain are received by peasants. Additionally, we should  realistically reduce peasants' burdens and enable poor areas to  expeditiously shake off poverty and become rich.    (2) Great efforts will be made to readjust industrial  structure and build up our capacity for sustained economic  development    In 1994, we will formulate the development plans for  automobiles, engineering machinery, daily-use electric  appliances, electronics, iron and steel, non-ferrous metal, and  building materials industries, as well as intensive processing  industry for agricultural and sideline products. We will  support the development of high-priority key industries and  products by increasing credit loans, using foreign capital,  encouraging joint ventures, recommending the share-holding  system, and experimenting on turning debtors into partners.  Light, textile, and other conventional industries will  particularly pay attention to market demand and to opening up  the market. We will continue to strengthen basic industries.    (3) We will actively promote the reform of the  investment system, make great efforts to readjust investment  patterns, increase investment, and earnestly step up the  construction of key projects.    We will increase investment in infrastructural construction,  basic industries and backbone industries, such as agriculture,  water resources, transport, telecommunications, energy sources,  and important raw and processed materials. More efforts will be  made for the technological transformation of enterprises. We  will concentrate on the construction of key projects and  actively do good preparatory work for the Eighth Five-Year-Plan  projects. We will vigorously promote the reform of the  investment system.    (4) We will step up the construction of the market  system and strive to open up the market.    We will give higher priorities to planning the construction  of 11 wholesale markets for capital goods and agricultural and  sideline products, 11 shopping centers, and a number of  provincial border markets. We plan to establish a provincial  securities trading center, increase securities trading firms,  and develop urban and rural cooperative banks. We will  accelerate the development of the technology market. We will  step up the establishment of labor service and real estate  markets. Attention will be paid to the development of brokerage  and service agencies in the market.    (5) We will open up wider to the outside, make efforts  to use foreign capital, and increase exports.    We will make full and flexible use of the preferential  policies granted by the state to the two open cities Hefei and  Wuhu, accelerate the development of the export-oriented economy  in the province, and strive to maintain the development momentum  of the Wuhu economic and technological development zone and the  Hefei high-technological industries development zone. We will  vigorously develop international tourism.    Efforts will be made to expand export trade. We will  actively increase sources of export goods, and strive to enable  more of our production-related, scientific and technological,  materials, and commercial enterprises to obtain the foreign  trade authority. We will rationally arrange imports.    We will use foreign capital more boldly and more  effectively,  and strive to set up 3,000 or more new joint ventures,  cooperative enterprises, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises  and to obtain $1 billion of foreign investment this year. We  will continue to make effective use of loans from foreign  governments, monetary organizations, and commercial banks.    (6) We will strive to increase revenues, optimize the  credit structure, and promote direct capital flow.    We will continue to pay attention to increasing the sources  of revenues, match revenue increases with economic growth, and  strive to receive 8.5 billion yuan of revenues in 1994. We will  actively make banks play the role of main channels of capital  flow, vigorously seek savings deposits, and further optimize the  use of loans. A further step will be taken to widen the  channels of direct capital flow.    (7) We will control excessive commodity price  increases and strive to improve the people's living standards.    First, we will meticulously implement the pricing system  reform plan according to the demands set by the state. Second,  we will improve macroeconomic coordination, maintain an overall  economic balance, make the "vegetable basket" project a success,  and ensure market supply. Third, we will establish as soon as  possible a reserve system for major agricultural products and  keep improving it; and we will establish a grain risk fund.  Fourth, we will pay more attention to monitoring and examining  the prices of daily necessities and services for residents, and  promptly adopt measures to control excessive price rises.    A further step will be taken to improve the living standards  and increase the income of the people in both urban and rural  areas.    (8) We will accelerate the transformation of scientific  and technological achievements into practical productive forces,  give high priority to the development of education, and  coordinate the development of other social undertakings.    First, we will take advantage of planning and the market to  accelerate the industrial application of a number of selected  major scientific and technological achievements which can be  widely applied, yield high added value and good economic  efficiency, and play a great promoting role. Second, we will  apply advanced science and technology in transforming  conventional industries. Third, we will strive to achieve  success in the projects of tackling tough scientific and  technological problems assigned by the central and provincial  authorities, and accelerate the transfer of military industry  technologies to civilian sectors. Fourth, we will accelerate  the establishment of a system for managing science and  technology, as well as a science and technology operating  mechanism, which conform to socialist market economic structure.  Fifth, we will convene a provincial science and technology  congress.    We will give high priority to the development of education.  Efforts will be made to ensure success in basic education,  accelerate the development of secondary vocation and technical  education, and develop multi-form, multi-level adult education  with on-the-job training and continued education as its main  forms. We will steadily develop the higher education and strive  to increase educational investment. We will take a further step  to step up the building of socialist spiritual civilization and  to actively promote cultural, sports, public health, press,  publication, radio broadcasting, cinema, television, civil  affairs and other social undertakings. We will increase  investment in social undertakings through various channels and  in various forms. We will continue to improve the family  planning work. We will pay attention to nationwide improvement  of farmland and environmental protection.</p>

			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BAKER SAYS HE FAILED TO HEAL RIFT OVER MISSILES IN W. GERMAN TALKS  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III today failed to heal a rift with West  Germany over nuclear missiles, leaving a shadow over the May 29 and 30 summit  that President Bush will attend with other Western leaders.  </P> <P> "If we had bridged the gap, I would tell you," Baker said after he met with  West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher. He said the security of  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization could be at risk if the allies let their  nuclear defenses down.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, officials of the 15 other NATO nations welcomed in guarded terms  Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's proposal to unilaterally cut 500  short-range nuclear weapons. Baker said it was merely a Soviet public relations  ploy, and Bush's national security adviser said it was designed to split NATO.  </P> <P> Brent Scowcroft, speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One as Bush flew to  Texas for a speech, said the Soviet proposal "is designed principally to create  problems within the alliance . . . divisions within the Western alliance."  </P> <P> The NATO officials, in a statement after Baker briefed them on his trip earlier  this week to Moscow, said, "We consider reduction in 500 weapons alone as a  welcome, positive, but rather modest step." The statement said NATO looks to  Moscow for further "reductions in its unwarranted superiority."  </P> <P> The Bush Administration's dispute with West Germany is over short-range nuclear  missiles targeted against the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact countries, mostly from  sites on West German soil.  </P> <P> West Germany wants to delay a proposal to triple the range of the missiles and  to increase their speed, asking instead that the United States begin to  negotiate short-range missile cutbacks on both sides with the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> The dispute has opened fissures within the alliance. A majority supports West  Germany in a position that Baker suggested was partially motivated by politics.  </P> <P> Disarmament feeling is strong in West Germany, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl's  decision to oppose modernizing the Lance missiles and to urge negotiations is  viewed as a way of trying to improve his chances for reelection next year.  </P> <P> Gorbachev complicated Baker's task with an announcement Thursday that the  Soviets would withdraw 500 nuclear missiles, bombs and artillery shells from  Eastern Europe this year.  </P> <P> He also advised Baker in a 3 1/2-hour Kremlin meeting that the Warsaw Pact  would propose at East-West talks in Vienna wide-ranging cutbacks in troops,  tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear forces.  </P> <P> Baker said the unilateral withdrawal of about 5% of the Soviet short-range  nuclear arsenal was "quite apparently designed for public opinion" and included  no guarantee that the missiles would be destroyed.  </P></p>

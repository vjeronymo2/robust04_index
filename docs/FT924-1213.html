			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Japan willing to open market more JAPAN yesterday said it was willing to open its market further - including the contentious financial services sector - in an 11th hour bid 'to accelerate the process' towards a settlement of the Uruguay Round of talks on global trade reform. The proposal came as delegations from 108 countries involved in the Round met for a stock-taking session in Geneva, many expressing disappointment at slow progress and criticising the US for demanding that a number of issues - including anti-dumping rules and proposals for protection of intellectual property - be reopened for debate. The US vigorously defended these moves, insisting in a statement to the meeting of the top-level Trade Negotiations Committee that it had served notice 11 months ago that these issues would have to be addressed, and criticising 'those who would settle quickly for a minimum package'. Mr Rufus Yerxa, heading the US delegation, said it would take 'further hard bargaining to bring a successful end to the Round'. Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, vice-minister for International Affairs in Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, told the FT that if present disputes were carried into 1993, there was a danger of a 'chicken and egg' deterioration that could lead to the collapse of the Round. Mr Arthur Dunkel, director general of Gatt, warned negotiators they were 'now, more than ever, engaged in a race against time'. But he insisted the talks were not stalemated and that they would continue until December 23. He called another meeting of the TNC on January 15, giving scope for a last-ditch breakthrough in the last weeks of the Bush administration in the US. Mr Hatakeyama said the Japanese proposal for 'acceleration' would involve a suggestion that detailed discussions on market access and trade in services should be hived off from the urgent need for a political commitment to the Uruguay Round draft agreement tabled by Mr Dunkel a year ago. This suggestion was dismissed as unrealistic by other negotiators, some of whom nevertheless echoed Japan's fears over recent moves by the US to call for substantial parts of the draft agreement, like that on anti-dumping, to be opened up. Mr Hatakeyama emphasised that any country trying to amend the Dunkel draft 'would have to win consensus from opposing parties.' He said Japan was willing to make deeper cuts in its market access negotiations - a stumbling block to progress for EC negotiators - noting at the same time that Japan's line-by-line concessions, tabled in March, cut tariff barriers by an average of almost 50 per cent. 'We can be very positive on financial services,' he said, answering directly US and EC calls for a more open market for financial services, securities and insurance.</p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Concern grows over Russia's N-plants ALL Russia's 400 nuclear power stations and research centres are a potential danger, a safety official said yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow. Mr Sergei Shoigu, chairman of the State Committee for Civil Defence and Emergencies, claimed Tuesday's radiation leakage at a nuclear power plant near St Petersburg posed no danger, but criticism of the reactor type - the same as that which exploded in Chernobyl in 1986 - was justified. In Vienna, the International Atomic Energy Agency said it had downgraded the accident to level-2 from level-3. Estonian foreign minister Lennart Meri complained that radiation levels had doubled in the Estonian border town of Narva since the leak.</p>

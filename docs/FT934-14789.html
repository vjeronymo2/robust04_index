			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: Oce declines 26% to Fl 13.9m in third term OCE-VAN der Grinten, the Dutch photocopier and office equipment maker, reported a 26 per cent fall in third-quarter net profit. This comes after declines of nearly 50 per cent in each of the first two quarters of 1993. Net profit fell to Fl 13.9m (Dollars 7.7m) from Fl 18.8m in the third quarter of 1992. Figures for the nine-months were down 42 per cent at Fl 40.6m. The company blamed the decline on lower sales, caused mainly by the weakness of European economies and which extended the first-half trend. The depreciation of important currencies against the Dutch guilder continued in the third quarter, but at a reduced rate. Third-quarter sales fell by 6 per cent to Fl 603m. In the first three quarters taken together, sales declined by 7 per cent to Fl 1.85bn. Oce-van der Grinten said it would pay an unchanged interim dividend of Fl 0.90. However, it said the interim dividend should not be seen as an indication of the level of the final dividend.</p>

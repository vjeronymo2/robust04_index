			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SIDEKICKS AVOID FORECLOSURE, WILL COMPLETE MISL SEASON  </P> <P> The future of the Sockers and the Major Indoor Soccer League brightened Monday  when the Dallas Sidekicks met a 1:30 p.m. deadline set last week by a federal  bankruptcy judge for posting $260,000 to avoid foreclosure by the  organization's major creditor, Dallas Basketball Ltd.  </P> <P> Four major shareholders, including Stan Finney Jr., chairman of the board for  the Sidekicks, put up the money which guarantees that the team will finish the  remainder of the season, according to Gordon Jago, the Sidekicks' president and  coach.  </P> <P> Sockers President Ron Cady, a participant in a conference call Monday morning  in which representatives from each of the seven teams discussed the matter,  said this will allow the MISL expansion committee to continue its search for  new franchise sites. Also, he said, it gives the MISL's executive search  committee an opportunity to continue looking for a commissioner. Bill Kentling  resigned as commissioner last week, effective May 31.  </P> <P> "I'm real encouraged," Cady said. "It sends a message (to the league) that they  (the Sidekicks) have made a commitment."  </P> <P> Dallas is still required to post payments of $130,000 in April, May and June to  Dallas Basketball Ltd.  </P> <P> "We have been granted the opportunity to reorganize and prepare for the  future," Jago said. "I think the other teams will be very relieved. For us not  to complete the season would have been absolutely disastrous." DON PATTERSON  </P></p>

			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Japan on slow but sure road to recovery The Japanese economy's crawl towards recovery became official yesterday, when economic ministers endorsed a report stating that better times were just around the corner. Japan 'is moving toward recovery at a gradual pace,' according to the latest monthly report by the government's Economic Planning Agency; slightly more cheerful than the previous month's observation that the economy was 'pulling out of the slump'. Mr Masahiko Komura, the agency's director-general, said this was not a declaration of economic recovery, merely that the economy was moving that way. The EPA's monthly reports, closely watched by the financial community for minute changes in wording, are of less practical than symbolic importance. EPA watchers say the previous report did not mention 'recovery'. Yet this latest attempt to spread mild optimism over an end to nearly three and a half years of recession, the longest since the second world war, fell on sceptical ears yesterday. It produced not a twitch in the government bond market, and a chorus of doubt from business leaders. The agency wrongly declared that the economy had bottomed out last year, so businessmen are almost superstitiously reluctant to believe it this time. 'Bright factors are certainly spreading, but I believe it only means that the economy is coming out of the worst period, and I have no feeling of real recovery yet,' said Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of both Toyota, Japan's largest car maker, and of the Keidanren business federation. Less circumspect than his Keidanren counterpart, Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of the Nikkeiren employers' federation, warned that a rise in personal spending might be a one-off, brought on by the hot summer and an income tax rebate. 'I cannot be optimistic,' he said, citing the impact of the yen's continued strength on Japan's export-dependent manufacturing industry. Despite business leaders' doubts, the EPA report does back up the more respected Bank of Japan's recent quarterly Tankan survey of business confidence. Its most recent Tankan, early this week, indicated that a fragile recovery is emerging, constrained by a weak jobs market and a continued decline in corporate investment. The real test will be the EPA's publication, in the second half of this month, of gross domestic product for the second quarter of the year. Japan produced higher than expected 3.9 per cent annualised growth in the first quarter. Growth usually eases in the second period. So anything near the 1-2 per cent annualised increase that several private sector economists in Tokyo are expecting would prove the agency's moderate cheerfulness to be on the mark after all. Japan's top four securities companies' research units have revised upward their forecasts for the earnings of leading quoted manufacturers in the year to next March. Nomura, the largest and least optimistic, yesterday forecast that blue chip companies' pre-tax profits would fall for the fifth consecutive year, by 0.5 per cent. This is considerably less than the 2.7 per cent reduction it was expecting in June. The other three - Yamaichi, Daiwai and Nikko - are all forecasting that big manufacturers will show a clear recovery from four years of profit decline. The difference is that, unlike Nomura, they include steel companies' asset sales as earnings. However, all four agree that a rise in exports, the fruits of corporate cost cutting and a recovery in domestic demand, helped by a hot summer, are the main features in the improved profits outlook.

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Survey of Russia (14): Stable business can be done - A Guide for Visitors Doing business in Russia has become in some ways more, in some ways less, taxing. The more first. The Russian language is difficult, although it is a worthwhile courtesy to learn a few words. Few people speak English and interpreters should be carefully chosen. It is thus both time-saving and sensible to learn as far as possible before travelling what officialdom will require of you. Most international airlines serve Moscow and many serve St Petersburg. However, Aeroflot and the independent companies, which have been created from its partial breaking-up, dominate the internal market. These are usually bad, sometime very bad. Like most areas in which foreigners operate, they are charged more for the same low service. However, genuinely private airlines are beginning - of which Transaero, with several destinations within Russia and the former Soviet Union, is the best. Travel agents should be consulted. Outside of Moscow and St Petersburg, food and hotels are at best adequate. If travelling widely, bookings should be made well in advance and confirmed shortly before arrival. Elementary items, such as towels and bottled water, should be taken and the traveller must be prepared to be patient and to wait. Although there is a tradition of warm hospitality in most parts of Russia, there is little or none of service and politeness: thus, public encounters are often abrasive and can quickly degenerate into squabbling. Sometimes shouting works, sometimes it makes matters worse. Negotiation and reaching agreement can be harder than in settled economies, although far from impossible and often more rewarding. The underlying issues which must be carefully examined are those of property rights, especially of land, legislation and taxation. The first can be very vague: that is in large part either because the law is vague and because title, even when apparently firmly vested, can in practice be hard to establish in court if challenged. The second, legislation, is a minefield of overlapping and contradictory laws which produce the effect of a field of struggle between the actors, rather than a reasonably ordered code which defines rights and responsibilities. Taxation, which for the moment is seen - especially by the oil companies - as usually the most severe problem, is serious because of the height of taxes and because of their variability. Companies, both Russian and foreign, must often pay taxes which can amount to more than their income: a clearly unsustainable position which is solved by evasion. Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, has recently promised to reduce taxes and to grant tax holidays to foreign investors. These issues can, of course, be clarified by reference to consultants, lawyers and accountants, of which there are now many - Russian and foreign - in Moscow, St Petersburg and, to a much lesser extent, elsewhere. But the advice cannot solve the basic problem that huge confusion exists in all these areas. Last on the downside: a business culture is only developing in Russia and in the other former Soviet states. This means that Russian business people can display one or more of the following characteristics: an extreme naivety which foreigners were and are not slow to exploit; extreme suspicion, which bedevils relationships, certainly at first; extreme untrustworthiness, which gives rise to the saying that Russian business people start to negotiate after an agreement has been signed. All of these views, made famous by anecdote, have a basis but they can be moderated by care and checking. The number of foreign companies - Unilever, ABB, Brown Boveri, BAT, Proctor &amp; Gamble, United Technologies and others - which are now investing with success or the expectation of it, show that the basis for business and profits exists, albeit on a fragile foundation. This has led us to the upside: it is a function of the steady opening-up of Russia and its neighbours which causes pain but which, nevertheless, continues. Russian politicians and officials, whatever their past and present views, are - often reluctantly - constrained to work within an economy which is being pulled towards that of the world economy; it is no longer possible to adopt an autarchic policy on either investment or on industrial structure. Although Russia has been independent for a little over three years only and though legislation and policies to create a full market structure are even younger, it is already evident that many, especially younger, Russians working in new sectors such as finance and banking, have experienced a steep learning curve and are anxious to reach standards of professionalism equal to those in developed economies. Increasingly, these are the people with whom foreign business visitors are working and collaborating. The influx of foreign capital, still slow compared with other developing countries, will be encouraged in the second part of this year by new laws and regulations prepared for the next phases of the privatisation process. Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister in charge of privatisation, has announced that the new privatisation programme will be designed to encourage much more rapid and significant strategic investment in the privatised Russian companies and has said that he wishes to attract much more foreign investment than he was able to do in the first phase. Already, foreign companies large and small have taken generally modest shares in the privatised companies and there are signs that some of them are prepared to go much further - buying out companies, creating majority shareholdings and making partnerships with Russian companies in key market sectors. The experience of those few companies which have already done so shows that, in spite of the macro-economic problems afflicting Russia, good and stable business can be done if the ground is well prepared. The development of foreign hotels, restaurants and shops in Moscow and St Petersburg has been rapid in the past three years, transforming the facilities for visiting and resident foreigners and for the growing, if still small, proportion of wealthy Russians. Prices are very high by international standards and often are grossly out of line with service. However, their development has meant that discomfort need not necessarily be an inevitable accompaniment of the business traveller.</p>

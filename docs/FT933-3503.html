			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Israel and the PLO: Polls show growing support for peace accord SUPPORT among Israelis and Palestinians for the peace agreement signed in Washington is steadily growing, according to a number of opinion polls published yesterday. Latest polls show that 62 per cent of Israeli Jews and 65 per cent of Palestinians support the 'Gaza-Jericho' peace accord although an even larger majority on both sides of the 'Green line', which divides Arab and Jew, support the holding of referendums on the agreement. In Israel a poll conducted by the Guttman Institute of Applied Social Research among Israeli Jews found that 62 per cent are in favour of the Gaza-Jericho deal, a marked increase on last week's 52 per cent. However, 66 per cent would like the government to hold a referendum or new elections. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, has ruled out holding new elections but said his government might call a referendum if the deal failed to get sufficient parliamentary support next week. Mr Rabin has repeatedly said the peace accord must get majority support in the Knesset without relying on the five Arab votes which make up his majority. At least 10 other Jewish members of the Knesset, including six MPs of his coalition partner Shas and one member of the right-wing Likud Party, are currently wavering between abstention and support. The Guttman Institute poll found many more Israeli Jews support handing over the economically decimated Gaza Strip - 81 per cent - than favour giving up the West Bank town of Jericho, which is backed by 59 per cent. Furthermore, on sensitive issues likely to dominate future negotiations over a permanent Israeli-Palestinian settlement, the poll showed Israeli Jews were much less compromising. Only 11 per cent favour concessions over the status of Jerusalem as a united city under Israeli jurisdiction and only 20 per cent think Israel should cede all or part of the rest of the West Bank. However 63 per cent are satisfied with the government's handling of the peace process. The right wing sought to whip up Israeli fears. The opposition Likud party said: 'The Israeli surrender to the demands of the murderous PLO won't bring peace to Israel but will only incite more terrorism and bereavement.' In an interview broadcast on Israeli television last night Mr Benjamin Netanyahu, Likud party leader, described yesterday's signing as 'an event of national humiliation. Arafat is an arch murderer of the most abominable kind'.</p>

			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHRYSLER OFFERS NO-INTEREST LOANS ON AUTOS  </P> <P> Chrysler Corp. escalated the car industry's cut-rate auto-financing wars today  by offering interest-free loans on its cars and trucks.  </P> <P> The zero-percent financing is the most drastic program yet offered by a U.S.  auto maker in an attempt to spur sagging sales.  </P> <P> The interest-free loans are based on repayment schedules of up to 24 months and  will be given for 1988 and 1989 U.S. car and truck models. Chrysler said the  sales incentive program has no expiration date.  </P> <P> The company is also offering rates of 5.9% to 10.9% on longer-term loans,  Chrysler said.  </P> <P> Last week, Ford Motor Co. launched the latest salvo in the incentive wars by  offering 2.9% short-term loans and expanding its other incentives. General  Motors Corp. matched that program on Friday.  </P> <P> Chrysler, which is also offering cash incentive programs ranging from $300 to  $2,000 per vehicle, said it has increased the incentives offered on a number of  car and truck models.  </P> <P> Bennett Bidwell, chairman of the Chrysler Motors Unit, said the auto maker does  not plan to reduce its second-quarter production schedules and thinks that  business will pick up due to the program.  </P> <P> Several weeks ago, Chrysler had announced a program featuring 4.9% loans that  at the time was its most extensive program since the late 1970s.  </P> <P> Bidwell said that program was created because the company saw that sales were  softening.  </P> <P> U.S. auto sales are down about 8% so far this year, and truck sales are off  about 2%.  </P> <P> Chrysler acknowledged that the cost of the new round of incentive programs will  have a slight negative impact on second-quarter results.  </P></p>

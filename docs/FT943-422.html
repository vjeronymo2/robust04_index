			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: US bonds It is difficult to see why the US bond market should have been in a positive mood yesterday. The Federal Reserve's decision not to raise interest rates on Tuesday night cannot be more than a temporary reprieve. Yesterday's durable goods data may have been distorted by the auto and aircraft sectors, but they still show underlying strength in manufacturing. On the most pessimistic reading, the Fed is now dithering while the economy strides ahead. There cannot be much comfort for the bond markets in that. One explanation for yesterday's gains is that the market now believes in a trade deal between Japan and the US which will remove the threat of sanctions and allow the yen to fall. A weaker yen would be good news for bond markets everywhere because it would encourage Japanese institutions to step up their investment abroad. But for the time being, this scenario smacks of wishful thinking. There would be a much greater chance of a weaker yen and a robust Japanese recovery if the Bank of Japan were to cut interest rates aggressively. The chances are therefore that the bond markets will soon revert to their old anxieties about the Fed's intentions. The question is now one of timing. A welter of data in the second week of October will shed fresh light on employment, capacity use and inflation. The Fed will then be under pressure again to show its muscle. As before, a small increase would simply leave the markets worrying about more rises to come. A large increase which signalled the end of the tightening process would be the only real comfort.</p>

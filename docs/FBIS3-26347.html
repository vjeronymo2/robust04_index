Yu Yongbo said that the current National Propaganda and  Ideological Work Conference is an important meeting of overall  significance held by the CPC Central Committee at the crucial  period when China is establishing a socialist market economic  system and carrying out the socialist modernization program. It  is the concrete embodiment of Deng Xiaoping's principle of doing  two kinds of work simultaneously and attaching importance to  both. It fully reflects the complete and accurate understanding  and mastery of the party's basic line by the third generation of  collective leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core. The  implementation of the spirit of the conference will be of great  significance to strengthening and improving propaganda and  ideological work in the new situation and strengthening the  building of socialist spiritual civilization and also be of  far-reaching influence on China's reform, opening up, and the  socialist modernization program.    Yu Yongbo pointed out: In light of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and  the spirit of the 14th party congress, and in view of the new  problems and circumstances facing reform and opening up,  particularly the establishment of a socialist market economic  system, General Secretary Jiang Zemin, in his report delivered  at the conference, made comprehensive and profound expositions  on the principles, fundamental tasks, and guiding ideology for  propaganda and ideological work, which illuminated the direction  for doing well propaganda and ideological work at present and  for a period in the future and served as the ground for  strengthening and improving Army ideological and political work.  The party committees and political organs at all levels must  earnestly study, understand, and resolutely implement them. In  practical work, we must also implement the guiding important  speeches made by Comrades Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, and Ding Guangen.    To implement General Secretary Jiang Zemin's report and the  spirit of the current National Propaganda and Ideological Work  Conference, Yu Yongbo emphasized, the most fundamental and  important task is to pay attention to the study of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. The primary task of the whole Army's political  work this year is to study well Volume 3 of the Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping. At the crucial period of reform,  opening up, and establishing a socialist market economic system,  the study of Deng's works is required for the Army to toe the  CPC Central Committee's line ideologically, politically, and in  action as well as to establish a powerful spiritual mainstay in  the Army and fundamentally enhance unity and increase combat  effectiveness. In accordance with the requirement of the  Central Military Commission and the General Political  Department, we stepped up the study of Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping at the previous stage  and launched a new drive of study throughout the Army. It was  indeed a good beginning. Through the implementation of the  spirit of the National Propaganda and Ideological Work  Conference, we should further increase our understanding of the  importance of applying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm the mind  of officers and men of the whole Army, and make the activities  of studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping more profound, solid, and fruitful.    In the new situation, Yu Yongbo pointed out, it is the great  historical responsibility of the comrades engaged in political  work, particularly those engaged in propaganda work, to follow  General Secretary Jiang's instructions, arm people with  scientific theories, guide them with correct opinion, mold them  with lofty spirit, and encourage them with outstanding works.  Yu Yongbo made a three-point requirements for cadres of the  whole Army engaged in propaganda work: First, step up  self-study, which should be currently focused on studying well  Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping.  Second, cadres engaged in propaganda work should be good at  making thorough investigation and study. Third, take an active  part in central work and expand the sphere of education work.    At the conference, Xu Caihou, deputy director of the General  Political Department, made specific proposals on studying  General Secretary Jiang's important speech: First, realize the  historical responsibility of propaganda and ideological work  from a high plane of the times and overall situation, brace up,  and attain better achievements. Second, keep a firm grip of the  fundamental principle of propaganda and ideological work and  make strenuous efforts to implement the fundamental task of  propaganda and ideological work. Third, carry out propaganda and  ideological work closely around the Army's central task and  offer ideological guarantee and spiritual motivation to the  modernization program. Fourth, enhance political firmness and  awareness and have a firm grasp of the correct ideological  guidance for the media. Fifth, focus attention on training  "people with lofty ideals, moral integrity, better education,  and a sense of discipline" and further strengthen ideological  and political work. Sixth, strengthen leadership over  propaganda and ideological work and build up a contingent of  propagandists who are political aware, professionally  proficient, and honest and upright in their ways.    The current All-Army Conference of Propaganda Chiefs is a  part of the National Propaganda and Ideological Work. We have  listened to the important reports at the conference, held  serious discussions in connection with the Army's reality,  further realized our mission, and enhanced our confidence.  Directors of the political departments under the major units of  the troops garrisoned in Beijing were present at today's  conference.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Rome, April 2 (AFP) -- An Italian lawyer lodged a  formal complaint Saturday [2 April], alleging that comments by  neo-fascist leader Gianfranco Fini praising former dictator  Benito Mussolini are against Italian anti-fascist laws.    Giosue Calabria, a barrister in the central northern city of  Bologna, claims the comments that Mussolini was "the greatest  statesman of the this century" breach a 1952 law banning any  public apology of fascism.    Calabria said the 1952 law could lead to prosecutions  against  "anyone who publicly exults the officials, the principles, the  facts or the methods of fascism," and should therefore apply to  Fini's comments.    Fini, whose National Alliance was in the three-party  rightwing coalition which swept to a landslide victory in  historic general elections on March 27-28, made the comments in  an interview published Friday.    In the daily LA STAMPA newspaper, Fini said Mussolini was  "the greatest statesman of this century," adding that Silvio  Berlusconi, whose Forza Italia dominates the winning alliance,  was no match for Il Duce.    "Berlusconi will have to run hard to show he is part of  history like Mussolini," he said in the interview.</p>

			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: POST CARDS SENT FROM THE VACATION'S EDGE  </P> <P> It seems everyone was apprehensive about going on a vacation this year except  President Bush and me. While the world was in chaos, he fished and played golf  in Maine and I traveled to Turkey and Greece in search of anything to look at  that was older than myself.  </P> <P> I don't presume to know what kind of a time the First Family had away from the  office, but with me, the answer to "Did you have a good time?" varied  drastically between the time I left Greece and the time I arrived home. I  always send myself a card to remind me.  </P> <P> * GREECE (the last day of vacation): "Did I have a good time? Are you crazy? I  am tanned, rested and stress-free. For three weeks, I have read, slept and  eaten when I felt like it. I have met interesting people and have seen the  antiquities of the world. I will never forget this trip."  </P> <P> * ATHENS AIRPORT (the next morning on the way home): "Did I have a good time?  Sure. Dear, you just ran over my foot with the cart. Where is Gate 41? What do  you mean there is no place to turn in our drachmas? You want me to buy $41  worth of chewing gum? That Turkish coffee maker will never fit under the seat.  Don't start with me. It is 4 a.m."  </P> <P> * LONDON HEATHROW (four hours later): "We did have a good time, didn't we? The  sun and all. I cannot believe we missed our connection. No sense getting tense.  We've got nine hours of bad food and troll seats to relax."  </P> <P> * DALLAS-FT. WORTH (nine hours later): "So I look like Margaret Mead with a  migraine. Thank you very much for sharing that. You don't look like you've just  had a vacation in . . . help me . . . Greece, either. What do you mean the  luggage is lost? Is that final? What does Customs want us to do? We go to what  counter? We were just there. And then the shuttle? And we have five minutes to  make our flight to Phoenix?"  </P> <P> * PHOENIX (the first morning home): "Did I have a good time? What kind of a  crack is that! All the clocks in the house are blinking. The yard died.  Something smells in the refrigerator. I need to go to the store, but it's only  3 a.m. I would do the laundry if we had our luggage. So I'll sit around and  read three weeks of old horoscopes."  </P> <P> * ONE WEEK AFTER VACATION: The pictures are back and are overexposed. They cost  more than the national budget of Brazil. We received the card in the mail we  sent to ourselves. It reads, "Having a fantastic time."  </P> <P> My husband looked over my shoulder and observed, "The scenery is beautiful.  Where is that postmark again?"  </P> <P> "Syros," I said. "It's in Greece."  </P> <P> "We should go there someday," he said. "We never take a vacation."  </P></p>

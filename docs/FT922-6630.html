			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / SFO probes payroll company THE Serious Fraud Office is investigating how Payroll Services, a private payments company, allegedly diverted more than Pounds 24m of PAYE and National Insurance payments from the Inland Revenue and may have invested in a string of properties and a Spanish villa. Payroll Services, based in Sutton, south London, which serves more than 500 banks and financial institutions around the capital, went into provisional liquidation last month after the Inland Revenue discovered that one of the companies had fallen badly behind on its tax payments. Touche Ross, the accountancy firm acting as provisional liquidator, said the SFO is also investigating Payroll Services's parent, the Wren Group, where some of the money was allegedly transferred, and the directors of the companies. The Inland Revenue is understood to have extended an informal moratorium on the payment of these missing taxes. But it says Payroll Services' clients - which include a number of London offices of large Japanese and European banks - will have to make a second tax payment if the missing funds are not recovered. Payroll Services is one of a number of groups that have grown rapidly in recent years as smaller companies contract out the monthly payment of salary, PAYE and national insurance. The company handled more than Pounds 30m of such payments each month. According to the Touche Ross report, Wren Group appears to have invested in 55 properties, some of them residential, while Payroll Services owned a Pounds 75,000 villa in Spain. Mr Terence Wright, who owns all but one of Payroll Services's shares, is among a number of directors being pursued by Touche Ross. Among Wren Group's assets is an office building in Sutton which is nearly fully let to a number of smaller companies on short leases. Among the other subsidiaries of the Wren Group are a photographic company; a distributor of hydraulic parts and equipment; a property refurbishment company and an insurance broker. Last month the Bank of England called for provisional liquidators to be appointed to a financial arm of George H. Jackson, Payroll Services's Sutton-based auditors, which had carried on 'a banking-type business', Touche Ross said. The arm had been operating without the required Bank of England licence.</p>

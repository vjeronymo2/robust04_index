			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AZTECS GET A LIFT, END LOSS STREAK AT 3 GAMES  </P> <P> If a victory over a two-year-old Division I basketball program can have much  meaning, then maybe some good will come out of San Diego State's 93-78 victory  over Florida International at the San Diego Sports Arena Wednesday night.  </P> <P> Because if there was ever a team that needed a boost, it was the Aztecs. Losers  of three in a row and 10 of their past 12, the Aztecs were thankful for any  victory, even one against a program that as a recently as two years ago was  playing teams such as Palm Beach Atlantic and opened this season against  Florida Memorial.  </P> <P> "This game came at a good time, and if we can win Saturday night (against U.S.  International) maybe we can have a little momentum going into our trip (next  week) to New Mexico and Texas El Paso," said junior guard Tony Ross, who scored  a season-high 25 points before fouling out with 2:07 left. "These games could  be the most important of the season because they can give us a little boost  going into the conference tournament."  </P> <P> That is not to say any of the Aztecs would confuse a victory over the Golden  Panthers (9-16) with one against any member of the Western Athletic Conference,  but at this point of what has become a disappointing season for the Aztecs  (11-14), any hopeful sign is encouraging.  </P> <P> "It wasn't pretty, but we'll take it," said reserve guard Rodney Jones, who  scored a season-high nine points. "We needed something to go our way."  </P> <P> The Aztecs established control early behind the shooting of Ross, who scored  nine of his 25 points in the first 5 minutes. Ross took advantage of a  man-to-man defense that left him unguarded for several layups and long-range  jumpers.  </P> <P> "When you get out of league, teams don't have a long time to scout you, and  they leave shooters open," SDSU Coach Jim Brandenburg said. "You turn him  loose, and he is going to score. We did a good job getting him the basketball,  and he did a good job getting it into the hole."  </P> <P> Ross was one of four Aztecs, but the only starter, to score a season high  against the Golden Panthers as Brandenburg used the game to substitute freely.  Much of that was out of choice, but quite a bit was out of necessity. Four  Aztecs fouled out, including three starters -- center Mitch McMullen, power  forward Sam Johnson and Ross.  </P> <P> For McMullen, it was his ninth disqualification, third in his past four games  and his earliest of the season. McMullen fouled out with 11:18 to play with six  points and six rebounds.  </P> <P> The numerous substitutions made for some unusual combinations. At one point the  Aztecs were playing with two walk-on guards -- William Dixion and Kevin  Honaker.  </P> <P> "I was just trying to give some guys who haved played much some playing time,"  Brandenburg said. "At some times our combinations were kind of strange."  </P> <P> Brandenburg hardly appeared worried about it all. He kept starters Shawn Bell  and Michael Best on the bench even with Florida International as close as 10  points in the final 3 minutes.  </P> <P> But the Golden Panthers were never able to get much closer. The loss was only  their third in the past nine games. They had revived their season after a 1-13  midyear swoon.  </P> <P> The Aztecs' 93 points were the most since a 102-88 victory over UC Irvine, but  the crowd of 1,768 was the worst since 1,529 attended a New Year's Eve victory  over Vermont and the third worst in the past two seasons.  </P> <P> "We were not at our sharpest," Brandenburg said. "We got out to an early lead  and just (traded baskets) for most of the night. The one good thing was we had  a chance to play a lot of the younger players."  </P></p>

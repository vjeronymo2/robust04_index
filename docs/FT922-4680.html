			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: CIS grain trade switch forecast THE FORMER Soviet Union, which has supported the world grain market for 20 years with its huge purchases, could be transformed into a grain exporter by the turn of the century, trade experts believe, reports Reuter from Berlin. For many grain traders meeting here at the annual congress of Coceral, the European Community cereals lobby, the question was not whether members of the Commonwealth of Independent States would achieve self-sufficiency, but when. 'By the year 2000 Russia could be independent of grain imports,' predicted Mr Rudolf Stoehr, Coceral's president. Higher prices, falling demand and a new incentive to produce for the market would all contribute the shift, he said. And Ukraine and Kazahkstan - two key grain-producing republics - could be exporting well before then. Mr Oleg Klimov, head of the Exportkhleb, grain agent for Russia and 12 other former Soviet republics, looked forward to the day when he would execute exports instead of imports. 'In five years' time we might well be an exporter,' he said. 'Look at Poland and Czechoslovakia. They were importers two years ago, now they are exporters. The same can happen in our country.' Mr Klimov said imports in the 1992-93 season, starting next month, would plunge to between 20m and 25m tonnes from 38m tonnes in 1991-92. The International Wheat Council recently predicted a more cautious figure of 27m tonnes. But the trend is clear - and this time a bigger crop in 1992 is only part of the reason. Price liberalisation has triggered a structural change in grain consumption within the CIS. In the past, huge subsidies meant bread cost only 50 per cent of the price of the wheat used to make it. So farmers fed whole loaves to their pigs. Today rocketing prices have pushed many foodstuffs out of consumers' reach and consumption has crashed. 'Consumption of grain for food and (animal) feed will decline significantly,' Mr Stoehr said. Higher prices should also give more incentive for action on the notorious waste problems. Nearly one third of the CIS grain crop is wasted, either eaten by pests or spoiled by rain while it lies on the ground waiting to be collected by trains and trucks.</p>

Accompanied by Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan, Li Tieying today made  an investigative tour of the Beijing Optical Glass Mart, the  Hongyun Company, Ltd; the Beijing Matches Company, Ltd; and the  Beijing Daily Use Chemical Plant No. 2. After hearing briefings  on the four enterprises' experience in implementing  supplementary reforms, Li Tieying affirmed the progress that the  No. 1 Light Industry Corporation has lately scored in trying out  supplementary reforms. He pointed out that one of the major  feature of the corporation's experiment is its efforts to  implement supplementary reforms, rationalize all sorts of  internal relations within the corporation, and transform its  operational mechanism for the purpose of establishing a modern  enterprise system in line with guidelines of the third plenary  session and the requirements of the "Company Law."    Li Tieying said that the goal of the experiment with the  modern enterprise system is to explore effective ways to merge  the public sector of the economy --the state sector in  particular -- with the market economy. He pointed out that a  socialist market economy is an economy based on management by  law. Enterprises must formulate new chapters in accordance with  the modern enterprise system, strictly abide by these chapters,  and use them to regulate enterprise activity and relations so  that enterprise management is truly separated from government  administration and ownership from management.    Officials of relevant departments including Liu Zhifeng and  Li Runwu took part in the investigative tour.</p>

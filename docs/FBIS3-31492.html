			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, February 17 (CTK) -- An article in the  political weekly RESPEKT comments on the announcement by the  World Bank that it was ending all negotiations concerning a  second loan of $225 million to the Czech Energy Works (CEZ) to  be invested into improving the polluting coal-fired power  stations of north Bohemia.    The World Bank's decision to stop the Energy II loan comes  just as the American congress is deciding whether to guarantee a  loan of $317 million from the Ex-Im Bank to the Westinghouse  company for the completion of Temelin nuclear power station in  south Bohemia.    A report issued by the Bank Information Center, an  independent organization monitoring the work of several large  banks, gives lack of interest on the part of the Czech  Government as the reason for ending the talks on the Energy II  loan. "Our relations with the World Bank have cooled so much  that the talks were not going well," RESPEKT quotes CEZ  spokesman Michal Kacena as saying.    Kacena said Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus was to blame here for  having said in Washington at the end of last year that the Czech  Republic was not so badly off as to need developmental aid.    Detailed reasons for the freezing of negotiations between  the  World Bank and the Czech side remain unclear, RESPEKT says, but  very probably concern the inability of the Czech Government to  guarantee the loan from its resources, which are almost used up  from guaranteeing the first loan (Energy I), the Ingolstadt  pipeline, the development of telecommunications and the motorway  to Germany, and now possibly for the Ex-Im Bank loan for Temelin.    RESPEKT said the key question was put to the CEZ chief  spokesman last week when the English-language weekly THE PRAGUE  POST asked if the reason for stopping the Energy II loan was  that the money necessary for state guarantee had been swallowed  up by the guarantee for Temelin. The answer was "probably yes."    It can be seen once more, RESPEKT writes, that last year's  government decision to complete Temelin is bringing the country  a whole number of economic problems. Moreover, it is being  confirmed that the completion of Temelin is using up money which  would otherwise be invested into north Bohemia.    The two loans from the World Bank, which refuses to finance  nuclear power in any way, are to help desulfurize coal-fired  power stations and to make their operation more efficient.    If the Energy II loan is not forthcoming, CEZ has three  means  of finding money to clean up the coal-fired power stations.  Either it slows down their closure program and does not  desulfurize them, or it increases the price of electricity, or  it exports electricity.    Already last year CEZ broke a government regulation by  exporting around 3 percent of the total electricity produced  here instead of the approved 1.5 percent. Most of this went to  Italy and Switzerland. If this had not happened, RESPEKT  writes, at least two of the four blocs of the Tusimice II coal  power station [could have been closed].    Last year the export of electricity brought CEZ 2 billion  crowns. The completion of Temelin costs approximately 20 million  crowns a day.    The Children of the Earth environmental organization wants  parliament to approve a law saying that the annual export of  electricity may not exceed its import (last year the Czech  Republic exported 3000 GwH and imported 885 GwH).    Meanwhile CEZ makes no secret of the future export of  electricity from Temelin. "Financing the loan for Temelin  nuclear power station to the amount of 30 billion crowns will  ensure without problems the future production of electricity in  this power station and its sale at home or abroad. The  repayment of foreign credits by future export (approximately a  quarter of the yearly output for 10 years) would also help the  Czech Republic's hard currency balance," the CEZ public  relations department said in 1992.    At the close of the article RESPEKT points out that last  year's report by the World Bank (the one which Klaus said was  "written overnight in a hotel," and therefore held no force for  the Czech Government) says that "the medium-demand scenario for  electricity shows that there will be no need of electricity from  Temelin between 1995 and 2010." The report was written by Dale  Grey, chief economist of the World Bank's Energy and  Environmental Division.</p>

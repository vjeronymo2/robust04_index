During the weekend [26-27 March]  the foreign ministers presented a compromise proposal to their  London colleague Douglas Hurd as a last offer in Ioannina,  Greece, a proposal in which they do not yield one millimeter of  substance. They only built a bridge for Hurd, across which he  can retreat. What the British wanted to prevent at all costs has  now been set down: In an enlarged union it will no longer be 23  votes but 27 that are necessary to build a blocking minority.  The smaller minority then can still delay decisions, according  to the formal concession -- and that until the Council decides  the end of the debate with a simple majority in line with its  standing orders. Then the matter is decided with the usual  qualified majority of 70 percent.    However, this has been the usual procedure at the European  Council of Ministers' meetings anyway, because for them how one  treats the other is more important than the arithmetic of votes.  In Brussels the government representatives are not overly  surprised when the votes are taken. Quite the opposite: The  decisions of the Council are usually clarified in the "Committee  of Permanent Representatives" of the 12 governments, which comes  before the Council of Ministers' meetings. If the ambassador of  a larger member country, such as the United Kingdom, objects,  the other 11 discuss the matter with him and postpone the  pending decision.    The ambassadors virtually buy from each other, with  compromises, the majority that they think politically  appropriate. Occasionally, the opposition exhibited by any one  of them is nothing but a game with marked cards to deceive the  opposing forces at home. This means: Quite a few ministers do  not mind being outvoted in Brussels. However, if things get  tough sometimes, the oppressed government has the last resort of  stressing a "vital national interest" and blocking the decision.  Just last autumn France got into the headlines when it  threatened to veto the European-U.S. agricultural agreements  within the framework of the GATT round. The Germans definitely  could have put in their veto in the past to prevent Brussels'  bad banana protectionism. However the Bonn agriculture minister  himself "betrayed" consumers' interests because he had to follow  the producers' interests.    Douglas Hurd knows what conditions in Brussels are like and  he knows very well that London's struggle for 23 instead of 27  votes is quixotic. He has probably joined the insight of a  growing part of his faction, namely that the foreign policy  damage that Great Britain is doing to itself far exceeds the  benefit of a compromise about balancing the votes, in particular  since this benefit can hardly be measured. From the British  viewpoint, it would make sense to struggle generally against the  instrument of majority vote in the Brussels Council of  Ministers, with the goal of turning the EU back into a forum of  cooperation among states. Just modifying the qualified majority  seems to be pointless since even opponents of European  integration, such as the British, are occasionally very  interested in pushing something through in Brussels.    Great Britain, for instance, is the pioneer of a liberal  economic constitution in the EU. Precisely at the time when, by  being enlarged to 16, the traditionally protectionist majority  of the current 12 member states might turn into a liberal  majority, which would be acceptable to the British as they want  to make votes by qualified majority more difficult. Today,  Tuesday, Secretary Hurd will try to make it clear to his  stubborn party colleagues that in Europe, Great Britain has  meanwhile acquired the bad reputation of being erratic and is  dramatically losing political weight. "Lightweights," however,  are actually very much in need of the instrument of majority  vote.</p>

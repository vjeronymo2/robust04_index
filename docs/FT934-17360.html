			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Technology: Warning] Warning] black ice - Worth watching An electronic device which can detect black ice, and warn drivers of icy patches before accidents occur, has been developed in France, by Metera of Sille-le-Guillaume. The battery-powered logging device is positioned at the side of the road at notorious black spots. There it measures the temperature of the air and road surface and the humidity. It calculates whether the road surface is dangerous including such factors as the exposure of the site, tree cover and winds. The Emac 90 logging system communicates the information to the relevant authorities automatically using a phone line. Alternatively, a road sign can be illuminated to warn drivers.

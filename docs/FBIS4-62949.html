			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 18 May -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev has highly praised the results of today's  Russian-Finnish summit attended by the presidents of the two  countries: Boris Yeltsin and Martti Ahtisaari.    During a conversation with journalists at the end of the  talks, he said that Finland has given Russia great support in  the implementation of its initiative to create a post of the  commissioner for Baltic sea countries for human rights,  including the rights of people belonging to ethnic minorities.  This complicated matter will be discussed at the forthcoming  meeting in Tallinn between representatives from the Baltic sea  countries, which will also be attended by the Russian foreign  minister.    It is the Finnish diplomacy, according to him, which played  a  mediatory role and helped to work out a compromise according to  which the commissioner has been given a clear mandate to deal  with human rights in the Baltics. "High standards reached in the  area of human rights in Finland, Sweden, and other countries of  the Baltic sea must be emulated," continued the minister. "We  are not demanding privileges for the Russian speaking  population, but we are demanding equality and will not  compromise on this."    Andrey Kozyrev said that in August there will be meeting of  representatives from the Barents sea countries and that Finland  is involved in the preparation of the meeting.    Andrey Kozyrev noted that not all the questions on the  agenda  were easy, "But what is important is that they are not at the  heart of a political dispute." One of the most important  positive factors in Russian-Finnish relations is the fact that  neither side has any territorial claims. "All these matters have  been fully settled through bilateral agreements and through the  CSCE," he said.</p>

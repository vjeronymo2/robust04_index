			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / The Clinton-Yeltsin Summit: West's backing for Yeltsin a big gamble THE Clinton-Yeltsin summit cannot be a success on its own. It is the formal centrepiece of a process of organising aid for Russian reform: a process which should see clear decisions made on assistance by the foreign and finance ministers of the Group of Seven countries in Tokyo in ten days' time, but which cannot be consummated without a political victory for Russia's reformers. President Yeltsin came to Vancouver having committed himself to taking part in an April 25 popular vote which he initially called on questions of trust in his presidency and approval of a draft constitution. Just before the summit, he agreed instead to a referendum under the control of his opponents in the parliament. In this poll the question of trust remains, but is supplemented by questions on social and economic reform and on elections of the president and the parliament. Further, these questions must win a majority of more than 50 per cent of the electorate - a high qualifying margin which may render the exercise inconclusive - as intended by parliament. Yet from this vote - if it goes ahead - Mr Yeltsin must claim enough of a political victory to allow him to dominate parliament and to protect reform. Only if this is possible can foreign aid be applied. President Bill Clinton and other western leaders are thus right to say they are betting heavily on Mr Yeltsin. But if he does pull it off, says one senior western official, 'stabilisation of the economy is closer than it has ever been'. The government has a plan, drawn up by Mr Boris Fyodorov, who was at the Vancouver talks, and as deputy prime minister in charge of finance and the economy is the shaper and controller of economic change. He has told western governments he will need, in the coming year, Dollars 20bn for stabilisation of the rouble, support of the budget and restructuring of industry. He may not get it all. But he should get at least half, and with that he can start his transformation. The western countries are likely to change the way aid is provided. They will bypass the International Monetary Fund, for over a year the west's arbiter of Russian reform and disburser of aid. The IMF will continue to judge the performance of the government and to work with it to set targets. But the leaders of the G7 now appear determined to take the disbursement of aid into their own hands. It should mean that, rather than aid being held out as a reward for good behaviour, it would be given in order to promote good behaviour. Rather than demand a budget deficit of 5 per cent of gross national product, for example, as the IMF has done over the past year, funds would be provided to support the budget which would make such a target realistic. Mr Brian Mulroney, the Canadian prime minister, made the new relationship between the IMF and its chief paymasters clear in Vancouver when he said that 'after all, the leading industrial countries are the majority of the shareholders of the IMF' - a sign that the Fund will be subordinate to the perceived necessity of helping a reform process which cannot conform to the Fund's guidelines. Thus, in two weeks, the G7 should have completed their side of the bargain. They will have offered Russia a substantial package of support which would allow its government to make the critical moves to bring inflation under control and to make the rouble convertible on current account. However, there remains a doubt that Russia's politics will stabilise sufficiently to support the policies on which the provision of aid is predicated. While Mr Yeltsin enjoyed the hospitality of Vancouver, his opponents - and even his allies - in Russia were undermining his position. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, denounced the west for taking sides in the struggle between parliament and president. Mr Valery Zorkin, the head of the constitutional court, called Mr Yeltsin's participation in the summit a waste of time. And Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister who had last week said that Mr Yeltsin's support of the government was indispensable to reforms, launched a savage attack on his own deputy prime minister in charge of privatisation, Mr Anatoly Chubais, for conducting a programme reminiscent of the Stalinist collectivisation of the peasant farms in the 1920s and 1930s. Though Mr Chernomyrdin and the other corporatists in the cabinet have accepted that stabilisation is essential, they are not reconciled to privatisation. 'Our interests lie with Russian reforms and with Russian reformers led by Boris Yeltsin,' Mr Clinton has said. Now Mr Yeltsin, after the unequivocal support delivered in Vancouver this weekend, must show that he really does lead, and that the reformers are still in a position to be led.</p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): What is an AVC? An additional voluntary contribution (AVC) is a company pension arrangement set up by the employer to run in conjunction with the main scheme. It allows members to top up their benefits to the maximum permitted by the Inland Revenue. For most members, the maximum pension is two-thirds of their final salary (but see below for higher earners). Employees can pay up to 15 per cent of annual salary into company pensions but most schemes require members to contribute about 5 per cent. This leaves up to 10 per cent to invest in AVCs. Where the scheme is non-contributory - that is, funded solely by the employer - employees can invest the full 15 per cent in AVCs. Some employees' pension contributions and benefits are restricted by the 'pensions cap', which was introduced in the 1989 Budget. This restricts the amount of salary on which pension contributions can be based to Pounds 76,800 for the 1994-95 tax year (Pounds 78,600 in 1995-96). In the present tax year, capped scheme members can pay a maximum of Pounds 11,520 (15 per cent of Pounds 76,800) to their company scheme and AVC combined, while the maximum pension that can be taken is Pounds 50,690 (two-thirds of Pounds 76,800). Most company AVCs are run by life offices and building societies and the investment choice can be very limited. Free-standing AVCs (FSAVCs) are similar to company AVCs but the employee has an individual contract with the provider. They offer a wider investment choice but the employee bears all the charges, unlike company AVCs where the employer shares this burden. AVCs and FSAVCs offer tax relief on contributions, tax-free roll-up of the fund and, for those who started AVC contributions before April 1987, the possibility of tax-free cash. The fund is used at retirement to buy an annuity which provides a regular income for life.</p>

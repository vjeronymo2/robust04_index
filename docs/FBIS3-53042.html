They sustained their injuries when a fragmentation grenade was  thrown at a TV crew working on behalf of the Army spokesman,  documenting events in the Strip before the IDF [Israel Defense  Forces] pullout. As the area was combed, rioting broke out,  during which a young Palestinian was injured and taken to  hospital.</p>

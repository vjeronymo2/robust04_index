			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHAWN MOORE TO START FOR VIRGINIA AGAINST VOLS;  </P> <P> SUGAR BOWL: INJURY TO RIGHT THUMB HAS HEALED ENOUGH FOR QUARTERBACK TO RESUME  HIS POSITION.  </P> <P> Quarterback Shawn Moore has recovered sufficiently from an injured right thumb  to start against 10th-ranked Tennessee in the Sugar Bowl, and that's the way it  ought to be, Virginia backup quarterback Matt Blundin said.  </P> <P> "Shawn Moore will be the starter," Virginia Coach George Welsh said. "We feel  like he has progressed enough, and his hand is not a real problem physically.  He is going to be the guy we go with."  </P> <P> Moore dislocated his thumb on the final play against Maryland on Nov. 17, and  the operation to repair it left a puffy, red scar across the base of his hand.  </P> <P> Blundin said Moore deserves to start, even though it means he must defer a  childhood dream.  </P> <P> "All that Shawn's done since he's been here, he's basically been the  quarterback that has brought this program up," Blundin said. "You have to give  him the start if he's at least ready to take the snaps and throw the ball."  </P> <P> Moore led the nation in passing efficiency this season, completing 144 of 241  passes for 2,262 yards and 21 touchdowns. He also triggered Virginia's option  running attack, gaining 306 yards and running for eight touchdowns.  </P> <P> He had Virginia ranked No. 1 for three weeks in October before a 1-3 finish  toppled the Cavaliers out of the AP poll. Moore finished fourth in Heisman  voting.  </P> <P> Under other circumstances, Blundin would relish the chance to be the starter.  "It would be a special kick. It would be. That's an understatement," he said.  </P> <P> "It would be the biggest thrill for me since I've been playing sports, to be  able to start in the Sugar Bowl. You watch these things when you're a little  kid and imagine yourself doing it. Just being a part of it is great.  </P> <P> "You probably hear that from everybody, but it's so true."  </P> <P> In his lone start this year, against Virginia Tech, Blundin passed for 305  yards and two touchdowns.  </P> <P> Welsh said Blundin is a smart quarterback with a strong arm and the confidence  of his teammates, but isn't Moore's equal on the option.  </P> <P> Defensive tackle Joe Hall, who lines up against Blundin every day in practice,  went a step further in praising the 6-foot-7 quarterback.  </P> <P> "I personally think Matt Blundin is a great quarterback," he said. "He's going  to be a great pro quarterback some day. You'll see him next year breaking a lot  of Shawn's records."  </P> <P> Tennessee defensive coordinator Larry Lacewell said he believes Blundin, who  also plays for Virginia's 19th-ranked basketball team, is underrated as a  runner.  </P> <P> "You don't want to see that big red oak tree coming down the line of scrimmage  at you," Lacewell said. "At 6-7, he ought to be able to fall forward and gain  five yards."  </P> <P> Blundin also took exception to the idea that he is an immobile quarterback. "I  guess people have this perception that because I'm 6-foot-7 I can't run or  can't move out of the pocket. That's wrong," he said. "I'm agile enough to play  basketball, I'm agile enough to move out of the pocket."  </P> <P> Tennessee (8-2-2) is favored.  </P></p>

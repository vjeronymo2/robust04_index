			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Arts: Today's Television Until recently the difficulty on Fridays was to decide which old movies to watch. Now, all of a sudden, there is none. The only production billed as a 'film' tonight is an old American TV drama, Murder In The City Of Angels. It was supposed to provide a series vehicle for George Peppard, playing a 1940s policeman, but never got beyond this pilot (10.20 BBC1). Dr Quinn: Medicine Woman should have been abandoned at the pilot stage, but wasn't. Jane Seymour plays a doctor on the wild west frontier where everyone else acts in a manner befitting the 1860s - parochial, masculinist, Indian hating - while she expresses all the politically correct ideas of the 1980s. Odd. (8.00 ITV). BBC2 pilots another American series, Parenthood, which follows the fortunes of four generations of the Buckman family and is, we are told, 'heart warming'. This could be code for 'mawkishly sentimental'. Stand by for something that makes 'Little House On The Prairie' look rigorous and Tolstoyan (7.00). One Foot In The Past is a new series about 'the issues that shape Britain's heritage' (9.30 BBC2).</p>

			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Barry Wehmiller rises 8% BARRY Wehmiller International, the packaging equipment manufacturer, lifted pre-tax profits by 8 per cent, from Pounds 6.55m to Pounds 7.1m, for the year ended July 31. Turnover of the group, which makes about half its sales in dollars, rose by more than 15 per cent from Pounds 73.7m to Pounds 85.2m. About Pounds 4m of the increase was a result of the strength of the dollar against sterling. Mr Stewart Brown, chief executive, said yesterday that the group had benefited from its industrial and geographic spread at a time of difficult markets. It had found new business in the Far East and Latin America to offset lower sales in its traditional European and US markets. However, margins in the new markets were lower, while margins in Europe and the US continued to be under pressure. Turnover in the pharmaceutical and general packaging division rose from Pounds 38.6m to Pounds 46.1m, generating operating profits of Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 2.26m). The group said that sales to the pharmaceutical and personal care markets now accounted for 33 per cent of the group total. The vision division, which scans bottles and packages, also lifted operating profits, from Pounds 670,000 to Pounds 1.26m on turnover of Pounds 20.9m (Pounds 18.2m). Both volumes and margins had strengthened, Mr Brown said. Operating profits at the food equipment division fell from Pounds 3.49m to Pounds 2.1m on turnover of Pounds 18.2m (Pounds 17m). Mr Brown said the fall reflected an unprecedented low investment level from the UK dairy industry, which is undergoing a structural change with the demise of the Milk Marketing Board. Mr Brown expected demand for capital equipment to remain slow and unpredictable in the US and Europe. Nevertheless, he felt that the last two years of consolidation were now behind the group, which has started to look for acquisitions. Total operating profits were up from Pounds 6.42m to Pounds 6.8m. Net interest receivable was Pounds 279,000 (Pounds 133,000). Net cash in hand at the year end was Pounds 2.6m, down from Pounds 4.9m last year, mainly because of exchange factors. Earnings per share rose to 11p (10.7p). An unchanged final dividend of 4.3p is proposed, giving a maintained total for the year of 6.7p.</p>

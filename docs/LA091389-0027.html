			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> COCKER STILL ROILING AND BOILING  </P> <P> Remember the devastating Joe Cocker imitation John Belushi used to do on  "Saturday Night Live": twitching movements, bleary eyes and all? Remember the  time Joe himself -- good-naturedly but misguidedly -- joined Belushi for a  round of dueling Cockers, apparently oblivious to the fact that at least as  many people were laughing at him as with him?  </P> <P> Well, Cocker can have the last laugh. With Belushi a long-gone victim of the  kind of excesses Cocker has conquered, the mad-dog Englishman was a performer  at the peak of his powers Monday at the Universal Amphitheatre. That famous  phlegmy, nodal, raspy roar is better than ever, as is his way with, around and  through a song. Even the cheap sentimentality of "Up Where We Belong" and "You  Are So Beautiful" came out like real passion. (Of course, he could sing the  college football results in Sanskrit and make it seem like real passion.)  </P> <P> Fortunately, though, there was only a little cheap sentimentality Monday. The  generous two-hour set was dominated by the kind of roiling, boiling  R&amp;B-based rockers that made Cocker famous. Selections both old ("Feelin'  Alright," "The Letter," the once-again-familiar "A Little Help From My  Friends") and new (a straight take on Leonard Cohen's wry "I'm Your Man")  benefited from the alive playing of the 13-piece band, which included long-time  Cocker mainstay Chris Stainton on keyboards and the unsurpassed Memphis Horns.  </P> <P> But it was Cocker himself -- singing up a storm, leaping with joy to close each  song, sincerely grateful for the reception from the largely neat, largely  middle-aged but hardly restrained audience -- who made the show happen. Why, he  made aging seem like something to look forward to. And how many other survivors  of the Woodstock Wonder Years can say that? STEVE HOCHMAN  </P></p>

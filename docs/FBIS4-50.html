			<p>In      a move suggesting that Pyongyang is still seeking to preserve  avenues of dialogue with Washington, the North Korean leadership  pulled some of its rhetorical punches vis-a-vis the United States  in this year's media treatment of the 25 April anniversary of the  founding of the Korean People's Army (KPA).  During this year's  otherwise routine commemoration, Vice Marshal Kim Kwang-chin in  his keynote speech, carried by Pyongyang radio on 24 April,  avoided portraying the Koreans as having led "the anti-  imperialist, anti-U.S. struggle" of the entire "revolutionary  peoples of the world"--a prominent theme in last year's keynote  speech, which was delivered by KPA Chief of Staff Choe Kwang  (Pyongyang radio, 24 April 1993).  Moreover, Kim's speech omitted  specific mention of the United States in touting the KPA's  achievements at one point, saying merely that the army had won  "victory" over the two "imperialist powers" in "the anti-Japanese  revolutionary war" and the Korean war--a departure from the  standard depiction of the KPA as having smashed "the two  imperialisms of the United States and Japan."      In line with the rhetorical restraint on the United States,  Pyongyang media have not been observed to report or comment on  Assistant Secretary of State Robert L. Gallucci's recent trip to  South Korea, in spite of the fact that he was widely reported to  have discussed the possibility of UN sanctions against North  Korea over the nuclear issue (Seoul KBS-1 radio, 18 April).  Assistant Secretary Gallucci headed the U.S. delegation last  summer in the U.S.-North Korea high-level talks.     (AUTHOR:  YIM.

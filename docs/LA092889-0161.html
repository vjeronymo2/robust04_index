			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE RESCINDS FRAUD RULING AGAINST SHIPYARD ON NAVY CONTRACT  </P> <P> A federal judge has withdrawn a judgment in which he ruled that one of the  largest shipyard companies on the West Coast committed mail fraud and acted  with fraudulent intent against the U.S. Navy.  </P> <P> In settling a lawsuit between competing shipyards, U.S. District Judge Stanley  A. Weigel on Tuesday withdrew an earlier summary judgment against Southwest  Marine Inc., according to a court clerk and shipyard attorneys.  </P> <P> The Aug. 8 judgment found that the company acted "with intent to deceive,  manipulate and defraud" the Small Business Administration and the Navy in the  fall of 1983 to win a contract worth up to $150 million.  </P> <P> The judgment was a precursor to a trial to decide a lawsuit brought by three  competing shipyards against Southwest Marine. The lawsuit alleged that  Southwest Marine used unfair means to win a contract to fix four Navy ships.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Earlier Finding  </P> <P> Despite Weigel's latest action, a spokeswoman for the Navy's Sea Systems  Command, which oversees the repair of naval vessels, said Wednesday that Navy  officials were still considering sanctions against Southwest Marine in light of  the judge's earlier finding.  </P> <P> Southwest Marine maintained in a statement, however, that the rescinding of the  judge's order eliminates the possibility that the company would be barred from  bidding on future government jobs. Repairs on Navy ships provide about 80% of  the workload for Southwest Marine's 2,500 employees, company officials said.  </P> <P> An attorney for Southwest Marine said the judge's latest decision gives the  company a "clean bill of health" in its dealings with the government.  </P> <P> "As far as we're concerned, it's (back to) business as usual," said Lloyd  Schwartz, vice president and legal counsel for the San Diego-based ship  repairer.  </P> <P> Southwest Marine is one of the largest remaining ship repair businesses  remaining in the West, with facilities in San Pedro, San Diego, San Francisco,  Portland and American Samoa.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Comment  </P> <P> Weigel, through his clerk, declined to comment on the decision to rescind his  earlier ruling.  </P> <P> The judge issued the first ruling in August in reaction to a finding that the  company fired more than 500 employees for a single week in late 1982, only to  hire them back a week later. The practice allegedly was a thinly veiled attempt  to qualify as a small business under SBA rules. Only businesses with 1,000  employees or fewer were eligible to bid on the lucrative Navy contract.  </P></p>

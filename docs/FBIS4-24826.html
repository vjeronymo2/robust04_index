			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, 20 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) --  "Knowledge assets" and "goodwill assets" are what have helped  Guangdong people repeatedly prevail in business battles.  Quietly, an enthusiasm for "intangible assets appraisal" is  growing across Guangdong. The strange power of this "magic  weapon" employed by Guangdong people is being popularized and  standardized.    One year ago, China's first "intangible assets appraisal  office" was established in Shenzhen, opening a new chapter in  the history of scientific appraisal and fair pricing of patented  technologies, copyrights, business franchises, service  trademarks, and approval rights owned by Chinese firms and  intellectuals. The Shenzhen City Intangible Assets Appraisal  Office has made over 30 appraisal reports commissioned by more  than 20 clients.    Sources revealed that the office assessed the trademarks and  goodwill of the "Sanjiu" Corporation to be worth roughly 700  million yuan, and the formula for Yunnan Baiyao [a medicine] at  over 40 million yuan. When a university bought into a  joint-stock enterprise with one of its scientific and  technological achievements, the office gave it a monetary value  of 32 million yuan. An engineer was awarded 460,000 yuan worth  of technology-generated earnings over a three-year period by a  company after it adopted his patented technology. Courts have  ruled that "intangible assets appraisals" are admissible as  evidence.    Guangdong Province has been cautious about the appearance of  offices for appraising intangible assets, and apart from  Shenzhen, only Zhuhai has formed an intangible assets appraising  group -- a provincial assets appraisal center is still being  prepared. However, intellectual and business circles are very  enthusiastic about this "intangible" industry. People hope very  much for a quantified "statement" on the value of their  knowledge and business goodwill.</p>

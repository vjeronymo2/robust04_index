			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> POLICE SEEK CROSSBOW HUNTER  </P> <P> Burbank police are searching for a man who used a crossbow to shoot and kill a  deer as it was feeding outside a house at the base of the Verdugo Mountains.  </P> <P> The dead animal was found early Sunday morning in a driveway in the 2400 block  of Scott Road.  </P> <P> Melissa Caven, 22, said she heard a noise outside her bedroom window about 2  a.m. When she looked outside, she saw three deer eating in the front yard. Deer  living in the rugged hills often venture into residential areas to find food  and water.  </P> <P> Caven said she watched for several minutes and took a few photographs before a  dark four-wheel-drive vehicle with three men inside stopped in the street  outside her house. One of the men climbed out of the vehicle, carrying what  appeared to be a crossbow. He raised the weapon and fired a single arrow at the  deer.  </P> <P> The animals scattered, and the vehicle drove away.  </P> <P> Police later found the carcass of the deer, a 100-pound female, in the driveway  of a house a block away. Goldberg said the animal had a puncture wound in the  upper back and police found bloodstained pieces of a broken arrow in the  driveway.  </P> <P> Goldberg said the man who shot the arrow is being sought on animal cruelty  charges.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IN GATES SETTLEMENT, PUBLIC PAYS WHILE SUPERVISORS EVADE HEAT  </P> <P> Consider for a moment Sheriff Brad Gates' conduct before and after the court  judgment ("Gates Off Hook in Suit; County to Pay $616,000," Nov. 17). Gates  regularly issues permits to wealthy business people, friends and political  backers during the late 1970s and early 1980s.  </P> <P> A jury of his peers finds Gates guilty of denying the Ritter brothers their  constitutional rights (he denied these licensed private investigators gun  permits six times during the same period).  </P> <P> After the judgment is rendered, Gates refuses to admit any wrongdoing. He even  boasts that the judge trusts him, despite the fact that he has agreed in the  court settlement to pay $616,000 and reaffirm that he will obey his own oath of  office.  </P> <P> And in the midst of it all, Gates persuades voters of our fiscally conservative  county to reelect him sheriff.  </P> <P> JOHN R. MAITINO, San Juan Capistrano  </P></p>

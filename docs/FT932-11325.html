			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / House prices poised for recovery HOUSE PRICES showed a modest rise of 0.1 per cent last month according to Nationwide, Britain's second-largest building society. The figure represents the second consecutive monthly rise, but March's increase was 1 per cent. Mr Brian Davis, Nationwide's operations director, said: 'Overall, we have seen little change in house prices over the last six months and this month's figure is further evidence that stability is now returning to the housing market.' Mr Davis expected growing confidence over the next few months with house-price recovery aided by the decision of first-time buyers to enter the market. The average UK house price in April was Pounds 52,339, 5.8 per cent lower than the same month last year, said Nationwide. Meanwhile, there were 218,867 residential property transactions in the first quarter of this year - 4 per cent lower than the last quarter of 1992 and 8 per cent lower than last year's the first quarter, according to the Adams Residential Property Index. This is compiled by James R. Adams, a market research consultancy, by monitoring housing completions made by solicitors. Activity in the construction industry remains dangerously low but the decline in quantity surveyors' workload has begun to slow down, says a survey published today by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, Andrew Baxter writes. Quantity surveyors' workloads fell by 0.7 per cent in the first quarter of this year, compared with a 5 per cent drop in the final quarter of last year. Workload over the past 12 months has fallen by 13 per cent. The quarterly survey is based on a questionnaire of more than 200 chartered surveying practices.</p>

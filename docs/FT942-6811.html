			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / German vehicle output increases 5% for April German car, bus and truck output rose 5 per cent in April, bringing total production in the first four months almost level with the comparable period last year, according to the VDA industry association, Christopher Parkes writes. A 4 per cent rise in exports last month brought the total shipped abroad in the four months to 761,400 units, a rise of 2 per cent overall. The association, noting that total output rose 10 per cent, said car production last month increased to 350,900 units from 333,754 a year earlier. Light-truck makers suffered further from weak demand, with production down almost 2,700 at 10,500 units, while output of 'other' commercial vehicles showed continuing growth, expanding 27 per cent to 9,700. This sector, the only part of the motor industry showing consistent improvement, has stepped up manufacture 9 per cent in the first four months and increased exports 25 per cent. Car exports rose 2 per cent to the end of April. According to the VDA incoming domestic and foreign orders for new cars rose last month, supporting a report of 'pleasing' developments from German distributors.</p>

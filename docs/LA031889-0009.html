			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REFORMERS RISK ALL IN ROMANIA  </P> <P> The dramatic, even hysterical, physical construction, reconstruction and  destruction of Romania on the will or whim of Nicolae Ceausescu has conveyed an  intimation of the end -- an end that may now be approaching.  </P> <P> An open letter of protest addressed to the Romanian dictator March 10 by six  senior figures in the Romanian Communist Party, including one of the party  founders, 94-year-old Constantin Parvulescu, is certain to have serious backing  elsewhere in the party and government.  </P> <P> It is virtually certain, as well, to enjoy support from the Soviet Union,  although one of the signers, Silviu Brucan, former ambassador to the United  Nations and former editor of the Communist Party newspaper, was arrested last  Saturday.  </P> <P> The ability of the Soviet authorities to intervene in Romania's internal  situation or even to protect the six is by no means assured. The program of the  Ceausescu regime is implicitly anti-Soviet, exploiting the old hostility of  Romanians towards Russia.  </P> <P> The statement by the six, that they are acting "at the risk of their liberty  and even of their lives," is thus the exact truth. These men say that they are  making this protest out of duty, "because the present policy of Romania  compromises the idea of socialism for which they have struggled, and has  isolated Romania internationally."  </P> <P> Their initiative brings the internal Romanian crisis into the open; until now  it has been stifled by police repression and obscured by Nicolae Ceausescu's  program of false nationalism. Sumptuous boulevards and public buildings have  been constructed for the grandeur of the Romanian nation, while the Romanian  people groaned in cold and winter darkness, trekking from shop to market in the  daily search for something to eat.  </P> <P> The six say in their letter: "A government which for five winters has failed to  resolve problems so vital as those of heating, the provision of electricity,  transport and food for the population is incompetent, incapable of governing."  Among their demands is that the export of Romania's agricultural output, "which  threatens the biological survival of our people," be stopped.  </P> <P> The charges made are those that exiled Romanians and foreign observers have  made for years. This letter was issued the day after Romania was condemned by  the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations in Geneva -- a vote in which  the Soviet Union abstained, as did Bulgaria and the East German delegation.  </P> <P> The emigre writer, Eugene Ionesco, told the political commission of the  European Parliament in February that Romania's situation is one of "cultural  genocide." Romania, he said, is "making a final departure from Europe itself."  </P> <P> Infant mortality in Romania is now the highest in Europe, despite a government  program of population increase demanding five children from every woman of  child-bearing age and forbidding abortion as well as contraceptives. The old  are expected to die without burdening the country's declining medical  facilities. Male life expectancy now is only 66 years. The ration of meat for a  worker in Brasov, Romania's second city, in 1987 was 8.5 kilos (less than 20  pounds) for the entire year.  </P> <P> The independent culture and languages of national minorities -- Hungarian,  German and Serbian -- are cruelly repressed. More than 13,000 ethnic Hungarian  refugees from Romania were given residence permits in Hungary last year alone,  and it is believed that a like number are living undeclared in Hungary.  Hungary's consulates in Bucharest and the Transylvanian city of Cluj have been  closed by the Romanian authorities.  </P> <P> In Bucharest at the beginning of March, one of the signers of the open letter  (its existence then still unknown) made it possible for me to see another  document he had signed. It argued that multi-party government was inappropriate  for Romania today, but called for pluralism inside the Romanian Communist Party  -- real and open debate among the party's members and leaders, with decisions  taken openly as the outcome of those debates.  </P> <P> I did not understand at the time what he wanted me to do about this document.  It now seems clear that he wanted it made known internationally that the aims  of these Communist patriarchs -- who include a former foreign minister, a  former president of the National Assembly, the No. 2 figure in the party before  1972 and head of the Communist unions -- are wholly consistent with  contemporary Communist orthodoxy and reform.  </P> <P> These six old men challenging Ceausescu do not ask for communism to end in  Romania. They ask for restoration of the constitution, "virtually suspended"  today, "constructive dialogue" and "restoration of the constitutional rights  and individual liberties of citizens." They want to save the system, not wreck  it.  </P> <P> Theirs, no doubt, is an aim that may properly provoke bitterness; they helped  make this system what it was when Nicolae Ceausescu took over. Nonetheless,  today they take their lives in their hands to defy manifest injustice. They  honor the Romanian nation; they deserve urgent support from Western governments  and Western public opinion.  </P> <P> International outrage can make a difference, even in Ceausescu's Romania.  </P></p>

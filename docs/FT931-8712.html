			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont legal bill sparks review call THE FINAL chapter in the parliamentary saga of Mr Norman Lamont's legal bill was written yesterday as the Commons public accounts committee called for a review of government rules on using public funds for ministers' personal expenses. The cross-party spending watchdog regretted that the Treasury had not highlighted in its accounts the decision to pay Pounds 4,700 towards the Pounds 22,000 costs of evicting an unwanted tenant from the chancellor's private home. Treasury officials said in evidence to the committee that the decision was so clearly within the rules that there was no particular need to raise it. But, drawing on officials' own words, the committee said: 'The fact that the decision was given 'exceptionally rigorous high-level consideration', and the fact that Sir Terence Burns (the Treasury permanent secretary) acknowledged that others may have made a different decision, suggests that to follow Treasury guidance to err on the side of notation rather than of omission would have been the wiser course of action'. The MPs recommend that the review of the rules should produce clear guidance to officials and ministers about the use and disclosure of public resources for ministers' non-official expenses, and emphasise the presumption against using public funds. While the committee makes clear that it is not concerned with Mr Lamont's conduct, it notes in the report that it 'remains for ministers to decide whether or not to allow such payments to be made'. The report comes the day after Mr John Gummer, the agriculture minister, was rebuked by another Commons committee for not declaring work on his garden that was paid by a food company.</p>

			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BECKER ACCEPTS STOCKHOLM WILD CARD  </P> <P> Defending champion Boris Becker has accepted a wild-card berth in the Stockholm  Open tennis tournament starting next week, the event's organizers said today.  Becker, the Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion, returned to action in this week's  Paris Open after a long layoff because of a knee injury suffered in the U.S.  Open. "Boris needs match training for the Masters and the Davis Cup final.  That's the main reason why he is coming," tournament director Johan Flink said.  The Stockholm Open, which will be held in the 16,000-seat Globe Arena after 20  years in the Royal Tennis Hall, has attracted a strong field headed by Ivan  Lendl, the world's top-ranked player.  </P></p>

			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Hurd to discuss China dispute BRITAIN'S foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, arrived in Hong Kong yesterday for a two-day visit expected to be dominated by a dispute between Britain and China about how to finance a big new airport, and local demands for more democracy. On his arrival Mr Hurd said the dispute over the HKDollars 175.3bn (Pounds 11.6bn) airport would be solved within the framework agreed between Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, and Mr Li Peng, his Chinese counterpart, in Beijing last September. That agreement was regarded at the time as a successful conclusion to two years of often bitter talks. Mr Hurd said he did not know how long the latest round of talks would take. China has castigated the Hong Kong government for disclosing details of the negotiations. It is concerned about the cost of the project and the financial support which the government plans to make available to public sector corporations constructing key projects. But Hong Kong officials believe China's stated concerns are a cloak for larger worries about the pace of democratic development in the colony. They are also perturbed by the plans of Mr Chris Patten, the new governor, to take his time and consult locally about political matters before he makes any decisions. Mr Patten seems determined not to be pushed into early decisions. He plans to reshape his cabinet at about the time he opens the autumn session of the local legislature on October 7. Last week he politely turned down an invitation to visit Beijing and is not expected to go there until mid-October. Mr Hurd will meet representatives of the colony's political establishment over the next two days. He is expected to face pressure over both the airport and democracy.</p>

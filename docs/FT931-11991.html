			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / All ears tuned to revolutionary research: New figures on who's listening to what on British radio Television may be the dominant broadcasting medium in Britain, but millions of pairs of ears still regularly tune in to radio. The first joint radio research covering both the BBC and the commercial stations shows that more than 41.5m adults - 89 per cent of the country's total - listen to radio at least once a week. The research by Radio Joint Audience Research (Rajar), based on 56,000 listeners keeping detailed diaries over a three-month period, gives Classic FM, Britain's first national commercial radio, a weekly audience of 4.25m or 9 per cent of the total. Rather more surprisingly, Atlantic 252, a long-wave interloper broadcasting pop music from Ireland, had 3.8m adult listeners in its official survey area, which covers about 70 per cent of the UK. In the battle between the BBC and the commercial stations the corporation is still ahead with the help of its big guns: the five national channels from Radio 1 to Radio 5. Altogether the BBC has 69 per cent of UK adults listening at least once a week and accounts for 58.4 per cent of total radio listening. Fifty three per cent of the adult population now listens to some form of commercial radio each week and the sector has a 37.8 per cent share of all listening. But more important than these revealing figures is the fact that the Rajar research exists at all. For years the BBC and the commercial sector have produced separate listening figures using different methods; and then they have squabbled about the results. They wanted to end the confusion so set Rajar up last year. Now, a benchmark has been set for advertisers buying airtime and for those wondering whether BBC Radio provides value for money. On Wednesday, the Association of Independent Radio Companies had a tricky decision to take at its annual meeting. Should the companies agree that the Rajar findings should be published, even though the news for some may not be good and there may be 'glitches' in the first of what will be quarterly reports? The decision to publish immediately was virtually unanimous, even though the disclosures might involve rough justice for a number of stations whose listening figures appeared to be surprisingly low. 'I think that shows great maturity and robustness of confidence in the medium,' Mr Jimmy Gordon, managing director of the successful Radio Clyde group, said yesterday. The results, particularly for local stations, appear to be lower than previous figures compiled separately. Mr Richard Eyre, managing director of Capital Radio, agrees that the industry should be given credit for having the courage to publish, but added: 'It is surprising that the result should deliver a blow that is greater to ILR (independent local radio) than it is to the BBC.' The arrival of the first common currency for radio ratings in the UK comes at a turning point for the radio industry. The BBC, under its new director-general, Mr John Birt, is in the middle of redefining what its role in radio should be as the debate gets under way with the government on the renewal of corporation's royal charter. It runs out at the end of 1996. For the commercial companies offering a total of 140 radio services on both AM and FM the challenge is different and larger. The task is to break away from the reputation of commercial radio as a bit of an also-ran in the media stakes, doomed to be a 2 per cent medium - taking a share of about 2 per cent of all UK advertising revenue and reliant on the growth of overall spending on advertising for their own growth, rather than increasing their share. Radio revenues from advertising last year are expected to be between Pounds 130m and Pounds 140m with opinion divided on future prospects. Some in the industry believe a 'quantum leap' in advertising revenue is possible with the arrival of new national commercial stations, but others believe the growth will be more gradual. On the face of it the numbers look pessimistic. Since 1979 the number of hours of commercial radio has grown by more than 55 per cent, yet its share of advertising revenue has remained static. Mr Douglas McArthur, chief executive of the new, independent Radio Advertising Bureau, believes this can be changed and has set himself a target of doubling radio's share of national advertising by 1996. Mr McArthur, who has put together a team of radio research and planning specialists, Sound Planning, to work with companies which have not been regular users of radio advertising, had a small piece of good news for his colleagues this week. After two weeks of working with the Unilever brand, Batchelors Cup-a Soup, on Wednesday morning Unilever decided to buy airtime. 'By the end of this year, Sound Planning will have delivered at least Pounds 2m to stations and I aim it to reach a rate of Pounds 5m per year,' Mr McArthur said. The Advertising Association is forecasting 8 per cent real growth in radio advertising revenues this year followed by 5 per cent in 1994. Zenith, the large media buyer, is more pessimistic and foresees little real growth. With Classic FM successfully launched the industry hopes that the launch of the second national commercial station (INR 2) in April - Virgin Radio, devoted to popular music - will further stimulate advertisers and listeners' interest. The third scheduled national commercial station, which will be speech-based, has been delayed until 1995 because of the recession. In the meantime, Mr Eyre of Capital has decided to launch 'INR 4'. This is a proposal to market the existing ILR stations as a network so that an advertiser can buy into all of them at a particular time of day or into a particular type of programme. 'I'm cautiously optimistic,' says Mr Eyre, who believes it is possible to double radio's share of national advertising by 1996. While the commercial stations are preoccupied with attracting advertising, the BBC has set itself a different task. It aims to develop 'recognisably distinctive and innovative services'. For Radio 1, for example, the emphasis will be on range and diversity of music rather than just playing what is most popular. A 24-news and current affairs network is planned for next year. An example of how the BBC plans to differentiate itself from its commercial rivals came this week in London. GLR, the regional station for London, increased the proportion of news and current affairs during its peak listening hours. As commercial broadcasters were speaking yesterday of the rather unpalatable survey results, it was clear that it will be some time before an accurate trend is established and all the glitches removed from the new survey. Over at the BBC it was Mr David Hatch's last day as managing director of BBC Network Radio before becoming special adviser to Mr Birt. 'It is remarkable and a credit to our producers, writers, musicians, actors and broadcasters that over 60 per cent of the British public listen to one or more of the five BBC networks each week,' Mr Hatch said.</p>

According to the local daily "KAYHAN" today, the IRIB Chief  Mohammad Hashemi, brother of Iranian President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani, has resigned from his post, and Minister of  Culture and Islamic Guidance 'Ali Larijani would replace him.    In a telephone interview with XINHUA, an official from the  IRIB neither confirmed nor denied the report, saying that only  the Iranian leader 'Ali Khamene'i would decide whether the IRIB  chief will be changed.    He said that he did not know if Mohammad Hashemi has given  his resignation.    However, the state-run television tonight reported that  Iranian leader 'Ali Khamene'i received Mohammad Hashemi and some  IRIB directors today, praising the IRIB for its achievement  during the past years.    IRIB has come under criticism for being too liberal.    Last November, a committee appointed by the Iranian Majles  issued a long report, criticizing the IRIB for abusing its  budget, broadcasting non-Islamic programs, using staff members  of former shah regime.    The report brought out a hot debate between the Majles and  the IRIB and some IRIB directors were forced to resign.    "KAYHAN" also said that Deputy Minister of Culture and  Islamic Guidance Ahmad Pournajati [spelling of name as received]  would be caretaker of the ministry before President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani appointed a new minister.    The newspaper quoted sources "in some political circles" as  saying that Kamal Kharrazi [spelling of name as received], the  top man of Iran's United Nations mission, would be called back  to head the Guidance Ministry, and would be replaced in New York  by Hashemi.    The aim of the reshuffle is believed here to create a better  working relationship with the local press.</p>

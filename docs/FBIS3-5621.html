			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- A private defense panel to  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Wednesday [9 March]  discussed post-Cold War developments around the world and the  military situation surrounding Japan.    The nine-member group, asked to review Japan's  two-decade-old  defense policies, exchanged views after listening to briefings  from officials of the Foreign Ministry and the Defense Agency,  the panel chairman told a news conference.    The group spent considerable time discussing the Foreign  Ministry's explanation that the world is in a transition period  after the end of the Cold War, said Hirotaro Higuchi, also  chairman of Asahi Breweries Ltd.    Many group members raised doubts about the notion, arguing  that frameworks already exist to maintain a new world order such  as the Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations and the United  Nations Security Council, Higuchi said.    The next meeting of the panel is scheduled for March 16.    The panel, after debating overall defense matters once a  week, will offer recommendations to Hosokawa by around summer  for a revision of the National Defense Program Outline, which  has served as Japan's basic defense policy since 1976,    Based on the panel's recommendations, defense policies,  including Japan's future role in U.N.-led peacekeeping  operations, will likely be revised in time for inclusion in the  Defense Agency's budget requests for fiscal 1995.    Higuchi denied the possibility of the panel discussing the  interpretation of the current war-renouncing constitution,  saying the group will talk about defense matters within the  scope of the current constitution.</p>

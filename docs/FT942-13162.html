			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian nickel output exceeds western estimates Russia's nickel production last year was much higher than previous western estimates suggested and its consumption was much lower. This became clear after Russia for the first time supplied government statistics on its nickel market to the International Nickel Study Group, the Hague-based industry organisation. The figures revealed Russia's primary nickel production last year was 190,000 tonnes, some 22 per cent below the 1992 level but well above the 168,000 tonnes previously estimated by the study group. Nickel consumption was 60,000 tonnes compared with the study group's estimate of 80,000 tonnes. Russia's official nickel exports came to 110,000 tonnes, down from 133,000 tonnes in 1992. The study group pointed out, however, that these exports excluded those of ferro-nickel or other forms of the metal, estimated to be nearly 30,000 tonnes in 1992. Mr Glen Wittur, secretary-general of the INSG, said that the official Russian figures would be used by the study group from now on. However, it was still not clear how often the statistics would be supplied. China, a prospective study group member, reported that nickel output at its principal facility, Jinchuan Nonferrous Metals Corporation, reached 27,300 in 1993 or 88 per cent of total Chinese production. This also suggests the study group underestimated China's output which it previously gave as 29,500 tonnes. Jinchuan is being expanded so that China's nickel production will rise to 50,000. China's 1993 nickel consumption was estimated to be 45,000 tonnes. Consumption is predicted to rise to 70,000 tonnes by the year 2,000.</p>

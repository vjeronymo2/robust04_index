The Proposed Decision and Order sets forth the procedures that the DOE has tentatively formulated to distribute a total of $10,700,000, plus accrued interest, obtained by the DOE under the terms of the Consent Order entered into with Murphy on July 15, 1994. These funds were paid towards the settlement of alleged violations of the DOE petroleum price and allocation regulations that were in effect from August 19, 1973, through January 28, 1981.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The OHA has proposed to distribute these funds in accordance with the DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy in Crude Oil Cases, 51 FR 27,899 (August 4, 1986)(the MSRP). Under the MSRP, crude oil overcharge monies are divided between the federal government, the states, and injured purchasers of refined petroleum products. Refunds to the states would be distributed in proportion to each state's consumption of petroleum products during the price control period. Refunds to eligible purchasers would be based on the volume of petroleum products they purchased and the degree to which they can demonstrate injury.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Any member of the public may submit written comments regarding the proposed refund procedures.

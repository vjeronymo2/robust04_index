			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHARITIES SUE UNITED WAY OVER PAYROLL  DEDUCTIONS  </P> <P> Three charities filed a $6-million suit Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court  against United Way of Los Angeles and United Way of California, claiming they  have been denied a fair chance to get payroll deduction donations from  California's state employees.  </P> <P> The suit alleges that United Way used a pledge system that encourages  contributions to United Way agencies, but which makes it difficult to donate to  non-United Way charities.  </P> <P> The suit, which also names the state as a defendant, was filed by Combined  Health Appeal, International Services Agency and Environmental Federation of  California.  </P> <P> After the suit was filed, the plaintiffs sought and obtained from Superior  Court Judge Miriam Vogel a temporary restraining order barring United Way of  Los Angeles from distributing pledge cards to state employees without attaching  designation cards which allow donors to give to non-United Way charities.  </P> <P> A hearing for a preliminary injunction on the matter will be held Nov. 16.  United Way attorney Framroze Virjee said in court, "I believe the campaign  we're running now is fair and in compliance with the law."  </P> <P> Los Angeles United Way is in the midst of a $95-million fund-raising effort for  its 350 human service and health agencies.  </P></p>

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: Case gets in shape for a difficult harvest - Laurie Morse examines restructuring at Tenneco's agricultural machinery subsidiary THE grain harvest is about three weeks behind schedule in the American mid-west, and farmers are working overtime, pushing their tractors and combines to the limit. The machines are invariably the trademark green of John Deere, or the distinctive red of the old International Harvester company, whose logo has been assumed by equipment manufacturer J. I. Case, the Wisconsin-based unit of Tenneco. This year, with US farm income projected at 10 per cent above 1992's Dollars 62.5bn, Deere and Case are hoping farmers will end their self-imposed austerity and make long-deferred purchases of tractors and other equipment. For Case, always a distant second to Deere, the battle for market share will be more difficult than usual. The company, the largest division of Houston-based Tenneco, is restructuring, with the aim of returning the unit to profitability. Case delivered Dollars 4bn in revenues to Tenneco last year, and still logged a huge Dollars 1bn loss. Quality problems in manufacturing, a pricing policy aimed at maintaining market share at any cost, and out-of-control inventories have plagued Case for years. When turnround expert Mr Michael Walsh took the helm at Tenneco in 1991, he hired an old friend, Mr Dana Mead, as president and asked him to revamp Case. Mr Mead tackled inventories that had jumped as high as Dollars 2bn, ordering manufacturing cutbacks and reduced manufacturing time. He also cut the workforce to 17,000 from about 30,000 in 1990. Mr Mead also instituted stringent quality controls, and reviewed Case's agricultural and construction equipment product lines model by model. Some products were scrapped and others were re-tooled so that Case retained only assembly functions, buying parts from outside suppliers. Production was rationalised to meet customer demand, a new concept for Case. This year 70 per cent of its output will be built to customer specifications, rather than being manufactured wholesale and then customised through costly rebuilding. Mead also ended Case's customary sales discounts. This reform has reduced volume this year, but profits have grown. 'Case forgot it liked to make money and just liked to make tractors,' Mr Mead jokes. Inventories fell by Dollars 719m in 1992, and are projected to be down another Dollars 300m in 1993. Tightening quality controls at the factory and in the sales process has saved the company about Dollars 200m this year, according to Mr Ted French, Case's chief financial officer. Mr Mead's policies are paying off. Case posted a Dollars 52m operating profit at the end of the third quarter, up from a loss of Dollars 134m a year earlier. Contrary to Wall Street projections only a few months ago, Case is expected to show a profit for the full year. Its production lines are gearing up for a 30 per cent surge this quarter, to bring output in line with that of 1992. Meanwhile, Mr Mead says he intends to continue to trim his workforce, and will squeeze out an additional Dollars 34m in quality savings in 1994. Still, analysts say the turnround is weak at best. Mr Frank Manfredi, editor of Machinery Outlook, an Illinois-based newsletter, says Case's practice of rolling earnings from the financing unit into profits boosted the third-quarter bottom line. Without the credit subsidiary's contribution, Case's year-to-date operating profit is a mere Dollars 12m. The company's European cuts have been difficult, and markets there are shrinking, while the US agricultural economy remains flat. Mr Mead says it is not yet time to ease up. 'This is just the beginning of the transformation,' he told analysts recently. 'It's been a long, tough struggle and we're not getting any help from our markets.' Indeed, Case is projecting sales of Dollars 2.8bn in North America this year, and about Dollars 1.1bn in Europe, its second-largest base. Of those sales, about 60 per cent will be agricultural machinery and 40 per cent in construction equipment. The late harvest has delayed the autumn selling season for big-ticket agricultural items such as tractors by about three weeks in North America. Meanwhile, farmers who are used to buying Case's shiny red tractors at juicy discounts are finding value pricing hard to swallow. 'They're trying to wait us out, looking for year-end mark-downs,' one dealer observed. And while US farm income is up slightly this year, it is projected to be down 8 per cent in 1994, a forecast that reinforces Mr Mead's determination to raise operating profits even as sales decline. In Europe, the situation is even more dismal. European tractor sales are projected to fall to 106,000 units in 1994, down from 181,000 in 1990. Industry-wide sales of construction equipment are flat to lower. And unlike North America, competition is fragmented and intense. The big German construction market remains depressed. 'We don't have any idealistic views about the 1994 market,' says Mr Steve Lamb, Case's managing director for Europe. Case's policy of holding the line on discounts has not succeeded in Europe, where Deere, also suffering from a shrinking market, is pricing aggressively. Case operates eight manufacturing plants in Europe, most of them the legacy of Tenneco's acquisition of France's Poclain construction equipment and International Harvester's agricultural divisions in 1985. Several small manufacturing operations are being closed or reduced in size, with redundancies of about 1,000 workers. That includes the 266 redundancies at Case's French plants announced in September. Given Case's ambitious restructuring plans and the struggling state of Poclain's businesses, 'its a pretty safe bet that you'll see more closures in France', where about half of Case's 7,500 European employees are situated, Mr Lamb says. The contraction is fundamental to the success of Case's turnround. 'It is essential to get the size of production down to the size of the market,' Mr Mead says.</p>

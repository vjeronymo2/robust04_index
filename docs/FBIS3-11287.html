Argentine diplomats have always believed that the debt,  contracted through the export of trucks and other vehicles to  Cuba during Peron's last term, was "irrecoverable."    Cuba had offered to Argentina to pay the debt through  tourist  leasings in the island, as it lacks the cash to pay it.    Robaina's visit would take place at the completion of the  negotiations undertaken by Cuban diplomats at the Argentine  Foreign Ministry to renegotiate the debt.</p>

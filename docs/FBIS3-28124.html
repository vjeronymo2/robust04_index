			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 2 KYODO -- Prices for domestically  produced rice are rising sharply in jiyu-mai dealings, or a grey  market outside government channels, due to growing speculation  that consumers would prefer to buy domestic rice even at higher  prices, industry sources said Wednesday [2 February].    Also contributing to the uptrend of rice prices is the fact  that the pace of importing rice from such countries as China and  Australia has been slower than initially expected, causing  concern about the amount of rice available, they said. Rice  dealers want to build up their stocks of domestic rice  regardless of the rising prices, they added.    In Japan, the government buys about 20 percent of the rice  crop and oversees the independent distribution of a further 40  percent.    There is also a grey market supported by rice growers and  distributors outside the government's control.    According to the sources, prices for popular domestic rice  brands on the black market have shot up since the previous week  by an average of 1,000 yen or more for 60 kilograms.    Koshihikari rice, a product of Niigata Prefecture and one of  the most popular brands, is now sold for about 41,000 yen per  bag. Akita Komachi of Akita Prefecture is 38,000 yen and  Sasanishiki of Miyagi Prefecture is 36,000 yen.    The inflation in the grey market will inevitably affect  retail prices of rice, they said.    A supermarket in Tokyo's Setagaya Ward is selling  Koshihikari  for 11,900 yen per 10 kilograms.    "It is selling all right at the price. I suppose consumers  do not mind paying a little more for tasty rice," a clerk at the  supermarket said.</p>

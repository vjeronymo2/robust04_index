			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Patten censured by legislature: Governor 'reproved' over budget Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, yesterday made colonial history when he became the first of the colony's 28 governors to be censured by the local legislature. By a vote of 21 to 11 the Legislative Council (LegCo) voted in favour of a motion 'reproving' Mr Patten for 'acting against to will of the public' in denying LegCo the right to amend the government's budget. More important than the actual point of contention was the ill-feeling towards Mr Patten that emanated from the pro-democracy wing of LegCo - hitherto the governor's staunchest body of support. Last night he was accused of being 'dictatorial', 'colonial' and falling short of his own rhetoric about 'accountability'. Recently Mr Patten has rebuffed pro-democracy legislators' attempts to promote civil liberties. His supporters believe he has been reigned in by the British government which has lost its stomach for any more fights with China about Hong Kong. A broad coalition of legislators had wanted to reduce property taxes. Under Hong Kong's constitution - the Queen's instructions to the governor - only the executive branch of government can tax or spend taxpayers money. Mr Patten, as his predecessor had done, invoked the Royal Instructions to thwart a proposed amendment.</p>

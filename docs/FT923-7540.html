			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Bush launches election attack against 'do nothing' Congress PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday set out a re-election strategy focusing on attacks on the Democrat-controlled Congress, whose 'sorry record' he will link directly to his opponent, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas. In a pre-recorded interview with ABC News broadcast yesterday, Mr Bush said he would take as his model former Democratic President Harry Truman, who won re-election in 1948 by fiercely attacking a 'do-nothing' Congress. Against the background of a Washington Post/ABC News poll yesterday showing that 61 per cent of Americans do not know what Mr Bush wants to do in a second term, the president sought to portray himself as having been too busy in Washington dealing with Congress to lay out an agenda. Congress had 'let me down and the American people.' As the Republican party faithful began gathering in Houston for their party's convention, which begins today, Mr Bush defended moving Mr James Baker from his role as secretary of state into the White House to assist his re-election campaign. 'He's been at my side in every political battle, and I think there's so much at stake in terms of what we can do to help this country, that I wanted to have this trusted friend and adviser, with a proven record, running the White House.' The president also said he would come forward with new ideas on education programme, health care reform and taxes, so that voters had 'a major choice'. Convention speakers in Houston were preparing for a concerted assault on Mr Clinton. Mr Rich Bond, the party chairman, said Mr Patrick Buchanan, who unsuccessfully challenged Mr Bush in this year's Republican primaries, would 'tear the bark' off the Democratic candidate in his speech today.

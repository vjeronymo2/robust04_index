			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Letter: Absurdity which stultifies the role of UK company boards Sir, Sir Owen Green has done such an excellent demolition job (Personal View, June 9) on the absurdities of the Cadbury Report that very little remains to be added. There is, however, one aspect on which he touches only lightly and which in my opinion deserves greater emphasis. British corporate governance differs from that of most other countries in its implicit (and sometimes quite explicit) assumption that boards of directors determine policy while management - a lower grade - see to its implementation. Hence the reference in the Cadbury Report to boards 'driving their companies forward'. Nowhere else is such an assumption made or accepted. I have myself had the privilege of serving on boards of three of America's biggest corporations; the notion that their members were 'driving' anything in any sense would strike them as quite odd. In the US and on the European continent management is top-dog for both policy and implementation - and enjoys the accompanying prestige - while boards, though possessing the ultimate deterrent, confine themselves in practice to ensuring that management does not run amok. The British custom of attributing prestigious policy functions to board members has many consequences, some of which give rise to the very problems analysed in the Cadbury Report. Perhaps the most absurd of all is that it compels senior managers to perceive board status as the ultimate and indispensable prestige symbol, thereby partly stultifying the essentially supervisory role which corporate boards should be performing.

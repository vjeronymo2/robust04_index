			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Hans Rauscher: "Clinton's D-Day"] </F>   [Text] This week, Bill Clinton was the first U.S.  President since Woodrow Wilson to speak at the French National  Assembly. Wilson represents one side of U.S. policy: the good  will to improve the world (by modeling it, if possible, along  the lines of the U.S. example).    What Clinton represents is still uncertain. In any case, it  is not the other side of U.S. world policy -- the tough  superpower policy, oriented toward its own interests. Given his  predisposition as a left-liberal Democrat, Clinton should rather  be counted among the idealistic school; in reality, the  characteristic feature of Clinton's foreign policy line is  probably the absence of any foreign policy line. So far, he has  exercised the leadership role that his office unavoidably forces  on him with reticence and almost with indifference. He  hesitates to use the power of the United States seriously --  even if the matter at hand is a serious threat.    Obviously, Clinton has real problems with power.    The explanation for that lies in his background as a member  of the anti-Vietnam generation. His formative years were  characterized by the disproportionate, senseless, and ultimately  unsuccessful use of U.S. means of power.    Clinton experiences the abuse of U.S. power, not its use for  a just cause.    The experience of the D-Day celebrations this week may have  had a bit of a correcting effect. One cannot think of any more  honorable cause in history than the defeat of a real empire of  evil, as Hitler's Germany was. Without the United States this  would not have been possible, and Stalin, too, would have had to  accept an arrangement with Hitler.    The question is how important Europe still is for Clinton's  administration. Assurances, also in his speech in Paris, are  one thing, real inclinations and interests are another.  Clinton's people have repeatedly announced a shift of their  focus from Europe to Asia. This need not yet worry the  Europeans; the focal points of this administration are  constantly shifting. On the other hand, the "ad-hoc-ery" of  Clinton's team is certainly extremely worrying.    Whenever the Americans believed that they could neglect  Europe, things developed toward a disaster. In World War I, the  Americans saved Europe from a German victory. Their fresh  troops, who reinforced the completely exhausted English and  French troops on the Western Front, prevented the success of the  last great German offensive. In 1918, the United States  withdrew, however, from Europe into total isolation -- to the  detriment of Europe, which succumbed to the unchecked aggression  of Hitler's Germany and had to be liberated again with enormous  sacrifice.    This time the U.S. leadership was smarter: It not only  supported reconstruction with its Marshall Plan, but also  repulsed the Soviet attempts to take in those countries where  the Red Army was not deployed: In 1948, the Berlin blockade,  military support for the anticommunists in the Greek civil war,  support for Tito's anti- Moscow course, financial support for  the democratic parties in France and Italy; in 1950, support for  the anticommunist forces at the half-hearted putsch attempt in  Vienna and eastern Austria; in the late 1950's and early 1960's,  the repulsion of various crises in Berlin; in the late 1970's,  rearmament against the threat of Soviet intermediate-range  missiles.    The U.S. shield kept the Russians out and -- what is perhaps  more important -- prevented the Soviet Union from being able to  force the free Europeans into submission by means of a military  threat.    The U.S. interests certainly played a role in this: If the  Soviet Union had received full and unhindered access to Western  technology and Western capital through an intimidated West  Europe, it would not have lagged behind so enormously in its  development. The internal collapse could have been prevented or  at least delayed for a long time (the USSR was able to survive  as long as it did only through extensive industrial espionage).    Basically, even Stalin and his successors were not so  interested in getting West Europe physically under the control  of the Red Army. They would have been satisfied with turning  West Europe and, above all, West Germany into a client state,  included in the Soviet system of exploitation. It was in the  Americans' strategic interest to prevent the Soviet Union from  grabbing West Europe's potential and thus from becoming a far  more dangerous rival.    And today it is in the interest of the United States to  prevent the same thing from happening in connection with Russia.    The question is whether the path that Clinton is taking in  this connection, namely integrating Russia as much as possible  into European policy, is the correct one. In Bosnia, Russia has  already been given a veto right. Perhaps things could not have  been done differently.    However, Clinton's readiness to extend the so-called NATO  Partnership for Peace to Russia is being viewed with concern.  During his visit to NATO headquarters, Russian Defense Minister  Grachev tried to bring NATO under the supreme authority of the  CSCE, which would mean a de facto veto right for the Russians  over NATO. It would be, as Henry Kissinger warns, "the  emasculation of NATO, which has been a goal of Russian foreign  policy for 45 years."    Clinton's seeming readiness to give Russia special status in  NATO is alarming, not only to tough Realpolitik experts like  Kissinger but even more so to the East European reform states,  which finally want to get out of Moscow's sphere of influence.  This is so important because NATO is the decisive and almost  only institutional link between the United States and Europe.  If NATO becomes a watered-down association with a Russian veto,  then one has to be extremely worried about everything that D-Day  meant 50 years ago.</p>

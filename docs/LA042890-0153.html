			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOONE TO PLAY VOLLEYBALL FOR TROJANS  </P> <P> Aaron Boone of Edison High School has signed a letter of intent to play  volleyball at USC this fall.  </P> <P> Boone, a 6-foot-5 setter, will join former Orange County standouts Jason  Perkins (Corona del Mar), Chris Knowles (Dana Hills) and Drew Sheward (Newport  Harbor).  </P> <P> "UCLA also wanted him but he had already made up his mind," Edison Coach Brian  Rofer said. "UC Santa Barbara recruited him too, and I know a lot of other  schools would have loved to have him."  </P> <P> Rofer, who played volleyball at UCLA, said Boone has a chance to start as a  freshman at USC.  </P> <P> "In 1996 I think he has good shot at the Olympic team," Rofer said. "He'll be  done with school by then and I can't see anyone touching him." MIKE REILLEY  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> WALKEN HAS PURPORTED CLOSE ENCOUNTER IN 'COMMUNION'  </P> <P> "Communion" (citywide), a serious, often persuasive attempt to dramatize writer  Whitley Strieber's purported contact with aliens, affords Christopher Walken  his showiest role to date.  </P> <P> As the life-loving, happily married Strieber, Walken is a prankish, playful  charmer whose wife Anne (Lindsay Crouse) laughs a great deal but is in fact a  solid, sensible type. They're smart enough to know they have it all, including  an adored small son Andrew (Joel Carlson) and a chic Manhattan apartment.  </P> <P> They also have a large, equally chic cabin in the mountains. On a weekend in  October, 1985, Strieber, his son and another couple (Andreas Katsulas, Terri  Hanauer) are awakened by a blinding light. In short order Strieber seems to be  hallucinating and sinking into paranoia. A calm, dedicated parapsychologist  (Frances Sternhagen) tries to help, but he tends to resist her.  </P> <P> Under the assured, easy direction of Philippe Mora, working from Strieber's  adaptation of his own best seller, Walken dazzles, giving us an intelligent,  talented man caught in a nightmare and fearing for his sanity. Crouse matches  him as a strong woman determined to put up a ferocious fight to help her  husband and save their marriage. Mora and his stars take "Communion" far above  standard sci-fi schlock, yet the film stumbles in its presentation of the  aliens.  </P> <P> Even those open to the possibility that Strieber did have a series of close  encounters of the third kind with a bunch of jolly blue gnomes and some  spindly, doe-like creatures with Keane eyes may have a problem with the  literalness with which these aliens are presented. They seem right out of the  pages of the National Enquirer. Clearly, Mora means to be faithful to Strieber,  but a more ethereal approach to the non-humans might have been more effective.  </P> <P> Even so, "Communion," a most handsome production, does take us on an incredible  journey that comes full circle in satisfying fashion. And Walken and Crouse are  terrific.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. HAILS NEW E. BLOC ARMS MONITORING PLAN;  </P> <P> VERIFICATION: NATO INSPECTORS WOULD GET UNPRECEDENTED ACCESS TO WARSAW PACT AIR  BASES.  </P> <P> Bush Administration officials responded warmly Friday to a new Warsaw Pact  proposal for monitoring cuts in conventional arms, saying that it appears to  "parallel" the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's position and could help  produce a formal agreement in six months to a year.  </P> <P> "The East proposals on verification appear to be based on the concepts that  NATO presented . . ., " said State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler,  adding: "We are pleased."  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney also described the plan as a positive step.  </P> <P> "I think it is encouraging in that it shows a willingness on their part to very  seriously engage in this question of conventional arms reductions in Europe,"  Cheney said in a wire service interview.  </P> <P> The Soviet plan was presented Thursday in Vienna, where talks will resume Nov.  9 on reaching military parity between NATO and the Warsaw Pact on conventional  forces.  </P> <P> The East Bloc's proposal would provide Western inspection teams with  unprecedented access to Warsaw Pact air bases, according to Administration  officials. The Warsaw Pact could not refuse an inspection team's request to  enter specific bases. Once there, inspectors would have free access to the  base, "to the point of climbing into the cockpits," one observer noted.  </P> <P> In addition, the Soviets proposed that aircraft subject to limits would be  rolled out of their hangars upon request. In addition, all aircraft would be  electronically "marked" with identification codes to facilitate each side's  counting of opposing aircraft.  </P> <P> "The Soviets are clearly interested today in getting results in Vienna by next  summer," a senior West German official said in response to the latest  concessions.  </P> <P> In May, President Bush sought to accelerate the conventional arms talks by  calling for NATO negotiators to come forth with detailed proposals by this fall  and a completed agreement by next summer. Since then, the alliances have  briskly traded proposals designed to limit aircraft.  </P> <P> In a recent concession, the Warsaw Pact broadened its definition of Warsaw Pact  aircraft that should be covered by the negotiations and proposed a lower limit  on warplanes -- 4,700 aircraft -- than NATO had advanced.  </P> <P> But not all elements of Moscow's package were greeted with satisfaction. The  proposal would prohibit countries on either side from establishing new air  bases or expanding existing ones within another country. Officials fear that  the provision would bar the United States from shifting its aircraft in the  face of changing war plans or demands by its allies.  </P> <P> The United States, for instance, is seeking a new NATO home for its 401st  fighter wing, which Spain ejected from Torrejon Air Base last year.  </P> <P> The Soviets offered the concessions in hopes that NATO would drop its  opposition to counting rules that could leave the Warsaw Pact with an advantage  in aircraft, officials believe. The Warsaw Pact, pointing to the threat posed  by U.S. carrier-based aircraft as well as by long-range bombers, has insisted  that the negotiated limits exempt its air defense interceptors as well as jet  trainers.  </P> <P> By contrast, NATO has insisted that all aircraft capable of shooting and based  between the Atlantic and the Ural Mountains should be subject to the negotiated  limits.  </P></p>

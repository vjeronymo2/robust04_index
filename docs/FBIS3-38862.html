In a letter to the prime ministers, he also announced  that he would contact them directly in the event the  negotiations become difficult.    "The issues of transit, agriculture, and holiday homes  remain  unsolved. Austria's position on these issues has nothing to do  with the wish to get special treatment, but it is the result of  a businesslike effort to show the differences from other  situations or to ask for a step-by-step adaptation to a joint  system, which was conceded to other member states in the past,  too," Vranitzky writes.    For the government it is, therefore, essential to reach a  result in the negotiations that takes these special features  into account.</p>

Sayyed Munawwar Hussein, secretary general of  Jamaat-i-Islami, stated this in a meeting here today. He said  that our rulers ignore the problems faced by our people just to  make the United States happy. This way these rulers are used to  keep the people away from Islamic movements. There is a spread  baseless propaganda against these movements. Movements to help  establish Islamic identity are accused of terrorism and  fundamentalism. While commenting on the international situation,  he said that the United States has recognized its target. It  considers Islam a danger to it. Secularism cannot tolerate  Muslims, and secularism, be it Western or Eastern, commits  atrocities against the people. Its proof is the abominations  committed day and night against the Muslims in Bosnia. About  Afghanistan, he said that pro-Soviet intellectuals had advised  us that this issue should be taken care of through negotiations  with the Soviet Union. However, the Afghans not only embarrassed  it in Afghanistan but in the whole world. It proved that the  only superpower there is Allah who can make one great or little.  All honors and humiliations are in His hands. Commenting on the  new world order, he said the United States wants to do whatever  it desires and no one should question it. That is why it makes  all these plans, and that is why it sent its armed forces to  Somalia. However, when its troops were being killed, it announce  their recall and thus Allah made its plans fail. Those who say  that Islam could not be implemented with jihad in Afghanistan  and with democracy in Algeria should know that the world is  changing now. The Kashmiri people are offering their lives and  the Muslims in Palestine and Bosnia are bravely standing against  kafirs. The Islamic laws have been implemented in Sudan and  there is new awakening in Malaysia. All these point to the  bright future of Islam. Hafiz Mohammed Idris, leader of the  Jamaat-i Islami of Punjab; Mian Maqsud Ahmed, secretary general;  and Chowdhery MPA [Member of Provincial Assembly] also addressed  the meeting.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Nuclear Development of S. Korean Puppet Clique denounced" </F> -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 1 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the  Central Committee of the Korean Social Democratic Party [SDP] in  a statement on April 30 branded the nuclear arms development of  the South Korean puppet clique as an open challenge to the  desire of the whole nation for peace and peaceful reunification  on the Korean peninsula and an unpardonable criminal act of  reducing to a waste paper the "agreement on reconciliation,  nonaggression, cooperation and exchange between the North and  the South" and "joint declaration on the denuclearization of the  Korean peninsula".    The statement says:    The DPRK already proposed at talks with the United States to  replace graphite moderated nuclear reactors by light water  reactors in order to remove the "suspicion" of the United States  and international reactionaries and reached even an agreement on  the way of it.    Therefore, if the graphite moderated nuclear reactors are  replaced by light water reactors, the "suspicion of nuclear  development" by the DPRK will be removed. But the United States  is raising a hue and cry over "suspected nuclear development",  while failing to implement the agreed points. This is an  outrageous act.    The South Korean rulers must admit of their own accord that  the heavy water reactor in Wolsong and the multi-purpose  research reactor in the Taedok complex are reactors for the  development of nuclear weapons, take a measure to eliminate  them, open to the public the truth of the secret development of  nuclear weapons they have stepped up while trying to do harm to  the DPRK, apologize for it before the nation and remove the  already stockpiled nuclear materials.    If the South Korean authorities continue the adventurous  development of nuclear weapons in defiance of protest and  denunciation from the entire Korean people and international  public, they will be held fully responsible for all consequences  from it.    The United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency  must renounce the unfair policy of double standard in nuclear  inspection, refrain from putting "pressure" on the North which  has no intention to produce nuclear weapons, and take issue with  the nuclear development of the South Korean authorities and  bring chief culprits to the dock.</p>

This was ruled by the Supreme Court following a supervisory  review of the already enforced sentence, pronounced by the court  in Ruse (northeastern Bulgaria) back on July 13, 1993. The drug  trafficker was found guilty of smuggling on two occasions a  total of 13.5 kg of heroin of 60 percent purity, worth 3,432,000  leva, across the border checkpoints at Kapitan Andreevo and Ruse.    The judges of the court in Ruse qualified the case as a  grave  crime, but pronounced a sentence of six and a half years,  although for such cases the law provides between 5 and 15 years.  At the same time the court found the defendant innocent of the  charges that he carried in his luggage half the amount of heroin  when going from one border checkpoint to the other.    This sentence was contested by the prosecutor and as a  second  instance on October 14 the Ruse Regional Court repealed the  sentence in its acquitting part and returned the case for trial  by another panel of the court. This ruling was criticized by  the prosecutor general of the Republic who suggested that the  Supreme Court repeals it. In this way, after the Supreme Court  judges examined the sentence under the supervisory review, they  repealed the amended part and returned the case for  reconsideration from the stage of hearing.</p>

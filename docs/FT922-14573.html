			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / International Company News: Downsize to exist - expand later / Scottish Heritable's preparation for turnround FROM CARPET making in India to Scottish tenement flats, from lime quarries in Texas to firework manufacture in Yorkshire; the interests of York-based mini-conglomerate Scottish Heritable Trust have been nothing if not varied. In the 1980s, when the banks were keen to lend and expansion was the fashion, SHT saw its wide spread of companies as a safeguard against a downturn in any sector. But the 1990 results, which showed a loss of Pounds 15.9m and gearing of more than 300 per cent on net debt of Pounds 66.4m, brought an urgent reappraisal and management changes. The early fruit of the new approach was seen last week in the 1991 preliminary results, which showed a pre-tax loss down to Pounds 792,000, net borrowings reduced to Pounds 41m and gearing down to 270 per cent. Now the new management are pushing against a tight timescale to get borrowings under Pounds 10m by the year end, to cut gearing to 100 per cent or less, and to inject a greater logic into the group's activities, as a basis for future profitable growth. 'We have to downsize SHT and then start again,' says Mr Brian Shoosmith, an ex-Hawker Siddeley executive who joined SHT as managing director last August. Synergy and debt reduction are at the nub of SHT's divestment philosophy. At face value, it might seem odd that SHT is contemplating the sale of Standard Fireworks, the dominant UK manufacturer in its sector, and the group's main profit earner. Last year Standard made Pounds 3.3m before tax and interest on turnover of Pounds 18.7m. But its disposal - discussions on a management buy out are at an advanced stage - would help to substantially reduce borrowings. And, observes Mr Shoosmith: 'How do you find synergistic business with a fireworks company?' The remaining company in the manufacturing division, loss-making Birmingham-based hospital bed manufacturer Hoskins, was sold in February for Pounds 1.3m to specialist healthcare company Securetrend. The further flung extremities of the group's empire are also under review. In India, E Hill and Co, in which SHT has a 74 per cent stake, is being sold to its minority partner. 'It's just the problem of trying to run an Indian carpet making business from York,' says Mr Shoosmith wryly. A decline in oriental carpet sales in 1991 contributed to the group's drop in turnover from Pounds 116m to Pounds 95.5m. The future policy on oriental carpet importing, wholesaling and washing subsidiaries in the UK, France and the US is under consideration. Just over half the Pounds 25.4m reduction in net borrowings resulted from the release from a USDollars 28m guarantee of the debt of one of the US associates, Scottish Heritable Inc. SHT does not have a controlling interest in that company or in its four associated US lime quarries, and hopes eventually to sell its stakes. Its two wholly owned American housebuilding companies, Haven Homes in Pennsylvania and Fox Ridge Homes in Tennessee, both made good profits and the group intends to retain them. It would like, however, to free itself of its minority stake in North American Housing Corporation. The other division, property, consists of St James Development Trust, which has a mixed portfolio of land around Britain and some partially developed sites, and Cromdale Holdings, which owns hundreds of tenanted tenement flats in and around Glasgow. Disposal of part of the St James portfolio is imminent. Once the property market improves, SHT hopes to get out of development completely, but expects to retain Cromdale Holdings. Mr Shoosmith and SHT's new finance director, Mr Stuart Macdonald, who joined in October, are keenly aware that under their standstill agreement with the banks the amount available drops from Pounds 31.5m now to Pounds 6m by December: the US facility also falls from Dollars 33.5m now to Dollars 20m in October. In the longer term, a much smaller SHT will have to decide on its expansion strategy. But there are more pressing considerations. 'Number one is existence, making sure we do have a future' says Mr Shoosmith. 'This is the year of the turn around.'</p>

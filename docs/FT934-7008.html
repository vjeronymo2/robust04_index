			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Company News (This Week): Wind of change yet to reach the bottom line - Allied-Lyons For two years now, the drifting fog of worldwide recession has obscured the benefits to Allied-Lyons, the UK drinks, food and retailing group, of restructuring to sharpen the focus on its core businesses. Few expect first-half results on Tuesday to afford any clearer glimpse of what has been achieved. Pre-tax profits are expected to improve 24 per cent to about Pounds 290m - but by a more modest 7 per cent if exceptionals and restructuring costs are excluded. Progress at the trading level is likely to be even slower. The management team which took over in 1991, after a Pounds 147m loss on currency transactions, responded immediately to criticisms that the growth rate had been pedestrian. It has introduced new management structures. Peripheral, low-profit operations have been sold, including Lyons Maid ice-cream; Showerings cider company; wine interests in Germany and Chateau Latour, the Bordeaux vineyard  -on which a book loss of about Pounds 20m will be taken - and Grants of St James's. Marketing spend has been increased, and in spirits concentrated on its leading brands - Ballantine's, Beefeater, Kahlua, Courvoisier and Canadian Club. The alliance with Domecq of Spain has been strengthened and extended into Mexico. In Germany, France, Italy and Greece, Allied has taken control of its brands distribution. Brewing operations have been merged with Carlsberg in the UK, where Carlsberg-Tetley was launched early this year into a fiercely competitive and still declining UK beer market. The Victoria Wine drinks retail chain has been reinforced by the acquisition of Augustus Barnett. Costs have been reduced, with the workforce cut by nearly 2,000. These moves have been applauded - but Allied's investors will have to wait a little longer to see the rewards.</p>

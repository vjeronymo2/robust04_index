			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Eduard Mokhorov under the rubric "Point of </F> View": "Economic `Selective Breeders' Have Taken the Country  Onto a Proven Path, But in the Opposite Direction"]    [Text] Bryansk--In his time, a self-taught village  selective breeder, a former disciple of Michurin, tried to grow  a new vegetable-fruit unknown to science out of plain potatoes.  Like its American progenitor, this plant had a root system on  which potato tubers grew, whereas the surface part was graced  with tomatoes. I do not remember the name of this selective  breeder, but I know for sure that the hybrid he produced was  called the PUKS or, if the abbreviation were to be expanded,  "Path to Socialism." Of course, you have guessed that this is  about the notorious "Chonkin" by the venomous writer  Voynovich.    Due to well-known causes and events, our people gave up the  PUKS after August 1991. We are now producing a new hybrid,  likewise unknown to science, which is officially called "Path to  Capitalism," PUKK in short (of course, with two k's at the end).  All of us, from the president to the common kitchen maid, are  producing PUKK willy-nilly. Although no one knows what the  underground-surface part of this hybrid will look like, everyone  has already managed to fully partake of its fruit. It may very  well be that, due to our doing everything the other way around,  the tomatoes will end up in the underground segment while tubers  will ripen amid rustling tops.    Yegor Timurovich Gaydar may be rightfully called the main  selective breeder of the Russian PUKK. Despite the entire  fantastic nature of the project, PUKK has turned out to be a  tenacious hybrid. Despite Gaydar having been removed from his  favorite agronomic experimentation for a second time now to the  sound of gun salvos in front of the White House, his PUKK has  managed to strike root in the very thick of the Russian economy,  regardless of who is in charge of the selective breeding effort  at present.    They say that this is a sick economy. They frequently liken  it to a precipice which we need to jump across no matter what.  We would have jumped across with our characteristic enthusiasm,  but for three things accompanying PUKK that are getting in the  way: inflation, the nonpayments crisis, and a universal  recession in industry. Mass unemployment promises to be the  fourth evil.    The government swears on a daily basis that it is  fighting these misfortunes that are threatening to blow up our  society in every way possible. By all signs, the evil would have  been vanquished had it not been for the agrarians and miners  taking turns at being bothersome. The most intelligent and  learned people, from G. Yavlinskiy to B. Kurkova and Granny  Vanga from Bulgaria, propose fast-acting prescriptions for  fighting inflation. The discontented segment of the population  (members and candidates for the underclass) associate the three  evils plaguing the Russian economy with PUKK and Gaydar. We must  acknowledge at this point that in this instance, intuition does  not fail our public.    All kinds of abusive words have been hurled at Yegor  Timurovich in recent years! "Lab chief" is the gentlest of the  swear words. Meanwhile, Gaydar smiles coolly. He feels  superiority over the crowd of ignoramuses. None of them has  understood and appreciated the titanic feats accomplished in two  years by the father of the Russian PUKK. At best, our irritated  philistine has noticed a commercial stand opposite his house and  begun to patronize it on a regular basis in order to buy Dutch  sausage, Greek oranges, a jar of Brazilian coffee, or a bottle  of Royale at any time without standing in line. As long as you  have money, purchasing the erstwhile goods in short supply is  now everyone's privilege.    It appears that everything is just fine now as far as Greek  oranges are concerned. Now let us try to figure out the things  that are not at all in plain view but are hidden, like tomatoes,  in the underground segment of the present-day political economy.  Those who brand the Gaydar team with infamy for being incapable  of creative actions in the economic sphere are making a big  mistake (or perhaps are not being entirely truthful).  Nonetheless, the blood-curdling cries of conservatives who would  like to take the country back to PUKS are still being heard.  Their charges sound trivial: "They have dragged the economy into  a global crisis, but do not know themselves how to get out of  it."    Comrade conservatives, you are in error! Gaydar knows  everything. The reform has not failed, as we are being  persistently told at present; it is rather being successfully  completed. The endeavor on which Yegor embarked two years ago  has already been accomplished in the rough. The building has  been erected; what remains is to take down the scaffolding and  start finishing the building. In all of that, you, the credulous  philistines, have been intimidated for over two years in every  way possible with horrendous shock treatment. However, we have  done without physicians. This was merely a feint. Highly  professional butcher-surgeons from the International Monetary  Fund performed the surgery with precision: We did not even  manage to shriek.    The postoperative pain made itself known when 9.5 out of 10  Russians found out that the big, tasty-smelling pie of state  property has been virtually carved up, and none of them  personally was in any danger of tasting that delicacy.    The ideological anesthetic wore off later, and then the  opened-up society sensed the smell of PUKK: The once united  Soviet people ended up divided into poor and rich. In the  process, a narrow stratum of chosen ones ended up in the sun of  a capitalist paradise on the other side of the precipice, while  the rest--sovietized creatures, that is, the superfluous,  unnecessary, and for this reason dangerous elements of  society--are still awaiting the miraculous leap across the  precipice which was promised by the prophets of 1991. Miners,  collective farmers (under whose feet the ground is literally  giving way at present because it will be taken away at any  minute) ended up among the sovietized creatures, or the  superfluous ones. Retirees, the military (with the exception of  the loyal elite), workers of the military-industrial complex,  and the working intelligentsia also ended up as such.    Therefore, the surgeons have done their job without  publicizing the results. The rest was up to ideologists, those  who console and distract. They are trying hard, especially on  TV. The main point is to be persistent, to tirelessly drum into  your souls and minds a few magic formulas on a daily basis. You  never sweated previously, but if they recommend to you a  patented deodorant day in and day out, you will wake up in a  cold sweat in the middle of the night on some occasion and, to  the sound of music playing in your sick head, utter: "Khlavin  Cosmetics, Israel, Ben Gurion Boulevard."    With the same importunate inevitability, specialists in  political advertisements will impress upon you, gentlemen,  former Soviet and currently superfluous people, that you have  not lost all that much by acquiring PUKK. After all, the  completely illusory guarantees of the old Brezhnev-Soviet  Constitution were taken away--such as the right to low-paid  labor and second-grade recreation on a trade union voucher, and  unskilled medical services.    What else was there? Oh, yes: the prospect of being given  the  "Labor Veteran" medal and a free "Khrushchevian slum" with a  view of the belching smokestacks of a plant before one retired.  In addition, it was demonstrated to the superfluous people on  TV, on 4 October of last year, that the state which had  previously protected them from thieves will now protect the  peace and comfort of the new elite from them, from the  Sovietized creatures whom nobody has any use for.    They are now impressing on all the superfluous people that  the difficulties they are experiencing are temporary in nature.  The brainwashing department that has now replaced the agitation  and propaganda arm of the CPSU Central Committee gently induces  us to think that inflation is the main enemy (next to the  Reds-and-Brownshirts) at this stage in history. If we overcome  this perfidious evil, the Russian people will live no worse than  the British in their vaunted Lemonia (as is known, this  geographic discovery was made by Vasiliy Aksenov).    However, how is inflation to be overcome, along with the  other evils of the period of transition? The segment of society  on whose backs the chosen ones have gotten across to the other,  promised side of the precipice live with this burden on their  minds at present.    Prescriptions for the struggle have already matured in many  brilliant revolutionary minds. As far as the miners are  concerned, they are prepared to act straightforwardly. These  guys know how to get to the top of their "game" in a cavalier  manner. Were they not the ones to yell in 1989 louder than  anyone else: Give us PUKK, and down with the commies? Now they  are also yelling: "Gaydar is gone, down with Chernomyrdin and  the president to boot! Since the war, 40 governments have  changed in Italy, but now they gorge themselves on spaghetti  with Uncle Ben's sauce every day. We will keep toppling prime  ministers and presidents until such time as we elect those who  know how to cancel inflation, corruption, and nonpayments by a  single decree." To the sound of such inflammatory rhetoric, a  certain well-known gentleman who is counted among the fascists  is already walking about and stroking his gilded belly.    If we disregard emotions, it would be worthwhile to think  hard: Yegor is, of course, a "lab chief" and the "Mephisto of  the Russian economic reform." But how did he manage to produce a  budget that patched so many gaping holes literally with nothing,  literally out of thin air, without being distracted for a second  from his principal objective?    This is where we learn Gaydar's main secret. The Russian  PUKK  which he has reared and cherished has three sources and three  components, as Marxists said at one time. You will be very  surprised, but these are inflation, the nonpayments crisis, and  a paralysis of the state industrial system. While our liberals  and conservatives fought the ills of the economy at  get-togethers and on the pages of the press, Yegor Timurovich  knew for sure that the treasury was empty, that he would not be  given credit from overseas, and that his path toward the market,  i.e. capitalism, could become yet another utopia under the real  conditions of Russia--the existence of a monolithic community of  directors and labor collectives which guarded so-called  all-people's assets like the apple of their eye--unless the  mechanism of antieconomics operated to counterbalance these  forces.    Yegor Timurovich was not an indecisive tearful  Bolshevik, one of those who are scared by the forthcoming  difficulties. Very soon the entire industry of Russia was on its  last legs due to inflation and the universal plague into which  the nonpayments crisis had turned. There were no orders. Working  capital and credit ran out. There was nothing to pay wages with.  This turned out to be enough for the directors, the erstwhile  sworn enemies of the elements of the market, to turn into the  most faithful allies. It was not without their assistance and  the interested consent of labor collectives that universal  privatization was completed within mere months. The once  prosperous standard-bearers of Soviet industry were auctioned  off at scrap prices. The predominant group thought that they had  become masters: After all, they struck an advantageous deal and  got control of half the plant free of charge. However, what is  to be done next about these shares and about the plant, which  has no orders? The new-fangled owners do not know it. Instead,  this is known by the tycoons of private financial corporations,  although they are in no hurry to make an appearance on  stage.    To some, inflation is worse then the plague. However, to  Yegor Timurovich and the future owners it has become a mighty  lever of Archimedes. The crisis ruined many people; but others  managed to accumulate powerful capital of their own without  producing anything at all. People who had access to loans,  licenses, and quotas grew rich playing for the fall of the  exchange rate of the ruble against the dollar. Drawing on  inflation and other companion phenomena, the father of the  Russian PUKK conducted the historical process of primary  accumulation of capital in Russia in two years. Mother Europe  needed hundreds of years to accomplish this.    To be sure, Gaydar's adversaries have one argument against  PUKK which is irrefutable in a way. They say that, first, Gaydar  abandoned regulation in the economy, relying only on the  elements, and second, neglected a program for social protection  of the dispossessed. The opponents are in error yet again in  this instance. Prices, and even the entire economy, were  regulated by the printing press.    I believe that Yegor Timurovich was secretly rubbing his  hands with glee in all this: His provider, inflation relieved  the government of many of its past debts and obligations:  Payments happened to be made with another kind of rubles. In the  process, Gaydar said publicly: "Guys, I had nothing to do with  it. You were the ones to demand that the delayed wages be paid,  you demanded new bonuses; so as a result you got an inflationary  cycle not planned by the government."    Now about the social protection program. Who said that  Gaydar  has forgotten the poor, the impoverished, and the indigent,  retirees, and war veterans? Indeed, inflation swallows our  money. However, it is a veritable boon to the socially  unprotected strata of the population. After all, it is precisely  through inflation and delayed payments that Gaydar has taken  away from some (we might say from all of us) in order to give to  others (that is, once again to almost all of us).    Besides, under Russian conditions cataclysmic inflation  is even a humane means to implement unpopular reforms. The  previous rulers reached into our wallets and passbook accounts  from time to time, justifying themselves bashfully. However, as  a rule, such one-time expropriation induced universal shock.    Khrushchev raised meat prices (to 2.6 rubles per  kilogram) just once, pointing to prices abroad. He was not  forgiven for this fault of his as long as he lived. Brezhnev  introduced the annual date of 1 April as a merry state holiday  during which it was allowed to "temporarily" raise individual  prices. He was not forgiven for that either (and not at all for  his senile weakness and the golden stars), even after his death.  Prime Minister Pavlov froze our savings for a few weeks once,  but where is he now?    Unlike all his unpopular predecessors, Yegor Timurovich  created a system for continuous rather than just one-time  action. Everything we have managed to receive in the form of  wages, bonuses, retirement benefits, profits, and dividends is  now siphoned away from us every second of every day rather than  just once a year. We cannot name anyone personally as the robber.    After all, it is inflation, something like Gogol's elusive  nose which once abandoned the face of a St. Petersburg official  and lived autonomously and independently in the surrounding  space. Gaydar has left the stage, but the nose continues to  cruise and circulate, sometimes surfacing in a provision of yet  another edict or under the guise of an important statesman. In  the process, all of us are frequently left holding our noses.    In general terms, inflation now amounts to a powerful  accelerator of the collapse of state property and the  establishment of private property. The need for this catalyst  will no longer exist when the process is completed (in 1991 we  called ourselves supporters of market reforms, i.e. PUKK, almost  to a man), when private owners of all plants, minerals, and land  come along. Inflation will disappear, and a hard currency will  appear. There will also be firm laws protecting the gains of the  owners. Believe me, the long-awaited international capital will  then appear on the Russian stage, too.    Russia has not appreciated its great man, Yegor Gaydar.  Rather than drift as the waves and currents command, he made the  clumsy, heavy ship of our domestic economy sail into the wind,  against hostile whirlwinds, tapping in the process the energy of  the winds and whirlwinds themselves. The people on the deck are  groaning and cursing. Rolling makes some sick. Some are  threatening the helmsman with mutiny. However, gentleman, you  are forgetting that in 1991 you were the ones to give the  ultimate assignment to the captain: "Give us PUKK!" So, we are  sailing to the promised country of Lemonia in keeping with it.  The captain is filling the social order accurately.</p>

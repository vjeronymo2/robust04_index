The chairman of the National Executive Committee of the Left  Revolutionary Union of Peru, Angel Castro Lavarello, received  the Korean ambassador on March 9. He said the United States  should honestly implement the agreed conclusions, and added:  "The third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks must be held as  scheduled and the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula must be  resolved in a package deal as proposed by the DPRK."    The chairman of the Nepal Workers and Peasants Party,  Narayan  Man Bijukchhe, released a statement on March 4 saying that the  "nuclear issue" on the Korean peninsula had been invented and  scenarized by the United States and it had rendered the  situation of the Korean peninsula strained against the interests  of the Asian people.    He voiced firm solidarity with the Workers' Party of Korea  and the Korean people in the consistent efforts they are making  for the relaxation of the situation of the Korean peninsula  through talks, maintaining a principled stand, undaunted by the  U.S. pressure and threat.</p>

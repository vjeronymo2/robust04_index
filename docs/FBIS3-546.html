			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Joe Latakgomo] </F>   [Text] On March 5 last year, the Zambian nation woke up to  the shock news that President Frederick Chiluba had declared a  state of emergency and ordered the arrest of several opposition  politicians, including the sons of former President Kenneth  Kaunda, over plans to overthrow the government.    For many observers, the action was seen as a smokescreen for  the serious economic problems that the country faced as Zambia  battled to extricate itself from the clutches of 27 years of a  socialist economic and political regime. The fragility of newly  democratic regimes was demonstrated once more with Zambia's  example. Intervention by the World Bank and the International  Monetary Fund have not softened the impact of new economic and  fiscal policies on the average Zambian, who had looked up to  Chiluba and the Movement for a Multiparty Democracy (MMD) for  economic salvation following their 1991 election victory.    For many, however, Chiluba has turned out to be a lameduck  president. His opponents accused him of being unable, or  unwilling, to deal with allegations of corruption and  drug-dealing in government circles. And even his threat at the  beginning of last year that 1993 would be the year of discipline  within the party and government has done little to gain the  confidence of Zambians.    Chiluba had warned that "inside the velvet glove was a fist  of steel", when responding to a growing demand for clean and  accountable government, but the only show of steel was against  opposition members. Now into his third year of power following  victory on the wave of pro-democracy sentiment that raced across  Africa since 1991, time is running out if the MMD hopes to be  returned to power in 1996.    So far, there has been very little tangible improvement in  the lives of the people of Zambia. Indeed, for many, the  situation has deteriorated. The price of consumer goods --  including staple foods -- has shot up, sometimes by as much as  200 percent. Inflation is racing away above 150 percent.  Unemployment is rampant, and the privatisation programme that  was seen as a cure-all, seems to have ground to a halt.    Nobody in government seems to have fully grasped the  vastness  of the financial resources required to make the programme work.  Health services, education and roads have deteriorated  dramatically, and resistance to government expenditure on the  "non-productive sector" has ensured the deterioration continues  unabated.    Real per capita incomes are still low, and cuts in the  bloated civil service have resulted in thousands of disgruntled  civil servants, used to the patronage that derives from  autocratic rule. This was the unkindest cut of all -- and the  opposition was quick to exploit this and other job losses and to  extol the virtues of previous systems which at least guaranteed  jobs and kept food prices artificially low.    Chiluba assured concerned donor nations that the state of  emergency would not be kept in force "a day longer than is  absolutely necessary." Late last year, these donors at the  Paris Club made it clear they would not deal with Zambia unless  the government fired those involved in drugs and other corrupt  actions. A variety of Ministers were axed or resigned.    The backing by the unions helped Chiluba -- and the MMD --  into power, but now even the support of labour is doubtful.  Some unionists are now opposed to continued association with  the government, and one leader has even called on the unions to  "stop prostituting themselves to both workers, capital and  political leaders."    Was liberalisation pushed too fast for such a fragile  economy? It seems so, and the dangers of unfulfilled  expectations are quite obvious for those -- including South  Africa -- now going the path of democratisation.</p>

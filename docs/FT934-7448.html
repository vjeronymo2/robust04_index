			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Lucas dismisses pay rumours MR GEORGE Simpson, who takes over as chief executive at Lucas Industries, the international engineering group, next May, will be paid the market rate, Sir Anthony Gill, chairman and current chief executive, said yesterday. Talking after a tranquil annual meeting in Solihull yesterday, Sir Anthony dismissed as 'rubbish' widespread suggestions that Mr Simpson's remuneration package is worth millions of pounds. 'We are worshippers of the market. We live by the market,' he said. This suggests that Mr Simpson will receive pay at or around the level received by Sir Anthony - Pounds 355,000 a year. It will be topped up by a performance bonus, which on the basis of past practice at Lucas, could amount to between 10 and 12.5 per cent of his salary. Mr Simpson will also receive a so far unspecified number of share options. When Mr John Grant last year became finance director he received options on 808,080 shares at what now looks a low price of 99p a share. Mr Simpson can expect more shares but at a higher price. Sir Anthony owns 660,000 shares and has options on a further 948,714. Mr Simpson's arrival at Lucas presages further management changes. The group is splitting up the post of chief executive and chairman, with Sir Anthony staying temporarily as non-executive chairman. The handover, said Sir Anthony, 'will take some thinking out', but he expects Mr Simpson to decide the order in which he wants to take over responsibilities. 'I've a vested interest in it working well. I have money tied up in the company,' Sir Anthony added, referring to his shareholdings. 'The understanding is that I would see in the new chief executive and then the nominations committee (of the board) would get to grips with the appointment of a new non-executive chairman. I'd be surprised if that's not sorted out by the end of next year,' he said. Although Sir Anthony observed that 'it would be a rash promise to say there will be no more changes,' Lucas now appears to be within reach of greater management stability. There were three finance directors in four years. The first retired, the second, Mr David Hankinson, 'turned out not to be right for the sort of organisation we found ourselves having to have two years later,' said Sir Anthony. The meeting heard that elections in relation to the enhanced scrip dividend alternative had been received in respect of holdings totalling 668.5m existing shares (about 94.3 per cent). BZW has received acceptances of its cash offer in respect of 193.6m existing shares (27.32 per cent).</p>

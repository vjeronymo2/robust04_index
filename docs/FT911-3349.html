			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Industry surveys the gloom FT-SE Index: 2,488.6 (-15.2) A couple of days ago, the UK chancellor announced that his assessment of the economy would henceforth rely more heavily on anecdotal surveys of consumer and business confidence. The latest quarterly survey from the British Chambers of Commerce will have dampened his spirits accordingly. The level of home and export orders is plunging faster than ever, in both manufacturing and services. Expectations on employment and investment are down again, as is capacity utilisation. Against the odds, there is a modest revival in business confidence. Significantly, though, it relates more to sales than to profitability. There is room for slight scepticism on the findings, since the Chambers of Commerce survey does not have the same long history as that of the Confederation of British Industry. But there is no reason to suppose the two will differ radically. If the CBI confirms the picture in its quarterly survey next week, the equity market will have to rethink the timing on the recovery of the UK economy as a whole. Equally, the chancellor might be tempted to rethink his views on interest rates. But as luck would have it, sterling is proving a minor casualty in the battle between the D-Mark and the dollar, besides perhaps suffering from market nerves ahead of next month's UK local elections. Earlier this week, it was the second strongest currency in the ERM after the peseta. It has now fallen to fifth place. There is no real threat from the mooted rise in German interest rates, since the D-Mark has meanwhile dropped to second bottom in the system after the French franc. But with sterling now bang in the middle of its divergence range, it is a risky time for UK rates to move aggressively the other way.</p>

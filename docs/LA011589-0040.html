			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PIRANHAS AFTER 'BRAZIL'  </P> <P> Shame. I've seen films ruined before by studio executives, but Universal  Studios' televised version of "Brazil" takes the cake (Outtakes item, by Steven  Smith, Jan. 8)!  </P> <P> It is ironic that film maker Terry Gilliam, whose chief idea was to warn us of  "the system," should lose out in the end to the Big Brother of Universal.  </P> <P> But the real losers are those who see this movie for the first time and think  this version -- which has undergone changes in editing, the musical score,  dialogue and the ending -- is the real thing.  </P> <P> Bah humbug! What a way to start the new year.  </P> <P> GREGORY NERI  </P> <P> Manhattan Beach  </P></p>

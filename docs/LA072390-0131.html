			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> BABY BORN DURING 'DIE HARD'  </P> <P> The nonstop action in "Die Hard 2" may have been too much for Kami Core, who  went into labor midway through the movie and gave birth 20 minutes later in the  theater restroom.  </P> <P> Core, 18, wasn't particularly concerned going to the theater Saturday since she  wasn't due for almost two months.  </P> <P> But about halfway through the action thriller, Core began feeling labor pains.  She went to the restroom, where paramedics were summoned. About 20 minutes  later, she gave birth to Cortney Brion Samuels on the restroom floor.  </P> <P> Seven weeks premature, the infant and her mother were taken to Kennestone  Hospital. Core was to be released Monday but Cortney won't go home for another  two weeks.  </P> <P> "Stuff like that happens on television, but it never happens in real life,"  Core said.  </P></p>

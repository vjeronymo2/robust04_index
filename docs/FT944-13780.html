			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Old row entangles Rowland and Fayed The complicated relationship between Mr Mohamed Fayed and Mr Tiny Rowland - once friends, then enemies, now allegedly buddies - took an extraordinary twist yesterday when it emerged that they are in effect suing each other again. They find themselves at opposite ends of a court case because of an indemnity which Mr Rowland's company, Lonrho, gave to Mr Graham Jones, a former employee of Mr Fayed who defected to Lonrho. Because of this indemnity, a potentially substantial liability may have been created for Lonrho by legal proceedings which Mr Fayed initiated at the beginning of the year for breach of confidence against Mr Jones, former finance director of House of Fraser, the stores group acquired by the Fayed brothers in 1985. Mr Jones is defending the action. Mr Rowland last night confirmed the existence of the indemnity, but said that he did not believe Mr Fayed would do anything to damage him. Mr Royston Webb, Mr Fayed's legal adviser, said that in the forthcoming case he would be contesting the validity of the indemnity. He said that there was precedent that such an indemnity was void if wrongdoing was proved. Mr Michael Cole, a colleague of Mr Fayed, said Mr Fayed and Mr Rowland 'currently love each other', so he did not believe Mr Fayed would pursue the case if it hurt Mr Rowland. Until peace broke out last October, Lonrho and the Fayeds had been warring in and out of court for eight years, because of Mr Rowland's fury that the Fayeds had snatched House of Fraser from under his nose. As part of his campaign to destabilise the Fayeds, Mr Rowland had allegedly secretly recruited Mr Jones in the spring of 1990. Mr Jones had left House of Fraser in January of that year and had allegedly undertaken not to divulge confidential information. Mr Jones allegedly received payments of Pounds 555,000 from Lonrho between April 1990 and June 1991. During that period, he allegedly supplied information to the Bank of England alleging that the Fayeds were not fit to own Harrods Bank. The Bank took action against the Fayeds and in June 1991 it forced them to surrender their management control of Harrods Bank to an independent trustee. Mr Fayed was furious. He had long suspected that Mr Jones had worked with Lonrho but could not prove it. After Mr Fayed and Mr Rowland agreed to drop their court cases against each other, he asked Mr Rowland for documentary evidence on Lonrho's relationship with Mr Jones. An associate of Mr Rowland said he could not imagine why he passed on the documents: 'He must have forgotten the existence of the indemnity.'</p>

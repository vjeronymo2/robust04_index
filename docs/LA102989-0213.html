			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Joseph Coria. The following information about Joseph Coria, a candidate for the  Montebello City Council, was deleted from a list of candidates and their  backgrounds in last Sunday's Southeast section. Coria, 46, has lived in the  community for 14 years. He works as medical administrator at the Garmar Medical  Group in Montebello. He is on the board of the Montebello Chamber of Commerce  and is a member of the board of the Montebello Downtown Business Assn. Coria  supports the right of the city to use eminent domain to acquire property for  redevelopment, one of the hottest issues in this year's election. He is running  on a seven-point platform that, among other things, calls for better police,  fire and paramedic service in the city, more youth activities and more health  awareness in the community.  </P></p>

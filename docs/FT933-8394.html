			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Observer: Sound of silence The break up of Yugoslavia has posed a tricky problem for the organisers of the world athletics championships in Stuttgart. The International Amateur Athletics Federation has decided that athletes from the Yugoslav athletic federation will be allowed to compete as independents wearing a white outfit with no national colours.

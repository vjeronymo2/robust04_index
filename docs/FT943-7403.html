			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo up on talk of US link Pharmaceuticals giant Glaxo Holdings resisted the market's nervousness as the legacy of US buying at the end of last week was helped by support ahead of figures in a fortnight and takeover optimism. Reports in the Sunday press that Glaxo was preparing a link with PCS, the US pharmacy benefits management company recently acquired by Eli Lilly gave an early lift to the stock which was up 11 at best. This was further helped by optimism over the full-year dividend. Pharmaceuticals analyst Mr Robin Gilbert of Panmure Gordon spoke at the morning meeting and argued that the company would announce a second-half dividend of 18p this year against 15p last year, giving 27p for the full year. Glaxo is set to announce its figures for the year to June on September 8 and expected to publish profits of around Pounds 1,850m against Pounds 1,675m last year. The shares ended the day 3 better at 639p.</p>

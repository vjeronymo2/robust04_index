			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gadi Yatziv] </F>   [Text] Even after a week's time, we still cannot fully take  in and comprehend the significance of the massacre in the Cave  of the Patriarchs in all its evil and wickedness. That is how it  always is with events so loathsome that people simply cannot  absorb them. If we were to make a concerted effort to grasp this  outrage in its true dimensions, we might well fall prey to the  blackest bitterness for days on end.    To gain some appreciation of this atrocity, which cannot be  comprehended in full, let us suppose that such a thing had  happened to Jews. I am attempting here to conjure up from our  historical memory some anti-Semite driven by ideological hatred  who breaks into a synagogue and indiscriminately shoots hundreds  of Jewish worshippers at prayer on Yom Kippur, killing them for  no reason other than that they are Jews. I recall a great many  instances when Jews, by the hundreds and thousands, have been  killed while praying, but not a single time when Jews killed  others as they prayed. This demented murderer deliberately chose  the hour of prayer as the hour of his murder. As a religious  man, he completely understood what it means for a man to commune  with his God, and precisely at that moment of the soul's  purification, decided to unleash his welling hatred, that deadly  hatred of his that had been burning within him all his life.    Now we are trying to assess the effect of this murder on the  peace process, which is the most pressing and fateful issue in  the short term. Even so, beyond the consequences for the peace  process, which shall be of short duration one way or another, we  will be compelled to deal with the effect of this murder on our  collective psyche, and in that respect the effect will be felt  for a long, long time, even for generations. This is a subject  that will be with us from now on because the murderer gave vent  to dreadful impulses that continue to spread within a large part  of our public. And this is a public much larger than we are  ready to admit.    Let us not delude ourselves. Goldstein is not an anathema as  he ought to be for the entire nation of Israel. He is a hero for  many, and not just in the Jewish community of Hebron. Many  others are prepared to understand his motivations, rather than  be shaken by what he did, and to find a thousand excuses for  redeeming this maggot.    We often speak of "the corrupting occupation," but we really  do not mean a serious deterioration in norms or a steep decline  in morality, but only petty backsliding bordering on breaking  the rules of orderly administration.    Accordingly, we must finally realize the tragic truth, that  a  large part of our citizenry has already been corrupted by the  occupation to the depth of their souls. Anyone who does not  believe that should ask the teachers who have discussed this  issue with their students in Tel Aviv, Hertziliya, Haifa, Be'er  Sheva, Jerusalem, and everywhere else in the country.    The Goldstein virus has succeeded in infecting the  bloodstream of too many Israelis for us to continue to feel at  ease with the current state of affairs. Carriers of the virus do  not exhibit any special outward signs as they meet us in daily  life, but on the appointed day, a day of peace or of war, they  are liable to inflict further calamities on us; and the disgrace  will be ours then, too.</p>

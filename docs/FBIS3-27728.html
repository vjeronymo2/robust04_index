			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 31 KYODO -- The 129th regular Diet  session opened Monday [31 January] as Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa prepared to draw up an economic expansion program  following a narrow weekend victory over political reform  legislation. The House of Councillors started a full session at  10 AM, kicking off the Japanese parliament's 150-day term that  ends June 29. The House of Representatives begins its full  session at 2 PM.    The regular Diet session will immediately go into recess,  probably until February 8, to allow the coalition government to  map out a third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 and the  fiscal 1994 budget.    Hosokawa, fresh from a tough but successful battle over  political reform bills, will find his hands full with a long  list of tasks, including a summit meeting with U.S. President  Bill Clinton in Washington on February 11 and a new economic  stimulus package worth about 15 trillion yen, official sources  said.    The pump-primer package will contain an income tax reduction  of some 6 trillion yen, which will become part of the fiscal  1994 budget program starting April 1, the sources said.    Hosokawa's policy address to both houses of the Diet will be  delayed at least until late February, making it increasingly  difficult for the Hosokawa cabinet to win parliamentary passage  of the fiscal 1994 budget before the end of the current fiscal  year March 31, the sources said. Under that pessimistic  scenario, the sources said, Hosokawa has to fashion a  provisional budget program to keep the government running, in  addition to the current fiscal year's third supplementary budget  to help lift the economy out of its worst postwar recession.    At about the same time, his coalition government has to work  with the primary opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to  modify the political reform legislation which barely passed the  Diet on Saturday, the final day of the extraordinary session,  coalition lawmakers acknowledged.    The controversial legislation calls for replacing the 511  multiseat constituencies for the powerful lower house with a  combination of 300 single-seat electoral districts and 200  proportional representation seats. It also provides a single  fund-raising organization for each politician to solicit  donations from businesses and other groups.    Backed by veteran back room strategist Ichiro Ozawa,  Hosokawa  managed to broker the political reform deal with LDP President  Yohei Kono in what critics called a "dango" or big-rigging  fashion.    The Finance Ministry, under pressure at home and abroad to  take more effective economic stimulus measures, will unveil its  fiscal 1994 budget program and the government will formally  decide on its fiscal 1994 budget around February 15 after some  modifications, officials said.    Additionally, the officials said, the Hosokawa government  will submit to the Diet the current fiscal year's third  supplementary budget program aimed at buoying the stagnant  domestic economy.</p>

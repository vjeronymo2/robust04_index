			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Man In The News: Smoother after a few days' growth - The US president has risen in stature since his successful state of the union address / Bill Clinton President Bill Clinton was so smooth and eloquent in his state of the union address on Wednesday night that most people must have assumed it was either the result of hours of practice or reliance on the teleprompter or both. Keen students of the Clinton speech-making technique thought they detected some typical extemporisation. But against the press of deadlines and with advance copies of his text unavailable until moments before delivery there was little cross-checking between what he said and the official script. The local correspondent of the Economist, however, is on sabbatical. Like most journalists in Washington with a moment to spare, he was in a TV studio preparing to comment on the president's address and he had a text in front of him. He calculates that up to 30 per cent of what Mr Clinton actually said was made up as he stood there. Whole sections - including one beautifully calibrated passage on the economic and social imperatives of healthcare reform - were nowhere to be found in the written text, at least not until the White House released the version as delivered afterwards. Speechmaking is an important ingredient of the politician's art and, when on form, which is normally late in the day, Mr Clinton can be better than most. But lots of fine politicians have the rhetorical ability of newts. What marks Mr Clinton out is an ability to be rhetorically turned on not only by the emotion of the moment but also by subjects, such as rural electrification, community block grants and ad valorem taxes, which normally render most speakers unintelligible and send most audiences to sleep. This can only be the result of his being what he is - a policy 'wonk'. All the evidence is that he was involved in every minute detail in the 50 hours of meetings that preceded Wednesday night. So consuming was his engagement that up to hours before he spoke amendments were still being made to the plan by the man himself, thus explaining why the government printing office simply could not get out the full supplementary documentation until the following morning. He is not the sole policy wonk in his new Washington regime. His wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, is another, as members of Congress and others are rapidly discovering as she pursues her investigation into healthcare reform. She is also not without political tact and charm, as witnessed by the fact that she invited to sit next to her on Wednesday night Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and John Sculley, the Apple computer mogul. Neither of them looked the least bit uncomfortable as, it can only be assumed, she discoursed on M2 and MS-Dos. Another in his element, and also delivering a virtuoso, though off-camera, performance earlier on Wednesday, is Leon Panetta, the director of the budget. He rattled through the whole Clinton programme for the benefit of the media, pretty much without notes and with constant asides to obscure congressional budgetary authorities and federal programmes with acronyms from hell. (Try LIHEAP - low income home energy assistance programme - for size). This was, of course, his meat and potatoes for many years in Congress, as it was Lloyd Bentsen's. But the new treasury secretary, following Mr Panetta to the podium, made no attempt to compete, confining himself to a couple of folksy and funny anecdotes before driving up to his old milieu on Capitol Hill to do some serious arm twisting, at which he excels. This week, indeed, saw the true soul of Bill Clinton and his administration. There are still serious doubts about his resolution and his slipperiness - and still more about his ability to get through Congress all or even most of what he has set forth. There may well also have been some sleight of hand, some artful juggling of numbers, in the programme he presented. But there should be much less doubt about his convictions. The bottom line for Mr Clinton is that he was elected to change the way the country is run. He defines his mandate for change not as the measly 43 per cent of the vote that he won last November, the second lowest winning percentage this century, but as the 62 per cent that he and Ross Perot combined to score in reaction to the status quo. As he put it on Wednesday, 'unless we have the courage now to start building our future and stop borrowing from it, we're condemning ourselves to years of stagnation, interrupted by occasional recessions, to slow growth in jobs, to no more growth in incomes, to more disappointment.' Apocalyptic it may sound, but oversell is a proven technique. Second, he came to the office with the firm conclusion that if he was to achieve anything of substance it had to be laid out from the very beginning. This is always any new president's greatest window of opportunity. The chances of Congress agreeing to tax increases and serious spending cuts diminish as mid-term elections approach. If, as happens more often than not, the president's party in Congress loses seats in the mid-terms, then the third year of an administration becomes inauspicious for big initiatives unless early victories have been won. Third, he can be simultaneously politically ingenious and ingenuous. Until a week ago, the latter characteristic appeared to predominate as he floundered around trying to find an attorney general and to get the military to accept homosexuals. But it was ingenuity of no small order to challenge the Republicans to come up with bigger and better spending cuts than he had proposed and also to say that 'if we do right by this country, I do not care who gets the credit for it'. Mr Clinton's convictions are also not those of the conventional 'tax and spend' big government Democrat of conservative demonology, though he may be more inclined to tax in what he sees as a necessary cause than cut spending with the same aim in view. Critics of his package have noted that it constitutes a significant retreat from an early promise by Mr Panetta and Mr Bentsen to try and find Dollars 2 in spending cuts for every Dollars 1 in new taxes. Mr Panetta claims an equal division over four years but the hard numbers look more like a ratio of Dollars 2 in cuts for Dollars 3 in taxes. Mr Clinton's departure from the Democratic norm is that he believes in both government and the private sector in more equal balance than his predecessors. As he put it on Wednesday: 'tonight I want to talk to you about what government can do because I believe government must do more.' But, having taken away the Reagan legacy in 19 words, he gave some of it back in his very next sentence. 'But let me say first that the real engine of economic growth in this country is the private sector.' Mr Clinton can, and does, wax eloquently about the virtues of small business, in particular, though not overpaid corporate fat cats, just as he does about the nobility of employment as compared with the dependence of welfare. 'I pledge to you that I will do my best to see that business and labour and government work together - for a change.' In this respect he freely contrasts what the US, in his view, does wrong and what Germany and Japan have done right. It was significant, therefore, that after the opening rhetorical ruffles and flourishes, the first segment of his address on Wednesday night was devoted to the cause of making business more competitive, with government help by way of investment incentives, a better trained and educated workforce and infrastructural improvements. The bleeding heart stuff, movingly as it was rendered, came later. The tax element, surely the most controversial, came last. As he has taken his campaign around the country in the past 48 hours, it is interesting to note that he presents his arguments to ordinary people in a very similar and detailed way. He may, for populist purposes, dwell a little more on the evil ways of lobbyists and other 'naysayers' but he sees no reason to shy away from the fact that he probably knows his brief better than anyone in his government, including Mr Panetta. He does not talk down to people and he is a very good listener. This week, he is basking in the glory of general approbation, with the opinion polls favourable, Ross Perot offering qualified support, the Republicans on the defensive, and the Washington pundits prepared to give him his due. There were even the first kind words from Brussels and Tokyo. This must also please a president who is known to believe that the greatest single contribution he can make to international prosperity is to put the domestic house in order, as America's friends and allies have been urging for years. Yesterday, a leader in the New York Times, previously as hostile to Mr Clinton as it was to the last two southern presidents, LBJ and Jimmy Carter, praised his 'vision' and wrote: 'Presidents must seem to grow larger in office. By that standard Wednesday evening was a plus for Mr Clinton and the nation.' Cautiously it added, 'it is too early to rejoice'. But Mr Clinton would agree with the caveat and knows this week's euphoria will not last. He has privately told visitors in the past week that he was confident enough in his programme and in his own performance to expect good initial reviews, but that soon the fight will really begin. This is when he is really going to have to show his leadership and sell his convictions.</p>

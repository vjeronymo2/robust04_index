			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Fault-lines spread from without to within: After a divisive meeting in Kiev, the republics of the former Soviet Union face a mounting crisis of cohesion Mr Leonid Kravchuk's astonishing display of frankness at the end of the summit meeting of the Commonwealth of Independent States on Friday has effectively undercut whatever grounds that organisation may have for remaining in effective existence - though its paper form may continue for some time yet. The Ukrainian president said the CIS had done nothing useful in its short life of four months; that it was probably doomed; that Russia would never permit a discussion of the division of what had been Soviet property at home and abroad, and is now effectively Moscow's property since Russia has proclaimed itself the successor state to the Soviet Union. Though he is living dangerously, Mr Kravchuk has little choice but to take a tougher line with Moscow and little reason for preserving the pretence of harmonious co-operation between the CIS partners. The national temper continues to rise in Ukraine, as every Russian act is interpreted as threatening, and Mr Kravchuk relies increasingly on the nationalist parties and groups for his political survival. The best reason for staying within the CIS was to retain leverage over the Russians and to try to persuade them to moderate energy price rises. But it seems certain Ukraine will soon lose that battle. Mr Vladimir Lopukhin, the Russian energy minister, is likely to cut subsidies for oil supplies to Ukraine. Hence Ukraine's stance at the CIS meeting; hence the underscoring by General Konstantin Morozov, the Ukrainian defence minister, of the fact that Ukraine has signed no military treaties with other CIS members; hence the comments by senior Ukrainian officials that this was the last, or at best the penultimate, Commonwealth summit. Since the Ukrainian-Russian relationship is the indispensable pivot of any such grouping, this probably means the end. But this is no bad thing: the reasons for the Commonwealth were high-sounding but empty, like much of the former communist rhetoric of the Gorbachev period. However, unlike still earlier communist rhetoric, there is no underlying coercive strength, rooted in the party and the secret police, to ensure cohesion remains. There are good reasons for a Commonwealth - the need to preserve economic ties, to develop civilised approaches to each others' minorities, to address the national conflicts, to divide property rationally, to maintain common services and common security and to assist in the similar tasks with which all are confronted in their stated aims of making the transition from totalitarianism to democracy and capitalism. But these ambitions are now for the birds. Nationalism is far too strong and the resurrection of long-buried grievances too common. Add to this the interests of the ruling elites in the republics - who see diplomatic prestige and opportunities for self-enrichment in greater independence - and it is easy to grasp the lack of interest in doing more than observe the pieties of post-Soviet co-operation. The Friday session of the CIS showed that Ukraine is ready to propose itself as the model for this process towards greater independence: insisting on its right to be a nation unencumbered by the anomalies which the Soviet past has left, such as the presence on its territory of military formations owing their allegiance to another state power. The contrary pole is occupied by Russia, which wants the Commonwealth to stay together. However, it has no clear position on what posture to adopt within the organisation. In general, the temptation for any Russian government is to conflate the former Soviet Union with present Russia, to claim and hold former USSR property and assets, and to seek some general hegemony over the former Soviet area, mainly on security grounds. Russians of any opinion would agree that a potentially hostile government in Kiev would be intolerable, although they would divide on whether or not to prevent that by diplomacy or, ultimately, force. Russia thinks of itself as a great power, and does not think that way about any other member of the Commonwealth. It is thus difficult for it to take seriously the national agendas of countries like Ukraine, since Moscow's first concern is to ensure they do not threaten or harm the superior world role of Russia. The Ukrainian challenge forces Russia to face up to life after the Soviet empire - a painful process since it is certain to be replete will all kinds of insults from former dependencies - and one which is fraught with danger. But there is no alternative, for the neighbouring states or for Russia, if it is to fulfil its wish to become part of the modern world. But there is an even more painful matter for Russia, lurking within its borders. This is the future status of the autononomous areas and non-ethnic-Russian people on its territory. Other republics have such problems too. Georgia and Azerbaijan, for example, are in a state of war with minorities. But Russia has by far the largest dilemma in the shape of the peoples who are the descendants of Caucasian, Siberian, or other races. Some of these minorities number just thousands, others, numbered in millions, often have territory named after them. These areas are now home to stirrings of nationalism. The most populous of them, Tatarstan, has just voted for independence with a 62 per cent majority. Its ethnic people, the Volga Tatars, make up some 48 per cent of the nearly 5m of the autonomous republic's population: Russians account for some 42 per cent. It remains to be seen how far the leadership of the republic will go. The best guess must be that Mr Mintimer Shamiyev, the president and a former Communist party first secretary for the republic, will push it as far as he can. Tatarstan pumps 30m tonnes of oil a year, enough to make it rich if it did not have to share them with the rest of Russia. Of the other 19 autonomous republics within Russia, only Chechenia in the Caucasus has also said it will be independent (it also has oil, and is even more Moslem). The other 18 last week initialled a federative treaty, under which they were given some important concessions - including joint control of mineral rights - but agreed to allow Moscow to be responsible for most state-like functions. However, this has to be ratified by the parliaments of these republics. Already, the Kabardina-Balkaria republic in the Caucausus has demanded changes before it signs up. Russia has a problem of vast scope here. Other empires were able to slough off their subject peoples, and were usually able to wring their hands at a safe distance over post-imperial conflicts. Russia's empire was both contiguous (the former Soviet republics) and internalised (the autonomous republics and districts). It may be able to let the first part go and work out a modus vivendi with its members. But it is beyond present understanding how it can at the same time allow the autonomous republics the freedom some of them desire while constructing a unitary Russian state in which all have equal rights and duties. The Commonwealth may be nearly finished, but the drama of the large and small nations emerging from the ruins of the Soviet Union is only now beginning.</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / EU urged to catch up with the world: The Delors White Paper for the 21st century When European Union heads of government meet for their summit in Brussels on Friday they will be told that the creation of their single market has gone a long way towards resolving the Twelve's competitiveness problems, but 'the truth is that although we have changed, the world has changed faster'. As a result, European Commission president Mr Jacques Delors, in a much-vaunted White Paper on competitiveness, growth and unemployment, calls for far-reaching changes to catch up. But he warns: 'If there were a miracle cure, it would not have gone unnoticed.' Indeed, the paper starts from the premise that Europe is facing an economic and social crisis, of which unemployment is a main feature. The Commission wants big changes in employment policy and a European 'social pact' whereby gains in productivity would be ploughed into new investment and the creation of jobs. It also wants the EU to act as the catalyst for a big investment programme in advanced telecommunications and information systems, and rail, road and energy networks across Europe. With unemployment expected to reach 20m next year, 'the EU should aim to create 15m jobs by the end of the century,' the document says. The framework for creating jobs and improving competitiveness, the document underlines, must remain an open economy, trading within solid multilateral rules after a successful Uruguay Round world trade reform deal, and monetary stability, low inflation and gradually reduced budget deficits, to make possible economic and monetary union and a single European currency. But the White Paper, titled Tackling the Challenges and Moving into the 21st Century, makes clear its main target is unemployment, while emphasising that it is offering only broad guidelines for a complex problem offering no quick fixes. There is, one senior Commission official says, 'an ideological debate between those who believe the (labour) market will clear if you just remove a few obstacles, and those who believe this is a huge economic and social problem' requiring government intervention, albeit by following the trend of the market. On the basis of the final draft, however, the latter views, identified with Mr Delors and Mr Padraig Flynn, the social affairs commissioner, appear to be winning out. But the paper could face a rough ride at the summit. The UK, echoed by Unice, the EU employers' confederation which yesterday produced its own competitiveness blueprint, is pushing hard for labour market deregulation and reduced employment costs. Germany, moreover, as the EU's main paymaster, may balk at the sums in the paper for funding trans-European networks. The White Paper rejects wage-cutting and pruning of welfare payments as only likely to depress demand further, but also dismisses 'a generalised reduction in working hours and job-sharing at national level' which could slow down production. The White Paper's diagnosis is familiar from earlier drafts. Over the past 20 years, unemployment has steadily risen from cycle to cycle, as the European economy's potential growth rate has shrunk from around 4 per cent to 2.5 per cent, the investment ratio has fallen by five percentage points of gross domestic product and Europe has done worse than the US and Japan on jobs, preserving export markets, matching research and development to the market and developing new products. Notably, the EU is failing to harness the growth potential in eastern Europe, and is too slow in responding to 'an increasingly knowledge-based' economy. The document identifies three kinds of unemployment requiring different treatment: cyclical unemployment, caused by low growth; structural unemployment, perhaps two thirds of the total, caused by competition from low-wage economies, the high cost of unskilled labour, deficient training and over-protection of 'traditional industries' in decline; and job losses caused by failure to adapt to the speed of technological change. Growth alone, the document argues, would deal only with the first category. It therefore advocates: Advanced vocational training throughout people's working lives. Labour market flexibility through retraining, flexible working hours, measures to revive the rented housing market to stimulate labour mobility, and (more gingerly) pricing people into work through unemployment benefit cuts, but accompanied by minimum income guarantees. Part-time working and job-sharing at company level, which companies such as car maker BMW at Regensburger in Bavaria have shown can enhance use of plant. Reducing the cost of low-skilled labour by cutting social security contributions on their jobs, to be financed partly by greater tax revenue from the resultant expansion of employment. The paper also suggests that the energy tax now blocked in the Council of Ministers and revenue from another proposal to harmonise taxes on investment could also make up the difference. Re-channeling more public spending on unemployment towards 'active' labour market measures, including a big expansion of employment services for job-seekers. A subsidised expansion of 'social' services in areas such as environmental protection, housing renovation and community care. Officials underline that the trans-European networks programme is not a public works proposal to create jobs, but a plan to make Europe more competitive. A labour market strategy to create jobs is therefore essential. 'Recovery must be achieved principally by developing work and employment and not by going for basically Malthusian solutions' which would create a divided society, the White Paper concludes.</p>

			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: China tries to avert cotton price war WITH COTTON prices rising on shortages in key provinces, China is releasing 500,000 tonnes from national reserves in a desperate effort to cool the market and avert a cotton war, reports Reuter from Beijing. Vice Premier Li Lanqing made the announcement this week at a meeting here to discuss the cotton crisis, the Farmers Daily reported. He said that, with the crop due to fall this year, the extra stocks were being released to stabilise the market and encourage the proper purchase of cotton from farmers - in other words, to stop them from going to the black market. An agriculture ministry official said it was too early to say by how much the crop will fall. He blamed the drop on unusually severe pests and flooding in production areas. Cotton, a vital raw material for the textile industry, one of China's biggest export earners, has caused some of the worst headaches for central planners since reforms began in 1978, with wild fluctuations in production. Output nearly tripled from 2.17m tonnes in 1978 to a record 6.26m in 1984, causing a glut and leaving stocks rotting on the roadside. Output plunged to 3.54m tonnes in 1986. Then the cycle began again, with output rising to 5.68m tonnes in 1991 and falling 20 per cent to 4.53m last year. Cotton remains one of the few crops still entirely under state control, with farmers supposed to sell only to authorised buyers. But at times of shortage a black market develops. On Tuesday, the government announced that it was raising the purchase price from Yn300 (Pounds 34) a dan (50 kg) to Yn330, with a promise of a further increase next year. Mr Li told the meeting that cotton should in the end become a free market commodity but the moment was not yet ripe, so the government had to increase its control over the crop. 'We need to set up a national warehousing system specially for cotton, similar to what we have for grain,' he said. Reports from the provinces, in official newspapers, indicate that the government may have moved too late. In Hebei, an important producer, the shortage this year will be 100,000 tonnes and in Shandong it will be 50,000 tonnes short. Prices have already started to rise, the newspapers said.</p>

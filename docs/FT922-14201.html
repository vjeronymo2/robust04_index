			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Jobs: How recession-bound staff view their work - Employees believe companies have coped well with hard times, but recovery may take them aback HEY, catch an eyeful of what follows] Its author, British, is comparing the jobs out-look at the time of writing with conditions in the mid-1970s: 'One happy difference between then and now is that, in economically advanced nations at least, people reaching the age of 16 today have far better work prospects . . . . Happily, too, the coming shortage of youngsters seems sure to reverse one of the most depressing trends . . , the growing liability of people aged 40-plus not only to be thrown out of work, but to be ruled out of consideration for other jobs that were available.' Rich, eh? Whether to laugh or cry at it will probably be a hard decision even for the thousands now in the said pickle at well under 40 years old. And do you know who wrote it? I did, that's who. Just three years and three months ago. What summoned the ludicrous spectre from the deep was the arrival of a survey* from the Wyatt management consultancy, albeit not one of the executive-pay kind *Work UK 1991. Pounds 30+vat from Wyatt Co, 21 Tothill St, London SW1H 9LL; tel 071-222-8033, fax 071-222 9182. regularly reported here. It was an update of an extensive study of British workers' attitudes to their jobs and companies, which was made by Wyatt in late 1988. That naturally sent me looking back to see what had been said about the earlier findings, and . . . well, the only thing that saved it from suppression was the realisation that I'd believed it, every word. Nor was I alone in wearing such rosy-coloured spectacles. Which suggests there has been a marked change in perspective between the two studies - a shift which provides an illuminating context for the differences in attitudes the follow-up reveals. In both cases the people surveyed all had full-time jobs, were randomly chosen and contacted directly, not through their employer. The number in the update was only 806 as against 3,275 in 1988, the reason being not so much increased difficulty in finding full-time employees, as the consultancy's wish to contain costs. One thing that may reflect the nature of the recession, however, is that whereas nearly one in five of the original 3,275 were managers with at least two levels of staff under them, the same applied to only just over one in 10 of the latest group. So what did the findings show about the attitudes of us still employed Brits last November as compared with those of three years before? The first example - that more of us are worried about our long-term job-security - is less startling than that the anxious proportion has risen only from 36 to 48 per cent. What does seem surprising is that despite our increased worries about security, our morale is high. One question put to the 806, though not asked in the rosy days of 1988, was if their employers had coped well with recession. Over two thirds answered yes, and almost as many thought their organisation well placed to take advantage of an up-turn. To back that air of confidence, questions asked in both surveys suggested that organisational performance has improved. Nearly four in every five of the latest group felt that overall quality of work and services was good, as against three in five before. Employers were seen as tolerating sub-standard workers by only 32 per cent compared with 41, and the proportion saying quality had been reduced for the sake of cost-cutting was up by a mere 1 per cent to 30. The greater confidence in employing outfits was accompanied by a rise in personal satisfaction with the job - up from 59 per cent to 66 in general terms. The belief that payroll-cuts often produce welcome opportunities for the survivors is supported by rises of much the same order in the shares saying their jobs gave them a sense of achievement and a chance to use their particular skills and abilities. Accordingly, perhaps, 45 per cent felt their organisation was more than just a place to work, compared with 38 three years earlier. Even more - 57 per cent as against 45 - said they'd recommend other people to join it. All of which would seem a feather in the cap of the heads of British companies. To stay in business, the managers have imposed some stern treatment on us in the managed majority, and those of us who have survived it, at least, evidently tend to feel better as a result. Which in turn might strike the managers as good reason to go on handing out the same medicine in future, boom or bust. If they do so, however, my suspicion is that they will make the same sort of mistake as the one exemplified by now ludicrous-looking prophecy I made in 1989. It's the mistake of assuming that the forces which dominate in the climate of the moment will continue to be dominant when it changes. Other evidence from Wyatt's study suggests otherwise. The prime case in point is that when the 806 were asked what they intended to do when the economy improved, nearly a quarter said they'd find another job - close on double the proportion who wanted out in 1988. What's more, while the most footloose of the various types of worker were the manual sort, 22 per cent of the managers planned to leave together with 23 per cent of the technical specialists. That finding endorses a lot of other research which shows that, while people may make the best even of military discipline and often admire those who impose it when there's no other choice, they never lose their aspirations to be treated as free-born human beings. Nor do they fail to notice it when they are being treated otherwise. For instance, of Wyatt's 806, around three quarters declared that their boss was not only technically proficient, but understood the work they themselves did. By contrast, less than half thought their boss competent at dealing with human problems and motivating staff. Pay was another thing that, although they broadly felt it adequate in the circumstances, they largely didn't find motivating. Not much more than a quarter considered that how much staff got really reflected the contribution they made, and under a third said they had been helped to improve their work by performance-appraisal schemes. What's more, they were not much encouraged by the promotion prospects in their present company. Of all types of staff, just 33 per cent were satisfied with the openings on hand. Of the technical specialists whose skills are often crucial, only 23 per cent were content. Since a lot of research has shown that good prospects for promotion tend to be decisive in retaining people against jobs-market competition, that finding looks ominous for employers once demand revives. For something that has not changed since 1989 is the decline in the number of young people available for recruitment. So if Britain stages an economic recovery, my rosy forecast might eventually prove right. In which case, given that I'm still around, I'll be tempted to brandish the same words again, proudly for a change. One damper on my hopes of getting the chance, however, is the 806's answers to Wyatt's questions about the approach of the single European market. Only about a third thought their organisation would benefit from the change, and fewer than two in every five said their employers were making any preparations for it at all.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Feliks Babitskiy report under "Situation" rubric: "To Each </F> Opponent -- a Political Double"]    [Text] Two weeks have now passed since the declaration of  the sensational February amnesty, but the disputes surrounding  the question of who needed it and why have still not died down.  Most likely several political intrigues have clashed here, and  their resultant force, so to speak, has apparently not satisfied  anyone.    First of all, the desire of the Duma leadership to  demonstrate its independence of the president to the whole world  and primarily to itself is completely obvious. No less obvious  is the worry of certain parliamentarians that the possible trial  of the "October prisoners" may stir up the electorate's interest  in them on the eve of the presidential elections. On the other  hand, unlike Zyuganov and Zhirinovskiy, Anpilov and Rutskoy were  never professionals in political terms. And therefore, having  been pardoned opportunely by the charity (and, clearly, it is  only the powers that be that can be charitable) of these people,  and having discovered their previous natural niche already  filled, they would be forced, according to the cunning  reckonings of the parliamentarians, to quietly and ingloriously  leave big-time politics. This danger was obvious even from the  Lefortovo cell from which Rutskoy, according to rumors, had told  his supporters in the Duma not to even hint at any amnesty.    However, the events following the amnesty have shown that  even Boris Yeltsin is not at all inclined to oppose it. Thus,  the leaders of the "Russia's Choice" movement, who include many  first-class lawyers and legislators with experience of working  in the previous Union and Russian parliaments, have found a  great multitude of contraventions of existing legislation in the  document adopted by the Duma. It would, apparently, be as easy  as anything to suspend its effect and lodge a complaint in the  Constitutional Court.... But nothing of the sort has happened.  On the contrary, the executive has done all it can to ensure  that the legislature's decision is irreversible.    Is not the whole point that the president too has been able  to come out of this with something?    Once again this cannot be ruled out. Even the "Yabloko"  faction has condemned the amnesty, arguing that by discontinuing  the criminal proceedings against the defenders of the "White  House" the parliament is thus removing responsibility from the  opposing side, whose stance during the October events did not  appear to be irreproachable to everyone either.    And then, Boris Nikolayevich could easily count on the fact  that each of his opponents will obtain a political double and,  instead of opposing him, would be forced to prove to the voter  his own self-identity. After all, it is no secret that at the  December elections Zyuganov got into the parliament by  inheriting Anpilov's electorate, and Zhirinovskiy -- Rutskoy's.  However, it now turns out that they were written off too early,  and they are now demanding back again what is theirs.    I think that this state of affairs suits the president.  After all, it is no secret to anyone today that there are no  legal obstacles to holding extraordinary presidential elections.  And so the only thing that can really avert them is a split in  the anti-Yeltsin camp.</p>

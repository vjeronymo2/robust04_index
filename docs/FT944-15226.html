			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / UK Company News: GAS shareholders foil speculative investor Shareholders in Gartmore American Securities yesterday foiled the attempt of a speculative investor, believed to be American, to grab an unfair share of the trust's assets by exploiting an anomaly in the terms of the debenture stock. The Pounds 51m trust, which was restructured as a split capital investment trust five years ago, had a provisional wind-up date of March 1995. The Pounds 3m debenture stock's official repayment terms are 100p in 2014, but if the trust is wound up earlier, debenture holders are entitled to the average mid-market price of the stock in the three months before wind-up, subject to a cap of 300p. Any extra payment above 100p is at the expense of the ordinary shareholders. An unidentified speculator, acting through Goldman Sachs, acquired 93 per cent of the debenture stock, and succeeded in pushing up its mid-market price from 114p from August to 300p in September. Gartmore responded by giving early notice of the wind-up meeting, so that the debenture entitlement was restricted to 206p. At an extraordinary general meeting yesterday, shareholders voted to relinquish their rights to block an extension of the life of the trust. The board is now working on proposals for a restructuring of the trust which would roll over most of the assets, while giving investors a fair cash offer if they want to withdraw.</p>

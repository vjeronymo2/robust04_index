			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / Venezuela to encourage private investment Venezuela's new government will encourage private investment and try to avoid the errors of past administrations which relied too much on oil revenues, according to Mr Julio Sosa Rodriguez, a top adviser to President-elect Rafael Caldera. Mr Sosa, addressing around 500 Venezuelan and international businessmen, gave few details of the policies of the Caldera government, due to be installed next Wednesday. But he said it would stress austerity, hard work, private investment, international trade and diversification away from oil. The new government would continue to encourage privatisation, and would allow private investment in all government-owned businesses except PDVSA, the national oil company, and Edelca, the state-owned hydroelectric power company, he said. However, joint ventures in oil and petrochemicals (which are controlled by PDVSA) will continue and be supported. Mr Caldera, who won the presidency in elections last December 5, has called for the elimination of an unpopular value added tax. Mr Sosa said the president would propose a coherent tax reform stressing progressive taxation. He denied the new government was planning a large devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar or imposition of exchange controls.</p>

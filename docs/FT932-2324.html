			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / UN forces hunt Somali warlord UN forces in Somalia continued their search for General Mohammed Farah Aideed yesterday in spite of President Bill Clinton's assertion on Thursday night that the operation against his militia was 'over and a success.' There was no confirmation in Washington of a report that Gen Aideed had taken two American and 12 Moroccan peacekeepers hostage, but an Australian army officer in the Somali capital dismissed it as 'totally false.' At his press conference, Mr Clinton said the murder of 23 Pakistani peacekeepers by Gen Aideed's militia two weeks ago 'could not go unpunished.' He added that the purpose of the UN operation 'was to undermine the capacity of Aideed to wreak military havoc in Mogadishu.' UN forces hit Gen Aideed's compound with an air and ground assault on Thursday. His militia fought back using women, children and hospital patients as shields, the UN said. One Pakistani and five Moroccan UN peacekeepers were killed and 43 were wounded, UN spokesman Joe Sills said in New York. The number of Somali casualties was unclear but could range into the hundreds, given the firepower used in the UN assault. In Nairobi Gen Aideed's Somali National Alliance said yesterday the UN attack killed 'more than 120 people, mainly women and children'. The alliance also claimed Gen Aideed's forces captured two American soldiers and 12 other UN peacekeepers. Mr Clinton said he would leave to the UN any decision of what to do with the warlord if he were captured. He denied any US vendetta against Gen Aideed. 'As long as he was willing to co-operate with the UN, he was able to live and work in peace,' the president said. Mr Robert Oakley, chief US diplomat in Somalia during the US intervention begun last November, said in a television interview that while it was right to seek to cripple Gen Aideed's militia it was equally critical for the UN to restart the process of political reconciliation and 'nation-building' in Somalia. Without being specific, Mr Clinton also promised that US personnel would play on-the-ground roles in helping to keep the peace and promote democracy in conflicts such as in Somalia, Camobodia and Bosnia.</p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / How to Spend It: Good design can save money and time - Small, domestic architectural projects COME difficult times and architects are among the first to suffer. The last few years have been tougher than any in living memory. From big companies, to small, specialist groups, hardly one has not had to rethink, retrench and regroup. Bad times for architects are often good times for clients. In Britain a host of young, hungry practices now has the time and energy to invest in small projects - which means that customers will get better value than ever. Clients can be rewarded with the undivided attention of some talented architects. For the architect, any project, no matter how small, is better than no work at all, and, after all, small projects can eventually lead to bigger ones. Many are hungry for the work experience and some actually prefer smaller projects. One reason why architects in the UK are not better used - and better understood - seems to be nervousness on the part of the public. Many people seem to feel that using an architect is the path to outrageous extravagance  -if not uncompromising design. Zeev Aram, of Aram Designs, believes passionately in persuading people that architects are much more than an expensive luxury. A good architect can provide a better solution at lower cost than the haphazard amateur approach that most householders adopt on their own. Hoping to make the public more aware of just what a difference a good architect can make to any house project, Zeev Aram has taken an exhibition, originally on at the Royal Institute of British Architects in Portland Place, London, and is displaying it in his Hampstead, London, showrooms where he hopes to attract the house-converting classes. Every project on show has cost less than Pounds 50,000 and I feel sure that visitors will be amazed at what good value clients receieved. The work of Britain's youngest,most promising architects is on show. The exhibition is on at Aram Designs, 65 Heath Street, Hampstead, London NW3 6UG from now until May 16, so hurry, hurry. Featured on this page are a few of the most domestic projects.</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / IMF loan facility likely for Poland THE POLISH parliament's approval last week of a tight 1993 budget has paved the way for agreement on a new Dollars 660m (Pounds 456m) IMF standby loan at the next executive board meeting of the International Monetary Fund in early March, a senior IMF official said yesterday. Mr Daniel Kaeser, the executive director for Poland, said the vote restraining the budget deficit to around 81,000bn zlotys(Pounds 3.4bn), or 5 per cent of GDP, opened the way to board approval. It also underlined the Fund's assessment that 'the reform process in Poland is becoming a success story with economic growth picking up,' he added. Approval of a new loan to replace an earlier Dollars 1.7bn facility aborted by earlier government instability and above-budget spending, is expected to unlock a series of significant financial agreements and encourage private investment. IMF approval for the Polish government's letter of intent will lead to a 20 per cent reduction in Poland's Dollars 32bn official government debt. This is the second and final stage of the 50 per cent total official debt reduction agreed by the Paris club of official creditors in March 1991. An IMF agreement is also required for completion of Poland's negotiations with the London Club for a similar reduction in Warsaw's Dollars 12.1bn debt to commercial banks. The first round of commercial debt negotiations took place in Vienna last week following the recent appointment of Mr Krzysztof Krowacki as Poland's chief debt negotiator. A green light from the IMF is also expected to be followed by World bank board approval of more than Dollars 1bn of new loans for the energy sector, industrial restructuring and farm modernisation. Loans in the pipeline include a Dollars 450m facility to help finance bank debt restructuring prior to privatisation. Several government credit agencies, including the UK government's ECGD, are also expected to resume export credit cover for Polish business once the above official debt agreements are in place.</p>

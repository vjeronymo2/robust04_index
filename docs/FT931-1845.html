			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Violent search for a settlement at Timex: The confrontation which has followed the sacking of 320 workers in Dundee THE VIOLENT scenes yesterday outside the Timex circuit-board plant in Dundee are indicative of the mounting anger among the 320 strikers who were dismissed by the US-owned company last month, and who are determined to win their jobs back. But they also demonstrate how the workers' cause has been taken up by far-left political groups such as Militant Tendency and the Socialist Workers Party. Their presence is an embarrassment to the AEEU engineering union, which represents the workers. Mr John Kydd, senior shop steward at Timex, said: 'The company will either have to take us all back or close the plant down for good.' Mr Jimmy Airlie, the union's Scottish executive officer said: 'We cannot allow any company to behave in the way that Timex has done and get away with it.' Just over four weeks ago Timex sacked all the workers at the plant - although those who had been in dispute for 21 days had agreed to go back to work under protest. What was even more surprising to some was Timex's decision to sack employees who had worked through the original strike. Mr Peter Hall, Timex's UK president, said this was necessary to prevent legal action by individual workers over imposed changes in their employment contracts. But the move did little to calm the labour force. The ferocity of the strike has taken the normally conciliatory union by surprise. Union officials emphasise their moderate tradition by pointing out that it was the AEEU which wanted a single-union deal with Ford when the company considered building a plant in Dundee five years ago. Union officials said that from the start they had tried to negotiate a compromise but Timex had shown no interest. The Timex president said: 'The dispute is over as far as the company is concerned.' Timex has sought to use the courts to end the dispute. Initially it secured an interdict - equivalent to an injunction - to limit the number of pickets outside its gates to six. But the company's subsequent attempts to tighten the legal restrictions on the strikers have proved less successful. It failed to prevent the 320 former employees from taking part in picketing, and last week the Court of Session in Edinburgh rejected a submission that the union was causing a disturbance by holding marches and demonstrations outside the plant. Some of the strike leaders still face an attempt by the company to have them jailed for alleged breaches of the original interdict. The union says it has withdrawn its legal representation of the leaders for fear of opening its funds to civil damages. With unemployment in Dundee above 10 per cent, the company says it is not encountering difficulties in hiring a new workforce. It insists that its competitive position required drastic action and says falling demand meant it needed to cut costs and reduce production. Timex negotiated with the union for two months. Senior executives from its Connecticut headquarters flew to Britain in mid-February to seek a deal. The workforce was asked to accept a 12-month pay freeze, a 10 per cent cut in benefits including pension rights and a lay-off rota for six months with access to independent arbitration in case of problems. Timex told the union that it intended to extend production in the second half of the year and recruit a further 300 workers. But when the workers refused to accept the package, the company lost patience. The violent scenes yesterday outside the Dundee plant are certainly not wanted by the AEEU, which would like nothing better than a quick and amicable end to what it sees as an unnecessary conflict. Its wish does not seem likely to be granted.</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Business and the Environment: Buddhists clash with hoteliers  -Efforts to preserve Japan's ancient capital Walking through the dark wooden gates of Kouryuji, Kyoto's oldest Buddhist temple, visitors are greeted by a sign politely refusing entry to those staying at the Kyoto Hotel. The temple is one of 1,000 in Japan's ancient capital embroiled in a longstanding row with the city's oldest luxury hotel. The Kyoto is being rebuilt into a high-rise structure due to be completed this summer. For the past three years, the Kyoto Buddhist Association has been protesting that the height of the new hotel - 60m - could detract from the skyline of the ancient religious and cultural city. 'Of course we can't really check where people are staying, but it's our way of standing our ground,' says Chikou Kiyotaki, Kouryuji's chief priest. The Japanese are destroying with their own hands even what the Americans chose to preserve,' he says, referring to the decision by the US air force during the second world war not to bomb Kyoto's numerous temples and gardens. In 1988, restrictions on the height of buildings in Kyoto were eased from 45m to 60m in an effort to boost development and investment. But Akira Nakajima, a lawyer and leader of a group of residents against the urban development of Kyoto, says the height restriction had protected the view of the mountains surrounding the city. The Buddhist monks lost a lawsuit against the hotel in 1992, but have continued to apply pressure. They have been calling for the disclosure of the city's approval procedures for buildings. Last year the city council announced new construction laws to protect certain areas around historic foundations. Meanwhile, the city's efforts to revitalise the industrial area south of the city, including the reconstruction of Kyoto station, have met with controversy. Kyoto's business community regards the new station as the main celebratory project of the city's 1,200th anniversary this year. The city council and local businessmen asked seven leading architects, including the late Sir James Stirling and Peter Busmann, to submit designs for the station. A 400m-wide by 60m-high glass and concrete avant garde structure designed by a Japanese architect was chosen. Norihisa Taniguchi, managing director of the station planning company, says the building, which will be completed in 1996, will become the new symbol of the city - the 'Eiffel Tower of Kyoto'. The group in support of development in central Kyoto claims residents have the right to a normal city life. 'People don't want to live in old wooden houses and become victims of construction restrictions,' says Takeshi Tanaka, managing director of the Kyoto Hotel. He claims the city is experiencing a population drain, especially with university campuses moving out due to building height limits, taking the students with them. Nakajima argues, however, that development in the city is driving people away, adding that it should 'not be just about building high-rise buildings'. He says the city planners of Kyoto lack a comprehensive vision of what the city should look like. Although temples around the foot of the mountains surrounding the city have remained unscathed, many in central Kyoto have not. The wave of urban development during the economic 'bubble' in late 1980s enabled developers to construct office buildings and condominiums around the small temples and shrines in the centre of the city. Kiyotaki offers the pro-development camp a few words for contemplation: 'If Kyoto ceases to become Kyoto, who will want to visit?'</p>

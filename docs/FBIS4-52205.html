He said:    "Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Palestine  Liberation Organisation Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhak Rabin met in Cairo on May 4 and signed an accord on  enforcing autonomy by Palestinians in Gaza and Jericho.    "The accord signed this time, a detailed working agreement  to  implement the declaration of principle on Palestine autonomy  which was signed in September last year, is a result of the  patient efforts of the Palestinian people to retake the lost  land and restore their legitimate national rights.    "The master of the Palestinian problem is the Palestinian  people.    "We respect the will and choice of the Palestinian people in  settling the Palestinian issue and consider signing of the  accord by the Palestine Liberation Organisation to be their  right.    "We hope the accord will be a basis of founding an  independent state of Palestine and the first step for a fair and  comprehensive solution to the Mideast problem.    "The Korean people will as ever actively support the just  efforts of the Palestinian and Arab people for a peaceful  solution of the Mideast problem including the Palestinian issue,  standing on their side".</p>

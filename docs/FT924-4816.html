			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Paris says Eurocorps can come under Nato FRANCE and Germany yesterday told Nato that their planned 'Eurocorps' of up to 35,000 soldiers can come under allied command in time of war or peace-keeping emergency. This signifies a more accommodating stance by France towards Nato, which will be welcomed by the US and other European countries like Belgium which have said they would attach forces to the Eurocorps provided it had some command link with Nato. France and Germany yesterday presented a joint memorandum to their partners in Nato, whose ambassadors will discuss it in Brussels tomorrow. The memo is the basis on which Paris and Bonn will negotiate detailed command arrangements with General John Shalikashvili, the US general who is the top Nato commander known as Saceur. France has agreed that the Eurocorps can come under Nato command, in the case either of a general attack on the alliance or of a decision by Nato governments to dispatch a peace-keeping force outside alliance territory. 'But the condition is Saceur must keep the Eurocorps together as an expression of a European defence identity, and not break up the French and German units and attach them to different formations', said a French official. By contrast, in peace-time there would be nothing to stop Germany temporarily detaching its units from the Eurocorps for different duties, the official said. In contrast to French forces, German troops come under Nato's integrated military command in peace-time. France quit Nato's integrated command in 1966, but a year later it agreed that in the event of an attack on the alliance Nato commanders could count on its forces coming under their control. The Bush adminstration bridled earlier this year when France and Germany announced their plan to build their current joint brigade into a full 35,000-strong corps by 1995, without clarifying its link with Nato.</p>

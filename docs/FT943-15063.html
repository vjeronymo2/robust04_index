			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Domestic politics sets France apart on Algeria policy: Paris finds it difficult to concur with US-led calls for dialogue with Islamic militants Algeria has been put back on the international agenda. Terrorism against westerners working there was discussed at the Group of Seven summit in Naples at the weekend, two days after six Italian sailors were killed on board their grain ship in a harbour east of Algiers. In the communique after the summit, the seven heads of government called cautiously on the Algerian government to establish a dialogue with the Islamic fundamentalists whom it outlawed when they were on the point of winning parliamentary elections 2 1/2 years ago. This represented a delicate compromise between the positions of France on the one hand and the US and Italy on the other. The French are suspicious of the American view that 'reliable and moderate' elements of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) can be found for a dialogue without compromising the current power structure of the military-led government. Yesterday gunmen disguised as Algerian police killed four Russians and a Romanian working with Algeria's state oil company Sonatrach. French and American policymakers agree that, in the words of Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, 'the status quo (in Algeria) is no longer tenable'. And they concur that wide-ranging economic reforms are desperately needed whatever Algeria's political fate. However, neither Paris nor Washington rates very highly the chances of economic reforms being implemented soon because of the political turmoil, though both have backed the programme Algerian leaders agreed with the International Monetary Fund in May and the Dollars 1bn standby loan which came with it. And both supported the rescheduling of Dollars 5bn worth of Algeria's Dollars 26bn (Pounds 17bn) foreign debt by the country's Paris Club official creditors. Beyond that, however, the two capitals appear to be drawing different conclusions from the failure of all attempts so far to bring to the negotiating table Algeria's military commanders and the leaders of the FIS. The difference between the US and French positions is that while Washington is attempting to build a long-term strategy towards a political force which it is convinced is here to stay, French leaders, who privately agree that political Islam will not disappear overnight, feel constrained by domestic considerations. US officials say they are trying to avoid 'demonising' supporters of the FIS, a party which Mr Juppe describes as 'extremist, terrorist, anti-European and anti-western'. French politicians, on the other hand, are caught in a bind. While they acknowledge the present political system is not viable, what conservative politicians fear above all is the fundamentalists either sharing power with the military or seizing power in the run-up to the French presidential election next year. As they see it, such an event would draw the issue of Algeria, radical Islam and perhaps France's 2m immigrants of North African extraction into the election campaign and boost the vote for far-right politicians such as Mr Jean-Marie le Pen. French officials also fear the domino effect of a FIS takeover in Algeria. Some go as far as to argue that Tunisia would 'fall in six months' and that Morocco and Egypt would quickly be threatened. In a joint television interview with President Francois Mitterrand last month, President Bill Clinton made clear that while he shared the concern of Paris about a fundamentalist takeover spreading unrest in the Moslem world, the US would encourage 'the present Algerian government to broaden its base (and) reach out to dissident groups who are not involved in terrorism'. US policymakers have sought to draw on the lessons learned from their country's long estrangement from Iran, as well as from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the strong anti-western feelings it provoked in Arab public opinion. They note that 17 of the 22 Moslem states have falling incomes and a predominantly youthful population. 'The potential for explosion is great,' they warn. The conclusions were summed up recently by Mr Robert Pelletreau, the US assistant secretary of state for near-eastern affairs: 'The US does not view Islam as the next 'ism' confronting the west, or threatening world peace, but does however, object strongly when the US is labelled a great Satan.' The US is 'suspicious of those who would use the democratic process to come to power, only to destroy that process in order to retain political dominance', a clear reference to the FIS assertion that a victory at the polls would only prove Allah's greatness, thus making the holding of any future election a pointless exercise. While concerned at the role of Iran and Sudan in exploiting Islamic extremist groups, the US sees 'no monolithic international control being exercised over the various Islamic movements active in the region'. While it does not wish to impose a western model of government in the Middle East, the US believes that broad political participation is 'an important and necessary contributor to long-term stability. Lack of economic, educational and political opportunities (are what) give extremists of any sort their constituency'. European and US officials also note that French support for reforms in Algeria is a recent development and occurred just before the Socialists lost their majority in the French parliament last year. French conservative politicians acknowledge this and say that not supporting Algerian political leaders who sought to implement bold economic reforms between 1989 and 1992 was a grievous mistake. French support, albeit qualified, for the current Algerian leadership is based on a belief shared by Mr Charles Pasqua, the powerful interior minister, and Mr Juppe that a FIS victory would spell trouble among the large Algerian and broader North African community in France. Some French observers say the high level of unemployment among young North Africans, as much as 50 per cent in some areas, is a more serious threat to social and political peace than events across the Mediterranean. Officials in Paris also say they fear an influx of refugees were the FIS to win power. Some European countries, notably Spain and Germany, are concerned that while the acts of terrorism committed by supporters of radical Islam are repeatedly denounced abroad, the methods used by the security forces, which are increasingly brutal, are seldom mentioned. They believe that the European Union has much to gain in the medium run by being more even-handed. France's key European partner, Germany, the current EU president, needs France's support on east European affairs and has little to gain by questioning the support Paris is lending the Algerian regime. Italy and Spain have their own domestic political difficulties and Madrid is unhappy about the public expression of divergences between the US and France on Algeria policy. French officials agree with their European and US colleagues that most of those who support the FIS do so out of despair at the lack of jobs, corruption and contempt for their leaders. They also suspect that the Clinton administration is hedging its bets by initiating contacts with FIS representatives abroad but acknowledge that US strategic interests in the Middle East include Israel, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, not Algeria.</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / World News in Brief: Bentsen resignation expected US Treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen is expected to resign soon, administration sources said, in what would be a blow to President Bill Clinton as he deals with a Republican-run Congress. Mr Bentsen, 73, a former Democratic senator from Texas, called the reports premature but stopped short of denying them outright. Robert Rubin, a former Wall Street executive who heads the White House's national economic council, is a leading candidate to replace Mr Bentsen. Observer, Page 19</p>

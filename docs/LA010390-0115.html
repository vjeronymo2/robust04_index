			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> MAYOR FEELS DRIVEN TO FINISH ROAD WORK  </P> <P> Several long-awaited improvements to traffic flow will be completed in 1990,  and work on at least one other major transportation project will begin.  </P> <P> Mayor Peter F. Buffa said he also expects the City Council to approve a new  General Plan by March or April, culminating four years of work to design a new  blueprint for the city's development.  </P> <P> "I can't remember a time in Costa Mesa when there wasn't some kind of street  project disruption for drivers to cope with, and it's nice to have the  resurfacing and flood control improvement project on Harbor Boulevard completed  this year," Buffa said.  </P> <P> But residents will have to be patient a while longer as the widening of  Victoria Street continues into 1990, he said.  </P> <P> "That project, which is about 20 years late and desperately needed, is  scheduled for completion this year, along with a comprehensive redevelopment of  the Triangle Square area," Buffa said.  </P> <P> Work is also scheduled to begin this year to complete the Costa Mesa Freeway.  </P> <P> "We have waited over 20 years to finish this project, and I'm really glad to  see it finally come about," he said.  </P> <P> Buffa, who along with Councilman Orville Amburgey is up for reelection this  year, predicted that the painstaking process of approving the new General Plan  will proceed without major delays.  </P> <P> "We seem to be striking a balance between the Proposed General Plan presented  by the City Council and an alternative plan proposed by a citizens' steering  committee," he said.  </P> <P> The plan will set the city's first building limits for commercial, industrial  and institutional land-uses and will reduce the limits for high-density  residential development.  </P> <P> Future hearings will center on a new land-use designation affecting the Home  Ranch project, which has been the subject of an extended battle between  developers and slow-growth proponents.  </P> <P> "Those are the major issues facing us, but there are several sidelights that  are rather important to me," Buffa said. He cited the Police Department's plan  to add an anti-gang unit to work with schools, and tentative plans to expand  the Immigration and Naturalization Service Jobs Center.  </P> <P> "Volunteers from our community literacy project have begun an experimental  project there to teach English to the workers, and I'm very interested in their  success," he said.

			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CONSOLIDATION OF TRANSIT AGENCIES  </P> <P> The subject of my letter is the consolidation of the Orange County  transportation agencies.  </P> <P> I'm a handicapped person who knows a lot about the Orange County Transit  District and I get a lot of information on the transportation needs of Orange  County.  </P> <P> I ride the buses a lot, and I can tell you that the OCTD's bus and van service  is increasing as much as the OCTD says. This fiscal year the ridership is up  15%. The OCTD was predicting only a 3% increase.  </P> <P> The Orange County Transportation Commission wants to take the OCTD and CTSA  (Consolidated Transportation Service Agency) services over. The OCTD is doing a  very good job. I do know that CTSA is trying to do a good job for the  handicapped and the elderly.  </P> <P> In the "Orange County 20-year Master Plan of Transportation Improvements"  prepared for the Orange County Transportation Commission, there is nothing  about bus or van service improvements, but there is evidence there will be a  decrease in service in some part of Orange County.  </P> <P> OCTC's staff says "trust us" with the taxpayers' money. How come there is an  investigation by the Orange County Grand Jury on the OCTC's staff deliberately  overstated effectiveness of the car-pool lanes on the Costa Mesa Freeway?  </P> <P> I think the Orange County Grand Jury should do a study on the cost of  consolidation of the transportation agencies before the state Legislature votes  for or against the proposed merger.  </P> <P> GARY A.

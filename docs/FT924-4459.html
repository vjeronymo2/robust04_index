			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Observer: Wishful thinking The social clout of the board of directors of Pilkington, glass-makers to the world, is definitely not what it was. A peer and a knight are retiring from the board and being replaced by a couple of commoners. Admittedly, one of the new boys, Rover chairman George Simpson, was knighted for an hour and five minutes yesterday before the Stock Exchange news service noticed and knocked him back down to plain mister. However, with Simpson's increased responsibilities at BAe, and the possibility of his becoming the next president of the Society of Motor Manufacturers &amp; Traders, he might not have to wait too long for his gong - if he's into that sort of thing.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Boris Slavin: "One Must Not Look Down on the </F> People"]    [Text] These words, directed against the activity of  Gaydar and his government team, were uttered yesterday by Viktor  Chernomyrdin at an enlarged session of the Russian Cabinet of  Ministers. What did these words imply? Was he totally  dissociating himself from those reponsible for the "shock  therapy" or just gently criticizing them?    Although appearing radical, Chernomyrdin's speech only went  halfway. On the one hand, there was the apparent intention to  strengthen Russian statehood and create conditions for economic,  political, and social stability in society. On the other hand,  the premier does not see any grounds or any potential "for  radically changing the course" mapped out last August. But what  about the fact that the people voted against the former policy  of reforms, which led to impoverishment and the collapse of the  economy? There was no clear answer to this question in  Chernomyrdin's report.    The government head is trying to justify his moderately  tough  financial policy in 1993, although he is perfectly well aware  that the temporary slowing of the inflation rate was artificial  and was due not to production growth but to the delayed payment  of workers' and employees' wages, reduced credit opportunities  for enterprises, and artificial unemployment. January showed  that inflation is rising rather than falling.    Viktor Chernomyrdin, while criticizing the monetarists, is  nonetheless not seeking a solution via the proven models of  economic development in China., Japan, South Korea, and so on.  He is trying to find a happy medium between Gaydar's monetarist  experiments and the former party apparatchiks' administrative  methods of management. Hence the desire to combine  liberalization of prices and foreign trade with stronger state  power and the establishment of order and discipline.    Of course, the government's desire to orient the reforms  toward the people and eliminate the main sources of their  discontent can only be welcomed. But how is all this to be  done? That is the question. But the measures proposed by the  prime minister will not be welcomed by the critically minded  reader. It is still totally unclear why, for example,  agricultural subsidies, which are granted in all developed  countries, "will pose a threat to other sectors of the economy"  here, according to Chernomyrdin.    Similar contradictions are to be encountered throughout the  prime minister's report. For example, how can you reduce the  budget deficit and at the same time increase investments in  industry, combat mass unemployment, and close industrial  enterprises that have not performed from the monetarist  viewpoint? Of course, it is a good thing that war and labor  veterans' pensions are to be increased. But what about current  science and culture, education, and medicine? Judging by the  report, the government will not get round to them.    The premier gave assurances that there will be no economic  and social catastrophe this year, that stabilizaiton is in the  offing. We would like to believe it, but, unfortunately, the  report provided no substantial evidence of this. The one thing  the report did make clear was that our president is alive and  well and neither the former laboratory head nor the current  prime minister should aim to supplant him. You will agree that  this is not enough for the country's future, for general accord,  or for democracy.</p>

The projects are located on the Flambeau River. The projects are located in Rusk, Price, and Ashland Counties, Wisconsin. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FERC staff has determined that licensing these projects would constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the staff intends to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on the hydroelectric projects in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act. The staff's EIS will objectively consider both sites Specific and cumulative environmental effects of the projects and reasonable alternatives, and will include an economic, financial and engineering analysis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A draft EIS will be issued and circulated for review by all interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EIS will be analyzed by the staff and considered in a final EIS. The staff's conclusions and recommendations will then be presented for the consideration of the Commission in reaching its final licensing decisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scoping Meetings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FERC staff will conduct two scoping meetings. The evening scoping meeting is primarily for public input while the day-time meeting will focus on resource agency and non-governmental organization (NGO) concerns. All interested individuals, organizations, and agencies are invited to attend and assist the staff in identifying the scope of environmental issues that should be analyzed in the EIS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To help focus discussion, a preliminary scoping document outlining subject areas to be addressed at the meeting will be distributed by mail to interested parties on the FERC mailing list. Copies of the preliminary scoping document will also be available at the scoping meetings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The public scoping meeting which will be conducted by staff will be held at 7:00 p.m. on August 16, 1994, at the Park Falls Public Library, 410 Division Street, Park Falls, Wisconsin.

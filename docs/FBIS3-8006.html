"The ceasefire is going well all over Bosnia-Herzegovina  except for small arms fire which is basically insignificant,"  said Lieutenant Colonel Bill Aikman, spokesman for the UN  Protection Force (UNPROFOR).    Earlier, Bosnian Serb forces besieging Sarajevo fired four  mortars toward positions of the mainly Moslem Bosnian Army in  the southern part of the city and small arms fire could be heard  for about five minutes.    Aikman said UN military observers enforcing a ceasefire  agreement that went into effect last month were immediately  dispatched to the region to restore calm. "In Sarajevo, the  ceasefire is holding," Aikman said. "As you can see, the people  can walk and be comfortable."    Since February 20, the deadline set by NATO to launch air  strikes against the Serbs if they failed remove their heavy  weapons from around Sarajevo or place them under UN control, the  Sebs have surrendered 276 cannons and the Bosnian Army has  handed in 47, Aikman said.    Elsewhere in Bosnia Thursday, UN military observers reported  troop movement around the northern town of Brcko, which has come  under heavy shelling by the Serbs. Western military sources  said some 250 shells exploded Wednesday in the region of  Gradacac and Brcko, 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Tuzla,  while 190 shells rained down on a "confrontation line" about  five kilometers (three miles) east of Lukavac, near Tuzla.  Automatic gun fire and mortar fire was reported at the front  lines, the sources added.    "Tension increased with heavy shelling in the morning and in  the afternoon" of Wednesday, the sources said.    Further west in the town of Bihac, local Moslem troops  successfully thwarted an attempt by the Serbs to infiltrate the  town while the situation in Mostar, divided between Croat and  Moslem troops, was said to be "very calm" Thursday despite five  shells falling on the Moslem sector.    In central Bosnia, the ceasefire signed Friday by Bosnian  Croats and Moslems appeared to have been generally respected.    As for the northern town of Maglaj, which is besieged by the  Serbs, UN officials were unable to update the situation there  Thursday following reports that 4,000 shells had fallen on the  city and neighboring towns the previous day.    Kris Janowski, spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for  Refugees (UNHCR), said his agency was still waiting for the  Serbs to allow a relief convoy to reach the city.    Relief convoys to Maglaj, whose pre-war population of 16,000  was 45 percent Moslem, were suspended in October after two UNHCR  drivers were killed just outside a tunnel that leads to the city.</p>

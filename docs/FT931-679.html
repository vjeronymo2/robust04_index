			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Glaxo to withdraw claims for Zantac GLAXO Holdings, Europe's largest pharmaceutials company, has agreed to demands by the US Food and Drug Administration that it withdraws some promotional claims about its ulcer treatment drug Zantac. In January this year, the FDA said Glaxo 'frequently suggests unapproved uses for Zantac and consistently makes comparative efficacy and safety claims that are not supported by adequate data'. Glaxo stopped publishing the contested claims in advertising and promotional literature earlier this month, but objected to the FDA's claims and said it was unlikely to write to US doctors as the FDA had demanded. The company said it has agreed with the FDA on a letter to be sent to US doctors, correcting its standard literature. Discussions continue on how Glaxo's retractions should be published. Zantac is the world's best-selling medicine with annual sales of about Pounds 2bn, representing 45 per cent of Glaxo's turnover. Annual US sales are estimated by analysts at Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 980m). The company stressed yesterday its right to distribute the drug in the US had never been questioned. An analyst said: 'This makes it harder for Glaxo to differentiate Zantac from Tagamet. When there is a cheaper generic version of Tagamet on the market in the US next year it may be harder for Zantac to maintain market share.'</p>

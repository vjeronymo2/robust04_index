"Neither government planes nor SDF ships could be used for  the evacuation of Japanese nationals since the Self-Defense  Forces (SDF) Law has yet to undergo revision," said the  official, speaking on condition of anonymity. He noted that  there are an estimated 10,000 Japanese nationals now residing in  South Korea.    "If an unanticipated situation were to arise, private planes  and boats would all come to a halt and it will become difficult  to protect our nationals," the official said.    The official doubted that the United Nations Security  Council  will immediately slap economic sanctions on North Korea for  failing to allow unimpeded international inspections of its  controversial nuclear facilities.</p>

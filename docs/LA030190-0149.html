			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: TOBACCO INDUSTRY GOES TO THE DOGS  </P> <P> It's been a bad time for the tobacco industry. First, it leaked out that they  were developing a cigarette to appeal specifically to black people. When that  idea ricocheted, they began concentrating on a cigarette for the young,  blue-collar white woman. The cigarette, named Dakota, was being test-marketed  to see if it would appeal to ladies who didn't have a high school diploma.  </P> <P> This news did not receive the public reception the tobacco manufacturers had  hoped it would. As a matter of fact, Health and Human Services Secretary Dr.  Louis Sullivan assailed it. So the tobacco companies have now gone back to the  drawing board to try to find another group that might pick up some of the slack  in the smoking business.  </P> <P> A meeting was held in the offices of tobacco consultants Ploughwright and  Ploughwrong, who specialize in programs to further cigarette consumption in the  United States.  </P> <P> Ploughwright addressed a tobacco mogul named Ziggy Slick. "We think that we've  found the answer to the problem. We'll make a cigarette for pets. It's an  untapped market. Our surveys indicate that there are more than 200 million dogs  in American homes, and only a handful have ever known the joys of smoking."  </P> <P> Slick said, "How the hell do you get a dog to light a cigarette?"  </P> <P> Ploughwrong answered, "Who says the pet has to light it? It can just eat it.  You don't care what anyone does with a cigarette as long as it is consumed."  </P> <P> Ploughwright added: "We have given it a name that any dog will recognize. How  do you like Fetch? We also plan to add a stick on the package in the center of  the target. That way the dog will never mistake it for Lucky Strikes."  </P> <P> Slick was dumbfounded. "It's going to take more than a stick on a package to  get a dog to go for a cigarette."  </P> <P> "Right. That's why the product has to have a strong advertising campaign. We  have a TV commercial now that will blow your brains out. It shows a dog  bringing in a package of Fetch to his master. The master takes two out of the  pack and puts them in the dog's mouth -- and lights them. Then the master takes  one of the cigarettes out of the dog's mouth and puts it in his own mouth.  Everyone remembers that scene when Paul Henreid did it with Bette Davis."  </P> <P> Slick said, "Dogs don't watch TV commercials."  </P> <P> "Are you kidding?" yelled Ploughwright. "They're glued to the set all day long.  The latest Nielsen ratings show that more canines than people are looking at  network shows. We've got this whole thing worked out, Mr. Slick. We have to  move fast before the other tobacco companies decide to go after the pet market,  too."  </P> <P> Ziggy sounded unconvinced.  </P> <P> "Look, we got burned on the cigarette aimed at the black smoker, and we didn't  do too well with the proposal to appeal to dumb girls who are only looking for  a good time.  </P> <P> "What makes you think that we won't be criticized for promoting our product  using four-legged animals?"  </P> <P> "Because," countered Ploughwrong, "we're promoting free choice. We are not  suggesting that dogs have to consume tobacco. We're saying that it should be up  to the animals themselves -- not to some bureaucratic Humane Society official  who keeps telling them that cigarettes are dangerous to their health."  </P> <P> Slick said: "Haven't they been doing laboratory tests with pets that indicate  that after they smoked cigarettes, they got cancer?"  </P> <P> "The tests are inconclusive. Most of the dogs who became ill from smoking were  also hit when they chased motorcycles down the street without wearing their  helmets."  </P></p>

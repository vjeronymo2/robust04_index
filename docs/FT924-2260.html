			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Survey of Pulp and Paper (2): The green conundrum - The industry and the environment THE 'green' challenge facing the pulp and paper industry is not just creating demands for cleaner higher-quality products, but it is also beginning to disrupt many of the previously-accepted economic patterns in the industry. As a result of the more widespread use of waste papers throughout the developed world, the industry's centre of gravity is slowly shifting from the virgin forests of the Nordic countries and Canada towards the more highly populated 'urban forests' of central Europe and the US. There is a limit to this process, because the recycling loop can never be entirely closed; there will always be a need for the input of fresh virgin pulps to strengthen the fibre content of paper products. But the trend is clear and unmistakeable. According to a recent Financial Times Management Report, the amount of waste paper recovered and re-used to produce more paper rose from 60m tonnes in 1985 to almost 84m tonnes by 1990. It is forecast to climb to 150m tonnes by the end of the decade. Its growing utilisation has begun to change the entire economics of paper production in many countries, as manufacturers find it more cost-effective to build new plants near the centres of waste paper supply. The UK is a prime example. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the strength of the British paper industry was sapped by labour unrest, high production costs and the awkward pressures caused by its dependence on pulp imports bought directly from rival Scandinavian companies, which produced both raw pulp and finished paper products. But the indigenous UK manufacturing industry was largely 'saved' by switching to the use of cheap raw materials, in the form of newspapers collected from the UK's centres of population. The industry's utilisation rate (defined as the amount of waste paper re-used in production) now stands at 60 per cent - one of the highest in Europe - although its economics have recently been threatened, as a result of the falling European prices for waste paper caused by a glut of supply stemming from mandatory recycling schemes in Germany. The paper industry in Germany is now in the process of building four paper mills to soak up this excess supply, further emphasising the shift towards locating plants near their end markets. But in spite of the economic attractions, the simple environmental equation that all recycling is necessarily good has exasperated the industry. In many respects, the paper producers argue that this simple truism is not, in fact, true and that the energy and environmental costs of additional paper recycling do not add up in some circumstances. The industry suggests that paper is, anyway, an infinitely renewable and benign resource if properly managed. What is the difference between harvesting properly-cultivated trees and corn or wheat - other than a vast divergence in growing times, they ask? According to industry estimates, 94 per cent of the wood used by European paper and board producers comes from sustainable managed forests, with the other 6 per cent coming from North America and the countries of the former Soviet Union. For a long time, more trees have been planted in Europe than have been felled each year. However, despite the industry's best efforts, environmental campaigners still find much to protest about in forestry and paper manufacturing practices around the world. The environmental damage caused by 'clear-cut' fellings, when whole forests are harvested at one time, has alarmed many environmentalists, although the industry is trying to limit this practice and argues that the damage is only temporary. Campaigners also worry when conifer and eucalyptus forests are planted without due regard for their impact on local fauna and flora. Such unnatural forests can cause ecological 'mono-cultures', destroying the diversity of species that are normally found in varied forests. Environmentalists also highlight the level of effluents produced at some pulp and paper mills - although, again, the industry, prompted in many cases by government legislation, has gone far to clean up its act. Attention has also focused on the level of harmful dioxins created by chlorine-bleaching of pulp, a process which is used to brighten paper products. These toxic dioxins are caused by the chlorine reacting with the lignin in the wood. Although the level of dioxins in paper is minute (less than 8.2 parts per trillion) and there is scant evidence to suggest that people have been harmed by handling their products, the issue became something of a cause celebre in the late 1980s as a result of a rash of wild fears about dioxin poisoning from chlorine-bleached nappies. As a result of the public outcry, companies have generally stopped using chlorine-bleached paper for nappies, and are reducing its use elsewhere while investigating alternative bleaching agents. Many companies have made a virtue of this necessity by marketing their paper products as 'green', and some have even cheekily added a price premium for the supposed environmental benefit. The packaging of paper products has also become the subject of environmental and marketing scrutiny. Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the Franco-British paper group, for example, has reported sales successes of its carbonless papers in Germany, as a result of wrapping them in an innovative new packaging system made from layers of recycled paper. Such economic impulses, combined with the emotional connotations associated with the environment, will ensure that green issues remain at the forefront of the paper industry's concerns for the foreseeable future. Yet some fear that environmental initiatives can sometimes act as an impediment to trade, concealing protectionist impulses. The 'green card' may well be played to defend western European markets from 'dirty' exports from cheap manufacturers in eastern Europe, they suggest. It is clear that those companies that can, and do, ride the environmental tide will prosper; those that ignore it will surely suffer.</p>

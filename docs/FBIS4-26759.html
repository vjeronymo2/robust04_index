			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 25 (CNS) -- Rain has been scarce in  most parts of northern China since early June, and drought is  now growing more serious. The average rainfall in the northern  area of the Huaihe River is less than 10 millimetres.  Shangdong, Henan and Inner Mongolia have seen not a single drop  of rain since then.    According to the office of the Flood Prevention and Drought  Combat Headquarters, due to scarcity of rain and high  temperature, water contained in soil has evaporated fast. At  present, drought in Shangdong, the northern part of Huaibei,  most part of Huabei and Northeast spreads quickly. The size of  drought-hit area in northern China is estimated to be 230  million mu of land. Many rivers have dried up, water storage in  reservoirs has dwindled. This has seriously affected crops and  summer sowing. More than 12 million people and 12 million  domestic animals are short of drinking water. [paragraph as  published]    According to the Central Weather Broadcasting Centre, since  early June there has been consecutive days of high temperature  in most parts of Huabei, Northeast and Shangdong, the  temperature is two to three degrees centigrade higher on average  than in normal years. Temperatures in these areas are usually  around 30 degrees centigrade, and in certain areas the highest  reaching 37 degrees. This further worsens the situation of  drought. However, adequate heat is most helpful to the growth  of crops in areas where water is plenty. The hot weather is  also beneficial to the harvest of winter wheat.</p>

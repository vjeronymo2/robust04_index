			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Money Markets: Small cut in DM repo THERE WAS a constantly shifting mood in European cash and futures markets yesterday, with various indications about when rates might be cut in Germany, writes James Blitz. German markets had been very optimistic first thing in the morning that the Bundesbank would significantly ease the rate at which it offers wholesale funds to commercial banks. However, after announcing a variable rate tender for money market funds on Tuesday, the Bundesbank said yesterday that the lowest accepted repo rate for short-dated liquidity was 8.13 per cent, and that it was 8.15 per cent for 35-day funds. This was a rather smaller cut than the market had expected. Speculation had been that the repo rate would come down from 8.17 per cent to 8.10 per cent or even lower. The repo announcement firmed German call money. The overnight cost of lending D-Marks had fallen to 8.00 per cent at the start of the day, and was back up at 8.14 per cent by the close. The duller mood was also the result of a net drain of DM8.1bn from the money market in the two-tranche deal. However, dealers said the market was still adequately provided with liquidity. Euromark contracts fell back from their opening levels, with the June contract showing a drop of 10 basis points at one stage to a day's low of 92.78. However, the contract subsequently rallied to finish at 92.86, partly helped by a slight downward revision in the German consumer prices figure for March, from a month-on-month rise of 0.4 per cent to one of 0.3 per cent. This offset fears that German rates would only fall slowly because of inflationary pressures. Sterling markets were quiet. There had been rumours of an imminent cut in base rates at the start of the day, partly because the sterling exchange rate index touched the 80.00 per cent level for only the second time since January 25, the day before the previous easing in UK rates. However, the UK authorities have made clear their reluctance to ease policy for now. Three-month money finished unchanged at 5 7/8 per cent and the one-month rate closed at 5 3/4 per cent. There was little difficulty removing a shortage of Pounds 1.25bn forecast by the Bank of England at the start of the day.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The collective peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan  were established in accordance with a decision taken last  September by the heads of five CIS states. In October they  arrived in Tajikistan. By their very presence in various parts  of the Republic, and especially the first joint exercises they  held, they have cooled many hotheads who want to change the  constitutional order in the Republic by unlawful means and to  destabilize the situation. The crime rate has also improved  markedly.    Unfortunately not all states that signed the collective  security treaty have fulfilled their peacekeeping obligations.  The military contingent from Kazakhstan has not arrived in  Tajikistan at all. The Kyrgyz force has merely staked out its  presence. The mandate of the peacekeeping forces is about to  expire. So, what will happen next?    [Begin recording of Colonel General Boris Pyankov, commander  in chief of CIS Joint Armed Forces] The need for them to remain  here until at least the end of 1994 is obvious because,  unfortunately, there are potential forces, groupings, groups,  gangs, and formations, certain forces that are striving to  breach the peace here, to destabilize the entire situation.

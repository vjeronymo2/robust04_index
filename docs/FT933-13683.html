			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Markets: A chill year for MFI - The Bottom Line IF MFI can still be considered a barometer of the UK's economic climate, then the pointer still seems to be hovering around 'change'. Predicting the fortunes of the furniture retailer and manufacturer, moreover, has turned out to be a less exact science than forecasting the weather, as analysts who were looking for profits of Pounds 80m plus from MFI when it was floated last July have discovered. On Monday, MFI unveiled a 39 per cent fall in pro forma pre-tax profits, from Pounds 66.1m to Pounds 40.2m for the year to April 24 - only half some forecasts a year ago. Investors may have been left wondering if MFI still deserved its reputation as a strong recovery stock. The results were, however, in line with recent forecasts. Derek Hunt, MFI's chairman, warned at the half-year stage in February that sales had nosedived after Black Wednesday in September, and trading in the first half of its 10-week New Year sale, which usually accounts for a third of annual turnover, was down. MFI can do little about the state of the UK economy, but it did suffer unduly from the sales downturn. Sales fell further than than they might have done because MFI lost market share to competitors such as B &amp; Q, Texas and Magnet during the January sale by misjudging its pricing and advertising campaign. Moreover, the drop in sales had a disproportionate effect on margins because the items affected were mainly kitchens and bedrooms. MFI manufactures these itself, and so enjoys both a manufacturing and a selling margin on them. But the company is working hard to improve its performance this year, irrespective of economic recovery. After its experiences in January, it adjusted some prices - without, it says, sacrificing too much gross margin - and revamped its advertising to highlight not the massive percentage reductions it was making, but the actual prices customers would pay for goods. It is also refitting its stores, improving the display of beds and sofas, employing more specially-trained staff, and increasing the range of flatpack furniture. Some 56 of MFI's 175 stores have been refurbished, and have shown a 6 per cent average sales increase. More stores will be updated this year. MFI reduced overheads by 7.2 per cent last year. Analysts believe there is more to come. The staff has been reduced by 820, and pay frozen this year. The company has reduced occupancy costs in some of its larger stores by subletting surplus space - providing rental income likely to reach Pounds 8.5m this year - and by buying the freeholds. The company says the introduction of a computer system across the group will lead to further savings. But MFI has still to prove it can raise sales as effectively as it can cut costs. Analysts are fond of referring to MFI's very high operational gearing, which means even a small swing in the right direction would significantly boost the bottom line. A 1 per cent rise in sales for MFI, they say, adds about Pounds 3m to profits, and some are already talking of Pounds 60m profits this year, assuming further productivity improvements and a sales increase of about 4 per cent. But that means sales must continue to improve - Hunt said on Monday they were running about 3 per cent ahead of last year - and MFI must avoid last year's mistakes. Some observers believe MFI may reap less benefit than expected from any economic upturn, as its product offer is not as strong as it was a few years ago, and it faces growing competition not just from the likes of B &amp; Q, but from Ikea, the Swedish furniture superstore operator. On the other hand, MFI is a clearly focused business, with nothing to distract it from its furniture stores, and its management enjoys respect in the City and among other retailers. 'Derek Hunt is one of the best operators in the business,' said one rival retailer yesterday. 'If things aren't going right he knows how to respond very quickly.' Given the question marks, however, many analysts believe MFI's shares, at about 128p, are high enough, even if the economic barometer finally swings towards 'set fair'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jacques Isnard: "Paris Should Only Commit Its </F> Blue Helmets to `Clear and Achievable' UN Mandates"]    [Text] Francois Trucy, (UDF-RPR [French Democratic  Union-Rally for the Republic]) senator for Var and mayor of  Toulon, published a report on Tuesday, 15 March, which Edouard  Balladur had commissioned from him on France's participation in  UN peacekeeping operations. The senator advocates in particular  that France should henceforth only become involved in "clear and  achievable" mandates and that it should demand openness within  the organization, for instance, costs should be disclosed as  soon as the political decision is made.    In seven years, the number of soldiers, policemen, and  civilian administrators required in the field for UN  peacekeeping operations has gone from 10,935 men in 1987 to  85,000 in 1993. This is a real explosion of demand: No less  than 13 ongoing actions, in eight of which French blue helmets  are involved. The United Nations did not prepare for that, or  it did so in a totally inappropriate way. Is evidence needed?  The department which heads these peacekeeping operations from  New York now has a team of 80 officials. "There is a great deal  of work and very few people," Francois Trucy writes, reporting  the ironic remark of a French officer who said that "the United  Nations works at a glacial speed."    "Everything starts with and goes back to the secretary  general," Mr. Trucy remarked. However, "there is no provision  for any succession of command" if the secretary general were to  disappear. The military structures at his side are not  comparable with a general staff "capable of preparing, planning,  and conducting large operations." There is no real operations  room "following up" operations, as there is in modern armies or,  if there is one, the French senator was not allowed to see it.  "An aura of mystery still surrounds it," he writes. Butrus  Butrus-Ghali has only one military adviser.    Member states, which are asked to provide "standby"  battalions, in other words forces which can potentially be  included in a framework set at around 100,000 men, take a lot of  persuading because they do not want to "tie up in advance" units  which they might need for national missions. The only military  body "which appears as such in the UN Charter" is the general  staff committee --formed by the chiefs of staff of the permanent  members of the Security Council -- whose meetings "are a formal  ritual without substance" and whose agenda, once it does meet,  "is to ensure that it will meet again. And that is all."    "If we (the French) think that peacekeeping operations will  be one of the essential tasks of our armed forces in the next 10  years," Mr. Trucy notes, "it is essential that our best  elements, our best officers, our best diplomats should apply for  and obtain positions of responsibility within the United Nations  in proportion to our involvement." The senator thinks that "we  are still all too often just the water which turns the mill,"  with around 9,000 to 10,000 French blue helmets. It is  therefore appropriate to derive as much as possible from "the  military investment" by an increased presence "in the political,  diplomatic, economic," and administrative spheres. Otherwise,  France will risk itself for other countries. "It is important,"  Mr. Trucy thinks, "that so-called peacekeeping operations should  not be reduced to American operations legitimized by the United  Nations or UN operations authorized by the United States."  <H5>  Indulging in `Waste' </H5>   The crisis of confidence which some states are experiencing  with regard tothe United Nations is accompanied by a serious  financial crisis in that organization. Out of a total budget of  $6.2 billion in 1993, which includes annual administrative costs  (50,000 salaries to pay, instead of 1,000 in 1946) and the  financial requirements of peacekeeping operations, the United  Nations is short some $1.5 billion from member state fees, and  the United Nations itself has a repayment arrears of over $600  million toward states which have advanced it men and equipment.    For peacekeeping operations alone in 1993, France's share  was  1.6 billion francs [Fr], to which must be added a sum of Fr5.5  billion -- for the maintenance of its blue helmets -- paid for  by the Defense Ministry and partly or belatedly repaid by the  United Nations. "At the end of 1993," the senator writes,  "France had a Fr600-million claim on the United Nations."    Mr. Trucy talks of "unnecessary or excessive spending,  uncontrolled costs," and "badly monitored spending," or  "artificially inflated budgets," like the order for 850  minibuses for Cambodia "following a misunderstanding."    In certain circumstances, the United Nations forces a  country  to indulge in "waste." "For instance," the senator points out,  "at the end of its mission in Cambodia, the French contingent  destroyed its stock of munitions because repatriation would have  been too dangerous. Let us mention the case of the S-30  air-to-air missiles which, although not fired in the framework  of operation Deny Flight, have to be replaced after a few dozen  flying hours. This weapon, designed in the seventies, is  intended for air combat missions, and it is now being used in  the framework of overflight interdiction missions. The Air  Force has designed several solutions to counter these  inadequacies. The fact remains that these missiles have a unit  cost of several million francs and it is difficult not to make a  connection between this unforeseen use and the order for 110 new  missiles placed in 1994."    Mr. Trucy makes 100 proposals to the prime minister intended  "to increase the quality, stringency, and efficacy of our  relations with the United Nations." Around 15 of them are  worthy of note. They are all aimed at securing "clear and  achievable mandates" which require from the secretary general "a  prior geopolitical analysis, a more accurate estimate of the  cost, real military expertise, a timetable making provision in  particular for reevaluations of the mission, involvement of the  main contributors, and the agreement of the parties involved."  Mr. Trucy asks for a more rapid "creation of a planning group  tasked with preparing future peacekeeping operations," the  creation of a "budget control and austerity body," and for the  French parliament to be informed about any involvement of French  forces outside national borders, as is the case in the United  States.</p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Mediocre results of analysis Sir, 'Why the FT knows its school tables' read the headline of John Authers' article on school examination league tables on November 20. This being the FT, the headline suggests one should expect a sophisticated analysis. Some sophistication] As far as this school was concerned, the article was ignorant about our catchment area and assumed, amazingly, that the cohort from which our A-level candidates was drawn was the same as for GCSE. A telephone call to the LEA or to me would have indicated that this school serves a far wider catchment than 'the plum academic area in north Oxford' and that its 1993 A-level candidates included 25 per cent who joined us at 16+ from other schools. To compare our A-level results favourably with our GCSE ones and conclude that our GCSE results are 'distinctly mediocre' displays distinctly mediocre powers of analysis.

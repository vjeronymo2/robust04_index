			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. The denominator for recalculating the home-market credit expense in 1979/80 must be added to the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The ratio of inventory carrying costs to total U.S. sales for the 1980/81 POR should be multiplied by the landed cost, consistent with the other PORs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The Department failed to adjust Koyo's reported home-market unit price for post-sale freight expense in calculating FMV. However, Timken believes that no change is necessary because Koyo failed to report its freight expenses correctly (see Comment 20).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The Department should delete certain duplicate observations in the home-market database.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Timken maintains and Koyo confirms that Koyo reported direct and indirect selling expenses, G&amp;A expense, and interest expense as a percentage of COM, not fixed amounts per unit as interpreted by the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with Koyo and Timken and have made each of these changes in the calculations for these final results of review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 41:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Timken states that the Department inadvertently reversed signs in its preliminary program for Koyo by applying the 20-percent BIA rate for models with no reported home-market VCOM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with Timken and have corrected the program for these final results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 42:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Timken asserts that the Department must ensure that selling-expense adjustments to CV are consistent in all respects with price-based adjustments. Timken contends that not all of the expenses, originally reported as direct selling expenses, were ultimately considered direct by the Department ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> freight, discounts).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with Timken's assertion that deducting the expenses reported as ``direct'' selling expenses in Koyo's CV database was incorrect. For these final results we have not used this variable in our CV calculation because it represented commission and rebate expenses, both of which we did not treat as direct selling expenses for Koyo in these final results (see our responses to Comments 11 and 23, respectively). Therefore, the only valid direct deduction from CV is the weighted-average credit expense for home market sales from the sales database for each POR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 43:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Koyo maintains that the Department's constant practice in its TRB determinations has been to break ties between two equally similar matches by first comparing the sum of the deviations for the two models, then comparing the levels of trade for the two models, then comparing the cost deviations for the two models, and finally by ranking the two models alphanumerically. According to Koyo, the Department inadvertently omitted the level-of-trade (LOT) tie-breaker in conducting the model match for these PORs. Koyo notes that this is not the same issue regarding LOTs that Koyo has raised unsuccessfully in previous reviews_that the Department should not cross levels of trade in comparing identical models before looking for similar models at the same level of trade.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Timken agrees, stating that where two matches with equivalent ``sums of the deviations'' are found, each at a different LOT, the Department should select the match at the same level of trade.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Koyo's statement that we have consistently selected the best model match based on, in order, ``sum of the deviations,'' LOT, and cost differences in all of its recent TRB determinations, is correct in the context of our computer programs for some previous reviews of this finding and the 1987 order of Koyo's U.S. sales of TRBs. However, in those previously completed reviews, the Department's stated methodology was to rank similar merchandise by minimizing first the ``sum of the deviations'', second, the difference in the VCOM of the U.S. and similar home-market product, third, the differences in LOT, and lastly, alphanumerically. When the ``sum of the deviations'' was the same for two or more bearings, the Department ranked them according to the similarity in costs, and, if the costs were the same, according to the similarity in LOT ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> TRBs I,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 57 FR 4978 (February 11, 1992)). In our computer programs for these administrative reviews, we have followed this methodology, ranking similar bearings by ``sum of the deviations'', differences in cost, LOT, and, lastly, alphanumerically.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 44:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Koyo states that the load rating for some sales of one model was reported incorrectly on Koyo's submitted computer tape. Although the cup and cone of each model should have the same basic load rating as the assembled model, in this instance a computer input error on Koyo's part resulted in an inconsistency in reporting the load rating of the cup, cone, and set. Koyo requests that the Department correct this error for these final results and cites  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> AFBs III  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> as precedent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Timken contends that the Department should make the requested correction only if the error is discernible based on the evidence of record at the time the error was identified. Timken notes that the documents cited by Koyo that contain corroborating evidence were all submitted in administrative reviews for periods other than 1979/86.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

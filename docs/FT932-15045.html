			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / International Company News: Dasa hit by cuts in military spending X:DEUTSCHE Aerospace, the aircraft and space technology division of Daimler-Benz, suffered a 17 per cent drop in new orders last year as civil and military spending cuts took effect. The company, which lost a net DM341m (Dollars 216m) on sales of DM17.3bn in 1992, was still on course to return to profit by 1995, Mr Jurgen Schrempp, chairman, said yesterday. However, planning would be eased and potential capacity problems could be avoided if the Bonn government made clear decisions now on its future strategy. Further cancellations of public contracts threatened the whole defence industry, he warned. Total new orders fell to DM12.5bn last year from DM15bn. Defence contracts fell more than expected to DM2.4bn from DM2.7bn. The company, which made a net profit of DM50m in 1991, would have been in the black last year had it not been obliged to take extraordinary charges for personnel and strategic measures, the company said. Only two of its six divisions - space systems and aircraft, which includes Deutsche Airbus - made an operating profit last year. Defence and civil systems alone lost DM264m. Dasa, a core business within Daimler-Benz, which recently forecast a further fall in group earnings of up to 30 per cent this year, expects sales for the year to be little changed from last year's DM17.3bn. It has been hard hit by the combination of recession and the slump in defence markets since the ending of the cold war, and first warned several months ago that it faced the most difficult two years in its history. Meanwhile, the management has pressed ahead with plans to develop its interests in civil aircraft.</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Reed Elsevier restructure will reduce audit fees Reed Elsevier, the international publishing group, plans to reduce its audit fees by nearly two-fifths as a result of a restructuring of its operations which has led to the appointment of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu as worldwide auditors. It also aims to reduce the number of legal entities registered in the UK by three-quarters as part of the process in an effort to reduce the number and costs of statutory audits. The fees of Reed, Elsevier and Reed Elsevier, their joint venture, are expected to fall from about Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 1.3m as a result of an audit tender for which all the largest six accountancy firms competed. Mr Nigel Stapleton, a director of Reed International, said: 'We did not make the decision on who came with the lowest fee, although price was obviously an important consideration.' He said the reduction reflected the elimination of duplication from having two firms of auditors as a result of the merger, as well as improvements to internal audit and changes in the structure of the company. He stressed that the audit tender prices from all the firms were very close to each other. 'We want a challenging audit, not the firm that will give us the easiest audit,' he said. The process began in June last year, and by October three firms remained for detailed selection: Touche, Price Waterhouse, current auditor to Reed, and Coopers, auditor to Elsevier until now.</p>

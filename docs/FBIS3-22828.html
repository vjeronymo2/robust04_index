Western intelligence services have, over the past three months,  monitored the movements of Iranians carrying suitcases and  wearing lightweight shoes in the Czech capital. The visitors  turned out to be the men running Iran's nuclear program. Notable  among these are Seyyed 'Ata ollah Mohajerani, who works on the  nuclear cell attached to President Hashemi-Rafsanjani. At the  same time as the giant Skoda company's factories on the  outskirts of Prague were being sold to the private sector,  Iranians rushed to buy shares, particularly in the company's  nuclear operations. To that end, they set up a network of  agents, a majority of whom became active in the "Iraqi lobby' in  the communist era. The mullahs are in the market for technology  for their nuclear sites. What are the secrets of the nuclear  network operating between Prague and Tehran?    From early September to mid-January, Western intelligence  services were struck by the unusual movement of Iranian  delegations in Prague and an increase in the staff of the  Iranian Embassy there. American, Arab, and European monitors  were convinced that the Iranians arriving in the Czech capital  were pursuing contacts and nuclear and arms deals. Such was  their conviction that an Arab military attache sent a report to  his superiors saying "the Czech Republic is on its way to  becoming a main conduit for advanced western technology to Iran,  specifically in the fields of military electronics and nuclear  knowhow."    Hence, the successive visits to Prague over the past three  months by Iranian officials responsible for their country's  nuclear program. The last such visit to be noted was the one  led by Haj 'Azimi, deputy head of the Atomic Energy Authority,  assisted by an "adviser" living outside Iran, who has been well  versed with Iran's nuclear program since the days of the shah.  'Azimi was once in charge of the Iranian Energy Corporation.  It was he who signed the first agreement with the West German  firm Kraft Werkers Union - K.W.U -- [preceding acronym in Latin  letters] to build two reactors -- one in Bushehr, 60 km from the  port, the second, 1,200 megawatt strong, in Ahvaz. After that  nuclear mission, a delegation representing "Iranian military  industries" came to Prague seeking a radar monitoring system of  the "Tamara" type, one of the most efficient and sophisticated  of its kind in the world, intended for detecting airborne  objects flying at an altitude as high as 250-300 km. According  to Czech sources, Tamara can spot airborne objects that other  traditional radar systems find hard to detect and track down.  They cite such targets as the small-size cruise missiles that  fly at an altitude almost so low as to touch the ground, the  Stealth fighters developed by Washington to blind radar systems,  including the "F-117" used extensively against Iraq during the  Gulf war, and the new strategic B-3" bombers, introduced into  the U.S. Air Force recently.    In the second week of January, 1994, what was dubbed by  surveillance services "the largest Iranian nuclear delegation to  visit the Czech capital" arrived in Prague. It comprised Amer  Ollahi, the official in charge of the Nuclear Power Authority in  Iran, Mehdi Shemran, a nuclear physicist from the Californian  Berkley University, who is also a prominent official of the  "Vavak" agency, who, in late 1991, negotiated the purchase of  three nuclear warheads with Kazakhstan authorities in Alma-Ata.  The extraordinary delegation also comprised Seyyed 'Ata ollah  Mohajerani, President Hashemi-Rafsanjani's adviser for nuclear  affairs. They sought to put the finishing touches on a deal of  nuclear components and technoloy, the draft of which had been  negotiated by Mansur Haj 'Azimi and an adviser living in a  European capital under the guise of an opponent to the mullahs  regime. Various sources repored that the Iranians were  interested in completing the Bushehr reactor, on which work was  begun by the Munich-based Kraft Werkers Union firm, which is a  subsidiary of the giant Siemens company. Mohajerani asked the  "Skoda Energy" firm to go through with the project at the  projected cost of billions of dollars.    This Czech firm is known to be part of the "Skoda Concern",  and is now undergoing privatization. Tehran may have offered to  become a shareholder in the company, as the final profile of the  distribution of its equity is yet to take shape. However, the  biggest three potential shareholders are the German Siemens, the  French Framathone and the American Westinghouse, in addition to  the company's director general Dr. "Souskek", a prominent  ex-communist in Prague. It is now established that Mohajerani  sought 30 percent of the "Skoda Energy" shares in a barter deal  involving oil shipments of up to half a million barrels every  three months. The Iranians also showed an interest in purchasing  equity in a number of Czech arms manufacturing firms. According  to reliable information, a deal to buy [baqdami] iron fell  through. The Czechs insisted on being paid in a basket of hard  currencies. The two sides agreed that the Iranians visit Prague  again in mid- February, on the eve of the announcement of Iran's  budget for the new Iranian year beginning 21 March, which  earmarks several billions of dollars to nuclear facilities and  their six secret locations. Most likely the delegation will be  made up of Mohajerani, Mansur Haj 'Azimi, and advisers.    Sources contacted by AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI are unanimous that  the Czech Government, in order to avoid dealing directly with  the nuclear mullahs, has authorized the director general of  "Skoda Energy" to do the talking with the Iranians and work out  an agreement with them, with the assistance of Vratislav  Lopovoski, the man responsible for the commercial section at the  Radiation Company [al-sharikah al-mushi'ah], who is well known  to Iranian politicians. Also joining the talks overtly or  covertly are establishments specialized in the manufacture of  nuclear components, including the "P.B.S" and the "CKD" which  were taken over weeks ago by the French "Elstom" company through  its "Sougilik" branch specializing in the supply of electric  power to reactors and the reactors' security and safety. Also  taking part in the negotiations is the "ZVU" firm, formerly the  "Skoda Moravia" which manufactures military equipment used in  the production of chemical and germ weapons. Another firm  joining the effort is the "Centizia" which produces the "Semtex"  explosive.    The Americans and Europeans are alarmed at the prospect of  Iran acquiring equity in these factories that are being  auctioned off. They note that, over a 30-year period, these  factories turned out weapons of the highest caliber for the  Soviet bloc. Influential members of Iran's National Security  Council -- the highest military decisionmaking body in the land  -- believe that these Czech factories, which Prague finds itself  unable to operate for lack of hard currencies, fit the  requirements of Iran's nuclear and armament program. It is  interesting that Iran has spread a network of agents, spies, and  informers in Prague. The Iranians are said to have recruited  dynamic members of the "Iraqi lobby" that were active in the  Czech capital during the eighties. That lobby, made up of local  and foreign agents and politicians and military personnel, went  into a state of "hibernation" after 1990. With the invasion of  Kuwait, members of that lobby became jobless. They formerly  served in the K.G.B. and its arms and all of a sudden found they  had no role to play. Faced with the Iranian "bait", they  offered their services to Iran's nuclear program. If the  behind-the-scenes negotiations produce a happy ending, as seems  likely, given an Iranian preparedness to meet all the financial  conditions, Iran will shortly take delivery of two reactors of  1,200 megawatt capacity each for the Bushehr location. Thus, as  the major shareholders in "Skoda", German firms will, through  the back door of Prague, have a stake in the Iranian nuclear  program.    A Western diplomatic report of limited circulation has  indicated that Iran recently received special equipment for the  935-megawatt Darkhovin reactor. A Czech firm that works as a  front for a major European establishment delivered the equipment  to Iran. So far the goods are still in their boxes. The only  obstacle hampering the unpacking is the European technicians,  who were scheduled to have arrived at the Darkhovin site, have  been slow in arriving due to bargains being conducted in back  channels. Israel stepped onto the scene, further complicating  the issue because of the difficult conditions entailed. It has  been reported that the Iranians are seeking the laser technology  required for the enrichment of uranium so that more thorough  research can be conducted at Tehran University. This plan is  part of a program to establish a nuclear technology base that  would subsequently facilitate the acquisition of nuclear  capability. Some Western surveillance sources expect that 1995  will be the year that Iran will manufacture its own nuclear  bomb. The Carnegie Foundation has revealed that Tehran has made  tangible advances in its quest to acquire various kinds of  nuclear technology equipment and extract fuel from uranium.  Sayrafi is an Iranian nuclear scientist who has, for several  years, been working at an atomic laboratory in a certain  European capital. Before that, he worked at the Iranian Nuclear  Energy Organization for a long time during the shah's rule. He  has indicated that Tehran invested some 5.5 billion German  marks, an amount equal to $3.73 billion, in the Bushehr project  started by the K.W.U. firm, an affiliate of the German Siemens  Company, in 1975.    In his last visit to Tehran, Heinrick von Perrere, the  Siemens director, told the Islamic Republic News Agency that the  Bushehr story is regrettable. It embarrassed the Siemens  workers, as well as the Iranians, he added. He went on to say  that this story should not be an obstacle to future trade deals.    That is why the Iranians created the Czech back channel to  circumvent U.S. bans and other regulations the Westerners  spelled out in Bonn in May, 1993. These bans and regulations  prohibited sensitive technology supplies from being transferred  to Iran. However, not everyone's interests are served by  compliance with these bans, especially when the mullas express a  readiness to foot their bills in cash and on time.    Those well versed in the mullas' quest to obtain nuclear  technology have cited authorizations to spend limitlessly on  efforts to obtain nuclear technology by the highest echelon of  power in Tehran, regardless of the crisis pertaining to oil  revenues. These authorizations coincided with the first test  firing of a long-range 1,100 km missile that is capable of  carrying a nuclear warhead in the desert of Tabas. Chinese and  DPRK experts attended the test firing of the missile.</p>

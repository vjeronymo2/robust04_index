			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Companies House sell-off plan studied THE GOVERNMENT is expected soon to move further towards privatisation of Companies House, the government's corporate information agency. The management consultancy SRU, which was hired by the government last autumn, has submitted a report on the agency's future to the Department of Trade and Industry. The report spells out a range of options for the agency, with emphasis given to privatisation. Other possibilities include further contracting-out of services. The department is expected to make a statement which will call for consultants to examine further the options for Companies House, and to consider the practical difficulties of privatisation. Problems to be considered include how many agencies would be permitted to collect company information and how information would be stored. Some company agents in the private sector fear that Companies House might exploit a monopoly position over access to corporate data. It is believed that a wide-ranging bill would need to be approved by parliament to permit privatisation of the agency. The bill would need to spell out the responsibilities of any company that took over the agency's functions. Consultants are also likely to be asked to consider options for lessening the requirements for filing information with Companies House. These could include removing the requirement for filing annual returns, or for listing other directorships held by each member of a company's board.</p>

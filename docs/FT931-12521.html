			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Satellite threat to ITV is dismissed ITV HAS little to fear from satellite television in terms of advertising, audience or programmes, a senior ITV executive said yesterday. Mr Craig Pearman, managing director of MAS, the advertising sales house that represents Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, told a London conference on satellite television that satellite sales had not risen spectacularly last year. According to Continental Research there was an average increase of 50,000 dishes a month last year. Two other research groups, BARB and GfK, suggested figures of little more than 40,000 a month. Forecasts at the beginning of last year had suggested a growth during the year of more than 90,000 dishes a month. 'Whichever estimate is taken, the annual sales are still at least  1/2 m less than the prediction,' Mr Pearman said. The share of viewing for satellite channels in satellite homes had fallen significantly from 37 per cent in November 1991 to 32 per cent in November 1992. Satellite's move to subscription would limit the audience for satellite television. As a result, Mr Pearman said, although ITV would lose some share of viewing the fall would be slow and not very large.</p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: Hewlett-Packard links with Japanese company HEWLETT-Packard (HP), the US electronics and computer group, and Oki Electric Industry, the Japanese manufacturer of communications equipment, have signed a broad 'master' agreement to co-operate long-term in development and marketing telecommunications systems, Reuter reports from Tokyo. They have not yet worked out details but will co-operate in licensing and joint development of technology as well as customer services and marketing, the companies said. 'We will sign many individual agreements under the umbrella of the master agreement,' said Mr Masao Nogami, an Oki vice-president. HP's strengths in Unix-based computer systems would complement Oki's in systems integration, said Mr Willem Roelandts, a HP vice-president. Mr Nogami declined to estimate the likely size of the business that would result from the agreement. HP and Oki have since 1990 worked together on printed circuit boards, and since 1991 on semiconductors and private telephone exchanges. Hewlett-Packard said Hughes Aircraft, a unit of GM Hughes Electronics, will buy up to Dollars 100m-worth of HP's PA-Risc-based workstations and servers, Reuter reports from Palo Alto. HP will supply up to 4,300 HP Apollo 9000 Series 700 systems to Hughes Data Systems over the next four years. Hughes will make the systems more rugged for installation in US Navy ships, submarines and land-based facilities under a defence contract.</p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Arts: Dustin Hoffman versus Our Lady of the Lingerie - Cinema ACCIDENTAL HERO (15) Stephen Frears BODY OF EVIDENCE (18) Uli Edel Dustin Hoffman in Accidental Hero plays a petty crook seized by a sudden surge of selfless bravery. One rainy night he rescues 54 people from a burning plane. There he is, juddering through outer Chicago in his noisy-wipered car, when the steel monster falls from the sky. Soon the passenger plane is lying across the road, its fuselage steaming, its drooping snout caricaturing Dustin's own. With a sigh our hero climbs from his car, doffs his Dollars 100 shoes, sloshes through the rain, does his bravest, then vanishes into the night. This movie has everything. Comedy, drama, air crash, lovable superstar, script by David (Unforgiven) Peoples, and the wonderful Geena Davis as a survivor-newsreporter who sleuths after the 'accidental hero.' Yet we keep thinking, 'When is it going to start?' Rhythm is the most elusive of movie qualities and it is missing-presumed-fled for most of Accidental Hero. Just when the story has begun to make sweet music with its contrapuntal portraits of Hoffman, the gutter-bred crook trading in secondhand patter and stolen credit cards, and Davis, the high-flying journo seeking a 'human interest' scoop, a third character ruinously interlopes. This is Andy Garcia, underscripted and underplayed as a sweetnatured hobo who claims a newspaper's Dollars 1m reward by claiming he was the phantom rescuer. (He has come into a vital piece of evidence). And just when we think the story is dancing brightly, caustically to the themes of press-and-media folly and the paradoxes of heroism, in come disruptive stretches of andante (Garcia romancing Davis) or adagios of soggy folk wisdom exchanged between Hoffman and his young son. British director Stephen Frears usually goes straight for the vernacular of human behaviour. His best films - My Beautiful Laundrette, The Hit, Dangerous Liaisons - present human beings demotically, sardonically, as chattering egos and appetites on legs. But a large-budget Hollywood project brings its own baggage of populist bet-hedging. Accidental Hero's cluttered plot and style testify not just to the three names in the 'original story' credit (Laura Ziskin and Alvin Sargent as well as Peoples) but to a desire to provide Something For Everyone. Schmaltz with the cynicism; romance with the misanthropy; young pretender (Garcia) with ageing superstar. The result is less a healthy balance of ingredients than a recipe for frustration. By final reel the movie has become mercilessly multi-directional. Newshound Davis shuttles between her two hero suspects; Hoffman shimmies between anonymity and limelight; minor characters yell for their last two cents' worth of screen time (Chevy Chase's newspaper editor, Joan Cusack as ex-Mrs Dustin). And let us throw in a final suspense vignette with Hoffman and Garcia teetering on the high ledge of a skyscraper. It is at once too much and too little. As so often in cinema, 'something for everyone' means not enough for anyone. The week's only other release is Body Of Evidence: a large, squishy, self-important object masquerading as a movie. The star is Madonna, whose screen career continues to take two steps backward for every one step forward (Dick Tracy, A League Of Their Own). Here Our Lady of the Lingerie is accused of using her body to murder a rich old man who died in the throes of sexual ecstasy. True or not, she is soon doing much the same to defence counsel Willem Dafoe. He has no defence against a woman whose love techniques range from dripping hot wax on his genitals to coupling on a car bonnet strewn with glass from a smashed lightbulb. (We are in the courthouse's public car park at night). Occasionally bits of plot break into the sex scenes, with the awkward diffidence of a butler asking if Moddom and the gentleman would like some tea. Joe Mantegna, Anne Archer and other worthies stand about the courtroom doing the where-were-you-on-the-night-of routines. Then it is back to the handcuffs, hot wax and car bonnets. If Mr Dafoe were a Chevrolet he would be in mint condition by the end of this film. In a thin movie week - no, let us call it skeletal - you can always read about films rather than seeing them. My spring bookshelf is buckling under the new movie tomes: not least those representing that major modern trend, the 'So-And-So on Himself' monograph. Best of these are Malle On Malle (Faber, Pounds 14.99) and Levinson On Levinson (Faber, Pounds 8.99). Both are short on preamble and long on substance. In the first, editor-interviewer Philip French gives us a brisk prefatorial trip through Malle's early life - born into the Beghin sugar dynasty, educated by Jesuits (see Au Revoir Les Enfants), baptised as a film-maker in Cousteau's deep-sea documentaries - and then plays Plato to Malle's Socrates as we movie into film publishing's answer to a Platonic dialogue. Malle's talk is as good as his films, alive with supple details and sudden revelations. On the difference between cinema verite and cinema direct; on the Vuillard paintings he looked at as inspiration for Pretty Baby; on the knack for finding the right unknown actor for a lead role (Pierre Blaise in Lacombe Lucien); on the challenge of making an all-talk film 'cinematic' (My Dinner With Andre). His versatility of style and range of interests as a film-maker have made Malle outlast the New Wavers he grew up alongside (Godard, Chabrol, Rivette) and next to whose dry avant-gardism he seems a maverick humanist. Barry Levinson's articulacy is more plainspun. This gifted social fabulist specialises in the underside of the American Dream: the lives of the dispossessed (Diner, Rain Man) or dispossessing (Bugsy). As a talker, his style can be as tousled and rambling as his characters'. (Editor David Thompson might have used a bit more scissorwork). But there are witty tales and revealing insights: especially about the constant war in film-making between perfect blueprint and brute reality. For Memory Lane movie buffs, what better than Aljean Harmetz's Round Up The Usual Suspects (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, Pounds 15.99)?. Celebrating fifty years of Casablanca, the author rounds up some usual and unusual stories about the making of everyone's favourite Hollywood potboiler. You will read about a casting near-miss for Ronald Reagan, about just what Humphrey Bogart did say to Dooley Wilson at the piano (after Wilson came in as casting replacement for Ella Fitzgerald), about Paul Henreid and the 'white suit controversy', and about whether anyone knew what the film's ending would be before the day came to shoot it. As for why the film has become a perennial, Harmetz lays out the choices: from those seeing a gay subtext in Rick/Bogart's friendship with Renault/Claude Rains to others claiming an allegory about President Roosevelt hesitating to commit America to the Second World War. Far-fetched? Ah, but Harmetz reminds us that 'Casablanca' is Spanish for 'White House.' Casablanca goes unmentioned in Christopher Palmer's The Composer In Hollywood (Marion Boyars, Pounds 19.95): no doubt on the grounds that Max Steiner had to score the film around someone else's tune. But if 'As Time Goes By' robbed him of royalties, Steiner's Gone With The Wind theme made up. Who can ever see a poster or still picture from that film without mentally hearing those soaring strings? These and other harmonic brainstorms are the subject of Palmer's book. Despite the odd solecism - The Snake Pit was hardly 'the first picture set in a lunatic asylum' ( The Cabinet Of Dr Caligari pre-dates it by 30 years)  -this is a plain man's guide written without plainness. Read Palmer waxing eloquent on Miklos Rosza's Ben-Hur score, on Bernard Herrmann's screeching Psycho strings or on Franz Waxman's weaving of styles in the moody and marvellous Sunset Boulevard score. 'The theme is set in the Phrygian mode  .Hispanic overtones ..motoric rhythms ..nonchalantly syncopated.' Who says that scholarship and showbiz cannot live in productive harmony?</p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / International Company News: Primerica lifts earnings to Dollars 153.9m RECORD earnings from its Smith Barney securities broking subsidiary helped Primerica, the US financial services group, yesterday report a 45 per cent increase in first-quarter operating profits to Dollars 153.9m. Total income for the period, however, was Dollars 220.8m, because the group reaped Dollars 66.9m in net gains from the sale of stock in Inter-Regional Financial, Musicland and Margaretten, the group's former mortgage banking subsidiary sold in a public offering in January. Smith Barney was again the star performer in the Primerica stable, riding another buoyant quarter for Wall Street and domestic stock markets to record profits of Dollars 56.1m, almost double the Dollars 29.3m the broking house earned a year earlier. Revenues were up from all of Smith Barney's main business lines, a reflection of strong market participation by individual as well as institutional investors, extremely high levels of new issue offerings and a solid increase in assets under management. Only principal trading, where revenues rose just 5 per cent, failed to match the record pace set by the rest of the company. Primerica Financial Services, the insurance and mutual funds unit, reported earnings of Dollars 46.1m, a slight improvement on a year ago. Although sales of new life insurance were down on the first quarter of 1991 at Dollars 11.1bn (compared with Dollars 14.3bn), they were about even with the levels report-ed in the previous two quarters. Earnings from the consumer services businesses rose 10 per cent to Dollars 44.7m, despite lower levels of consumer borrowing and the continued unfavourable economic climate. Primerica credited the improvement to high credit standards and tight control of expenses.</p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Securities dealer is jailed for fraud AN AUTHORISED securities dealer who misused clients' funds to prop his business was jailed yesterday for 2 1/2 years and disqualified from acting as a company director for five years. Sentencing Mr Andrew Kimmins at Southwark Crown Court in London, Judge Anwyl-Davies said: 'It is vital that the public should know that those who provide financial services are of unquestioned integrity.' He told Mr Kimmins: 'Your pride would not allow you to acknowledge the failure for which you were responsible, which drove you to dishonesty with disastrous results for your clients.' The judge said the loss to clients had been Pounds 3.5m and a further Pounds 500,000 had been lost by Mr Kimmins's family and associates. He accepted that Mr Kimmins's dishonesty had not been directed towards his own enrichment. Mr Kimmins had pleaded guilty to two charges of fraudulent trading. They alleged that between November 1986 and December 1988 he was knowingly party to the carrying on of the businesses of Blade Securities and Blade Investments, both of Brompton Road, London, with intent to defraud creditors. Twenty-three other charges were left on the court file. The judge said Mr Kimmins had signally failed to exercise proper control of the Blade group, of which he was the chairman, managing director and majority shareholder. Through his lack of control, inexperience, bad judgment of people and unjustified optimism, he had incurred appreciable Stock Exchange losses and very substantial personal debts. In mid-1987 Blade Corporation and Blade Securities had been insolvent, the judge said, but Mr Kimmins had continued to trade, using clients' money to pay trading debts. From the end of 1987 there had been no real commercial prospect of money being available to meet the companies' obligations but Mr Kimmins had continued to imperil clients' interests by carrying on trading. In 1988, when authorisation had been needed, he had formed Blade Investments but had given the Securities Association misleading information about the debts of Blade Corporation and Blade Securities. Mr Kimmins's serious breaches of trust, business practice and procedure had been aggravated by his failure to heed the lessons of the past and the warnings of accountants, the judge said. His efforts to remedy the wrongs for his clients had been 'a forlorn venture'.</p>

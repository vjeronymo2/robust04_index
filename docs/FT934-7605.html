			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Hosokawa achieves go-ahead for political reforms JAPAN'S Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa yesterday scored a political victory by winning parliamentary clearance for the first political reforms since the second world war. The lower house of parliament gave a bigger-than-expected 270-226 majority to four government bills to change Japan's discredited multi-seat constituency system to a mixture of single-seat constituencies and proportional representation. Donations to political parties will be strictly controlled, in an attempt to halt the financial scandals which have swept Japanese politics over the past few years, and corrupt politicians will be barred from office. The bills now pass to the government-controlled upper house for final agreement, expected by the end of the year. Yesterday's vote exposed further splits in Japan's two largest parties, which used to be the post-war political establishment - the opposition Liberal Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party, the biggest partner in the seven-party coalition. Thirteen mainly young LDP members defied party instructions and voted for the bills. Six more abstained, including former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, leader of one of the two LDP governments to fall because of failure to enact political reform, and former Deputy Prime Minister Masaharu Gotoda. Five Socialist dissidents ignored instructions to support the government and voted against the bills, on the ground their party will do badly under proportional representation. The Socialist split could widen as the bills pass through the upper house, where the Socialists have a greater number of rebels. The lower house vote was a remarkable departure from the political tradition of reaching consensus on important laws in backroom negotiations. Attempts at compromise between the ruling seven-party coalition and the government collapsed on Tuesday, despite compromises offered by Mr Hosokawa, obliging him to resort to a parliamentary showdown. Once the bills have gone through the upper house, an independent panel will draw up new electoral districts for future elections. The timing of the next general election is up to Mr Hosokawa, but most political analysts expect it to come in the second half of next year. Mr Hosokawa's victory augurs well for his meeting with US President Bill Clinton, a keen advocate of political reform, in Seattle this afternoon. The Japanese leader is also expected to use the meeting to confirm plans to cut income tax, due to be tabled by a government panel today. This step could relieve American pressure on Japan to stimulate domestic demand for imports, a way of curbing Japan's politically irksome trade surplus.</p>

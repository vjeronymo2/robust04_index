			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / UK Company News: CU up to Pounds 181m Commercial Union, largest of the UK's composite insurers, reported pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 66m to Pounds 181m in the first half of this year. The interim dividend is raised from 9.75p to 10.25p, payable from earnings of 26.3p (24.9p) per share. Mr John Carter, chief executive, said that general insurance operations continued to benefit from improved conditions in a number of main markets. The performance was particularly influenced by the return to profitability in the UK, where premium rates have been increased and claims fallen. Underwriting profits in the UK amounted to Pounds 26m (Pounds 57m losses), with profits in domestic and commercial property and motor business offsetting losses in the London commercial and reinsurance market. The group's operating ratio in the UK - which measures claims, commissions and expenses as a percentage of premiums - amounted to 97 per cent (105 per cent). Overall worldwide underwriting losses fell to Pounds 75m (Pounds 165m), despite high severe weather and catastrophe claims in North America, particularly in the first quarter. Underwriting losses in the Netherlands - CU's largest European operation outside the UK - fell to from Fl 39m to Fl 30m (Pounds 11m). In France, where the group is set to expand significantly following yesterday's completed acquisition of Groupe Victoire, underwriting losses narrowed to Pounds 11m (Pounds 16m), but the operating ratio - at 138 per cent (151 per cent) - remains high. Worldwide premium income from non-life insurance rose to Pounds 2.16bn (Pounds 2.11bn), compensating for a small fall in life insurance income to Pounds 923m (Pounds 927m). Investment income net of loan interest amounted to Pounds 179m (Pounds 169m). Income from non-insurance activities was Pounds 8m and earnings from associates Pounds 5m (Pounds 4m). Shareholders' funds amounted to Pounds 2.03bn at the end of June, compared with Pounds 2.53bn at the start of 1994. Investment values have since increased and shareholders' funds as at August 4 were estimated at Pounds 2.23bn.</p>

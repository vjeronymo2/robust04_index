			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (6): Witty about wealth - Quotations / Paul Taylor enjoys some cynical gems The Bedside Executive Edited by James Charlton Robert Hale, Pounds 7.99 120 pages A book of more than 600 quotations from business mavericks, politicians, economists, writers and leaders of industry sounds like rather heavy going. But even a quick peek inside the covers of The Bedside Executive is sufficient to dispel such concerns. This pocket-sized volume, edited by James Charlton, is packed with wise, witty and cynical gems - mostly from North America - on topics ranging from wealth acquisition to achieving success and doing deals. As Mr Charlton notes in his preface, the financial and business worlds are a particularly rich field for quotes. But while many of the wittiest come from acknowledged humorists such as Oscar Wilde or Will Rogers, others have been penned by unlikely wordsmiths including Henry Ford and J. Paul Getty. Inevitably profits, money and sound business practices loom large as a theme. Lee Iacocca, Chrysler's former chairman, once said: 'Volume times zero isn't too healthy,' and Warren Buffet, the legendary US takeover specialist, set out his business rules thus: 'Rule number 1: Never lose money. Rule number 2: Never forget rule number 1'. PT Barnum, the man who brought the circus to town, observed that: 'Money is a terrible master, but an excellent servant,' while actor Will Rogers advised people to 'invest in inflation. It is the only thing going up.' Comfort for those with large overdrafts comes from the Edwardian wit, Saki (Hector Hugh Munro), who noted: 'I'm living so far beyond my income that we might be said to be living apart.' Underscoring the American domination of pithy business quotes, Getty chipped in with the classic: 'If you can count your money, you don't have a billion dollars,' and Nelson Bunker Hunt is credited with saying: 'People who know how much they are worth aren't usually worth that much.' Among the observations on particular business careers are the following: Banking. 'Banking may be a career from which no man really recovers,' said economist John Kenneth Galbraith, while Mark Twain complained: 'A banker is a fellow who lends you his umbrella when the sun is shining and wants it back the minute it begins to rain.' Corporate finance. 'In the takeover business, if you want a friend, you buy a dog,' according to Carl Icahn, the Wall Street financier. Media. 'Advertising is 85 per cent confusion and 15 per cent commission,' said American comedian Fred Allen. Stockbroking. 'Buy when everyone is selling. And hold until everyone is buying,' advised J. Paul Getty, while stockbroker Raymond De Voe adapted an old axiom: 'Fools rush in where angels fear to trade.' Economists. 'An economist is a man who states the obvious in terms of the incomprehensible,' said publisher Alfred A. Knopf while George Bernard Shaw quipped: 'If all economists were laid end to end, they'd never reach a conclusion.' Herbert Hoover pleaded: 'Please find me a one-armed economist so we will not always hear, 'On the other hand . . .' ' On the state of the economy, another US President, Harry S. Truman, said: 'It's a recession when your neighbour loses his job; its a depression when you lose yours.' Among the relatively sparse quotes from women, tennis star Martina Navratilova observed that: 'Whoever said, 'it's not whether you win or lose that counts,' probably lost,' while Margaret Thatcher chipped in with: 'If you want anything said, ask a man. If you want anything done, ask a woman.' Some quotations sum up their creators better than any biographical narrative. For example Robert Maxwell, the disgraced tycoon, said: 'When I see a belt, I cannot resist hitting below it.' Others seem strangely prophetic such as Richard Nixon who said: 'A man is not finished when he is defeated. He is finished when he quits.' This is a book to dip into rather than attempt to read cover-to-cover. It is not, nor does it pretend to be, an encyclopaedic work, although it provides plenty of ideas for the after-dinner speaker. Instead, as the editor notes, 'the real test of a book of quotations like this is enjoyment, and to that end I hope this satisfies'. It does.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Jakarta (KOMPAS)--Indonesia is prepared to extend  temporarily its position as chairman of the Nonaligned Movement  (NAM) if Latin America cannot decide which country is to be the  NAM chairman for the 1995-98 term. Indonesia has been the NAM  chairman since September 1992, and its three-year term will end  in September 1995.    Thursday night, 10 February, at the Foreign Affairs  Department at Pejambon, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas disclosed to  reporters the results of the NAM Foreign Ministers Consultative  Meeting, held at Pejambon on 9-10 February. The matter of the  new NAM chairman is still completely uncertain, since  Nicaragua--the only official candidate--has yet to decide its  willingness to be the host of the 1995 NAM Summit Conference.    According to Alatas, Indonesia's willingness is a flexible  position because it understands the difficulty that Latin  America and the Caribbean are having in determining who will be  the NAM chairman for the 1995-98 term. Nicaragua so far has not  withdrawn its candidacy for hosting the NAM Summit Conference in  September 1995.    Besides Nicaragua, according to reports circulating in  Jakarta and New York, Chile and Colombia are also interested in  being the new NAM chairman. The decision as to who will be the  new NAM chairman may be known before the NAM minister-level  meeting in Cairo (Egypt) this June.    Alatas reemphasized, however, that Indonesia feels the NAM  chairmanship should rotate. "It is not good for one country to  be chairman again. It would be much better for other countries  to be given the opportunity. In that way, we can apply a  three-year rotation," he said.    Alatas also stressed that Indonesia's willingness to extend  temporarily its term of office would not be an extension of  mandate. In fact, Indonesia does not expect that the selection  of a new NAM chairman will be delayed until the meeting of NAM  ministers in New York around September or October 1994.  <H5>  Received by President </H5>   According to Alatas, President Suharto hoped that the NAM  Foreign Ministers Consultative Meeting would produce input,  views, suggestions, and proposals for implementation by the  minister-level conference in Cairo. Alatas said this after  accompanying heads of delegations to a reception with President  Suharto at Freedom Palace.    The president explained a number of resolutions and  decisions  from the 10th NAM Summit Conference, particularly those related  to management of population and foreign debts. He also touched  on NAM political issues.    Alatas said that although the meeting was informal, the  president hoped it would produce suggestions for the Cairo  meeting, especially about ways to increase NAM cooperation with  the Group of 77 and improve South-South and North-South  cooperation.    Specifically, the president hoped South-South cooperation  can  be conducted comprehensively in all areas of development in the  respective countries.    According to Alatas, the president believes Third World  countries actually can develop projects at low cost and for  collective benefit if they mobilize all Third World resources,  capabilities, and experience. "That is the next step we must  take," he said.    The president feels that new NAM approaches to restimulate a  North-South dialogue that is no longer based on a  confrontational attitude--but on an attitude of cooperation,  partnership, collective responsibility, and mutual  dependence--appear to be accepted and increasingly evident, all  of which are embodied in the word "partnership."    President Suharto explained to the delegations that steps to  expand the North-South dialogue were begun at the G-7 [Group of  Seven] summit conference in Tokyo in 1993. On that occasion, the  president explained NAM positions and aspirations to the leaders  of the seven industrialized countries belonging to the G-7  (Canada, the United States, Britain, Italy, France, Germany, and  Japan).    The president emphasized that South-South cooperation  includes helping the poorest countries and those that are  trapped by debt problems. "In performing its duty as NAM  chairman, however, Indonesia does not want to get any benefit or  'butt in,'" Alatas said. Indonesia will be involved in efforts  to find solutions. "We will fight for other countries,  especially the 50 countries burdened with debt and the 18  low-income countries in Africa and Asia," he asserted.  <H5>  On Bosnia </H5>   The president also took the occasion to touch on political  matters like Bosnia-Herzegovina, especially with regard to the  Bosnian request for support made to Indonesia and the NAM when  Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic visited Jakarta. The plan  for an international conference on Bosnia was also mentioned.    The president explained that the issue of holding an  international conference is to be discussed immediately by the  NAM Coordination Bureau in New York and that efforts are now  being made to obtain acceptance and approval from the United  Nations and the world community.    In reply to a question about sending volunteers to Bosnia,  Alatas said that sending troops to Bosnia is not the way to a  solution. He said he understands the frustration and irritation  felt by people all over the world with regard to resolving the  Bosnian war. "Do not let that irritation be manifested in calls  to send troops to Bosnia, for that would not solve the problem  but would expand the war instead," he said.    He said the steps that must be persisted in are approaches  to  the United Nations and the former Yugoslav states, urging them  to take serious responsibility, implement UN decisions, and stop  aggression. In addition, the slaughter should be stopped, by  using UN military force if necessary.    "Thus, the way is not through an expanded war, in which each  country would take part in warfare, but we must uphold  international law and support the actions of the UN Security  Council," he emphasized.    In reply to a question about a candidate for host of the  11th  Summit Conference and chairman of the NAM for the 1993-98 [as  published] term, Alatas said the next candidate is Nicaragua.  However, Nicaragua has yet to state its willingness and is still  considering the matter while discussing it with other countries  in Latin America. It is hoped that the issue will be resolved  quickly.    Touching on the failure to hold a G-15 [Group of 15] summit  conference in India last year, the minister said the postponed  summit conference will be held in New Delhi, India, this March.  "We hope that this time there will be no problem in obtaining a  quorum," he said. There can be no representatives at the summit  conference, and at least 9 or 10 chiefs of member states must be  present.</p>

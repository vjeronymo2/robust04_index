			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOHN STILL LOVES THE GAME, BUT HIS FAMILY COMES FIRST  </P> <P> In his first full season away from professional baseball, Tommy John has become  a self-described full-time father and husband. This spring he and his wife,  Sally, managed a New Jersey Little League team that sons Travis and Tommy  played for.  </P> <P> John has also made motivational speeches to corporate groups and served as a  sports consultant to a New York City hotel. However, he would like to return to  major league baseball in some capacity.  </P> <P> "The Dodgers have approached me on a couple of minor league assignments, but I  have to put my family first," said John, who pitched for six teams, including  the Dodgers and the Angels during a 26-year major league career.  </P> <P> "I'm looking into doing television baseball work, but only 30 to 40 games a  season, so I would have a chance to talk about the game I love and know a lot  about, and yet still have a family life. That's more important than anything."  STEVEN HERBERT  </P></p>

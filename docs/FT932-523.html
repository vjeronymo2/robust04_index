			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Boeing challenges Airbus with improved 737 models BOEING, the world's biggest manufacturer of commercial jets, yesterday decided to offer a new family of 737 twin-engine airliners to challenge the European Airbus consortium's range of twin-engine aircraft. Although the 737 has been the world's best-selling jet with more than 3,000 aircraft ordered to date and more than 2,500 delivered, Boeing has faced increasing competition in this market from the Airbus A320 and its bigger A321 derivative. The decision was taken in Seattle by the Boeing board, which said it would offer three sizes of improved 737 aircraft, including a 105-seater, a 130-seater and a 150-seater. Boeing said that a formal launch of the development programme would hinge on the company's winning sufficient initial orders. It said it had started working with more than 30 airlines in 1991 on an improved 737 family. Airbus has made inroads in the narrow-body market by launching new, technically more advanced airliners. Last year, it struck a significant blow against Boeing by winning a Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) order for 50 A320 jets from United Airlines, a traditional Boeing customer. Airbus also raised the competitive stakes this month at the Paris Air Show when it launched the development programme for the A319, a smaller, 125-seat variant of the A320. The original 737 programme was launched in 1965. The new 737 derivative will involve a bigger wing, improved powerplant and advanced systems to provide more range, speed and payload to compete against the improvements introduced by the Airbus 150-180-seat narrow-body jets. The bigger engines will be developed by the CFM partnership between General Electric of the US and Snecma of France. Boeing had considered developing an entirely new aircraft rather than a 737 derivative. It rejected that option on the grounds of market timing and of the much higher development costs. Developing a completely new narrow-body aircraft would cost an estimated Dollars 3bn-Dollars 4bn, while the cost of an improved derivative is put at about Dollars 1.5bn. Boeing had been under increasing pressure to offer airline customers improved versions of the 737 in the second half of the decade to coincide with the expected recovery in the world aircraft market. Boeing said last night that the first aircraft would be delivered in 1997.</p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Recovery seen in consumer credit Consumer credit recovered from its April fall to show a 1 per cent increase in May, but lending to business remained sluggish, according to figures released today by the Finance and Leasing Association. Total consumer credit in May was Pounds 1.357bn, up from Pounds 1.339bn in April, but below March's Pounds 1.463bn, before the tax increases came into effect.

Personal loans, up 21 per cent on the previous month, were mainly responsible for the increase in May's consumer credit total. Secured loans rose 5 per cent on the month to Pounds 22m. The amount lent on store cards fell 5 per cent between April and May, to Pounds 364m. There was a slight fall in motor finance to consumers, with lending on new cars falling 4 per cent between April and May and that on used cars by 1 per cent. Mr David Hardisty, association chairman, said: 'After the slowdown in April, May's figures are back to the kind of increases we were seeing at the end of 1993. Consumers appear to have taken the tax rises in their stride, but we will need to watch for longer-term trends.' Lending to business has been much more subdued than lending to consumers. Business credit fell 3 per cent between April and May and, at Pounds 973m, May's total was 2 per cent lower than in the same month last year. The association said it was the lack of 'big ticket' activity that was depressing lending to business. Mr Hardisty added: 'We are beginning to see small and medium-sized businesses investing in plant and machinery, but the larger deals are yet to materialise.'</p>

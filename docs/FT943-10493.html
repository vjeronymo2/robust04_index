			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / International Company News: Rodamco in two Spanish property deals Rodamco, the international property arm of Robeco Group, the Dutch pension fund, has acquired two of Spain's largest shopping centres in a Pta12bn (Dollars 92m) deal, writes Tom Burns in Madrid. The Dutch group bought Parque Sur, a 110 sq metre complex in Madrid, and Bahia Sur, a 57 sq metre retail area outside Cadiz. The price could rise to Pta15bn if post-purchase financial criteria are met. The centres were launched by Parques Urbanos, a domestic developer that collapsed last year, and were owned by Banco Exterior, part of the Argentaria banking group. Spain's biggest shopping centre, La Vaguada in north Madrid, valued at close to Pta12bn, is poised to change hands under the terms of a pre-contract signed between its owners, Compagnie Financiere de Suez, and Arc Union-Unibail, the French investment group.</p>

			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KINGS DON'T LOOK GREAT WITHOUT GRETZKY;  </P> <P> HOCKEY: STAR PLAYER TO BE SENT HOME WITH STRAINED GROIN, BUT THE INJURY IS NOT  CONSIDERED SERIOUS. FLYERS PULL AWAY IN THIRD PERIOD FOR 7-4 VICTORY.  </P> <P> The Kings were hit with the four words they've always dreaded but never before  heard Sunday: Injury to Wayne Gretzky.  </P> <P> For the first time since he joined the team nearly two years ago, Gretzky was  unable to play, sidelined for Sunday's 7-4 loss to the Philadelphia Flyers by a  strain in the groin area.  </P> <P> Although the injury is believed to be neither serious nor long-term, Gretzky  was due to leave the team and fly home today for further examination.  </P> <P> So he'll miss at least one more game, the finale to a five-game trip Tuesday  night in Minnesota.  </P> <P> "If this had been a playoff game, he would have played," said King Coach Tom  Webster. "He would have wanted to play. Let's put it at that. I'm sending him  home because I don't want to take a chance."  </P> <P> Gretzky first felt the strain skating on mushy ice in Buffalo Wednesday. He  aggravated it further Saturday in Boston.  </P> <P> By the time he had arrived in Philadelphia Saturday night, he was limping. When  Gretzky failed to respond to treatment Sunday morning, the decision was made to  scratch the man many consider the greatest to ever play from the lineup.  </P> <P> It might be cheaper for the Kings to set up a shuttle service to Los Angeles.  Defenseman Tom Laidlaw was sent home earlier Sunday with a hip flexor. And  teammate Keith Crowder was due to join him today, due to a knee injury.  </P> <P> Even some of those staying aren't in great shape. Center Mike Allison is down  with food poisoning after eating bad shellfish in Boston. Defenseman Steve  Duchesne took a puck in the Adam's apple Sunday, losing his voice, but no  playing time. And right wing Bob Kudelski was knocked out of Sunday's game in  the second period with a broken nose.  </P> <P> "Hell," said Webster, "I'm going home, too."  </P> <P> Just kidding, but Webster isn't too amused about seeing one of the Kings'  brightest trips of the year take such a dark turn.  </P> <P> After winning their fourth in a row Saturday, third on this trip, to clinch a  playoff spot, the Kings, those still able to skate, were unable to maintain the  recent momentum against the Flyers Sunday and sank to 32-35-6.  </P> <P> "We had the opportunity, "to prove we have a well-rounded team," Marty McSorley  said. "Wayne certainly makes us good, but we believed the other 19 guys could  have won this game."  </P> <P> The Kings were in it until the third period, keeping the sellout Spectrum crowd  of 17,423 in their seats despite the absence of Gretzky.  </P> <P> King goals by McSorley (13th), Mike Krushelnyski (15th) and Steve Kasper (17th)  were balanced by the Flyers, who got two goals from Ron Sutter (20th and 21st)  and one from Murray Baron (second), leaving the score tied 3-3 heading into the  final 20 minutes.  </P> <P> It didn't stay that way long.  </P> <P> Philadelphia scored three goals in a little over four minutes to put the game  out of reach, Keith Acton (his ninth), Murray Craven (23rd) and Craig Berube  (fourth) doing the honors.  </P> <P> John Tonelli banged in his 31st goal to bring the Kings a little closer, before  Rick Tocchet closed out the evening's scoring with his 35th.  </P> <P> The Kings will get over the loss. There will be other games.  </P> <P> There biggest concern was Sunday's other loss, because there's only one  Gretzky.  </P> <P> King Notes  </P> <P> Wayne Gretzky has failed to appear in two games since joining the Kings, both  last year, neither because of injury. He missed one because of his  grandmother's funeral and the last game of the regular season because it was  meaningless and the Kings wanted him rested for the playoffs. . . . The medical  report wasn't totally bleak. Larry Robinson returned after missing six games  and 12 pounds due to food poisoning. . . . With so many bodies missing, the  Kings recalled left wing Craig Duncanson from their New Haven farm club. In 46  games with New Haven, Duncanson had 17 goals and 25 assists. . . . Sidelined  Flyers include goalie Ron Hextall (pulled groin), defenseman Mark Howe  (herniated disk), both out indefinitely. Defenseman Kerry Huffman is day to day  with a bruised right knee. . . . Strip tickets for all four rounds of the  playoffs go on sale today at the Forum. Individual tickets for the first two  rounds will be available Tuesday. Priority numbers will be distributed at 9  a.m.. Limit is six tickets per person per game.  </P></p>

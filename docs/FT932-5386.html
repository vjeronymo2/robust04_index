			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Dublin to press tax amnesty bill THE Irish government is to press ahead with a controversial tax amnesty bill, which will permit tax evaders to repatriate funds held abroad or in non-resident accounts in Ireland, by paying only a 15 per cent levy in settlement of any outstanding, but as-yet undeclared tax liabilities prior to April 1991. The proposal has encountered intense criticism from opposition parties and trade unions as well as discomfort among the cabinet and on the coalition backbenches for being too lenient. Self-employed and non-PAYE higher rate taxpayers who will be the main benficiaries of the amnesty, will effectively pay less than a third of the original tax liability occurring on previously undeclared income. The government, however, believes that as much as IPounds 2bn (Pounds 1.9bn) could be repatriated to Ireland by the measure, further improving liquidity and lowering interest rates, and giving a much-needed boost to economic activity and employment prospects. Senior officials in the Revenue Commissioners and the Finance Ministry are believed to have advised against the proposal, concerned that the amnesty, the second on income tax in five years, will encourage future non-compliance. The previous amnesty netted IPounds 500m. Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister said in the Dail (parliament) this week that the amnesty will be balanced with a similar amnesty for those working but claiming social welfare, and by harsh penalties including imprisonment, for future tax offenders. Legislation to effect the proposal will be presented to the Dail within two weeks, according to the Finance Ministry, and is expected to be on the statute books before the summer recess. In another development, the government's taxation policy has been sharply criticised by the Central Bank, which in its annual report published yesterday said that 'a significant part' of the rise in Irish unemployment in the 1980s 'was due to factors within the control of the authorities'. Most important of these was 'the worsening of the tax wedge - the difference between the gross cost of labour to the employer and the employee's take-home pay'. The Bank says that there is a need for tax reform 'to stimulate the demand for labour and to improve work incentives'. The report also predicts that Irish gross national product will grow by 2 per cent in 1993.</p>

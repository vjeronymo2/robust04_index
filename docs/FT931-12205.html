			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Party leaders accused over EC TORY and Labour backbenchers opposed to the Maastricht treaty attacked their party leaders last night and accused them of acting in concert to give the European Community more power at the expense of the British parliament, Ivor Owen writes. Mr Richard Shepherd, Tory MP for Aldridge Brownhills, scornfully referred to the 'Con-Lab' front bench and protested that the leaders of the two main parties had 'thrown out of the window any regard for the power of the voter'. He was strongly supported by Mr Ken Livingstone, Labour MP for Brent East, who said the Labour leadership had spent so much time suppressing democracy within its party for the last 10 years that it did not find the treaty objectionable. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, gave repeated assurances that nothing in the treaty, or the European Communities (Amendment) Bill authorising consequential changes in UK law, would affect the government's right to determine immigration policy. An unimpressed Mr Teddy Taylor, Tory MP for Southend East and a leading critic of the bill, forecast that the home secretary's assurances would prove just as ineffective as those given by members of the Thatcher government during the passage of the single European act in 1986.</p>

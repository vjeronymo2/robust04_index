According to a joint statement by the city  and the police headquarters on Friday, Mayor Gerhard Widder  imposed the prohibition in the interest of public security on  account of the experiences with actions of Kurdish groups.  Nevertheless, the city and the police expect Kurdish actions in  Mannheim during the weekend.    According to the city, a Kurd gave notice of a demonstration  and a mourning procession to commemorate the two Turkish women  who set themselves on fire last Monday in order to protest  against the situation of the Kurds in Turkey and who died of  their injuries. The man who filed the notification had expected  10,000 to 20,000 demonstrators.</p>

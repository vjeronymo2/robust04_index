			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Telspec set for London market listing TELSPEC, a fast-growing manufacturer of sophisticated electronic telecommunications equipment, plans to come to market next month through a placing and intermediaries offer likely to value the company at more than Pounds 40m. The group, founded in 1975 by Mr Frank Hackett-Jones, an Australian electronics engineer with broad international experience, manufactures equipment which helps telephone operators improve the efficiency of their networks and reduces the cost of installing or expanding local telephone services. Mr Hackett-Jones, Telspec's chairman, is expected to sell about 35 per cent of his personal stake in the group as part of the flotation, which he said was designed principally to lift the group's profile and provide it with 'a sound financial base for future development'. However, the flotation will also be used to raise new funds for the company. Mr Garth Riley, Telspec's chief executive, said the new funds will be used to expand Telspec's overseas marketing operations. 'It is a growing industry and there are lots of opportunities,' he said. The group, which spends about 10 per cent of its turnover on research and development, has manufacturing operations in Rochester, Kent and near Melbourne in Australia and employs about 240 people. It is also considering setting up joint-venture manufacturing operations in south-east Asia to address emerging markets including China. The group has grown rapidly in recent years, buoyed by the wave of telecommunications privatisations and market liberalisations. In the year to December 31 the group posted pre-tax profits of about Pounds 3.4m on turnover of Pounds 18m. Its main customers include BT, Telecom Australia, Cable &amp; Wireless and Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, and it supplies a rapidly growing segment of the telecommunications market in Europe and elsewhere. In the developed world many PTT monopolies have recently invested heavily in converting their main 'trunk' networks to digital technology in preparation for new competition. However, telecommunications network operators are reluctant to invest in the 'local loop' - the part of the network which connects local subscribers to the telephone exchange - because of the long payback time. For example, BT estimates that the existing local loop is used about 4 minutes each day and that it costs Pounds 1,500 to connect one new subscriber. Most of Telspec's products are aimed at improving the capacity or usage of existing local telephone lines, traditionally based on a 'twisted pair' of copper cables or, in the case of new installations, reducing the cost. The group's products include 'pair gain' equipment, which enables more than one call to be carried on a single line; 'line concentrators', which allow a large group of subscribers to share a small group of telephone lines; and line amplifiers and extenders, which enable calls to be carried over longer distances. Credit Lyonnais Laing, financial advisers for the issue, are expected to issue Telspec's pathfinder prospectus later this month with dealings set to begin in early December.</p>

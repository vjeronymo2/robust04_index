			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1994 - Financial Control Systems (12): Familiarity wins affection - Spreadsheet usage Although BBC Frontline's use of the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet came about as part of a complete software suite, financial controller Tim Sutton has no regrets. 'Its universality means there is no need to train new staff, and it's possible to move data between applications on a common platform,' he says. The 140-strong publishing arm of the BBC upgraded from individual PCs to a network, and now has several users of Lotus. Mr Sutton's knowledge of spreadsheets means he is critical, but still appreciative - 'Excel may be better at simplification of processes. Lotus may be more long-winded in some respects, but people know it.' Another user, Roger Smith at McVities, the cake and biscuit manufacturer, agreed on all counts, including the observation that it can sometimes be a barrier to moving to other spreadsheets. A Lotus user-site since the dawn of the 1-2-3 spreadsheet in the early 1980s, McVities now has 300 users all over Europe - 'everyone knows and uses it, so there is easy interchange of data, and because it is so widespread, new staff know it,' he says. Lotus 1-2-3 Lotus 1-2-3, release 4.01 for Windows, was launched in Sept 1993. Lotus 1-2-3 presents data in a spreadsheet form for quick and easy analysis. Latest figures give Lotus 43 per cent of the Windows spreadsheet market. Number of users: 20m worldwide. Supplier: Lotus Development Corp, founded 1982 in Boston, US: Lotus UK was founded in 1983.

User views: 'Well-known, used and familiar: no training for new staff; support can be poor, unless extra premium paid, moving of models between packages can be clumsy, heavy memory usage, can be slow under Windows.'

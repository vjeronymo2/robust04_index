			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: New contracts help Capita rise 33% Capita Group, which provides services to the public sector, increased pre-tax profits by 33 per cent to Pounds 2.71m in the six months to June 30 and said prospects were encouraging. Group turnover rose by 38 per cent to Pounds 30.5m, thanks mainly to new contracts in the outsourcing division, which provides revenue-collection and computer services to local government. Outsourcing revenues increased by 77 per cent to Pounds 21.1m and operating profits almost doubled Pounds 1.51m. Capita said the division's five-year projected revenue stood at Pounds 118m at the half-year, up from Pounds 109m last time. Mr Rod Aldridge, chairman, said the group had taken a strategic decision to strengthen its sales activities in the central government and utilities markets to complement its core local authority work. He said: 'This should provide a balance of revenue. Inevitably, there is a temporary reduction in activity in the local government market as local authorities implement the local government review.' Operating profits from the advisory division rose by 43 per cent to Pounds 600,000, even though sales fell 5 per cent to Pounds 4.4m. Capita said the drop in turnover was mainly because of increasing competition in the provision of short-term managers to the public sector. Profits from the property services division fell by 14 per cent to Pounds 600,000, although sales were 8 per cent higher at Pounds 5m. Capita said that to provide additional support to its revenue management operations it paid Pounds 1.05m in April for John Crilley &amp; Son, one of the country's leading collection or bailiff agencies. Since the half-year, the group had acquired Sims Holdings, a supplier of computer systems and support services to the education market, for an initial Pounds 6m. Mr Paul Pindar, managing director, said Sims provided Capita with an important position in the growing education sector, a market which accounted for 9 per cent of gross public expenditure. Earnings per share increased 33 per cent to 3.8p (2.86p). The interim dividend rose by 29 per cent to 1.1p (0.85p), and the group said it expected to pay a total dividend for the year of 3.3p, a 29 per cent increase.</p>

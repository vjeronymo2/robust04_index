			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: GAELIC NEW AGE: CONVINCING INTERFACE;  </P> <P> ALASDAIR FRASER AND PAUL MACHLIS "THE ROAD NORTH." SONA GAIA *** 1/2  </P> <P> Gaelic New Age music? Hmmm, an interesting idea. Fraser and Machlis have  composed and adapted some traditional-sounding Irish themes into a very  untraditional format. Fraser's fiddle playing, rich in ornamental twists and  turns, is juxtaposed against the strikingly contemporary settings created by  Machlis' piano and synthesizer.  </P> <P> The results, even in pieces like the sprightly "Cowboy Jig," are fascinating --  a convincing interface between old and new. At its best -- "Bovaglie's Plaid"  is a stirring example -- the blend of synthesizer and fiddle will bring  passionate tears to the hearts of the most hidebound traditionalists.

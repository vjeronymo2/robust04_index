			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Buying a spray to cut the mustard - Why Reckitt &amp; Colman is selling its famous brand What kind of company - and chief executive - can sell not one but both its birthrights within six months? Reckitt &amp; Colman is the company, Mr Vernon Sankey the chief executive and Reckitt's Blue and Colman's Mustard are the birthrights with roots going back 180 years. No products could be more synonymous with their maker. Turning its back on clothes whiteners and English mustard, it aims to become 'one of the leading household products groups in the world' selling the likes of air freshners, lavatory cleaners and disinfectants. To that end it agreed to pay Dollars 1.55bn (Pounds 980m) this week for L&amp;F Household, a US maker of such mundane products, and put Colman's up for sale to help pay for it. The news came out of the blue for Norwich, the East Anglian town which has been home to Colman's since Jeremiah Colman started milling mustard near there in 1814. Five generations later, the company is chaired by Sir Michael Colman, the last employee from the family. 'There is a great deal of surprise and shock,' one citizen said. 'People have found it difficult to come to terms with the sale and what might happen to the 750 jobs here.' Because Colman's is a bigger business than Blue and so closely identified with Norwich, the psychological impact was far greater than Hull suffered in March. The Humberside city where Isaac Reckitt built his enterprise from 1840 was then told that the business had been sold to Holliday Chemical. The Colman's sale was also harder for the company. 'Emotionally it was very, very difficult,' Mr Sankey says, leaping up from a chair in his London office and rushing over to the largest picture on the wall. 'That was my office. That was my car,' he points out on an aerial photograph of the Norwich operation. He began his Reckitt career there, aged 22, in 1971 and returned in 1985 to become managing director. ''How could you sell Colman's? We lived there', my two oldest children said to me this week. But within a few minutes they understood the strategy perfectly,' Mr Sankey says. Apparently a highly persuasive communicator, he had also convinced Sir Michael of the merits. Colman's would be better off with a food company rather than a seller of household products, the chairman said earlier in the week. It was all part of the company's evolution, Mr Sankey says. Reckitt merged with Colman in 1938 although they had been pooling their overseas activities from 1913. The group continued to function in largely separate parts until 1970. Then, working to a blueprint from McKinzey, the management consultants, it adopted a typical multinational's structure. More importantly, the first historic roots were torn up: the headquarters were moved from Hull to the west London home of Chiswick Products - of Cherry Blossom shoe polish and Mansion floor polish fame  - which joined the group in 1954. The polish factory is long gone, its art deco office redeveloped into a coolly modern block in the 1980s and the northern hemisphere chunk of the shoe polish business sold in 1991. Diversification gripped the group in the mid-1970s as it picked up makers of beer kits in the UK and needlework kits in the US, wine makers in Australia and jewellery makers in New Zealand to compensate for slow growth in its core markets. By 1980, however, Reckitt had decided it could grow the original businesses if it focused on them. Divestments followed rapidly. Three big acquisitions in the past 10 years - Airwick, Boyle-Midway and L&amp;F for some Dollars 3.5bn - have pushed household products, toiletries and over-the-counter drugs to the fore and food to the rear. What was Mr Sankey's role in all this as a corporate strategist in the 1970s, a line manager in the UK, the Continent and the US in the 1980s and chief executive since January 1992? 'I just happen to be the person at the front. Focusing on me would not help in terms of the culture we're trying to develop to engage the hearts and minds of the people in the company.' Team work is the ethos, today's equivalent of the paternalistic concern of the Victorian Reckitts and Colmans. Everybody goes through 'personal development reviews'. 'We give mutual help on technical and personal shortcomings,' Mr Sankey says. Does he go through the process? 'Too right] Too right],' he says. According to his colleagues he is trying to curb his inclination to chip in his thoughts first and to make excessive demands on people. On the plus side he is the modern team leader: hugely energetic, very encouraging, quick to learn and analyse. As yet, the City knows little of this side of Mr Sankey and Reckitt. It likes the strategy but thinks the company is conservative and faces a stiff management challenge to meet its global ambitions. The company's shares fell sharply on news of the L&amp;F acquisition.</p>

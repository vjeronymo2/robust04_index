			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISHING NOTES;  </P> <P> EARLY SPAWNING SAND BASS EASY PREY FOR ANGLERS  </P> <P> Migrating sand bass continue to invade the sandy beaches to spawn.  </P> <P> Unlike the migrating albacore that showed up in May and then disappeared, the  sand bass -- although a month ahead of their normal schedule to spawn -- can be  expected to remain for the summer.  </P> <P> With the early run of sand bass, all local sportfishing landings are scheduling  sundown trips, as the bass bite is excellent at that time.  </P> <P> Anglers are reminded that sand bass might be wearing tags from last year's  tagging program. The tags should be turned in to the Department of Fish and  Game with area caught and date for a $5 reward.  </P> <P> Seven South Bay fishermen returned from the fishing trip of a lifetime in Costa  Rica.  </P> <P> The group, led by Curtis Brown of Torrance, was fishing at Tamarindo Beach near  the Nicaraguan border.  </P> <P> Brown said the sailfishing was spectacular, with more than 50 fish caught and  released.  </P> <P> Mike Pruitt and Fred Holtz of Torrance caught seven sails with the largest  estimated to weigh more than 150 pounds.  </P> <P> Carson angler Tony Jackson used 15-pound test line and battled one fish for 40  minutes.  </P> <P> Eldon Johnson of San Pedro was using light tackle, but lost several fish before  switching to 20-pound test line.  </P> <P> Howard Homan of Long Beach, who was on his first sailfish trip, caught several  fish. Philip Friedman, the voice of 976-TUNA, said on the last day the group  also caught rainbow runners, dorado, big-eye tuna, yellow-fin tuna and  amberjack.  </P> <P> Brown and Friedman said it was a wide-open bite for two hours and all the fish  were caught on jigs as no bait was available.  </P> <P> In conjunction with National Fishing Week, Saturday is a free fishing day.  </P> <P> The public can fish California waters without a fishing license. However,  anglers are reminded all catch limits and size regulations apply.  </P> <P> The second grunion season starts Saturday. They are expected to hit South Bay  beaches to spawn between 10:45 p.m. and 12:40 a.m. for a four-day run.  </P> <P> The run times and beaches change nightly.  </P> <P> South Bay Catches: Joan Bartold of West Los Angeles, fishing aboard the Betty O  out of Santa Monica Bay, caught the whopper of the week, a 35-pound halibut.  </P> <P> Janet and Bob Yamane, fishing off Catalina Island aboard the Mustang, caught  33- and 31-pound yellowtails. The West Los Angeles couple hooked their fish at  the same time, with Janet catching the larger fish.  </P> <P> Nguyen Hon Ling of West Los Angeles, fishing on the Annie B barge, caught a  32-pound halibut.  </P> <P> Mark Arsencal of Hawthorne, fishing aboard the Sea Spray off Torrance Beach,  won the jackpot with a 14-pound halibut.  </P> <P> Fish Reports  </P> <P> Local fishing is starting to improve as barracuda have moved into horseshoe  kelp. Bonito fishing has slowed. At Catalina Island, bass and barracuda provide  most of the action. White sea bass and yellowtail slowed the past several days.  </P> <P> Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Spitfire fished Santa Monica Bay and anglers  caught 220 sculpin and 50 sand bass.  </P> <P> The Happyman, on a half-day trip to Venice Beach, returned with 175 sculpin and  20 sand bass.  </P> <P> The Betty O rock cod special fished the rockpile and caught 160 rock cod, a  lingcod and a halibut.  </P> <P> Redondo Sportfishing: The Sea Spray, fishing off Torrance Beach, found a  wide-open barracuda bite.

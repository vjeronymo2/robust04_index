			<p><P> January 2, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> GREEKS HAVE A WORD -- SATIRE -- FOR PAPANDREOU'S LOVE AFFAIR  </P> <P> Politics and sex, the mix that has rocked Greek theater for 2,400 years, is  finding new life in satirical shows that mock Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou  and his relationship with a former flight attendant.  </P> <P> Greeks are packing the capital's theaters to laugh at satires of the  69-year-old Socialist premier, who is carrying on a public relationship with  34-year-old Dimitra Liani while his governing Panhellenic Socialist Movement is  besieged by financial scandals.  </P> <P> Public affairs -- sexual and political -- have been favorite topics for Greek  comedians since the playwright Aristophanes made the combination a smash hit in  the 5th Century BC.  </P> <P> Papandreou's heart operation in London last September inspired the title of a  popular revue, "Post-Aorta Greece," written and directed by Lakis Lazopoulos,  Greece's top satirist.  </P> <P> Lazopoulos asks innocently at each show: "If a newcomer to Athens saw Andreas  and Dimitra walking and holding hands, what would he think?"  </P> <P> "That there's a nice girl helping an old man cross the street," comes the  answer.  </P> <P> Outside the Vembo Theater a giant poster of Papandreou and Liani embracing  advertises "Little Dimitra's Sweetheart," a take-off of a classic Greek  folklore play, "The Little Shepherdess's Sweetheart."  </P> <P> In the show, an Athens housewife is asked whether the prime minister's  pre-election pledges of political and social change have been fulfilled.  </P> <P> "Andreas has made one change OK. He changed his American woman for a Greek,"  she answers as the audience breaks into enthusiastic applause.  </P> <P> Three months ago, Papandreou said he will divorce his 66-year-old American-born  wife Margaret, but no proceedings have yet been started. The blonde Liani has  been divorced twice.  </P> <P> Six political revues are playing over the holiday season.  </P> <P> According to box-office figures, the shows are grossing up to $37,500 a week,  twice as much as the most successful drama in Athens.  </P></p>

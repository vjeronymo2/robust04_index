			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bassam Abu-Sharif, adviser to PLO Chairman </F> Yasir 'Arafat by 'Awdah 'Awdah in Amman; date not given]    [Text] ['Awdah] You were a close aide to President 'Arafat,  but recently your role has been marginalized. Would you explain  the reasons for this?    [Abu-Sharif] My relations with brother President 'Arafat are  still cordial. These militant relations cannot be weakened.  Within the framework of the ongoing peace process, the  negotiating team attracts attention because it is charged with  this task. Meanwhile, many leaders not directly involved in the  negotiations are charged with other tasks. Regrettably, I have  read many articles and reports that try to distort things and  misinterpret them. As you have noticed, I did not respond to  these attempts, because we face difficult tasks now. No doubt,  the current stage is one of the most difficult stages of the  struggle; it is a sensitive stage on the internal level as well,  in terms of negotiations, foreign relations, and inter-Arab  relations. It is natural to see different viewpoints regarding  tactical points and the working plan and mechanism that must be  followed in the interest of our people to achieve what can be  achieved through the peace process, despite its difficulties.  The objective is full Israeli withdrawal from Arab territory.  This cannot be achieved by remote control.    Negotiations are being held with the Israeli enemy. He is a  difficult enemy, not an easy enemy. When we talk with the  Israeli enemy we must not forget we are talking with an enemy,  regardless of its delegations' visits to Tunisia and the  meetings in Cairo. We must not forget it is an enemy who tries  to achieve as much as it can within the land for peace equation.    We believe the absence of coordination among the Arab  parties  involved in the talks will weaken the Arab position, or at  least, strengthen the position of the Israeli negotiators. We  see that the Israeli stand is united, despite the known  differences between Shim'on Peres and Yitzhaq Rabin. We also  see that it is stronger, although we know Rabin's majority in  the Knesset is very small and that the Likud is strong. When we  talk about the working mechanism, there are points that must be  tackled to strengthen the position of the Palestinian and Arab  negotiators. I believe the existence of different views and  detailed discussions are important so we can form a sound  opinion in the service of our people.    I would like to note the importance of Jordanian-Palestinian  coordination, in particular within the framework of coordination  among the Arab negotiating delegations. This must be united and  capable of mobilizing Arab support. Without the unity of the  Palestinian stand and the unity of the Arab position -- which  must be supported by all Arab sides -- the position of each  negotiating team will be weaker. Syria can negotiate in the  Syrian track, but it will be stronger when it is supported by a  united Arab position. This will make the U.S. Administration  think carefully before taking any stand to appease Israel.    I believe neither the initial agreement nor the periodic  meetings of the Arab parties involved in the process are enough.  There must be continuous meetings on general and special  issues. The general issues relate to the Arab-Israeli talks.  The specific issues deal with each track. This will save us  from suspicion and from falling into Israeli traps.    ['Awdah] I take it from what you say that the state of  your relatonship with 'Arafat is fine?    [Abu-Sharif] Yes, it is as you describe.    ['Awdah] But you are in Amman now, while Tunis swarms with  top Israeli, Russian, and U.S. officials, including Dennis Ross.  Aren't you being marginalized?    [Abu-Sharif] I haven't been to Amman for a long time. I am  here visiting relatives and friends. I leave for Tunis tomorrow.  I know that Israeli, U.S., and Russian delegations are in Tunis  to promote the implementation of the latest UN Security Council  resolution.    ['Awdah] Hasn't 'Arafat invited you to join these talks?    [Abu-Sharif] I am returning to my office in Tunis.    ['Awdah] Do you have anything against the Cairo  negotiations?    [Abu-Sharif] People may have their own opinions about the  peace process and the media handling of it.    ['Awdah] Can you be more specific?    [Abu-Sharif] Take the Hebron massacre, for example. The  tragedy might have been seized upon to put Israel on the spot.  The tragic massacre stigmatizes not only Israel but the entire  West. We should have mounted a worldwide campaign that did not  stop until Israel was forced into drawing up a timetable for the  withdrawal of settlers from the occupied territories,  simultaneously with the withdrawal of Israeli troops. The issue  is not about disarming the settlers. The settlers and  settlements are part of the establishment of occupation. This  objective might have been obtained away from the battlefield or  even the diplomatic front. Ninety-five precent of a campaign for  such an objective must be fought through the media. The  al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre is a black chapter in the annals of  the West. We ought to have used it to mobilize world opinion  and put all the governments of the West in the dock.    Let me ask you this: Suppose a Palestinian extremist shot 10  worshipers at the Wailing Wall? How would the Israelis have  handled such an incident? Wouldn't they have turned the world  upside down?    ['Awdah] And since, as you say, your relationship with  'Arafat is fine and you are his media adviser, what stopped you  from launching this media campaign?    [Abu-Sharif] No comment.    ['Awdah] Then you are not 'Arafat's media adviser any more?    [Abu-Sharif] I still hold that position. I have no regrets  over my optimistic outlook about the peace process.    ['Awdah] At the 20th session of the Palestine National  Council in Algiers, you told me you were optimistic about the  chances of an independent Palestinian state. Now, three years  on, nothing significant has been achieved.    [Abu-Sharif] I never had any illusions that the peace  process would be not be long and arduous. Even now, I dare say  that, in spite of everything, the peace process will move  forward. The whole exercise is not up to the local players.  There is the international community's will to put in place the  land-for-peace formula, no matter how much time and effort, and  even blood, that will take. Israel is in a difficult position.  It is not as if it is being dragged to the peace process  against its will. Peace advances its own interests. However,  it is an illusion to think that the peace process will be an  easy ride. After all, we are negotiating with an enemy.    Once again, let me stress that without proper and real  intra-Arab coordination, between the Palestinians and Jordanians  in particular, we will get nowhere.    ['Awdah] I would like to remind you that, in Algiers, you  told me the peace process would lead to peace, an independent  state, and Jerusalem.    [Abu-Sharif] I still say the same. The peace process has not  moved very far, but it will snowball as soon as Israel begins to  withdraw from Jericho and Gaza. When withdrawal begins, the  snowball will create its own momentum, grow larger, create a  totally new psychological climate, and make it impossible for  settlers to stay in a predominantly Arab environment that was  usurped by colonialist aggression. We have to start the  process, Once the withdrawal begins, it will continue until the  end.    ['Awdah] They say you have a personal view about unity  between Jordan and Palestine.    [Abu-Sharif] Union between Jordan and Palestine exists. What  separates them is the Israeli occupation. Logically and  psychologically, you cannot divide a family, half of which is in  Amman and the other half is in Jerusalem.    ['Awdah] Has 'Arafat assigned new duties to you? Have you  anything to say about that?    [Abu-Sharif] Certain duties do not need statements. This is  natural.    ['Awdah] You were the first to call for a  Palestinian-Israeli  meeting. Do you regret it?    [Abu-Sharif] This is true, and I do not regret the  initiative. I was the first to propose the implementation of the  international resolutions through direct negotiations with  Israel and under the slogan of establishing an independent  Palestinian state that will live in peace next to Israel. It is  not land for peace, but land and a state for peace. I still  demand the same, and I call for the implementation of Resolution  242. By the way, this resolution applies to East Jerusalem,  too. It is wrong to raise an argument about this issue and to  deal with Jerusalem separately. Resolution 242 covers East  Jerusalem automatically. Therefore, it is wrong to deal with  the issue of Jerusalem as if it were a separate issue. Dealing  with Jerusalem separately will enable other parties to say yes  or no, while insisting on Resolution 242, which covers  Jerusalem, means it is natural for Jerusalem to be included in  Resolution 242.    ['Awdah] You prepared for the political process before the  Madrid conference. You may have read unpublished documents in  which the United States made promises to President 'Arafat and  then ignored them.    [Abu-Sharif] Yes, Washington and the PLO exchanged  documents,  including the letter of invitation to the peace conference and  the letter of assurances. These are documented. However, I can  say a certain party may disavow such documents when the  political situation changes. What is important is that the Arab  front should remain unified to impose its respect on other  parties.    ['Awdah] Are there documents other than the letter of  invitation to the peace conference and the letter of assurances?    [Abu-Sharif] President Bush and President Clinton exchanged  official letters and documents, which contain a U.S. pledge to  implement the land-for-peace formula and Security Council  Resolutions 242 and 338, to give the Palestinian people their  full legitimate political rights, and to guarantee Israel's  security. All these documents were worked out before and after  the Madrid conference.    ['Awdah] Did the PLO and Washington exchange secret  documents  and letters?    [Abu-Sharif] Undoubtedly. There are secret things and  documents that have not been published.    ['Awdah] Do you believe Washington's decision to abstain  from voting on the paragraphs of the recent UN Security Council  Resolution Number 904 pertaining to Jerusalem and the occupied  territories reflects a U.S. retreat from pledges it has made to  Palestinians?    [Abu-Sharif] I do not believe this reflects a U.S. retreat.  In the same vein, I cannot see it as reconfirmation of previous  U.S. stands on the issue. Washington's abstention from voting  on the paragraph pertaining to Jerusalem has clouded the issue.  Hence, the U.S. position must be clarified. The U.S.  Administration cannot provide an explanation for its stand  unless Arab negotiators make a joint official demand, asking the  United States to explain its position. For my part, I support  His Majesty King Husayn, who recently said he will demand an  official explanation for Washington's decision to abstain from  voting, because abstention is neither yes nor no. We do have  official letters from the United States, explaining its position  toward occupied East Jerusalem.    ['Awdah] You are reported to have had your own views toward  the Cairo and Oslo accords. Given the al-Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre, what do you have to say?    [Abu-Sharif] I believe events have superseded these two  agreements. For example, in the Oslo accord, the Israelis did  not acknowledge the need for an international presence in the  occupied territories. But, in the aftermath of the massacre,  the Israeli Government endorsed an international presence. This  step forward is not enshrined in the accord. The Israeli  Government agreed to deem two Israeli organizations extremist  and terrorist to pave the way for evicting them from the city of  Hebron. This is another step forward. Additionally, the  release of a large number of Palestinians is an accomplishment,  because it was not scheduled. Undoubtedly, the talks currently  under way in Tunis are addressing the ways and means of  implementing UN Security Council Resolution 904. The talks are  addressing the definition of international protection. The  deployment of Palestinian policemen in the city of Hebron was  not enshrined in the Oslo accord.    ['Awdah] You have deemed the Oslo accord an accomplishment,  although you have not contributed to it. However, it is  reported that your private comments on this accord are different  from the public comments you make on it. How true is this?    [Abu-Sharif] There is no doubt that the Oslo accord is a  significant accomplishment. I have articulated this position in  private and public. This is because we will establish  Palestinian national authority on any inch of territory Israeli  troops vacate, as the Palestine National Council sessions of  1977 and 1974 advocated. Israel has agreed to withdraw from the  territories. Anyone who believes liberation is achievable by a  knockout stroke is wrong. The liberation of our Palestinian  territories is achievable only by degrees. The important thing  is that we remain steadfast until the implementation of the  international legitimacy resolutions, after which there will be  comprehensive peace. Comprehensive peace will be the outcome of  joint struggle by all Arab sides.    ['Awdah] I would like to raise the question I first posed to  you regarding the reports that Yasir 'Arafat has marginalized  your role after he reached the conclusion that the Palestinian  information institution has failed to pave the way for an  agreement with Israel. Likewise, the Palestinian negotiators  have failed to reach an agreement with Israel. Meanwhile,  Palestinian secret channels have been successful in this regard.  What is your comment on all this?    [Abu-Sharif] Failure and success cannot be judged by a  single  specific issue. We should use the terms success and failure  when we address the overall outlook regarding the  accomplishments of the Palestinian information institutions, the  magnitude and effectiveness of which vary. Hence, I cannot  speak of the success or failure of the information institution,  because there are actually various information institutions.  But, the Palestinian information institutions can undoubtedly  do more and do better to address events and developments.</p>

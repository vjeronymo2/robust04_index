			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Tax shift boosts oil shares OIL ISSUES, little changed ahead of the Budget, rose sharply after news that Petroleum Revenue Tax on existing oil fields is being reduced from 75 per cent to 50 per cent from July 1 and that tax on new fields will be abolished. The market's knee-jerk reaction was that the oil majors, British Petroleum and Shell Transport, would be the main beneficiaries of the Budget changes, closely followed by the exploration and production stocks. BP had jumped 9 to 295p by the close, with turnover totalling 5m shares. Shell, sold down to 571p early in the session, finished a net 2 higher at 580p. The exploration and production stocks saw initial sluggish performance transformed into good gains across the board. Enterprise Oil settled 4 ahead at 492p and Lasmo, plagued by worries that the dividend may be cut when the preliminary figures are published later this month, gained 5 on balance at 186p. An analyst commented: 'Any reduction in the tax-take from the North Sea, on existing and new fields, has got to be seen as good news for the oil companies.' Premier Consolidated, with its raft of small marginal fields in the North Sea, was seen as a big winner from the Budget moves. The shares ended 2 3/4 up at 29 1/2 p.</p>

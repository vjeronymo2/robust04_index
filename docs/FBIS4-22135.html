			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, April 20 (TANJUG) -- The bomb which on  Tuesday blew up the car of the first secretary of the embassy of  the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in Turkey outside his  residence in the Turkish capital was planted by an Islamic  terrorist organization called the Great Eastern Islamic  Conquering Front (IBDA), the paper MEJDAN wrote on Wednesday.    It quoted Ankara's deputy security chief as saying that the  organization had claimed responsibility for the assault in  letters to several media houses and that the group had so far  been unknown for similar activities.    After the incident, the Turkish police stepped up security  measures around the Yugoslav Embassy.    Reacting to the attack, Charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav  Embassy in Ankara Bojan Bugarcic lodged a protest note to the  Turkish Foreign Ministry.    Bugarcic on Tuesday told TANJUG that the Yugoslav Embassy  had  repeatedly informed the Turkish authorities that security  measures around the embassy were not sufficient and pointed out  that it was the duty of the Turkish Government, as the host, to  provide full protection of all diplomatic and consular offices.    The Yugoslav Government on Tuesday lodged u strong protest  note to Turkey over the terrorist attack and pointed out that  the perpetrators of the criminal act had been encouraged by the  continuing and organized anti-Yugoslav and anti-Serbian campaign  of the Turkish media and unacceptible statements by Turkish  officials aimed against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and  the Serbian people.    In the protest note, which the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry  handed to the charge d'affaires of the Turkish Embassy in  Belgrade, the Turkish Government is asked to discover and punish  the perpetrators of the terrorist act, pay compensation for the  damage to property, take all necessary steps for full protection  of the Yugoslav diplomatic and consular offices and guarantee  the safety of their personnel and the members of their families  in Turkey, in keeping with the provisions of the Vienna  convention on diplomatic relations and other international  documents.</p>

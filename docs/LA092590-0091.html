			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Wolf Accused of Bad Faith: United Airlines pilots accused UAL Corp. Chairman  Stephen M. Wolf of trying to undermine them in a letter that was seen as an  indication that the proposed $4.4-billion buyout of the carrier is in deep  trouble. In a four-page letter to its members, the United Airlines unit of the  Air Line Pilots Assn. said Wolf is telling the company's board that employee  ownership is not widely supported by the union's members.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, some members of the board believe him, and the board will  decide our collective future on Oct. 9 based on Mr. Wolf's allegations," the  group said. Oct. 9 is the deadline for the pilot-led group to arrange financing  for the $201-a-share deal, which the board accepted in April. UAL stock  plummeted $8.50 on Monday to $92.25.  </P></p>

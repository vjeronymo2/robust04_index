			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / World Trade News: EC, US start talks on tariff changes The European Commission and the US have begun informal talks on the higher import duties resulting from enlargement of the European Union. In a bid to avert a dispute, both sides have agreed to find an interim solution to losses facing the US when higher tariffs come into effect as a result of Finland, Sweden and Austria formally joining the EU early next year. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, last week threatened retaliation if the two sides failed to reach immediate agreement on an interim compensation package. The US subsequently agreed to proceed with formal talks early in the new year. The negotiations are part of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) procedures and are triggered by the enlargement of any common market, but it is the first time an interim solution has been sought. Commission officials said the EU would seek an agreement on measures to be applied for six months pending a permanent deal. Already differences have emerged on calculating compensation. 'We have to try to make a qualitative assessment off how to offset decreases against increases,' a Commission official said. However, the US has interpreted Gatt rules to mean that the EU is required to offset each individual tariff increase. Both sides have also yet to agree the period over which the tariff changes are calculated. The US has said sectors such as electronics, forest products, chemicals and agricultural products would be adversely affected by EU enlargement. US trade with the EU and its three new members totalled Ecu7bn (Dollars 8.9bn) in 1993, of which 8 per cent was with Austria, Sweden and Finland. Commission officials said that less than 10 per cent of total US trade with EU members would be affected.</p>

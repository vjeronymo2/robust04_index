			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: Italy fears two-speed Community would leave it behind - Amato's aims at the summit ITALY'S prime minister, Mr Giuliano Amato, is expected to back his French and German colleagues at the Birmingham summit in pressing to maintain the momentum towards European unity and avoid renegotiating the Maastricht treaty. He will also be anxious to ensure European Community leaders can achieve consensus on the treaty's future. The Italian government is aware that disagreements at Birmingham could lead to a two-speed Community, with Italy, a founder EC member, in the slow track. Last weekend, Mr Amato made brief trips to Paris and Bonn to meet Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany to discuss summit strategy. Mr Amato is understood to have sought assurances that France and Germany were not planning to go ahead with a two-speed Europe. The Italian senate has ratified the Maastricht treaty and the chamber of deputies is shortly expected to follow suit. The government has virtually all-party support for its policy of resisting a dilution of the treaty's aims or changes in its timetable. Despite the lira floating outside the European monetary system and an economy falling well behind the proposed criteria for EC convergence, the government bases all policies on the premise that Italy will remain an integral part of the EC. In almost complete contrast to British concerns about sovereignty and subsidiarity, the Italian government welcomes the external disciplinary framework of the convergence criteria and the exchange rate mechanism. However, attitudes have changed since the Andreotti government signed the Maastricht treaty last December. His government took a fundamentally political view of the treaty, believing that even if Italy could not fully comply with the convergence criteria, it could not be excluded from the proposed union in 1997. The economic and financial crisis of the past three months has served to remind Mr Amato's government that such a political view cannot be taken for granted. If Italy fails to tackle its mountain of debt and huge public sector deficit, Mr Amato realises its Community partners will not feel obliged to hold the door open for the fast track. Thus, at Birmingham, Mr Amato will not merely be re-stating Italy's European credentials and its desire to re-enter the EMS as soon as possible, hopefully before Christmas; he will also explain his 1993 budget, now going through parliament, and his plans for bringing the public sector deficit into line over the next three years. To retain credibility with his partners, he is also likely to state the government's willingness to submit to close EC monitoring. This in turn is expected to facilitate agreement on an EC stand-by facility of some Ecu5bn (Pounds 3.93bn) currently under negotiation.</p>

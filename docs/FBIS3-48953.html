			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maria Wagrowska: "The President Will Back the </F> Army"]    [Text] Addressing members of the Polish Navy, Coast Guard,  Air Force, and the Air Defense, President Lech Walesa, commander  in chief of the Polish Army, said: "I have had many problems  over the last three years, but there were none with the  military." The president spoke at a New Year's meeting held on  board the largest Polish destroyer, Warszawa.    Lech Walesa also assessed the elapsed period of his  presidency, saying that "everything is okay in the concept that  I once chose, however there were problems with the realization  of the latter." The president added: "I bet on democracy and  reform initiated by the people. Poland did not let others win  the race. We will never have a better legislature than the one  we have now; I mean that everything was discussed over the last  four years and it only has to be given legal footing now."    Walesa stated that he had made no decision thus far  regarding  his running for another term as president but added that he  would like to give it a try.    The president swore that he will do his best to assist the  Army, saying in Piotr Kolodziejczyk's presence: "I will try and  assist [the Army] through the person who is an expert in this  matter. I will not put up with political divisions in the  Army." The president advocates adopting the Army's budget once  every four years, so that the Army can plan in advance.    Lech Walesa informed the audience that he will personally  attend the 12 January conference of Visegrad Group leaders with  President Bill Clinton, saying: "I hope he listens to us."    Answering a RZECZPOSPOLITA question regarding hopes placed  on  the 10-11 January NATO summit in Brussels, the president said  that we should approach the West set by step, staying in the  West's orbit. The West is skillfully scheming. It is happy  that the Warsaw Pact and the communist bloc have ceased to  exist, while we want a unified Europe.</p>

With the Japan-U.S. summit talks coming on 11 February, the  United States is becoming more and more irritated.    According to a Japanese Government source, U.S. officials  have made informal inquiries about Japan's approach to the  summit meeting, but policymakers in the government and the  ruling coalition parties have no time for anything else but  political reform. They are not in a mood for prior  consultations on the summit.    The summit meeting in February is supposed to be a venue for  the two leaders to assess the results of the Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks. However, a head-on collision has occurred at  the working level framework talks over the handling of the  numerical targets, and it has become difficult to come up with  results that can be taken up at the summit talks.    While negotiators on both sides agree that "there can be no  progress without a political decision by the top leader," the  Hosokawa administration has shown no sign of taking any action.  White House officials are becoming increasingly irritated. Some  U.S. Government officials have even expressed the view that "if  results cannot be expected from the framework talks, it would be  better for Japan to ask for a postponement of the summit  talks...." This is because if the summit meeting ends in  failure, anti-Japanese feelings may flare up in Congress, and  the President may be put in a very difficult position.    If there should be a postponement of the summit talks, it  would be a serious diplomatic setback for Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa. It seems that the prime minister's "troubles  at home and abroad" will continue for awhile.</p>

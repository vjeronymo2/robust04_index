			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / German scheme for cheap Euro-fighter 'nonsensical' A GERMAN plan to scrap the European Fighter Aircraft project and replace it with a cheaper warplane is 'a folly,' Mr Jonathan Aitken, the defence procurement minister, said yesterday. In a statement that he described as 'friendly plain speaking from Britain', Mr Aitken said the claims by Mr Volker Ruhe, Germany's defence minister, that a new fighter would save money were 'nonsensical'. The development phase of the EFA had been paid for and 'it would be extraordinary for the coalition partners (UK, Germany, Italy and Spain) to throw away DM15bn' (Pounds 5bn). Mr Aitken was responding to Mr Ruhe's proposal on Tuesday that the EFA be replaced with a lighter aircraft to save money but still provide jobs for the German aerospace industry. He had previously called for complete German withdrawal from the project. Mr Aitken said the proposal 'horrified' the UK government. Mr Ruhe seemed to be advocating a less capable aircraft that might be less effective against the latest Russian Fulcrum and Flanker fighters. Mr Aitken said those aircraft were being sold to other countries, so the end of the Cold war had not eliminated the danger from them. Furthermore, the question mark over the EFA had come 'at the worst possible moment', given the strains on European unity following the 'no' vote earlier this month in the Danish referendum on the Maastricht treaty.

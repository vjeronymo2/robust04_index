			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Lloyd's wins US court ruling LLOYD'S of London has won a further legal victory in an action brought against it by three US Names, Richard Lapper writes. The Names - individuals whose assets support underwriting at the insurance market - also took action against a number of agents and various banks. A Chicago District Court granted a motion by Lloyd's to dismiss an action brought by three Names, Mr Kenneth Bonny, Ms Francesca Bonny and Mr Robert Flesvig. The Names were appealing against an earlier ruling which upheld a Lloyd's contention that under the terms of agency agreements signed by Names, any dispute must be heard in an English court.</p>

			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Dollar's strength forces sterling under Dollars 1.50 THE DOLLAR continued its strong end-of-year rally on foreign exchanges yesterday, rising to its highest level against the D-Mark since the summer and pushing sterling below Dollars 1.50 for the first time this year. The US currency reached a high of DM1.6235, boosted by better-than-expected consumer confidence data in the US, increasing expectations that the US is set for strong growth in 1993. The US consumer confidence index rose to 78.3 per cent this month from a revised 65.6 per cent in November. The dollar's surge, which faded towards the end of European trading, was helped by a growing belief in financial markets that Germany may cut official rates early next year, triggering a Europe-wide relaxation of monetary policy. This speculation - with no support from the Bundesbank - pushed the pound down to a low of Dollars 1.4988, a level last seen in January 1987. The dollar closed in London at DM1.614, more than a pfennig up on the day. Sterling closed at Dollars 1.5135, down nearly two cents on the day. In New York, the dollar finished at DM1.6138, while sterling was trading at Dollars 1.5082. In Tokyo this morning the dollar opened at DM1.61385 and sterling was quoted at Dollars 1.507. The London stock market reached a record closing high, helped by hopes of lower UK interest rates and reports that the winter sales had started well. The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares rose 20.3 to 2,847.8. The broader FT-SE Actuaries 350 index also closed at a record at 1,388.9, up 9.1. Activity was well below the recent average. On Wall Street, a late round of computer-driven sell programmes pushed prices sharply lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 22.42 to 3,310.84, after registering an 18-point gain at one stage.

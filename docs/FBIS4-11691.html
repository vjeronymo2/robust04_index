			<p>BFN     [Text] Environment Minister Yosi Sarid sharply attacked  the halakic ruling issued by Rabbis Shapira, Yisre'eli, and  Neriya, calling on IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers to  disobey any orders to evacuate Jewish settlers from Hebron.  Minister Sarid said that the three rabbis behind the injunction  were irresponsible people who were toying with the fate of the  IDF and threatening the very existence of the state. If each  and every individual exhorted their supporters to refuse  objectionable orders, it would mean the end of the IDF, which  would rapidly disintegrate together with rest of the country.  The State of Israel should be pitied for having such stupid,  irresponsible, reckless and good-for-nothing rabbis, Sarid said.    Knesset Member [MK] Moshe Qatzav, the chairman of the Likud  Knesset faction, called on the government not to put the  soldiers' obligation to obey orders to the test in the context  of evacuating Jews from Hebron. MK Qatzav told our  correspondent that such action by the government could lead to  chaos within the IDF.</p>

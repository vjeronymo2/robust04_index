			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: Bethlehem Steel sees upturn BETHLEHEM Steel, the second largest integrated steel company in the US, announced a Dollars 41m first-quarter net loss, while Nucor, the largest US mini-mill group, reported a 33 per cent rise in net earnings to Dollars 21.7m. The US steel industry has been suffering from a cyclical downturn in prices and demand, though some of the more nimble, low-cost mini-mill manufacturers, notably Nucor, have avoided the heavy losses suffered by the large, integrated companies. Bethlehem expects to return to profitability this year. Mr Curtis Barnette, chairman, said there were encouraging signs of 'an increase in steel demand and the restoration of fair value for our products.' There had been a significant increase in orders. Its net loss was 54 cents a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 36m, or 55 cents, last time, excluding changes in accounting practice. Sales totalled Dollars 1.02bn (Dollars 995m). Nucor's earnings, lower than most forecasts, were 50 cents a share, up from 38 cents. Sales totalled Dollars 489m, against Dollars 388m.</p>

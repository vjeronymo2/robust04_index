Gilbertson, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (HFD&hyph;810), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, 301&hyph;594&hyph;5000. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  of April 5, 1993 (58 FR 17553), the agency proposed to amend its general labeling policy for over-the-counter (OTC) drug products to allow for the interchangeable use of certain words in the labeling required by an OTC drug monograph. The agency had previously proposed in a number of tentative final monographs and included in a number of final monographs a provision that the words ``doctor'' and ``physician'' may be used interchangeably in the labeling of OTC drug products. (See, e.g., &sect;&sect;333.150(e), 333.350(e), and 336.50(e) (21 CFR 333.150(e), 333.350(e), and 336.50(e)).) Instead of including this provision in each OTC drug monograph, the agency proposed to include such a provision in &sect;330.1 (21 CFR 330.1) as part of the general conditions under which an OTC drug is generally recognized as safe, effective, and not misbranded. The agency also proposed that, at manufacturers' discretion, the word ``ask'' could be substituted for the word ``consult,'' which appears in the directions for many OTC drug monograph ingredients. (See, e.g., &sect;&sect;333.150(c)(1), 333.350(c)(2), and 340.50(c)(2) (21 CFR 340.50(c)(2)).) Thus, the agency proposed that the phrases ``consult a physician,'' ``consult a doctor,'' ``ask a physician,'' and ``ask a doctor'' could be used interchangeably. The agency invited comments and suggestions as to such other terms that could be used interchangeably, i.e., terms general in nature that appear in more than one OTC drug monograph. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One trade association, representing OTC drug manufacturers, and one drug manufacturer submitted comments in response to the agency's proposal. Copies of the comments are on display in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, and may be seen by interested persons between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Summary of the Comments Received <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The comment from the trade association agreed with the agency's proposal to allow for the interchangeable use of the words ``doctor'' and ``physician,'' and the words ``consult'' and ``ask.'' The comment suggested the following additional sets of alternative terms and gave the following citations, showing inclusion in several OTC drug monographs, as support: (1) ``Clean'' or ``cleanse'' (&sect;&sect;333.150(d), 333.350(d)(1), and 346.50(d)(1) (21 CFR 346.50(d)(1))); (2) ``persist'' or ``continue'' (&sect;&sect;341.76(c)(5)(ii), 346.50(c)(7)(iii), 357.150(c)(1), and 357.850(c)(1)(i) (21 CFR 341.76(c)(5)(ii), 346.50(c)(7)(iii), 357.150(c)(1), and 357.850(c)(1)(i))); (3) ``chronic'' or ``persistent'' (&sect;&sect;336.50(c)(1), 338.50(c)(3), 341.74(c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4)(ii) through (c)(4)(iv), and 341.78(c)(1) (21 CFR 338.50(c)(3), 341.74(c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4)(ii) through (c)(4)(iv), and 341.78(c)(1))); (4) ``assistance'' or ``help'' (&sect;&sect;331.30(g), 332.30(c), 341.74(f), and 342.76(c)(5)(i) and (c)(6)(ii) (21 CFR 331.30(g), 332.30(c), 341.74(f), and 342.76(c)(5)(i) and (c)(6)(ii))); and (5) ``pulmonary'' or ``lung'' (&sect;&sect;336.50(c)(1) and 338.50(c)(3)). The comment stated that, in some instances, the paired terms already appear in the cited regulations and, in other cases, the alternative terms may be better understood by consumers. The comment mentioned the following examples: ``Lung'' disease may be better understood than the more technical ``pulmonary'' disease, and ``persistent'' may be better understood than ``chronic.'' The comment stated its understanding that the rule is intended only to provide a glossary of comparable terms that may be used interchangeably, not to make substantive changes in the underlying required label statements. For example, the comment mentioned that the rule would not permit the term ``health professional'' as an alternative to the terms ``doctor'' or ``physician,'' because a ``health professional'' may include pharmacists, nurses, midwives, and others who are not licensed to practice medicine. The comment requested that the agency clarify that this rule applies only to OTC drug monograph language otherwise required to be declared verbatim in OTC drug product labeling. The comment added that the rule would not apply to or otherwise affect the use of truthful and nonmisleading alternative terms that can be used for monograph indications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The other comment also proposed that the terms ``assistance'' and ``help'' be allowed interchangeably in the general overdose warning, which states: ``In case of accidental ingestion, seek professional assistance or contact a Poison Control Center immediately.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. The Agency's Final Conclusions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency has carefully evaluated the comments' proposals for the interchangeable use of certain terms and concludes that the interchangeable terms suggested by the comments (``clean'' or ``cleanse,'' ``persist(s)'' or ``continue(s),'' ``assistance'' or ``help,'' and ``pulmonary'' or ``lung'') are acceptable and will help promote better label readability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the agency has determined that the terms ``indication(s)'' or ``use(s)'' should be allowed to be used interchangeably. The agency considers the term ``use(s)'' to be simpler and better understood by consumers than the term ``indication(s).'' The agency is including this option in &sect;330.1(i). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency disagrees with the interchangeable use of the words ``chronic'' and ``persistent.'' ``Chronic,'' by definition, is of long duration, or may be subject to habit or disease for a lengthy period (Ref. 1). On the other hand, ``persistent,'' by definition, is refusing to let go, insistently repetitive or continuous, or enduring (Ref. 2). While ``chronic'' is also ``persistent,'' ``persistent'' is not necessarily ``chronic.'' For instance, a chronic cough denotes one that has gone on for a lengthy period of time, while a persistent cough could be one of recent onset that does not respond to treatment. Thus, a chronic cough and a persistent cough may be the same, or they could be two separate entities. Therefore, interchangeable use of the terms ``chronic'' and ``persistent'' is not included in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> References <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) ``Webster's II New Riverside University Dictionary,'' Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston, 1984, s.v. ``chronic.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) ``Webster's II New Riverside University Dictionary,'' Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston, 1984, s.v. ``persistent.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule does not make substantive changes in the language required in OTC drug monographs. The rule allows for alternative terminology for certain terms that are sufficiently comparable to be used interchangeably. The rule does not affect the use of truthful and nonmisleading terminology as an alternative to monograph indications in accord with &sect;330.1(c)(2)(ii) and (c)(2)(iii). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency has examined the economic consequences of this final rule and determined that it does not require either a regulatory impact analysis, as specified in Executive Order 12866, or a regulatory flexibility analysis, as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354). This final rule provides alternative labeling options that can be implemented at very little cost by manufacturers at the next printing of labels, for those products for which the manufacturer chooses to make a change. Thus, the rule will have no significant economic impact. The agency concludes that the final rule is not a major rule as defined in Executive Order 12866. Further, the agency certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 330 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Over-the-counter drugs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, 21 CFR part 330 is amended as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 330_OVER-THE-COUNTER (OTC) HUMAN DRUGS WHICH ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE AND NOT MISBRANDED <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

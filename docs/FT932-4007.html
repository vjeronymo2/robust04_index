			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Company car drivers shun cash FEWER than one in 20 company car drivers say they will give up their cars in exchange for cash from their employers before a tax system is introduced next April, although most drivers expect to pay more under the new regime, a Mori survey shows. Publication of the survey, carried out for Lex Service group's vehicle leasing subsidiary, follows hard on the heels of a report from employee benefits specialists Stoy Benefit Consulting. This concluded that nearly six out of 10 UK executives would be better off by handing back their company cars in exchange for extra pay and a mileage allowance to run their own cars. The Mori survey of more than 600 company car drivers found that 72 per cent expected to pay more tax, but 52 per cent said the new regime would have no effect on either the type of car they drove or its specification.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lima, 11 Feb (EFE) -- A Shining Path dissident  faction which rejects the peace agreement proposed by Shining  Path leader Abimael Guzman has formed the "People's Liberation  Army" (EPL) [Ejercito Popular de Liberacion], Peruvian police  reported today. A National Counterterrorism Directorate  (Dincote) spokesman explained that the EPL has rejected Guzman's  leadership and claims it is the authentic representative of  Maoist communism in Peru.    Abimael Guzman, arrested in September 1992 and sentenced to  life in prison, admitted the political and military defeat of  his organization that took up arms in 1980 and asked Peruvian  President Alberto Fujimori to negotiate a peace settlement.    According to the spokesman, the EPL leaders are: Alberto  Ramirez Durand, alias "Comrade Feliciano;" Julio Cesar Mezzich;  and a third leader whose identity is kept secret by government  information services.    The schism in the Peruvian terrorist band was confirmed in  documents found by police when they recently arrested a 10 EPL  members in the San Juan de Lurigancho district in Lima. In the  documents, the dissidents call Guzman and his followers, "the  opportunist rightist line" of the Peruvian Communist Party, the  official name of Shining Path. In other messages, previously  confiscated in several Peruvian jails, it was also established  that the Shining Path members who are loyal to their leader call  the EPL "the leftist execution line," the police source added.    According to police, the arrest of the EPL terrorists has  neutralized the terrorist offensive launched in Lima on 7  February, when a car bomb exploded next to the Air Force  headquarters and a bomb was placed next to an Army garrison.    The terrorists were arrested in the Cerro "Casablanca" area,  where they had established a training camp for handling weapons  and explosives.</p>

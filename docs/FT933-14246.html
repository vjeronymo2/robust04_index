			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / People: Bank for International Settlements Robin Leigh-Pemberton (pictured right), who stepped down as governor of the Bank of England last month, has picked up his first outside directorship and a new title. The former governor, who was given a life peerage in the Queen's birthday honours list, took the title Lord Kingsdown yesterday and was also appointed a director of the Basle-based Bank for International Settlements, the central bankers' bank. The appointment was less surprising than the title. The governor of the Bank of England always sits on the BIS board and the tradition is that the ex-governor is the second British director. Until yesterday Lord Richardson of Duntisbourne, head of the Bank of England between 1973 and 1983, had been the second British director on the BIS board. The choice of title was less straightforward. The ex-governor has strong ties with Kent. He has been Lord Lieutenant since 1982. However, although his home is in Kent, he does not live in either of the county's two Kingsdowns. Instead he has taken the title of a great, great grandfather, Thomas Pemberton, a successful lawyer who was made a peer by Queen Victoria, but died childless.</p>

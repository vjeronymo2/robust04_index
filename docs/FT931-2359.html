			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / From cups of tea. . . to round-the-clock talks . . .to a farce IT ALL started politely enough over countless cups of tea in the ground-floor drawing room of Richard Branson's elegant Holland Park mansion. For 90 minutes on Monday, January 25, the flamboyant head of Virgin Atlantic, perched on the edge of his armchair, chatted animatedly with Sir Colin Marshall, the hard-nosed and somewhat more conventional chief executive of British Airways. Both men were anxious to bury the hatchet after a messy, damaging and sometimes squalid battle which threatened to spiral out of control. A fortnight earlier BA had attempted to end its long-running 'dirty tricks' dispute with Virgin when it apologised in the High Court for its underhand behaviour and paid Pounds 610,000 in libel damages. Branson, in spite of the settlement, was still fuming at what he always saw as an attempt by BA to drive his smaller airline out of business. The day after Virgin's court victory, Sir Freddie Laker, whose own airline was forced out of business 10 years earlier, had telephoned from Florida to congratulate Branson and to offer a succinct piece of advice: 'Sue the bastards'. The Virgin boss now wanted a lot more than Pounds 610,000. He sought millions from BA for the damage inflicted on his fleet of eight jumbos, with a commitment never again to treat a competitor so shabbily. He threatened a barrage of legal action across the US and Europe if BA refused. In spite of BA hopes that the High Court hearing would represent the end of the affair, the airline knew it had to talk. Branson was not a man to give up easily and the mere threat, deftly dropped into the odd conversation, that he had far more damaging evidence could not be dismissed lightly. Both sides were also under increasing pressure from the government to settle a dogfight which ministers believed was giving the British airline industry a bad name. At their Holland Park summit Branson and Marshall were joined by Trevor Abbott, Virgin group managing director, and Robert Ayling, his opposite number at BA. Marshall kicked off with a statement repeating his airline's apologies and providing assurances that he had not been involved in any campaign. Like dishes on a menu, Branson then reeled off the issues he expected both sides to cover during talks designed to reach a final peace settlement. High on the list was a pledge by BA not to make any further improper use of Virgin computer information and an end to passenger poaching. Marshall and Branson seemed to take it in their stride. They emerged, smiling and joking, to tell the press, who had been kept entertained in Branson's dining room, that talks would start at once. Sir Colin was to fly out of the country on business, so he left Ayling to fix up an early meeting with Abbott and start the hard bargaining. Lawyers constantly on hand, Abbott and Ayling started to meet regularly at Enserch House, BA's London offices in St James' Square. Occasionally they convened at Linklater and Paines, the airline's solicitors. The talks quickly became bogged down. An insider said: 'It was quite clear that BA's lawyers were, initially, just intent upon finding out what else we might have on them.' On February 5 BA announcedthat Lord King was stepping down in sadness as chairman six months ahead of schedule. The end of his 12-year reign handed Sir Colin the executive chairman role he had always wanted. Ten days later the negotiations came close to collapse. In spite of a mutual pledge that neither side would disclose any details until an agreement was signed, Branson awoke to find Sunday newspapers carrying the terms of an offer included in a letter from BA to Virgin. His fury at BA's apparent lack of good faith intensified press suggestions that his side had leaked the terms of BA's offer. The theory was killed when it emerged that the letter was a draft which had never left BA's hands. That Sunday Branson wrote a long and angry letter to Sir Michael Angus, BA's deputy chairman. The letter challenged statements by BA's lawyers that the airline's directors had not known about the 'dirty tricks' campaign. Branson focused on the specific issue of computer accessing. Virgin had accused BA of tapping into its computer reservation information for the past three years and that it had continued to do so last summer even after Virgin's lawyers had formally complained to BA. In any case, the offer BA leaked to the Sunday newspapers was unacceptable. The UK flag carrier proposed to pay Virgin Pounds 3m to settle a longstanding aircraft maintenance dispute and also suggested arbitration procedures to determine Virgin's claims for commercial damages. The Branson letter brought BA back to the negotiating table and Lord Caithness, the aviation minister, urged Branson to try to settle to avoid a damaging legal battle in the US. When the talks resumed after an apology from Sir Colin for the previous weekend's events the lawyers took the strain. As the days passed Gerrard Tyrell and Colin Howes, the Harbottle and Lewis lawyers working for Branson, fought for 48 hours to stay awake as they sparred with an army of legal experts from Linklaters, Simmonds and Simmonds - representing the non-executive directors - and Sullivan and Cromwell. Up to 20 BA lawyers working in shifts kept one session going for 25 hours without a break. A Virgin official said: 'BA's view appeared to be that they were buying Virgin's silence, not that they were compensating us for the 'dirty tricks' campaign.' By February 18 Abbott had presented a compromise package to Ayling. Talks to hammer out the compromise intensified but on February 22 they risk being derailed with fresh press disclosures suggesting BA was still poaching Virgin passengers in California. The same day Branson rushed to Heathrow Airport to indulge in the type of highly effective self-promotion which has become his hallmark. Opening the new Virgin Clubhouse, complete with music room, massage and manicure parlours, Branson vowed to make flying fun. He had a more serious message for BA, issuing another public ultimatum to his competitor to settle immediately or face a bruising legal battle. The following day a meeting was held at Branson's home between the Virgin boss, Abbott, Ayling and Michael Davies, a BA non-executive director standing in for Sir Michael Angus. Branson told them he would settle the dispute for around Pounds 12.5m to Pounds 13m which would cover both the maintenance row and passenger-poaching claims. On March 1, BA came back with a draft contract including a counter offer of Pounds 9m. With some BA directors suggesting the figure was unnecessarily generous, it was to be BA's last cash offer. The draft, however, contained a poison pill. BA was now insisting on a strict confidentiality clause and the return of documents setting out the 'dirty tricks' allegations against BA which had forced the airline into a High Court settlement. Although he would accept the Pounds 9m cash payment, Branson flatly rejected any suggestion that his company should be permanently gagged. Neither would he tolerate returning the court documents if BA intended to shred them. He suggested they should be held by lawyers at least until both companies enjoyed a better relationship. An angry Branson told Sir Michael Angus that the idea of a gag was contemptible. Such were the conditions being laid down by lawyers, he complained, any autobiography he should one day write would have to pretend the affair never happened. Setting yet another deadline he told BA: 'settle by 4pm Friday or we'll see you in court.' The following day, with the talks deadlocked, Branson used an address to the Royal Aeronautical Society to ask the government to give smaller UK airlines a fair crack of the whip in competing for business against BA. He could not resist a jibe, thanking BA for its 'generosity' in checking, at absolutely no cost to Virgin, his airline's computer records. Two days later, after Sir Colin and Ayling had found themselves facing criticism of their airline's behaviour from some MPs at a meeting of the Commons all-party Aviation Group, talks were back on to resolve the gagging and shredding issues. As the hours ticked away towards 4pm on Friday March 5, Branson's team drew up a press release announcing the collapse of talks and the decision to pursue BA through the courts. At 3.59pm, a letter arrived from Ayling, telling Branson a more detailed response was on its way. Once more in the game of bluff and counter bluff, the Virgin camp lifted the deadline. When it came, however, the counter offer was still not acceptable to Branson. Although BA proposed to keep the 'dirty tricks' documents for five years, the Virgin boss felt he still faced an unacceptable vow of silence. That Sunday, Branson flew to New York as his lawyers digested the contents of BA's latest offer and prepared another response. When Branson returned to London four days later, both sides were still bogged down in a legalistic tussle which increasingly threatened their credibility in the eyes of those watching. The log-jam continued for seven more days, in large part because BA's top management were engaged on another front with the airline's USAir deal coming to a head. Ayling had to fly off at a moment's notice to the US where the new Clinton administration was about to pronounce itself on BA's Dollars 300m investment in USAir. The USAir deal, much to BA's relief, was cleared last Monday. Back in London, Ayling sent a letter to Virgin saying that BA was prepared to continue negotiating but not prepared to accept arbitrary deadlines repeatedly set by Branson. Virgin said Ayling's latest and long-awaited response was still totally unacceptable because it continued to insist on gagging Branson. 'This is turning into a Brian Rix farce and even farces don't run for so long in the West End,' said Abbott. Enough was enough. After Branson returned yesterday from the US he announced that he was breaking off talks with BA and that he was starting legal proceedings against the UK flag carrier's conduct in the UK, EC, and US courts.

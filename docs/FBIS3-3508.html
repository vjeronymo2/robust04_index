			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jinan, March 14 (XINHUA) -- The Shengli oilfield,  China's second largest after Daqing, has made major headway in  its geological prospecting.    Shuai Defu, Shengli's chief geologist, said that the recent  sinking of new wells in the Chengdao offshore oil and gas site,  China's biggest of its kind, has found over 100 sq [square] km  in oil formations, compared with the original area of 40 sq km.  And further exploration is needed to establish the actual  extent of reserves.    In the Linnan oil reservoir, an oil belt of nearly 1,000 sq  km has been assured, with an annual capacity of more than  500,000 tons.    On the north of the belt, a 2,000-m [meter]-deep deposit has  been found. It is considered to be one of the best oil  production centers in the region.    In the Feiyantan field, the newly-verified reserves last  year  doubled the initial figure.    In addition, the oilfield has also seen expansion after  fresh  strikes at other oil reservoirs such as Hekou, Bonan and  Caoqiao, according to Shuai.    Located in the Yellow river delta in east China's Shandong  Province, Shengli claims 65 verified fields with several billion  tons of oil reserves and gas amounting to tens of billions of  cubic meters.    Since its maiden year of 1964, Shengli has sunk 53 wells and  produced 520 million tons of oil, accounting for one-fifth of  the country's total. It has paid over 22 billion yuan in profit  taxes to the state, five-fold the government's investment in the  field.    So far, geologists have developed systems to probe for  reservoirs in Shengli's complex geological conditions,  impressing counterparts in the U.S. and Japan.    Now, armed with upgraded computers and other sophisticated  technology for oil exploration, experts are confident about the  great potential of the oilfield.    Last year, the growth in newly-verified deposits was  maintained above the average pace of the past 30 years.</p>

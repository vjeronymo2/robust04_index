			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Mercury set to offer cheaper mobile calls Mercury One-2-One, the mobile phone operator, is set to increase competition in the business telecommunications market today with a new daytime service undercutting prices charged by British Telecommunications. The service, which will be available only within the M25 area initially, is likely to offer One-2-One callers prices of up to 15 per cent below BT's, provided they make their calls from within a narrow designated area. When One-2-One launched its network last autumn it offered free local calls in the evening in a bid to sell itself to consumers deterred by the expense of mobile phones. The new service is an attempt to spread the same message to the medium- and small-business sector, which has until now also been wary of cellular phones. The overall cost of joining the One-2-One network is significantly higher than that charged by BT. Its cellular handsets retail at Pounds 200 or more, with annual connection and subscription charges of a similar order. However, One-2-One's move is set to stimulate greater competition between the UK's four mobile phone net-works. Pressure will be strong on the other network operators - Vodafone, Cellnet and Orange - to respond with price cuts, although they trade on the wider geographical coverage that is available on their networks. One-2-One, a joint venture between Mercury Communications and US West, a regional US phone company, launched its network a year ago and has about 120,000 subscribers. The UK's four cellular networks together have about 2.7m subscribers.</p>

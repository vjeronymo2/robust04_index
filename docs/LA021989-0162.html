			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> British Airways began inspecting passengers' electronic and electrical  equipment following the announcement that explosives hidden in a radio-cassette  player blew up Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland on Dec. 21, killing 270 people.  Britain's biggest airline was acting on a Department of Transport  recommendation that all airlines using British airports examine radios,  computers and other electronic or electrical equipment for possible explosives.  British Airways is asking passengers to remove such equipment from their  suitcases for a separate security check and, after clearance, to carry the  pieces aboard as hand baggage. No major delays were reported as a result of the  increased security.  </P></p>

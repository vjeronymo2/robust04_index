			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Fine Art acquires Galt for Pounds 13.5m FINE ART Developments, the mail-order and greetings cards group, is to expand in the educational supplies market with the acquisition of James Galt, the toymaker, for Pounds 13.5m cash. Mr Keith Chapman, Fine Art chairman, predicted there would be many synergies between Galt and his company's Hope Education. Established in 1836, Galt manufactures and supplies teaching aids and play materials. It also supplies local authorities with playground equipment. Customers choose and order from catalogues. However, the company is probably best known for its quality wooden items to be found in most UK retailers which stock toys. Mr Chapman said Galt had sales worth about Dollars 5m-Dollars 6m (Pounds 3.2m-Pounds 3.8m) in the US and Canada. In the year to February 28 Galt achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.4m and net assets on completion will be no less than Pounds 4.25m.</p>

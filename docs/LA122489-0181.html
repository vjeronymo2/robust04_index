			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE '80S A SPECIAL REPORT;  </P> <P> THE TASTE MAKERS;  </P> <P> PRESENTING THE BIG PLAYERS AND MAJOR IDEAS THAT -- FOR BETTER OR WORSE --  SHAPED THE 1980S. THIS IS CALENDAR'S FIFTH ANNUAL TASTE MAKERS REPORT, EXPANDED  THIS TIME TO COVER THE LAST 10 YEARS IN THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES: SHOW BUSINESS  EXECS, FILM PRODUCERS, FILM DIRECTORS AND WRITERS, STAGE, TV, MUSIC, DANCE, POP  MUSIC, JAZZ, COMEDY, RADIO, ART AND RESTAURANTS.;  </P> <P> POP MUSIC;  </P> <P> MICHAEL JACKSON  </P> <P> Forget the wacko image . . . the oxygen tank . . . the Elephant Man's bones . .  . the menagerie . . . and the tabloid-headline links with Diana Ross, Brooke  Shields, Liz Taylor and Bubbles the chimp.  </P> <P> They all may be part of the formula used by Michael Jackson to so intrigue the  public that he ended up as Vanity Fair magazine's Celebrity-of-the-'80s. But  the real reason this manchild reached his promised land in the '80s was his  music and electrifying presence.  </P> <P> Manchild he is. On the man side, Jackson's leap from child prodigy to the pop  innovator of "Thriller" was unprecedented (save perhaps for that of Stevie  Wonder). Combining that originality with his imaginative command of the new  music video form, Jackson virtually redefined the concept of a pop star in the  early '80s, not to mention the concept of album sales: "Thriller" has sold more  than any other album in history -- 40 million copies worldwide, its successor  "Bad" "only" 20 million.  </P> <P> In the process he created a new "sound of Young America," every bit as  pervasive (and ultimately color-blind) as the Motown sound in which he was  nurtured. It's hard to believe he released only two albums during the decade.  There wouldn't even be a New Kids on the Block without Jackson's inventions.  </P> <P> On the child side, the 31-year-old Jackson was the Peter Pan of the '80s,  living his heroic fantasies as he saved the world from gang wars (the "Beat It"  and "Bad" videos) and intergalactic evil ("Captain EO"). On the surface the  roles seem ludicrous: a shy, frail young man with the money (not to mention the  stunning dance moves) to give form to his daydreams. But the pop world followed  it all with almost pathological interest. When Michael wore just one glove, so  did kids around the world.  </P> <P> The Taste Makers project was edited by David Fox, assistant Sunday Calendar  editor. STEVE HOCHMAN  </P></p>

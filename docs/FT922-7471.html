			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Ford cuts its UK trade deficit FORD, Britain's biggest motor vehicle maker, cut its UK balance of trade deficit last year to Pounds 214m from Pounds 1.297bn in 1990. Until now Ford refused to disclose details of its UK trade balance after it moved into heavy deficits in the early 1980s. It is understood, however, that the deficit ran close to Pounds 1.4bn a year in 1988 and 1989. The sharp improvement last year, which was due both to a big fall in imports because of the recession and to a strong rise in exports, continued in the early months of 1992. Ford of Britain believes that its foreign trade deficit was virtually eliminated in the first quarter. The US carmaker's UK balance of trade - the difference between the value of its exports and imports of vehicles, components, parts and accessories - is an important factor in the UK motor industry's overall foreign trade performance. Ford dominates the UK new vehicle market, accounting for 25 per cent of UK new car sales and nearly 45 per cent of light commercial vehicle sales. It is also the biggest vehicle maker in the UK ahead of Rover and Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US. Ford of Britain first moved into deficit in 1981, having been a significant positive contributor to the UK trade balance. After its deficit reached Pounds 676m in 1983 and Pounds 501m in 1984, the company stopped disclosing details of its trade balance in its annual report, and adopted the defensive policy of only revealing the value of its exports. It is understood that the deficit was more than Pounds 1bn a year in each of the five years from 1986 to 1990 and peaked at Pounds 1.4bn in 1989. The improvement last year was a key factor behind the sharp contraction in the overall UK motor industry trade deficit, which fell by 78.3 per cent to Pounds 1bn from Pounds 4.6bn in 1990 and a record deficit of Pounds 6.6bn in 1989. Ford of Britain's foreign trade performance deteriorated rapidly from 1988 to 1990, when imports of new vehicles from its continental European plants rose to meet record UK new vehicles demand. At the same time its UK vehicle output was hampered by serious labour conflicts in 1988 and 1990. The recession depressed the value of Ford of Britain's imports by 26.6 per cent last year to Pounds 2.48bn from Pounds 3.38bn in 1990. Its UK new car sales fell by 23.9 per cent to 385,944 from 507,260 a year earlier. The value of its exports rose to Pounds 2.27bn last year from Pounds 2.08bn in 1990. The underlying improvement in exports was in fact much greater, as the 1990 total included exports by Ford's UK tractor operations, which have since been sold to Fiat, the Italian automotive group. Excluding the tractor business, the value of Ford's UK exports of cars, commercial vehicles and components rose by around 40 per cent last year from Pounds 1.6bn in 1990. The most significant factor was rising foreign sales of its Fiesta small car, where exports accounted for more than 50 per cent of last year's output of 223,000. Ford's export performance was helped by a sharp improvement in industrial relations. The company said it recorded the lowest number of industrial disputes at its UK plants in 1991.</p>

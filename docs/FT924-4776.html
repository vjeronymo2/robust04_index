			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Gooda Names halt action group move ANGRY lossmaking Names at Lloyd's of London yesterday forced the withdrawal of proposals which could have earned hundreds of thousands of pounds for representatives pursuing legal action on their behalf. Some 500 people at a meeting of the Gooda Walker Names Action group approved legal action against 77 agents which placed them with the lossmaking Gooda Walker syndicates. About 2,000 Names will support the action. The Names, whose capital backs the insurance market, also agreed to raise Pounds 2.8m to pay for their legal fees in what could be a complex and long legal action. Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, chairman of the action group, bowed to overwhelming pressure from his members by agreeing to withdraw an 'incentive package' which could have been worth up to Pounds 300,000 for each of 12 members of the group's committee. The Names will seek to recover Pounds 248m in losses, about 10 per cent of the total suffered by Lloyd's as a whole in 1988 and 1989, in an action which will allege negligence by the agents. However Mr Doll-Stein-berg added that it would have been 'divisive' to put the plan to claim 'success fees' - which would have been separate from legal costs - for recovering losses to the meeting. 'There seems to be a certain groundswell,' said Mr Doll-Steinberg. 'The word obscene is being used over and over again. If you could find another epithet I'd be grateful.' He added that new proposals would be put to another meeting in January. 'I wish you would express your feelings equally strongly to the people who lost you the money in the first place,' he said. Although many Names accepted that committee members might need some remuneration, many questioned the scale of the promised success fees. 'Most people believe it is obscene that you should, having decided to serve on a voluntary basis, then ask for Pounds 300,000,' said Mr Claud Gurney. 'There is no point in appointing lawyers and then negotiating yourself,' another Name said. 'You are keeping a dog and barking yourself.' 'We're not against you, but the goalposts are being moved during the game,' added another Name, who said that the division would 'glad-den the hearts' of the members' agents against whom the Names were fighting. Earlier Mr Paul Marland, Conservative MP for Gloucestershire West, who was one of three new Gooda Walker Names elected to the action group's committee, said he was hopeful about the prospects for a negotiated settlement but that the group 'must arm itself. We intend to keep our legal tanks full of fuel.'</p>

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / People: Changeover at Maunders John Maunders, the Manchester-based housebuilder, has announced that it has replaced its group managing director - two months after the change was effected. Bill Bannister, 43, previously group sales and marketing director, took over as group md in November, while Bernard Davies, 56, who had been in the post for a decade, and with the company for 22 years, has left. Analysts says this was a succession that had been expected, but one that had been hastened by the need for a tough cost-cutter at the top. Traditionally, the northern base of the business has been highly profitable; it is in the south where margins have been under severe pressure in the past three or four years, and Bannister, managing director of the Southern division, is understood to have proved his mettle in this area. John Maunders, the 47-year-old chairman and grandson of the founder, is well aware of Davies' contribution, according to analysts, and his compensation package is understood to be in the region of Pounds 200,000.</p>

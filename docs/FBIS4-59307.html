			<p>BFN     [Text] Tahir al-Husami, head of the Foreign Ministry's  Department of International Organizations and Conferences, this  morning presented a Foreign Ministry statement to the [UN]  committee investigating Israeli violations of human rights in  the Golan and the occupied Arab territories. The committee is  led by Stanley Kalpage, Sri Lanka's ambassador to the United  Nations.    The statement notes that Israel used all sorts of methods  that violate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the  Geneva Conventions of 1949, and the Hague Conventions of 1907,  as well as international humanitarian law, in order to change  the identity of the territories and the people. Israel has also  used these methods in order to judaize these territories and  exploit their resources to plant settlements, settlers, and  military fortifications in order to exercise oppression,  repression, aggression, and expansion.    The statement says that, throughout the past few decades, it  has become clear to the entire world how Israel has been  destroying the villages and Arab features of the Golan, most  notably the city of al-Qunaytirah. The number of villages and  urban centers that have been wiped off the map has reached more  than 240. Moreover, the number of inhabitants of Syrian Golan  that have been displaced by Israel has reached more than 120,000  people. Israel has plundered these people's resources and  carried out a policy of removing the Arab identity of the  occupied Golan and of obliterating its Arab features.    The statement also notes the Israeli's repressive methods  and  hostile policies against the Syrian Arab inhabitants, which are  aimed at isolating them from their Arab surroundings and  imposing an Israeli identity on them. The statement also notes  the suffering of the inhabitants in terms of poverty and poor  living, health, and educational conditions, in addition to  fomenting sectarian hatred among the inhabitants.    The statement also notes that Israeli practices, which  violate the human rights of the Palestinian and other Arab  peoples in the occupied Arab territories, are a result of  Israel's occupation of the Arab territories since 1967. The  statement adds that Israel will not stop these practices unless  the Israeli occupation of these territories is removed.    In conclusion, the statement says that Syria has provided a  chance for a just and comprehensive peace that achieves Israeli  withdrawal from the Golan and the rest of the occupied Arab and  Palestinian territories and secures the Palestinian people's  rights to self-determination in implementation of UN resolutions  and international legitimacy. However, Israel is still  obstructing progress in the peace process.    Afterward, the committee met with a number of eyewitness  deportees from the occupied territories. Members of the  committee listened to the deportees' statements on Israeli  practices and the methods of interrogation and torture used by  the Israeli authorities against the Arab inhabitants. Moreover,  the committee was briefed on practices by Israeli authorities on  how the citizens are deported.</p>

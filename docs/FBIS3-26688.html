A  Government spokesman said Hong Kong would accept Chinese Joint  Liaison Group (JLG) team leader Guo Fengmin's offer of expert  discussions to pave the way for a full meeting of the JLG's  airport committee.    Britain has been pushing for such talks -- to resolve  differences over land issues -- for several months. It also  wants the airport committee to meet to discuss a new funding  package for the project. Deputy British JLG team leader Alan  Paul is expected to discuss the offer with his Chinese  counterpart Hu Houcheng later this week.    Mr. Guo said on Friday an airport committee session was now  "inevitable" and that experts from both sides should "meet and  exchange views to pave the way" for it. His comments  constituted China's first official confirmation it wants to  discuss the Government's recent fourth financial package for the  Chek Lap Kok project and rail link, which proposes pumping more  than $60 billion of public funding into the two schemes.    "We agree with Mr. Guo's statement that a meeting of the  airport committee should take place and we hope that this can be  arranged as soon as possible to resolve outstanding issues on  airport and airport railway funding," a Government spokesman  said yesterday. "In the meantime we are, of course, willing to  hold expert talks to help pave the way for what we hope will be  an early agreement."    Legislator and Airport Consultative Committee (ACC) members  welcomed the news and hoped both sides could reach a  comprehensive agreement on financial issues. "This is a good  news," said ACC member Ho King-on. "The expert meeting may be  able to narrow the differences between two sides."    United Democrats legislator Chan Wai-yip also welcomed the  possible resumption of talks, even though he expressed concern  that the latest financial package might tax the Hong Kong  Government's reserves. He said the Government needed to revise  its estimates for revenue from 62 hectares of airport land  sales, saying these should have been higher. He added that the  amount should be enough to pay government equity and thereby  eliminate the need to draw money from the reserve. But the  legislator argued these issues would not seriously inhibit the  talks, referring to them as "technical problems" only.    Another ACC member, Anthony Cheung Bing-leung, urged both  sides to treasure the new co-operative atmosphere. "If the  British and Chinese really want to negotiate, they should make  the best use of this opportunity before another major political  dispute rises again in March -- when the Governor tables the  second part of his political package in the Legislative  Council," he said.</p>

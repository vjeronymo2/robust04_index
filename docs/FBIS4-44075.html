			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Greek Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros </F> Pangalos at Corfu news conference at the end of the EU summit at  the Municipal Theater in Corfu--live]    [Text] If you will allow me, Mr. Prime Minister, I will  summarize rather than repeat what you and European Commission  President Jacques Delors mentioned concerning the white paper.  I believe it has been agreed to give a new push to all the  important issues that were noted by the Greek Presidency and  were included in the agenda. This concerns unemployment, as a  main problem of the European economy, particularly unemployment  of the youth and long-term unemployment. This concerns small-  and medium-sized businesses and their capability to incorporate  modern technology, contribute in the labor sector, and encourage  local development activities.    As you know, we have adopted the 11 projects of the  transportation sector in order of priority. These include the  Egnatia highway and the Patrai-Athens-Thessaloniki highway that  are especially important for our country.    Finally, we agreed with promoting a society of information,  with new possibilities that open up due to the importation of  modern telecommunications technology, development, employment,  and improved quality of life.    Regarding the EU prospects, a group has been formed to  prepare the intergovernment conference of 1996. As you know  this was a Greek proposal. Because of this proposal, a  compromise has been achieved in Ioannina that made the EU  expansion possible for four new countries. The group will begin  its work on 2 June 1995. This is the day that the Mersin  conference convened. This way, we ratify our old position about  a new Mersin. We have proposed this in our previous  presidential term. Spain--which will hold the EU presidency  during that period--will preside over the conference. The  conference will also include--this was another goal of the Greek  Presidency that was accepted by all Council members with a  promise to the European Parliament--two representatives of the  European Parliament who will participate in the group.    We agreed in taking action in the domestic and justice  sectors against racism and fear of foreigners. There is a  specific action plan. We also agreed to combat crime and drugs.  Finally, we have adopted a text for the countries that are  possible EU members. On Cyprus we went a step forward,  stressing that the next EU expansion phase will include both  Cyprus and Malta. It is the first time that Cyprus and Malta  are included in the overall expansion chapter and their fate is  linked to the expansion course. The expression on Cyprus  disengages the accession course from the Cyprus issue. Of  course there is a separate reference on this.    Finally, I would like to mention as briefly as possible the  decisions made on EU foreign policy. We agreed to develop our  relations with the Mediterranean countries, and we will examine  the possibility of convening a conference between the EU and the  Mediterranean countries. This is a significant push to the EU's  Mediterranean policy.    We will also continue the efforts for peace in the Middle  East, particularly reinforcing the Palestinian entities in the  occupied Israeli areas. We call upon the Commission to make as  many proposals as possible for agreements with East and West  European countries and the Baltic states. We asked Russia to  withdraw its troops by 31 August, and we asked Latvia to  reconsider its immigration law in a way that it will not create  problems in the protection of human rights. We intend to  promote the decisions that we have made within the framework of  the stability treaty, which followed the Paris Conference on  Security and Stability.    We condemn the genocide in Rwanda and preannounce that we  will take action to protect the country's population. Regarding  South Africa, we will continue our work to restore economic and  political relations with the entire region, particularly the new  South African Republic where a regime of freedom and personal  rights exists.    Regarding Ukraine, we decided specifically on the amounts  that we intend to contribute to permanently close the Chernobyl  nuclear reactor. We expressed our concern for North Korea's  policy and we asked this country to respond to its obligations.  We have expressed our satisfaction for the democratization  developments and the protection of human rights that have been  noted recently in Latin America.    We have adopted guidelines for joint activity in the 1995  conference for the renewal of the nondistribution of nuclear  weapons agreement. Therefore, the community will undertake an  activity--something that it did not have--on the nondistribution  of nuclear weapons. This is a new chapter. Finally, we called  upon all sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina to show political will to  resolve the problem and ratify as soon as possible the statement  of intention so that the European Union may take control of  Mostar. We also intend to contribute to the reconstruction of  Bosnia-Herzegovina as soon as conditions allow it.</p>

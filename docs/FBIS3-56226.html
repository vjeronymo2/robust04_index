In an interview with Asket [name as received] cable  television on Thursday, Lebed brushed off accusations that his  "troops are worsening the economic crisis in the Dniester  Republic" as groundless. Many blame the soldiers who are paid  in new Russian roubles for the low buying power of the local  population. The soldiers exchange their money for old Soviet  banknotes which are the only legal tender in the republic on the  black market at a very high exchange rate.    Lebed also accused the authorities of the Dniester Republic  of misappropriations. He stressed that over 11 billion roubles  are used annually to keep the bureaucratic apparatuses and  servicing personnel of Dniester leaders, as well as finance the  studying of their children and relatives abroad.    He blasted Dniester officials for abusing their powers and  offices and neglecting the needs of the people.</p>

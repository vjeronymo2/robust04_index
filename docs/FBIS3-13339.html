			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Loss of Face in Geneva"] </F>   [Text] We have done it again. The much publicised  initiative to seek international censure of human rights abuses  in the Indian held Kashmir has been for the second time in quick  succession held back at the eleventh hour. First it was the  Indian offer of talks on Kashmir, and now the intervention of 16  countries, including our close allies Iran and China that has  apparently deterred Islamabad from going whole hog in pursuit of  its number one agenda in foreign relations. Ironically, the  prime minister had only a few days ago asserted in categorical  terms that come what may, Pakistan will go ahead with its  campaign for international recognition of the Kashmir cause, and  the 'game of numbers' will not stand in its way. Whether it was  an outright foreign policy debacle, as the Opposition would  insist or a tactical retreat dictated by the compulsion of  circumstances, as is likely to be offered as an alibi by the  Foreign Office, Islamabad, to say the least, has been guilty of  gross miscalculation in Geneva. And the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs should be made accountable for misleading the government  and the people about the success of our campaign to win  international support. No matter what diplomatic jargon has  been used to describe our unceremonious retreat, we have, for  all practical purposes, withdrawn our resolution from the Human  Rights Commission. And whether we like it or not New Delhi has  scored a major propaganda victory. Foreign Minister Asif Ahmad  Ali's contention that the objective to highlight Kashmir has  been achieved and 'it has been a great victory for Pakistan  since the resolution remains alive' simply does not hold and is  certainly not good enough to explain away the failure of our  initiatives on Kashmir. Perhaps it is time to review the entire  gamut of our Kashmir strategy and withhold any fresh moves until  we have undertaken a thorough stocktaking of our track record.  It is of utmost importance that we should have the insight to  discern where we had gone wrong in our understanding of world  politics, and whether it was our lack of comprehension, or  misplaced optimism on the righteousness of our cause. Is accent  on human rights abuses a viable strategy to draw world attention  to the Kashmir cause?    If the Americans have chosen to project themselves as the  custodians of human rights, it does not mean that they are no  longer selective in their concern for human rights abuses, and  are ready for an even-handed approach to deal with all victims  of repression. So is the case with their European allies who  couldn't care less for rape, torture and mass killings let loose  on Bosnian Muslims. We have to sooner than later clearly  identify our `constituency' in the international arena and  design our moves to cater for their sensibilities. The third  world countries do not in any case have an enviable human rights  record, whether it is China or Iran or the vast majority of OIC  countries. Human rights is not the kind of issue on which  Pakistan can hope to muster support for the Kashmir cause,  particularly when the US is trying to browbeat them on this  score. In the wake of the embarrassment we have suffered and  the despondency it may cause among the Kashmiri  freedom-fighters, it would be in the fitness of things to weigh  our gains and losses in foreign policy. Had we gone through  with the vote would we be closer to our goal today? Would the  world have rallied to our call of liberation of Kashmir, or  would it have turned its back on us, as it seems to have done  now?</p>

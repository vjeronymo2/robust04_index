			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> D.A. CANCELS INQUIRY OF ALLEGED COUNCIL BRIBE STATEMENT BY LOBBYIST  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County district attorney's office dropped its review Thursday  of a lobbyist's statement that two council members asked for contributions in  exchange for scheduling a hearing for her clients, saying there was no evidence  to warrant further investigation.  </P> <P> Assistant Dist. Atty. Curt Livesay said he closed the review of the matter  after the lobbyist, Ann Carlton Bose, contradicted her initial account in a  Thursday interview with investigators, telling them that she "never viewed the  matter as a bribe or soliciting a bribe."  </P> <P> "There's not enough to warrant an investigation," Livesay said.  </P> <P> Neither Bose nor her attorney, Charles English, could be reached for comment.  </P> <P> According to Bose's initial account, delivered in interviews last Friday with  KNBC and The Times, she had tried unsuccessfully for four months last year to  get a hearing before the Transportation and Traffic Committee, which Councilman  Nate Holden chairs.  </P> <P> Bose said that finally she called council President John Ferraro for help in  persuading Holden. Ferraro called back, Bose said, and told her Holden said he  would schedule the hearing if Bose's clients supported Ferraro's next  fund-raiser.  </P> <P> The lobbyist then wrote a letter to her clients relating the conversation.  Publication of the letter prompted the review by the district attorney's  office.  </P> <P> Livesay said that in the interview with investigators, Bose contradicted her  letter.  </P> <P> "She did say that she never took Councilman Ferraro seriously," Livesay said.  </P> <P> Bose told investigators that Ferraro simply reminded her that the ambulance  companies that she represents were his supporters.  </P> <P> "It's fair to say that what she said contradicts what the letter says," Livesay  added. "She never took Ferraro seriously when he made comments more than a year  ago."  </P> <P> Bose also told investigators that the letter was a draft that was not intended  to be mailed, but that she inadvertently failed to review it before it was sent  out to clients. Bose did not personally sign the letter before it was sent out.  Her signature was instead signed by a secretary, who had permission to file the  signature.  </P> <P> Holden said he would talk to his lawyer, Gloria Allred, before deciding whether  to drop a civil suit alleging libel and slander that he filed Monday against  Bose and her employer, Devon Blaine and The Blaine Group.  </P> <P> "Hell, I never said it!" he said angrily.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Continuing Doubts  </P> <P> Holden earlier this week said he considered the allegation by Bose to be an  "intentional" attack on his integrity. On Thursday, he indicated continuing  doubts about the newest Bose account.  </P> <P> Ferraro, in a statement issued by his council office, thanked the district  attorney's office for acting "in a timely manner."  </P> <P> "But the ultimate action was what I expected," he added. " I am not surprised  because I knew all along there was no substance to the allegations.  Unfortunately, when people make irresponsible statements of this kind, it  tarnishes the image of all elected officials."  </P> <P> Livesay said Bose was the only person interviewed by the district attorney's  office during its review.  </P> <P> "She was the only witness, as the ostensible writer of the letter," he said.  </P> <P> No charges are anticipated against Bose or others as a result of the flap,  Livesay added.  </P> <P> "I don't see in the context of all these events any crime that's been  committed," he said.  </P></p>

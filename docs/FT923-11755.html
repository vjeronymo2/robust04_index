			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: UK market While yesterday's further slump in UK equities confirmed that the post-election rally has been wholly reversed, it was also a reminder that the market's preoccupations are not primarily domestic at all. Throughout most of the day the UK market followed the European average, scarcely pausing to acknowledge that the UK trade and retail sales figures were just as expected. Yesterday's worst-hit UK stocks were generally those with high borrowings. But while the UK money market continues to discount a quarter point rise in interest rates, it is striking that there is no immediate pressure on sterling within the ERM. The worry is rather that the system's members are still under general pressure to raise rates in line with Germany. More parochially, there is still pressure on UK institutional cash flow from government funding. But this would not matter if the institutions did not perceive gilts as inherently more attractive than equities. At the margin, it would help a lot if the dollar were to revive further and Tokyo were to stop hitting fresh lows. But it will take more than that for equities to return to fashion.</p>

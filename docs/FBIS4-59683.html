			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "'Ali Nasir Denies Alignment With </F> 'Ali Salih and Considers His Supporters' Acceptance of Posts To  Be a Personal Decision"]    [Text] London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- The former (south)  Yemeni President ['Ali Nasir Muhammad] has denied any connection  with President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's recent decisions in Sanaa  appointing a new defense minister and a new naval forces  commander, both from the military commands which had seceded  with 'Ali Nasir from the regime which ruled south Yemen before  the unity, in the 13 January 1986 incidents. He said that 'Ali  Nasir is "for national unity and Yemeni unity."    This came in an exclusive telephone statement to AL-SHARQ  AL-AWSAT from his residence in Damascus, reacting to Yemeni and  Arab claims that the appointment of Staff Brigadier General  'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur as defense minister after Sanaa's dismissal  of Defense Minister Staff Brigadier General Haytham Qasim Tahir,  who belongs to the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], and the  appointment of Colonel Ahmad 'Abdallah al-Hasani as naval forces  commander, were made in the context of a new alliance between  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali Nasir to strike at the YSP in the  south by using southern elements.    'Ali Nasir wondered why these speculations were made now and  why there were no speculations about coordination between him  and the YSP when 10 men formerly loyal to him joined the party a  few weeks ago. Ten other supporters of 'Ali Nasir, he said, are  members of General People's Congress [GPC] leaderships. He said  that the GPC and the YSP had "shared power, wealth, and the band  [al-zumrah]."    It is worth noting that, during the 1986 incidents, the wing  loyal to 'Ali Nasir was called the "band" and the wing including  the current YSP leaders was known as the "clique" [al-Tughmah].  The sides called each other by these names.    The former president said that acceptance of an appointment  to any post in the Yemeni state is a personal decision by the  individual concerned. "When 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali Salim  al-Bid joined hands against us, we dissolved our own party." He  stressed that "'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali Salim al-Bid are  responsible for what is taking place in Yemen."    He stressed that a distinction should be made between the  position he insists upon, meaning that he "only supports Yemen's  unity and is not aligned with any other party," and the  positions of others "who are divided between the YSP and the GPC  as it has become a matter of personal choice" since the latter  part of 1989 when serious preparations began for Yemen's unity.    AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has also obtained a statement issued by  'Ali Nasir saying that he is "deeply pained by what is going on  in Yemen, the war and the infighting to the detriment of  national unity and Yemeni unity, destroying the Yemeni people's  achievements for which the people struggled for over 30 years."    He reaffirmed his support for the efforts made for the  preservation of unity and the settlement of disputes and  political conflicts through dialogue and peaceful means. He has  done and continues to do everything in his power to settle the  dispute between the two sides through a number of initiatives  this year and last year. He had earlier warned and expressed  fear that the differences and conflicts between the three  members of the ruling coalition could develop into a fire that  would burn the unity.    He added that "any efforts made or solutions proposed must  be  based on the preservation of Yemen's unity, not on a return to  the borders which existed before 22 May 1990."    He also announced that he is "holding consultations with  some  Yemeni figures who have not been involved in the conflict with a  view to a new initiative for the settlement of the Yemeni  crisis."</p>

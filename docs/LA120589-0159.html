			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> TURNER BLAMED FOR NO POWER  </P> <P> Five families who live without electricity near Ted Turner's 8,100-acre  plantation say they want the broadcasting executive to allow power lines to  cross his property to their homes.  </P> <P> Dressie Sloan of the Jefferson County National Assn. for the Advancement of  Colored People accused Turner of trying to get rid of his poor neighbors by  refusing to extend the electric lines.  </P> <P> "One word from Mr. Turner, and they'd have their lights," Sloan told the  Tallahassee Democrat on Sunday. But Avalon Plantation Manager George Purvis  said Turner was only complying with a former owner's restrictions.  </P> <P> "Mr. Turner has never tried to get those people to move out," Purvis told the  newspaper. "But Mrs. (Alexandra) McKay thought an above-ground wire would  destroy the national beauty of her land."  </P> <P> But even if Turner did approve the extension, Purvis said he wondered who would  foot the bill. A power line from the plantation's terminal to the houses would  cost at least $40,000, according to a manager for Tri-County Electric  Cooperative.  </P></p>

			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Greeks wrestle with the ins and out of banking: Turbulence in financial markets has led to some unorthodox limits on withdrawal of funds Just before closing time in a crowded National Bank of Greece branch in central Athens, the cashier shouted: 'Will anybody with a deposit to make please come to the head of the queue.' Two people in a line of 30 customers walked forward, each clutching a single cheque. Conserving funds at a time of financial turmoil, the bank was willing to give priority service for any customer willing to make a deposit. The call for depositors at National's branch in Skoufa Street has echoed in banks across Athens as turbulence in Greece's financial markets moved beyond dealing rooms and into the streets. Bank customers complained that withdrawal slips had suddenly disappeared from local branches. They also said some 24-hour automated teller machines had been unplugged by midnight - just the hour that Greeks planning a plate-smashing session at a bouzouki club are looking for extra cash. The unorthodox limits on withdrawals have come in the wake of moves by the socialist government, to avert a devaluation of the drachma. It has lifted short-term interest rates as high as 500 per cent and, with overnight inter-bank borrowing rates averaging more than 200 per cent last week, branch managers were determined to conserve funds. Following the lifting of capital controls this month, Greek businessmen can now take abroad as much foreign currency as they want, but there are now few dollars or D-Marks to be found in Athens. One clothing trader complained: 'On Friday, it took a trip around seven banks in the centre of town to collect DM1,500.' The National Bank, the largest commercial bank, which has about 35 per cent of total deposits in Greek banks, should be immune from pressure. However, it told some customers last week that they would withdraw no more than 50 per cent on money deposited last week. It also refused to open new corporate accounts and was charging interest rates at an annual rate of 150 per cent on one-week loans, which are generally used by small businesses to cover payroll costs at the end of the month. However, the banks complain that some company treasurers were quick to exploit the surge in short-term money market rates by raising additional loans and exploiting interest rate differences. These were used to buy repos  -fixed-term repurchase agreements - from other banks, at interest rates ranging from 55 to 90 per cent. 'This week we've been looking very carefully at loan requests, even from our best customers,' said one banker. Consumer lending, on the rise since the socialists tried in February to inject some life into the economy by raising the ceiling on consumer credit to Dr8m (Pounds 21,500), has collapsed as a result of the surge in interest rates. Greece's smaller private banks, generally run by shipowners or insurance companies, specialise in devising imaginative loan products, and are suffering under the weight of interest rates. 'What looked like a promising market has died,' said a car dealer, whose hire-purchase network is linked with a bank's consumer lending programme. 'There's no way anyone can risk offering an instalment agreement in this climate.' The rise in short-term interest rates will be reflected in government borrowing from this week. New issues will include a one-month zero-coupon bond at 27 per cent, restricted to investors who can put up a minimum of Dr15m and a three-month treasury bill at 25.5 per cent, up from 16.5 per cent last month. While the new bond issues should attract large cash inflows for financing the public sector deficit, the cost to the government will include further losses in VAT revenues as companies postpone payments. VAT revenue is running at only 3 per cent above last year against a budget target of 22 per cent. 'Companies are preparing to postpone their VAT payments in order to take advantage of high interest rates for repos and treasury bills,' said one analyst. High rates are also the socialists' main weapon in the battle to prevent a flight of capital, now that the last capital restrictions have been removed. However, the lifting of restrictions has been accompanied by a web of bureaucratic regulations likely to make transfers abroad will be complicated and time-consuming.</p>

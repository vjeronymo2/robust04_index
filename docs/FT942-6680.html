			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Survey of Residential Property (2): Paying for prestige and a room with a view - New York / For many New Yorkers west is now best. Frank McGurty explains why In a city of densely packed spires, the desirability of a residence is defined as much by its view as by its street address. In New York, apartments with sweeping vistas of Central Park or the East River still command the highest premiums. The new owner of a 10-room penthouse at Fifth Avenue and 86th Street, one of the most prestigious corners on Manhattan's posh upper east side, can gaze out at both these celebrated sights, and he paid dearly for the privilege. The 4,700 sq ft residence, occupying the entire 20th floor of a newly renovated building, recently sold for Dollars 5.05m (Pounds 3.45m). It was one of the highest prices paid for a New York apartment since the end of the property boom five years ago. The penthouse is elegantly appointed, to be sure, with its four spacious bedrooms, mahogany-panelled library and marble bathrooms equipped with oversized whirlpools. But so are thousands of less expensive accommodations in New York. What sets the place apart, then? 'Quite simply, the views are spectacular,' says Jack Heller, a principal in Heller Macaulay Equities, which developed the property. The sale price underscores how far the market has progressed since a tentative recovery began two years ago. Prices for the most luxurious flats and townhouses are steadily climbing and activity is picking up pace. One leading Manhattan estate agency, Ambrose MarElia, recorded 26 town house sales in the last three months of 1993, at an average price of Dollars 1.68m (Pounds 1.15m) against 17 sales in the final 1992 quarter, at about Dollars 1.3m each. 'With fewer choice properties being offered for sale right now,' says Joan Ambrose, who runs the company, '1994 is going to usher in a seller's market.' On the lower end, buyers are still dictating the market and prices continue to slip. But across the spectrum, the rise in US interest rates has pushed many prospective buyers off the fence out of fear that financing will become even more expensive as the year progresses. 'People are always afraid of being left behind. It's a wonderful motivator,' says Barbara Corcoran, head of the Corcoran Group, another leading New York realtor. Sales at Corcoran are up 40 per cent this quarter. Overall, the average price of a smart Manhattan apartment held fairly steady at Dollars 84,920 a room in the six months to the end of 1993, in sharp contrast with the trend during the 1989-91 recession, when prices plunged by 30 per cent. The bulk of Corcoran's sales, which tend to be at the top end, were in the Dollars 400,000 to Dollars 1.2m range. A one-bedroom flat on Horatio Street in Greenwich Village is fairly typical. The 'sparkling and spacious' 900 sq ft apartment, half way between midtown and Wall Street, was recently advertised in The New York Times at Dollars 185,000. A 1,800 sq ft, three-bedroom residence, near the Museum of Natural History on the upper west side, was listed at Dollars 399,000. Buyers last year were able to haggle down the price by about 18 per cent on average; fewer than 5 per cent pay the full fare. On the rental side, meanwhile, the upturn in sales and a dearth of new construction has created a supply crunch. With more people looking to buy, those who want to move house are no longer faced with the choice of renting out their properties or leaving them vacant. As a consequence, leasing is more expensive, whether for a modest studio near Times Square or a posh four-bedroom on Park Avenue. Still, where you are located in New York is nearly as important as what you can see out of your window. 'The closer you move towards Central Park - from both sides, east and west - the higher the price,' says Nancy Packes, head of Feathered Nest, one of the largest rental agencies in Manhattan. How much can a newcomer expect to shell out? On average, a one-bedroom flat rents for Dollars 1,550 a month, a two-bedroom Dollars 2,350 and a three-bedroom about Dollars 3,800. For posh apartments in prime locations, a one bedroom will command Dollars 2,500-Dollars 3,500, a two bedroom Dollars 4,000-Dollars 6,000 and a three bedroom up to Dollars 10,000 a month, whether on the east side or west. For many New Yorkers, however, west is now best. The area bounded by the park and the Hudson River, between 60th and 110th streets, has become the neighbourhood of the 1990s, especially among those with children. 'It is basically a revolt against the values of the 1980s,' explains Packes. 'The west side represents old-time values - it's things remembered.' When today's down-home west-siders were the young financial hotshots of the 1980s, they may have preferred the east side's thrusting glass towers and the noisy night spots crowded along First and Second avenues. Now they most often opt for the stately pre-war apartment blocks off Broadway and Columbus Avenue, and easy access to grocery stores and other 'neighbourhood' shops clustered in the area. 'The east side is Gucci; the west side is Baby Gap,' explains one lifelong New Yorker. The fresh demand is reflected in the price, of course. A new lease on a one-bedroom flat on, say, West End Avenue cost 10.6 per cent more in 1993 than the year before, according to Feathered Nest, which conducts on annual survey of the market. On the east side, a similar flat off First Avenue commanded just 5.9 per cent more in 1992. Another favourite with families is TriBeCa, a surprise perhaps for those who remember the 'Triangle Below Canal' Street as a factory and warehouse district that was deserted after dark. Like SoHo, the section 'South of Houston' and above Canal, many of TriBeCa's old industrial buildings have been converted into residential 'lofts', which often feature acres of space and loads of lights. 'Whether people admit it or not,' says Corcoran, 'light is their number one concern when looking for a place to live.' Unlike SoHo, TriBeCa is not choked with galleries, wine bars and upmarket boutiques. Instead, it boasts one of the best government-supported schools in the city. Battery Park, a few blocks away on the island's southern tip, has one of the popular playgrounds in New York. 'TriBeCa is a small town, Manhattan style,' the broker says. For many New Yorkers, that kind of ambience is worth much more than a spectacular view of Central Park.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Urban Development (4): Even the unsuccessful value the contacts made - In reviewing the achievements of City Challenge, Andrew Adonis finds that it has not entirely silenced its critics CITY CHALLENGE is the government's flagship programme for urban regeneration. Launched by Mr Michael Heseltine, in his second stint at the Environment Department between the end of 1990 and this year's general election, it has now gone through two rounds, embraces 30 of England's 57 urban priority areas (UPAs), and will consume more than Pounds 1bn of central government urban programme funding over the next six years, around a sixth of the total. 'City Challenge is about vision, quality, partnership and expecting local authorities to lead their communities with flair and imagination,' declared Mr Heseltine, announcing the first-round winners last year. In more concrete terms, four principles underlie City Challenge. They are that: Local authorities should work with their local business and voluntary sectors in forming and implementing regeneration plans; Government funding for urban regeneration should be used as 'leverage' for contributions from the private sector and other public bodies; Councils should prioritise their aspirations and give real impetus to the most urgent; Long-term funding should be available to see projects through to completion, freeing regeneration projects from the tyranny of the annual public spending round. Most City Challenge winners have chosen to manage implementation through an arm's-length company broadly representative of the main development partners. This is not a requirement of the scheme, but is looked upon favourably by ministers. To give an edge to the process, City Challenge was designed as a competition, forcing councils to bid against each other for available funds. The 'losers', it was hoped, would gain tips from the 'winners', so that they could win on the next round. Since virtually all the 57 eligible authorities are Labour-controlled, the room for political favouritism is limited - and appears to have played little part in deciding the winners. City Challenge was greeted with near universal cynicism by councillors in the UPAs, but it now receives endorsements (albeit qualified) from surprising quarters. Few council leaders deny the value of contacts and efforts made in preparing City Challenge bids. Many of them also appreciate the spin-offs, not least the regular bringing together of ministers and Labour councillors to discuss objectives and problems, one aspect of the steadily improving relationship between central and local government. 'Now I feel I can get on the phone to Redwood (the local government minister) to talk things over,' says one London borough leader, not noted for cordiality towards Tory politicians. Labour objects to the competitive bidding element, 'losing' councils protesting loudest. There is also concern at the inflexibility of the scheme: all winners in the first two rounds got Pounds 37.5m over five years, whether Barnsley or Birmingham, and they are were required to show a 'leverage ratio' of government to private and other public funding of at least 3:1 to stand a chance of winning. The greatest source of complaint, however, is the way City Challenge is resourced - by 'top slicing' of funds, mainly from the four main existing urban programmes. For losers in both rounds to date, notably cities like Bristol, Leeds and Sheffield, the grant implications are alarming. They could become more serious still if, as rumoured, urban funding suffers in this autumn's public spending round, because existing City Challenge funding is guaranteed to winners in the first two rounds regardless of future cuts to the budgets from which they are drawn. Such cuts could also put paid to the third round of City Challenge, currently pencilled in for 1994. 'If there isn't enough cash for at least 15 winners, it won't be worth doing,' says one insider. 'To offer five or six would look ridiculous.' Projects funded in the first two rounds fall broadly into three categories: those for run-down areas of cities, aiming to link them in to their local economies (like Birmingham's Newtown project); those for redeveloping other areas of cities, linking projects in to neighbouring areas of deprivation (like Nottingham's plans to relocate the Sneiton wholesale market to release the site for office, retail and workspace); and 'single town' bids, where Pounds 37.5m plus leverage ought to enable a medium-sized town at least to tackle most of its urban problems. The second-round awards to Kirklees (for Keighley), Sunderland, Stockton and Hartlepool fall into this last category. Taking the two rounds and all the bids together, how is the initiative developing? Mr Chris Griffin, of Victor Hausner Associates, which advises the Environment Department on City Challenge, sees a 'significant advance in understanding by councils as to what is wanted'. This is evidenced, he argues, partly in their selection of development areas and partly in the quality of their proposed partnerships with the voluntary and business sectors. 'There is much more local analysis and prioritisation, and much heavier involvement by the other partners,' he says. 'The second-round winners took on board better than the first the need for an integrated strategy rather than just a shopping list of worthwhile projects with 'hopefully' written by the side.' Nonetheless, Mr Griffin believes that greater effort is needed to develop indigenous industries, and he describes many of the estimates of income to be 'leveraged' from the private sector as 'little more than fingers in the wind.' He is careful to add, though, that where there is no a single large developer with the necessary land - as with the Derby and Nottingham schemes  -it is difficult to be more precise. Studies of the respective success of winners in realising their projected 'leverage' will make important reading in a few years' time. More immediately pressing for the winners is establishing their executive teams and local companies, and getting their projects and partners finalised and signed up. As for the losers, Mr Michael Howard, the new environment secretary, claims that the experience of applying alone will bear fruit. 'The map plan unsuccessful authorities have drawn up will provide a focus for future development of their area, and may be used as a basis to make progress through private and public funding of some initiatives.' 'Weasel words: in reality, it's cuts all round,' says the Association of Metropolitan Authorities. Much depends on whether or not there is a round three. If there is, the main losers in the second round will make herculean efforts not to lose out again (as did Birmingham when it lost the first time); and ministers will be under pressure not to award two pots of gold to the same authority. None of the winners in round one won in round two.</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Every day is Clinton's D-Day: Misgivings as the US president visits Europe This ought to have been one of Bill Clinton's easier trips abroad. When he made his maiden presidential voyage to Europe in January, he was a man with a discernible and difficult mission - to set Nato on a new path and to stiffen the forces of reform in Russia - and at least he achieved mixed results. This time, nothing on the agendas with the Italian, British and French governments, and even the Pope, compares in weightiness, unless it be Bosnia. Instead, his principal purpose is ceremonial, to represent his country at the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Normandy landings. But there is an edgy sense of foreboding in the Clinton camp about the week that began in Rome with his arrival early today and will involve hopping back and forth across the English Channel. This president has a multitude of problems on his back. His poll ratings have started to slip again, a White House aide has resigned for improper use of a presidential helicopter, his personal life and character are under legal and populist attack, his foreign policy (on his own admission) is subject to 'relentless criticism', and the centrepiece of his domestic programme, healthcare reform, has just been deprived of the full services of Congressman Dan Rostenkowski. The last thing Mr Clinton needs in these circumstances is a foreign foray that can be portrayed as a foul-up by increasingly hostile US media eager to pounce on any pratfall. In this respect, the ceremonial aspects of this visit are the most fraught with danger. To put it crudely, the concern is whether Mr Clinton - who never served in uniform, was born three years after D-Day and opposed the Vietnam conflict - can play the public part of commander-in-chief as well as did President Reagan on the Normandy beaches 10 years ago, even though he fought the last war in the studios of Hollywood. Late changes in Mr Clinton's itinerary demonstrate high sensitivity by White House planners. His first British landfall is to be at Cambridge, where there is a US military cemetery, not, as first intended, at Oxford, from where in 1969 he wrote his famous letter explaining why he did not want to be drafted. Every move he makes will be watched for signs of unease or disaffection between him and the old soldiers gathered to celebrate a great expedition; Mr Clinton's natural milieu is not that of men in uniform, nor do such men mix easily with him. The White House is also patently nervous about his treatment in the British press, particularly its lurid emphasis, far greater than most of its US counterparts, on the sexual harassment suit against him. Aides recently surveyed several weeks of UK cuttings and found virtually nothing positive. They fear an eruption of bimbo stories while Mr Clinton is in Britain - but at least they now accept that would not be orchestrated by Conservative Party central office. Even the session with the Pope today is not risk-free from a media standpoint. Mr Reagan was once able to nod off with impunity in a Vatican exchange but the pontiff is expected this time to complain loudly about US abortion policies, specifically the more liberal approach the US is recommending for adoption at the UN population conference in Cairo in September. The nuances of any presidential meeting with new neo-fascist members of the Berlusconi government of Italy will also be closely watched. Beyond the particular and the ceremonial, Mr Clinton must have a broader purpose in all his public comments while in Europe - which is to give a sense that he does have a coherent foreign policy. Mr Henry Kissinger, whose own reputation for a cool, calm and collected strategic vision has just taken a fearsome battering in H R Haldeman's diaries of the first Nixon presidential term, was still able to write, in the current Newsweek magazine, in terms that resonate in Washington and around the world. 'Will we be driven to decisions in a way that makes us appear weak and rudderless - and tempts intransigent foreign leaders to test us - or can we formulate a basis of US policy that allows us to anticipate the challenges of the new international situation before they erupt into crisis? Most of the administration's shortcomings are remediable  .. but answering that basic question requires more discipline, organisation and focus than has been demonstrated so far.' Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, chairman of the Senate armed services committee, was more to the point. Mr Clinton 'is involving himself more, and that is essential. But we expect too much of the president .. If he's not going to spend a great deal of time on foreign policy he's got to designate one person to be in charge - and that hasn't happend yet.' The target of both was Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, now under fire yet again for what is seen as bungling of policy on China. But the president told the Los Angeles Times last Friday: 'The last thing I need to be doing is considering changing my team.' Mr Christopher is going to be doing most of the technical heavy lifting on this European trip, after Mr Clinton has returned home, at ministerial meetings of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Nato and the North Atlantic Co-operation Council on three consecutive days. To be fair, Mr Clinton, whose decision-making processes can be as agonisingly slow as his mind and mouth can be fast and loose, recognises the problem - 'lack of confidence in me,' he told the Los Angeles Times. He has also begun to speak more frequently about the US role in the world - on Monday, for example, equating past sacrifices and present challenges. Clear contradictions persist, even so. The recent presidential directive on peace-keeping was more intent on defining where US troops would not be used rather than where they might. Yet the administration seems to be now investigating an invasion of Haiti, mostly on the grounds that it is in the US backyard and because the domestic pressure for intervention has been rising. If US critics are frustrated, and if the Senate is so confused that it passes contradictory motions on the Bosnian arms embargo, it is hardly surprising that a rudderless Europe, accustomed to the lead and protection of the US, wonders what to expect. Presidential foreign trips are usually good for domestic ratings. But, this time, Mr Clinton had better not put even the occasional foot wrong on a beach, in a pub, or in palaces and boats beyond number.</p>

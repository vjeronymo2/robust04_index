			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HARVEST OF THE OCEAN GARDEN;  </P> <P> AGRICULTURE: PICTURESQUE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COASTAL WATERS PROVIDE SOME  ATYPICAL FARMERS WITH AN ALMOST LIMITLESS BOUNTY: SEAWEED.  </P> <P> Vegetable farmers John Lewallen and his wife, Eleanor, harvest their crops in  the intertidal waters of the Pacific Ocean at a picturesque, remote cove  studded with rock outcroppings.  </P> <P> Their briny farm yields wild sea vegetables -- seaweed -- handpicked in  hard-to-reach coves and bays along a 40-mile stretch of rugged Northern  California coast.  </P> <P> The small town of Mendocino is the West Coast center of the esoteric sea  vegetable industry, which supports three little companies whose combined yearly  sales are less than $75,000.  </P> <P> The Lewallens harvest a dozen different species of edible seaweed, which they  rinse in fresh water, dry on lines in the open air, package and sell through  the mail and at health food stores across America.  </P> <P> Gross sales for the Lewallens' 9-year-old Mendocino Sea Vegetable Co., operated  out of their home in nearby Navarro, totaled $36,000 this year, their best on  record.  </P> <P> The two other companies, Ocean Harvest Sea Vegetable and Rising Tide Sea  Vegetable Co., have logged gross sales of $30,000 and $7,000, respectively, in  1989.  </P> <P> Sea vegetables sold by the three companies retail for $18 to $24 a pound, $1.80  to $2.50 for 1-ounce packages.  </P> <P> Connoisseurs prepare the seaweed much as others might serve land-grown  vegetables: in side dishes, casseroles, omelets, soups, salads and sandwiches.  </P> <P> Growing profusely in the bay near Mendocino are fucus, the seaweed known as  bladderwrack and popular as an herbal tea; grapestone, a seaweed with an  oyster-like taste and covered with crunchy bumps; sea cabbage; sea lettuce, a  soggy version of that found in the back-yard garden, and nori, rubbery in the  wild, the basic ingredient in the popular Japanese soup miso and the seaweed  wrapper for sushi.  </P> <P> The harvesters are licensed by the state Fish and Game Department.  </P> <P> One recent day, John Lewallen, 47, swam ashore from 100 yards out in the bay,  where he had cut foot-long fronds from huge onion-shaped bulbs of sea whip  seaweed bobbing on the surface.  </P> <P> As he boosted himself out of the water and onto a rock covered with fucus,  50-degree seawater flowed off Lewallen's black wet suit. He lifted a small  float filled with the sea whip fronds he had harvested. Sea whip is anchored to  rocks on the ocean floor with 20- to 30-foot long tubular stems.  </P> <P> "The amazing thing about sea whip fronds," Lewallen remarked as he and his wife  loaded the seaweed into a large plastic bag, "is that the leaves come from a  monstrous plant, yet (they) are light and delicate in texture and flavor."  </P> <P> Eleanor Lewallen talked about the uniqueness of harvesting vegetables from the  sea. "We don't plant, fertilize or till our crops," she said. "Nature does  everything. We use no machinery harvesting, and we are very careful when  trimming the plants to leave the reproductive organs so they continue to  produce. Our only tools are knives like the one John is using."  </P> <P> As they spoke, John and Eleanor Lewallen and their son, Loren, 5, munched on  various kinds of seaweed they had plucked off the inshore rocks. Each tasted  different from the next, yet they shared a common flavor -- something like how  the ocean smells.  </P> <P> They gathered long, hairy strands of feather boa seaweed and pieces of Turkish  towel seaweed, both used to rub one's body while taking a bath. "I know some  people who eat feather boa," John Lewallen said. "I never had a dinner of it  myself. Even I have to draw the line somewhere," he laughed.  </P> <P> John Lewallen grew up in Alaska and graduated from Whitman College in Walla  Walla, Wash. He spent a year in India working with villagers and two years with  an independent Peace Corps-type organization in a Montagnard village in  Vietnam. For a time he published a counterculture newspaper.  </P> <P> Eleanor Lewallen graduated from Mira Costa High School in Manhattan Beach,  spent two years at UCLA, earned her English literature degree at UC Berkeley  and taught for a while. She is widely known as founder of the Ocean Protection  Coalition and for her appearances at hearings protesting plans for offshore oil  drilling off the Northern California Coast.  </P> <P> "They call me the 'seaweed lady' because I always bring a bag of sea vegetables  to the hearings. Our waters off Mendocino County are some of the purest on  earth, unpolluted, pristine. Oil platforms would pollute the area, kill the sea  vegetables," she said.  </P> <P> After harvest, the Lewallens tie the seaweed for a day or two on ropes strung  from trees in their back yard. They place the dried sea vegetables into plastic  trash bags for storage in an upstairs bedroom of their rustic home to await  packaging and shipping.  </P> <P> "Seaweed has been a basic food in the Orient for centuries. Japanese, Chinese  and others have hundreds of uses for it," Lewallen said. "I have tried to  interest Japanese businessmen to buy wild sea vegetables from our coast. There  are different varieties here than they have. But so far my efforts have been in  vain."  </P> <P> The big problem is that in China and Japan, seaweed is cultivated on a large  scale as well as harvested in the wild and can be produced much more cheaply  than in California.  </P> <P> The Lewallens dream of helping to combat Mendocino County's high unemployment  by hiring 75 to 100 sea vegetable harvesters and shipping 5,000 to 20,000  pounds of seaweed a month to Japan. The current harvest is a mere 1,500 pounds  of dried seaweed a year. (It weighs 10 times as much when wet.)  </P> <P> But the Japanese businessmen who could make it all happen haven't shown up here  yet.  </P> <P> Ocean Harvest Sea Vegetable Co., in the tiny Mendocino County town of Comptche,  is owned by Betsy Holliday, 38, a dietary consultant and cooking teacher, and  Victor Marren, 44, who started harvesting sea vegetables for his own food when  he lived in Gloucester, Mass.  </P> <P> "I came to the Mendocino Coast six years ago for one reason -- sea palm sea  vegetables," Marren said. "The sea palm grows up to two feet tall and resembles  miniature palm trees. This seaweed grows only along the coast from Central  California to British Columbia."  </P> <P> Sea palm fronds, also called sea noodles, are Ocean Harvest's best-selling  product, retailing at $3.20 per 1.6-ounce package. Holliday and Marren's  products are found in health food stores as far away as New England and  Florida. They also publish a seaweed cookbook that sells for $2.  </P> <P> Mendocino Sea Vegetable Co. -- the Lewallens' firm -- also publishes a seaweed  cookbook, which sells for $4.95 and is in its fourth printing.  </P> <P> Recipes include Wakame Borsch; Nori lettuce and tomato sandwich; dolse (which  tastes like potato peelings) bagel and cream cheese; sea palm fronds sauteed  with honey, carrot and rice and also sauteed with butter and garlic, plus  numerous sea vegetable soups, casseroles and omelets.  </P> <P> "There are 500 to 1,000 different species of sea vegetables," said John  Lewallen. "We're always experimenting, always looking for new edibles from the  ocean garden."  </P></p>

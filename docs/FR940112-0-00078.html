			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on Specific Provisions of the NPRM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Provision A_Allow States to Consider Projected Institutional Expenses at the Medicaid Rate as Incurred Medical Expenses <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It should also be noted that Provision A does not govern implementation of section 1929(b)(3) of the Act, which permits States to project medical expenses in determining eligibility for medical assistance for home and community care under section 1929. Regulations governing section 1929 will be published separately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters objected to Provision A, believing that allowing States to project institutional expenses at the Medicaid rate contravenes the law. They believe that since the law requires accounting for ``incurred'' expenses and since expenses are incurred at the private patient payment rate, a projection of expenses, as a part of accounting for incurred expenses, should only be at the private patient payment rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We do not agree with the commenters. In the preamble to the NPRM, we noted that ``[i]t is currently permissible for States to project anticipated institutional expenses at the private patient rate'' but that we were proposing to revise regulations to also ``provide that States may count institutional expenses (not subject to payment by a third party) at the Medicaid reimbursement rate instead of the private payment rate in calculating spenddown.'' (48 FR 39960). As discussed in more detail below, we have analyzed the issue further and have concluded that it is inappropriate to project expenses at the private patient payment rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, the spenddown rules in sections 1902(a)(17) and 1902(f) of the Act provide for reducing income by ``incurred'' expenses (i.e., expenses for which the individual is liable). Under these provisions, the Secretary does not have to allow States to project any expenses since projection involves treating an expense as incurred before the liability arises. However, States are permitted to project expenses under the Secretary's general rulemaking authority in sections 1102 and 1902(a)(4) of the Act because projection may be necessary for the efficient operation of the Medicaid program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The assumption underlying the projection of expenses is that liability for the expenses will subsequently arise since only the amounts for which the individual is ultimately liable can be used to reduce income. However, when the private patient payment rate is higher than the Medicaid rate and expenses are projected at the private payment rate, liability for the projected expenses may not actually arise. That is, once expenses are projected and spenddown liability is met, the provider may charge expenses only at the Medicaid rate as specified in &sect;447.15. Thus, expenses projected at the private payment rate will actually be incurred at the Medicaid rate, and the State will need to reconcile the amounts accordingly. This reconciliation would make the projection at the private payment rate less efficient than if the projection were done initially at the Medicaid rate. Further, when expenses ultimately incurred at the Medicaid rate are insufficient to meet the person's spenddown liability, the determination of eligibility would have been in error. Only using the Medicaid rate to project expenses avoids these problems. Therefore, we are allowing projections only at the Medicaid reimbursement rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of commenters argued that the use of the Medicaid reimbursement rate is arbitrary and generally less than the private rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  States are required by section 1902(a)(13)(A) of the Act to pay for long-term care services using rates that are reasonable and adequate to meet the costs that efficiently and economically operated facilities must incur to provide care that conforms to applicable State and Federal laws, regulations, and quality and safety standards. We are clarifying in these final regulations at &sect;&sect;435.831(g)(1), 435.831(i), 436.831(g)(1), and 436.831(i) that States may project institutional expenses only at the Medicaid rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Many commenters were concerned that if a State uses the Medicaid rate rather than the private rate in the spenddown process, it could take longer to reduce excess income using the usually lower Medicaid rate. Thus, it would delay eligibility. A number of commenters were concerned that certain individuals may have insufficient income to pay the private institutional rate, yet have income in excess of the Medicaid reimbursement rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Spain's recovery continues Confirmation of Spain's gradual recovery from economic recession coincided yesterday with a slight resurgence in the headline inflation rate. A 0.4 per cent rise in consumer prices in July brought the year-on-year rate back up to 4.8 per cent from 4.7 per cent in June. The government target of 3.5 per cent for the year is increasingly less likely to be met. Fresh food prices climbed by 1 per cent in the month. The underlying rate - excluding volatile food and energy prices - was more moderate at 0.2 per cent in the month, bringing the annual increase down from 4.4 to 4.3 per cent. The Bank of Spain said growth was over 1 per cent in the second quarter compared with the same period last year.</p>

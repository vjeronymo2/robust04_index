			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Arts: Choirs at St John's - Concerts in London One of the phenomena of the 1980s was the rise of small classical music groups, which took their affairs into their own hands. To see the potential rewards, one has only to look at the Tallis Scholars, a group which has aggressively promoted its activities through setting up its own record label and which has won an enormous following both in Britain and overseas - an example which other choirs are starting to emulate. At St John's, Smith Square last week a pair of choral evenings gave the hall two well-filled houses. The Tallis Scholars' new recordings regularly feature in the best-sellers lists of the smaller record companies and a good audience must almost be assured when they appear, but we should not take their popularity for granted. Twenty years ago it would have been unthinkable to draw so many people to a programme of composers as obscure as Morales, Lupi and Verdelot. Under the direction of Peter Phillips, the choir has specialised in the unaccompanied sacred music of the Renaissance. There is no other comparable group that can match the focus of these voices, not a hint of vibrato, their sound searingly clear. In Morales's Missa Mille regretz there may have been more opportunity to vary the tone colour than they took; but Lassus's Magnificat (no 100) was a well-nigh unsurpassable example of small choir singing, crisp, alert, unanimous in rhythm and spirit. Anybody who missed Wednesday's concert, which also included a beautifully serene Ave Maria by Ludwig Senfl, still has the opportunity to catch the Tallis Scholars in the second of their St John's appearances next week. Unfortunately, it is another year to wait for the return of the Birmingham-based chamber choir, Ex Cathedra. On Saturday it presented a programme entitled 'Music for the Kings of France'. There is every sign that this is an ambitious group. Like The Tallis Scholars, it has founded its own record label, on which its first CD, of the Vivaldi Vespers, has now appeared. But in this case the choir does not intend to lift its profile through specialisation: Dvorak and Stravinsky also feature in its current season. At about 30 members, it is the right size for the music of the composers of Louis XIV's reign. Both Lalande's Jubilate and Du Mont's Magnificat employ a 'petit choeur', here taken by fresh young solo voices from within Ex Cathedra. Lalande's Concert de trompettes also allowed the Ex Cathedra Baroque Orchestra, softer-grained than other original-instrument bands that I have heard at St John's, to show its very professional paces. The main work was Charpentier's Te Deum Laudamus, receiving its first London performance in a new edition by Lionel Sawkins. Under Jeffrey Skidmore's direction, this was music-making of enormous eclat, the choral singing zestful, the trumpets ringing out with brazen vigour: Ex Cathedra will be welcome at St John's more often. Tallis Scholars' second pro- gramme is on February 10 (Box Office 071-222 1061)</p>

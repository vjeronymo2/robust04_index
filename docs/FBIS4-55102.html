			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 6 (CTK) -- The Civic Democratic  Alliance (ODA) is very upset at the "campaign unleashed with a  clear purpose" against Chairman of the National Property Fund  (FNM) Tomas Jezek, Chairman of the ODA's Group of Deputies  Oldrich Kuzilek said at a press conference today. The campaign  is undoubtedly politically motivated, and Jezek has ODA's  support, Kuzilek said. He stressed that the ODA considered  Jezek a "fair man of honor", and would continue monitoring and  analyzing the campaign surrounding him, Kuzilek said.    "Besides political, anti-transformation intentions, the  campaign also has aspects linked to the FNM's status as an  independent institution, such as the filling of the FNM  Executive Committee. This is fully in the competence of the FNM  Presidium, and the ODA does not want intervene in this sphere,"  Kuzilek said on behalf of his party.    The ODA admits the participation of some of its members in  certain personal clashes in the "gigantic process (of economic  transformation)", and explains them as unavoidable "clashes  between official and executive structures and levels", not as  any pressures or problems within the ODA, Kuzilek stated.</p>

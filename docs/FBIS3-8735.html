			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Representatives of the opposition parties that,  in fact, represent the coalition already, together with Jozef  Moravcik and Roman Kovac, returned from the talks with the  president of the Republic shortly before 2200. He announced to  the president the name of the candidate who is to form the new  government. Our reporters have just returned from the  parliament building. Hence, we can offer you the following  interviews.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified official] The parties that  formed the opposition so far, presented [the president] with the  name of a new prime minister to be authorized to form the new  Slovak government. This proposed prime minister, approved by  the president as well, is Jozef Moravcik.    [Unidentified correspondent] Did the opposition parties  propose candidates for ministerial posts as well?    [Official] This was not the topic of the talks. According to  the information given by the hitherto opposition parties, the  names for individual posts are more or less known [to the  opposition parties]. However, this [list of names] will be  fine-tuned. There is a chance that the names for individual  ministerial posts will be announced by Wednesday [16 March].  [passage omitted]    [Unidentified official] The Party of the Democratic Left  will  propose seven names [for ministerial posts]. The Center Bloc,  as I called it this afternoon--i.e., the Alliance of Democrats,  the National Democratic Club, and another independent club,  headed by Mr. Bajan--will also present seven names. The  Christian Democratic Movement will present five names.    [Correspondent] How many deputy prime ministers will there  be?    [Unidentified official] It is expected that there will be  three deputy prime ministers. One deputy prime minister will be  in charge of the economy. There will be another deputy prime  minister for the so-called superstructure or ministries of the  nonproductive sphere, and a deputy prime minister for  legislative matters.

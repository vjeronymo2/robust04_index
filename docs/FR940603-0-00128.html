			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated earlier, community credit unions may also apply for a designation as a ``distressed federal credit union'' and to do so regardless of whether they are converting to a community charter. These credit unions, as well as low-income community credit unions, may add select employee groups outside their operational area to their fields of membership as long as they have the financial ability to serve the group. After the credit union community has some experience with this policy, the Board will assess the wisdom of extending this option to all community credit unions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII. Overlap Issues <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal clarified that NCUA may exclude from overlap protection state chartered credit unions with a field of membership so broadly defined as to include virtually everyone in a wide area. Four commenters agreed with this clarification. However, many commenters addressed other overlap issues. Two commenters supported the requirement that credit unions involved in overlap situations first attempt to resolve related issues among themselves before turning to NCUA. Three commenters stated that field of membership policy was overly liberal and permits numerous overlaps which hurt small credit unions. Eight commenters stated that overlaps between credit unions should be liberally permitted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Four commenters believed NCUA should include a definition of the term ``incidental overlap'' as a further aid to the credit union community. One commenter believed the term should be defined as 3% of the potential membership of the credit union being overlapped. One commenter stated that overlaps are incidental if they do not create questions of viability for the credit union affected by the overlap. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal stated that an overlap may be justified if the original credit union failed to provide quality service to the group. One commenter suggested that the Board define ``quality service'' and reexamine its position regarding the absence of ``specialized service as not being a justification for an overlap.'' Seven other commenters also believed that the term ``quality service'' needed to be defined. They believed the term was very subjective: Did it mean the number of services, hours open, or the attitude of workers? A few of these commenters believed the lack of a definition has hurt small credit unions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter supported NCUA's intent to provide overlap protection for any type of charter if there are significant safety and soundness concerns. This commenter would expand this to include a low-income service impact test: A credit union should be protected from overlaps which would impair its ability to effectively serve low-income members of the community. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal also stated that in special cases exclusionary language should be used to limit the membership eligibility of widely dispersed employees or associations. One commenter disagreed with this limitation. This commenter believed that if there was a legitimate common bond, such as a single employer or association, and no credit union was serving the group, then exclusionary language was not necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. NCUA Board Decision <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final IRPS contains the provision in the proposal removing from overlap consideration broadly based state chartered credit unions, which parallels how the agency approaches broadly based federal charters. As to most of the remaining comments, the Board disagrees with many of the suggestions. The Agency's long-standing policy is working well. The vast majority of all overlaps are consented to by the overlapped credit union. The remainder are resolved in a way which makes the interests of the group paramount. The Board continues to believe it needs flexibility in this area. Therefore, the final IRPS does not define ``incidental overlap'' or ``quality service.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the Board agrees that experience with exclusionary clauses has not been entirely satisfactory. This entire section has been rewritten in the final IRPS in the hope of limiting their use to the few situations where they are truly warranted and effective. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IX. Documentation Issues <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal attempted to streamline documentation requirements. Five commenters stated that the documentation requirements in the proposal were not burdensome. Ten commenters disagreed. Many of these commenters also believed that financial statements were unnecessary in light of periodic call reports and examinations. Four commenters believed that financial statements should not be necessary for field of membership expansions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters noted that, for a field of membership expansion, the proposal required documentation from groups ``on the group's letterhead stationery and signed by an official representative to the group.'' The commenters believed this has generally been interpreted to mean an officer of the employer. These commenters believed that NCUA should be flexible and recognize that not all groups are represented by the employer or have an ``official'' representative. They suggested that the IRPS allow the regions to accept other documentation or certification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

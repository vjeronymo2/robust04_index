			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / MPs warn on cost of shedding forces jobs THE GOVERNMENT came under renewed pressure yesterday from the Commons defence committee to re-assess its plans for cutting the armed forces. The committee warned that ministers could face accusations of 'financial profligacy' if they were forced to cut more jobs. Current redundancy plans would cost the taxpayer about Pounds 400m a year for the next few years, it said. Although it stopped short of calling for a full-scale defence review, the committee said the government's argument for sticking to plans drawn up in 1990 was 'barely credible'. New pressures had built up, including the commitment of British forces to the former Yugoslavia and extra troops to Northern Ireland. The committee added: 'The time has now indeed come to stand back and take stock of the totality of the proposals for the British armed forces for the next decade in the light of recent changes in the strategic environment and of pressures on the defence budget.' The committee's report on this year's defence white paper was drawn up before the additional budget cuts included in last month's public expenditure changes. It warned that attempts to achieve savings discreetly by cutting back on logistic support and spares would have 'lethal consequences'. A repetition of previous 'salami-slicing' policies of this kind would be criminal, it said. The report also called for an early decision on the future of the two privately managed naval dockyards at Devonport and Rosyth. It said: 'The current uncertainty, and the long-drawn-out process of review following review, is damaging to all concerned.' The Ministry of Defence has indicated it intends to decide before Christmas on where to carry out refitting of nuclear submarines, which provides the core of both dockyards' business. GEC Ferranti of Edinburgh announced it has won a 'multi-million pound' contract to produce radar equipment for the Royal Navy's new EH101 Merlin helicopter.</p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / People: Miller/Williams five-year partnership comes to an end John Miller, finance director of paper and packaging group David S. Smith, is leaving in mid January after the interim results, ending a five year 'partnership' with Canadian-born chief executive Peter Williams. Miller, 45, played down the reasons for his departure. 'It is a great job here, and it is very difficult to explain why you do something like this without sounding smug, but occasionally you wake up in the morning and realise how ignorant you are. I'd just like a change.' He feels he has helped change the company 'mostly for the good', and thinks it is 'a safe time to leave'. He stresses there is no falling out with Williams. For his part, Williams acknowledges that it is 'a surprise when someone as young as John decides to move on' but goes on to stress that 'there was no corporate reason. I guess if you decide your backswing is rusty and you value that . . .'. This is the third job in which Miller has worked closely with Williams. Both men had been veterans of Reed International, Miller since 1974, shortly after qualifying as a chartered accountant. He began reporting directly to Williams from 1987, as finance director of the European manufacturing division. Shortly thereafter, Williams led the management buy-out of Reedpack, the paper and packaging businesses of Reed, which was then sold on to Swedish Svenska Cellulosa, at a handsome profit, in 1990. Miller joined him as Reedpack's finance director, picking up around an estimated Pounds 2m from the proceeds of the buy-out. He is replaced at David S. Smith by David Buttfield, the financial controller, also a Reedpack man. 'I want to make clear this is not just jobs for the Reedpack boys,' says Miller. 'We did do a proper outside search.' Meanwhile, the outgoing finance director has yet to decide how to repair his 'ignorance', but would consider anything from 'positions elsewhere in industry not necessarily as finance director' to spending a year studying fine art at the Courtauld Institute.</p>

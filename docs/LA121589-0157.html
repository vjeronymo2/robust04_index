			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HAWAIIAN AIRLINES PLANS TO CUT COSTS BY LAYING OFF 200  </P> <P> Hawaiian Airlines, which has agreed to be taken over by a Newport Beach  investor group, said it will reduce its work force by about 200 employees after  Jan. 1, 1990, in order to cut costs.  </P> <P> Hawaiian Airlines Chief Executive Officer John Magoon Jr. said Wednesday that  the layoffs will total just under 7% of the company's total work force and will  include both full-time and part-time workers.  </P> <P> "We're taking these steps to reduce operating expenses, create a more efficient  workplace and improve the airline's competitive position," Magoon said.  </P> <P> The airline's parent company, HAL, has scheduled a stockholder vote in two  weeks on a takeover bid by an investor group headed by Newport Beach attorney  J. Thomas Talbot and former baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth.  </P> <P> Magoon said the company hoped that it could rehire many of the workers as the  airline's operating results improve.  </P> <P> Assistant General Chairman Sam Poomaihealani of the International Assn. of  Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 141 said the cutbacks are scheduled  for Jan. 2 and 8 and would involve 200 to 242 employees.  </P></p>

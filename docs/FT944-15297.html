			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Balladur not answering for others Sir, As usual, you exaggerate the excellence of French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. He does not, as you would have us believe, say that he will 'answer for those locked up' in the Plantu cartoon which accompanied your article, 'Corruption rocks French ship of state' (October 17). The unfortunate Mr Balladur actually says 'Right, I'll call a register to see who's in the clink or otherwise indisposed'. Not even the FT's Man of the Year answers for the corruption of his cabinet adjutants. Carmel Fitzgerald, 16 rue Charles Bemont, 78290 Croissy-s-Seine, France</p>

			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : CLASSICAL MUSIC;  </P> <P> CHICAGO'S 2ND ORCHESTRA LEADS WAY WITH MINORITIES  </P> <P> In the competition for public funding, mainstream arts organizations have come  under increasing pressure to improve their dismal record of minority  involvement. From personnel to programming to representation on governing  boards, government agencies such as the California Arts Council are requiring  orchestras and opera companies, for example, to demonstrate a more inclusive  racial mixture.  </P> <P> Orchestra conductor Paul Freeman, in town to lead a pair of San Diego Symphony  summers pops concerts this week, could give a seminar on this topic. He  organized his Chicago Sinfonietta to be racially inclusive from its inception,  rather than worrying about minority involvement after the fact. After  conducting one of Chicago's Grant Park concerts in 1986, Freeman was invited by  local leaders to start a chamber orchestra.  </P> <P> "I told them what I wanted to do -- to scout out the top minority talent in the  Chicago area," he explained. "My goal was to make at least a third of the  orchestra composed of minority musicians, but we were equally careful to  articulate that the orchestra's social mission is secondary to its musical  goal."  </P> <P> In a Chicago Tribune commentary last fall, music critic John von Rhein  described Freeman's Chicago Sinfonietta as "the city's mid-sized,  affirmative-action, community-outreach orchestra."  </P> <P> When Freeman started the Chicago Sinfonietta in 1987, he was music director of  Canada's Victoria Symphony and principal guest conductor of the Helsinki  Philharmonic. It was the political chemistry of Chicago at that time that  encouraged him to set down musical roots in yet another city far from his home  in British Columbia.  </P> <P> "There was a certain vibrancy in the air then, especially during the  administration of (the late Chicago mayor) Harold Washington."  </P> <P> In three short years, Freeman has achieved many of his musical and social  goals. Chicago Sun-Times music critic Paul Marsh dubbed the young Chicago  Sinfonietta, "Chicago's second orchestra," a distinction of no small stature:  Several Chicago area musical ensembles vie to be ranked adjacent to Sir Georg  Solti's Chicago Symphony.  </P> <P> Freeman is equally pleased about his orchestra's racial mixture of black,  white, Asian and Latino players.  </P> <P> "With 30% of our 40 musicians minority, I think we're a model orchestra. The  membership of our board is also 40% minority. Some orchestra directors ask me  what they can do for community outreach and minority participation -- we have  that built in our orchestra."  </P> <P> Another musical project close to Freeman's heart is a series of nine recordings  he made for Columbia Records of works by black composers. Although the  four-year project was completed about 15 years ago, Freeman stated that its  benefits are still being felt. Especially for conductors who knew nothing of  the works of Chevalier St. George, William Grant Still, Ulysses S. Kay, the  recordings provided a crash course in orchestral repertory left out of the  orchestra canon largely because of the composers' race.  </P> <P> "Many conductors have used music from the series in their programming. And, for  the (living) composers represented in the series it has been a tremendous  thrust. George Walker, for example, received a commission from (conductor  Lorin) Maazel in Cleveland and then another commission from the New York  Philharmonic."  </P> <P> Freeman noted that the idea for undertaking the Columbia recording project came  from Robert Shaw, who was sharing the podium with Freeman at a conference on  black music at Atlanta's Spelman College. Shaw, at that time the Atlanta  Symphony's music director, was appointed principal guest conductor to the San  Diego Symphony last year.  </P> <P> Freeman has not put all of his eggs in the Chicago basket, however. Earlier  this year, he was appointed principal guest conductor of the Zagreb,  Yugoslavia, Symphony Orchestra. One of his main duties with the Zagreb Symphony  is to make recordings. Before he flew to San Diego for his all-Tchaikovsky  assignment with the San Diego Symphony, Freeman was in Zagreb recording works  by Beethoven, Bloch and Shostakovich. And by the black American composer Hale  Smith.  </P> <P> "Things are opening up in European countries musically," said Freeman.  </P> <P> And, if the activist conductor continues to have his way, other doors will be  opening in this country, too.  </P> <P> Time to subscribe. San Diego Opera general director Ian Campbell will take over  the KFSD-FM (94.1) air waves from 5 to 7 p.m. Sunday to solicit subscriptions  to the opera's upcoming season. As listeners call in their subscriptions,  Campbell will play recorded arias and selections from the five operas the  company will present at the Civic Theatre from January to May next year.  </P> <P> South Bay music. For several seasons, the Chula Vista public library has  offered a commendable series of free chamber music concerts in its F Street  auditorium. Last week, the library announced its fall series, beginning with a  vocal recital by soprano Ann DeVries and baritone Martin Wright on Sept. 17.  The Gennaro Trio (violinist Ronald Goldman, cellist Mary Lindblom and pianist  Ilana Mysior will perform Oct. 15, and the brass quintet Classic Brass will  complete the fall term Nov. 19.  </P></p>

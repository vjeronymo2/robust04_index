			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / US pulls out crack unit in Somalia THE US is to withdraw its detachment of Army Rangers from Somalia, reflecting its shift away from a policy of aggressively pursuing General Mohammed Farah Aideed, the Somali clan leader. President Bill Clinton said the move did not mean the US was abandoning the search for Gen Aideed, but that the Rangers were no longer needed in Mogadishu now that a force of 3,600 Marines was positioned offshore. 'It means that right now we are engaging in a political process to see how we can resolve our mission in Somalia and to do all the things the United Nations was ordered to do,' Mr Clinton said. US officials denied that the withdrawal of the Rangers, whose principal role during their stay in Somalia has been to carry out raids aimed at capturing Gen Aideed or his lieutenants, was part of a deal struck with the Somali leader to obtain the release last week of a US helicopter pilot shot down and held prisoner by his forces. Since the US abandoned its policy of aggressively chasing the general, the US combat forces in Somalia have been largely confined to barracks. The White House described the removal of the 600 Rangers, who are trained in special operations such as 'snatch' missions, as a 'rotation of forces.' Mr Peter Tarnoff, the undersecretary for policy at the State Department, told members of Congress that the primary mission of the Marine amphibious forces deployed off the coast of Mogadishu was to protect US troops in Somalia.</p>

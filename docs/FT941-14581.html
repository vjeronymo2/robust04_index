			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Enel chief faces power station fraud charges Mr Franco Viezzoli, the head of Enel, Italy's electricity authority, was yesterday arrested on charges of alleged serious fraud, abuse of office and manipulation of bids relating to the construction of a power station at Gioia Tauro in southern Calabria. He was arrested with 10 members of Enel in a police operation relating to the alleged rigging of bids for the power plant and the involvement of the 'ndrangheta, the Calabrian mafia. Among the Enel executives were Mr Guido Gallizioli, the deputy director, as well as Mr Alberto Negroni, former managing director. A total of 39 arrest warrants were issued covering local and national contractors, including Mr Lorenzo Panzavolta, the former head of Calcestruzzi, the Ferruzzi group's construction arm. Those arrested include those suspected of operating front companies for the leading local mafia families, the Piromalli and Pesce. Since 1989 magistrates in Calabria have been investigating the construction of Enel's power plant at Gioia Tauro, the site of an unbuilt steel complex. In 1990 work was stopped because contractors were suspected to have been infiltrated by the local mafia. Enel sought to restart the project and the go-ahead with new guidelines was given last November. Enel said yesterday it hoped the matter would be clarified as soon as possible. As a result of magistrates' investigations into bribes and illicit payments to contractors, evidence has emerged of alleged corruption in at least two Enel power station contracts - Brindisi in the south and Montalto near Rome. But this is the first time executives have been charged. In a separate development, Ravenna magistrates have decided to broaden the charges against the Ferruzzi family and former managers of the group to include conspiracy to commit a crime. This is the same charge as that levelled against criminal organisations and it is the first time magistrates have directed it against those running an industrial concern. Those affected include Mr Arturo Ferruzzi, the former chairman, Ms Alessandra Ferruzzi, his sister and wife of Mr Carlo Sama, former head of Ferruzzi's main industrial arm, Montedison, who was also indicted with the new charge; Mr Giuseppe Garofano, former chairman of Montedison; Mr Giuseppe Berlini, the Swiss-based head of the Ferruzzi family's overseas operations, and Mr Sergio Cragnotti, the former right-hand man of the late Raul Gardini while he was running the Ferruzzi family's business. It is not clear how this will affect Milan magistrates' well-advanced investigation into the Ferruzzi-Montedison group.</p>

			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / UK Company News: ASB to make offer and placing to fund purchases ASB GROUP, the recruitment and training company rescued from liquidation by a Pounds 750,000 rights issue last year, yesterday announced an offer and placing to raise funds to buy two training businesses, writes Peggy Hollinger. Mr Alan Greenough, chairman and chief executive, said the purchase of Harper Craven, the sales and marketing training company, and Monckerkin, the outward bound-type course specialist, would provide a solid base for future expansion. The group will pay up to Pounds 700,000 for the two groups. The company - which also announced increased losses for 1991 of Pounds 575,000, against Pounds 409,000 - is raising Pounds 200,000 through an open offer of one share for every 7.56 held at 6.5p and a further Pounds 200,000 through a placing, subject to clawback.</p>

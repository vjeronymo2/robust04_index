			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Sudan told to halt expulsion The British government yesterday gave Sudan until next Tuesday to reverse its decision to expel Mr Peter Streams, the British ambassador to Khartoum. Mr Abdurrahman Bakhit, Sudanese charge d'affaires in the UK, was called to the Foreign Office yesterday and told that the expulsion should be withdrawn if Sudan valued its relationship with Britain. The expulsion was apparently provoked by a proposed visit to rebel-held areas in southern Sudan by Dr George Carey, archbishop of Canterbury. The Foreign Office said the Sudanese government had been told of Britain's 'profound dissatisfaction and regret' at the expulsion order. The Foreign Office did not say what measures would be taken if Sudan did not comply.</p>

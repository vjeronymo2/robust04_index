			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Hard Ecu plan to be reviewed: UK may back down after concession on single currency timing BRITAIN MAY back down on its hard Ecu plan following an important concession on the timing of a single currency proposed at a meeting of EC finance ministers. The hard Ecu is a central plank in the British government's ideas for European economic and monetary union but the idea has gained few supporters in the rest of Europe. The proposal will be reviewed by senior UK officials in the next few weeks with the option of dropping it as a goodwill gesture to Britain's partners. Such a turnabout could raise political difficulties because the Conservative government has long insisted that its hard Ecu alternative has been generating interest abroad in spite of Labour scepticism. According to the concession proposed at the weekend meeting in Luxembourg by Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, Britain could sign a treaty on Emu later this year without agreeing on the final goal, to which the UK attaches strong reservations, of a single European currency and a new European central bank. That would mean Britain could join the other EC nations in stage two of Emu but leave open the question of further involvement until the late 1990s. According to some countries' schedule, the third and final phase of Emu would begin around 2000, and usher in the full operation of a new, single currency and the new central bank. The general feeling from the meeting, said Mr Philippe Maystadt, the Belgian finance minister, was that 'no country should be allowed to stop others advancing to Emu and that no country could have a single currency imposed on it'. The proposal was supported by Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's competition commissioner. 'It could be made clear that the UK was formally reserving its position, not just on when, but on whether, it accepts a single currency,' Sir Leon said. The British government reacted cautiously to Mr Delors' proposal. Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, said the suggestion was 'constructive but not a dramatic breakthrough'. There were still 'a million questions', many of them posed by other countries, that had yet to be answered about Emu. Downing Street also made clear that the option was just one of many coming out of the negotiations. Tory MPs appeared divided on the issue although, at first sight, the Delors plan may appeal to the leadership on the grounds that it should largely remove the controversy within the party on the Emu issue in the run up to a general election that most now believe will come in the autumn. However, there is also considerable concern that acceptance of the compromise might be seen as tacit endorsement of a 'two-speed' Europe - something the government has always vigorously opposed. The hard Ecu, proposed two years ago with Mrs Margaret Thatcher's support, was designed partly to keep Britain in the mainstream of the Emu debate. The proposal is for a new currency with anti-inflationary characteristics, which would be used by European businesses alongside existing national currencies. It would be separate from the existing basket Ecu - the notional currency which the European Commission hopes will evolve ultimately into a new single financial unit for Europe. The hard Ecu strategy is to be discussed by the main Whitehall committee responsible for the approach to Emu. The committee is chaired by Mr Nigel Wickes, a second permanent secretary at the Treasury, and includes representatives from the Foreign Office, the Bank of England and the prime minister's policy unit. In the light of the less than wholehearted support received from the rest of Europe, the hard Ecu could be abandoned, although Britain would probably continue to press for some of the basic tenets behind the proposal, such as the need to fight inflation. Apart from the main discussions, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French finance minister, sought to smooth over differences with the Germany on the timing of the formation of the European Central Bank. His officials spoke only of an institutition 'pre-figuring' the bank being set up in 1994. However, Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, remained insistent that it should be formed only on the eve of a single currency. Two-speed Emu, Page 3</p>

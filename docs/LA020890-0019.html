			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GRAVES GETS 3-YEAR PORT TERM, SCHENK DRAWS SHORTER STINT  </P> <P> Newly appointed Port Commissioner Clifford Graves was assigned the longer of  two unexpired terms on the powerful agency that controls state tidelands around  San Diego Bay, in a decision by a San Diego City Council committee Wednesday.  </P> <P> Graves will serve until Jan. 2, 1993, while colleague Lynn Schenk will serve  until Jan. 2, 1991.  </P> <P> The 4-2 vote of the council's Rules Committee settled the last remaining issue  in the appointment of replacements for retiring Port Commissioners William Rick  and Louis Wolfsheimer, who step down today.  </P> <P> Graves and Schenk were appointed Jan. 23 to fill the remaining portions of the  two commissioners' terms, following a brief power struggle over when Rick and  Wolfsheimer would step down.  </P> <P> But the council had left open the question of which appointee would be assigned  to the nearly three years remaining in Rick's term and the 11 months left in  Wolfsheimer's spot.  </P> <P> The council waived its policy of limiting port appointees to two terms when it  reappointed Rick and Wolfsheimer to third four-year terms to allow them to  complete the task of overseeing construction of the city's new bayfront  Convention Center.  </P> <P> Graves won the longer term with the support of Mayor Maureen O'Connor and City  Council members Ron Roberts, Wes Pratt and Linda Bernhardt, over the dissent of  council members Abbe Wolfsheimer and Bob Filner.  </P> <P> Several council members also criticized a Jan. 19 legal opinion by City Atty.  John Witt -- which states that the council lacks the authority to remove any  port commissioner without demonstrating malfeasance by the commissioner -- and  promised to ignore it if the issue is ever taken up by the full council.  </P> <P> The controversy stems from the desire of some council members to remove W.  Daniel Larsen, the city's third appointee on the seven-member Board of Port  Commissioners, for allegedly failing to represent the council's interests. Only  four council members -- Wolfsheimer, Hartley, Pratt and Filner -- appear ready  to vote to remove Larsen, leaving the group one vote short of the majority  needed.  </P> <P> Pratt, who called Witt's opinion "the very best in legal gymnastics," said that  Larsen's ouster may be brought to the full council even if it lacks the support  needed for passage.  </P></p>

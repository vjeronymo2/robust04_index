			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TEENS ARRESTED IN WOUNDING OF 2-YEAR-OLD;  </P> <P> CRIME: DETECTIVES NO LONGER BELIEVE THAT THE SHOOTING IN LYNWOOD WAS  DELIBERATE.  </P> <P> Three teen-age boys were arrested today in the wounding of a 2-year-old boy,  but the shooting that prompted outrage among city officials is no longer  considered deliberate, authorities said.  </P> <P> The three youths, two aged 15 and one 16 years old, were booked for  investigation of the attempted murder of Jonathon Fabian, said Sheriff's  Detective Craig Ditsch.  </P> <P> Their names were withheld because of their ages.  </P> <P> Jonathon was shot in the stomach Tuesday as he played with a push toy in front  of his home in Lynwood.  </P> <P> Witnesses said three teen-age gang members, at least one carrying a gun, ran  away after two shots were fired. Because no other gang members were seen in the  area, investigators speculated that the boy may have been the intended victim.  </P> <P> But investigators said today that the boy was not the target.  </P> <P> "The three suspects were walking on Muriel Drive when they exchanged words with  a group of rival gang members who drove in a vehicle," Deputy Bill Linnemeyer  said. "Two of the boys on the street fired at the car, which drove past the  2-year-old boy, who was caught in the cross-fire."  </P> <P> The boy was in critical but stable condition at Martin Luther King Jr.-Drew  Medical Center today. His condition was expected to improve.  </P> <P> County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn had called the shooting the "crime of the  century." The Board of Supervisors offered a $25,000 reward Thursday for  information leading to the capture of the assailants.  </P> <P> Lynwood Mayor Robert Henning had declared that it was time to "stop coddling  murderers no matter how old they are."  </P> <P> "If gang members want to shoot each other, that's one thing," Ditsch said. "But  it always bugs me when I see innocent people hurt. That feeling is just  magnified when it's an innocent little boy."  </P></p>

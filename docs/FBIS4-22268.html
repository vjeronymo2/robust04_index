Are you satisfied, from this point  of view, with the present state of affairs, and what problems do  you see in this sphere?    [Demirel] Turkey and Russia are the two great states of the  region. I think that we are responsible for peace and prosperity  not only in our region, but also in Europe and in the world. Our  countries have maintained political relations for more than 500  years. In the past there were conflicts and wars between us, but  enmity does not have to continue forever. I do not believe that  any country could build its policy on the basis of enmity. We  must shake hands with one another and save the future. The  people of our country, I know, is also interested in good  relations. This is why I appeal for the creation of relations of  peace, prosperity and friendliness, both today and in the future.    For several years I have advocated for us to have good  relations with our northern neighbors--with Russia, with the  former Soviet Union, irrespective of the regime existing in your  country. Our cooperation must be based on mutual understanding,  respect of independence, on non-interference in the internal  affairs of one another, and on respect of territorial integrity.  We do not want to interfere in your internal affairs, we respect  your independence and territorial integrity, and we want to  cooperate with Russia.    It is obvious that during the past few years our relations  have entered a new era in their development and are based on  common interests in the spirit of cooperation. The Agreement on  the Principles of Bilateral Relations signed during my visit in  Russia on 25 May 1992 and our negotiations with President  Yeltsin have been the cornerstone in this process. Since that  time our relations have begun to develop satisfactorily in all  spheres. We have the opportunity for international cooperation.  We are trying to create an Organization for Economic Cooperation  of the Black Sea Countries. The director of this organization,  who has just now been appointed (incidentally, he is a Russian)  has come to Istanbul. And now this organization continues to  develop its activity.    About 300 Turkish companies are operating in Russia. One of  the construction firms has reconstructed the White House. We are  buying natural gas from Russia. Turkey is open for the  development of business activities. We have good relations in  many spheres, and I do not see any reasons that would prevent  their being maintained.    Both of our countries must very attentively strive not to  darken our relations. On the government level we are acting in  this manner. Trifles should not be given exaggerated  significance. If something disturbs Turkey, we will communicate  this to Russia. And if something calls forth the displeasure of  Russia, it should tell the Turkish leadership about it.    I think that friendship and cooperation between Turkey and  Russia will be beneficial for both of our countries.    [Gagua] For the first time in recent centuries Turkey does  not have a land frontier with Russia. Now Turkey is bordered by  new independent states--Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. What  is the essence of Turkey's policy with respect to these  countries?    [Demirel] I think that if peace and accord are established  in  Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, this will only be for the good  of both Russia and Turkey. And if these countries are not at war  with each other, this will be in the interest of both Russia and  Turkey. I think that if peace is established in the Caucasus,  including the countries that are members of the Organization for  Economic Ccoperation of the Black Sea Countries, then this new  type of interaction and cooperation can be developed. Yes, this  is true, between our countries there is no land border, but we  are located on opposite sides of the Black Sea.    [Gagua] Today the idea of the restoration of the former  Soviet Union is acquiring more and more supporters. What do you  think about this?    [Demirel] You know, after the recent elections, after the  appearance of Mr Zhirinovskiy, one can talk about the fact that  there are many people in Russia who are displeased with the  collapse of the Soviet Union. They are displeased with the fact  that the republics of Central Asia, the Transcaucasus, and the  countries of East Europe are no longer within the sphere of  influence of Russia. They believe that a new Russia should be  created withing the borders of the former Soviet Union. It is  natural that this is a subject of anxiety of many countries, not  only Turkey. If Russia is going to be an imperialist state, it  will lose the trust it now enjoys. If this happens, then,  without a doubt, it will be a blow to many countries, who will  begin to see a threat in Russia. After the collapse of the  Soviet Union, all started to talk about the fact that the world  no longer is divided into two diametrically opposed camps, that  now the arms race will yield to peaceful development.    But if we preserve peace and cooperation, this will be good  both for Russia and the other countries. You see, in this case  we are working for the good and the prosperity of our peoples.  But if we are at war with one another, we only inflict harm and  misfortune on another, we condemn our peoples to poverty.    [Gagua] What is your attitude to the agreement signed by  Georgia and Russia, according to which Russia obtains military  bases in Georgia?    [Demirel] You know that by an agreement of the CSCE member  countries, which many states signed, the quantity of arms in  these countries must be under control.    As far as the agreement between Georgia and Russia is  concerned, this is the affair of these states, and we should not  be worried on account of this.    But Russia must observe the agreement on the quantity of  arms  in the region.    [Gagua] What do you think about the situation that has  developed around the Crimean Peninsula?    [Demirel] The dispute over the Crimea is a dispute between  Russia and Ukraine. We are interested in the fate of the Crimean  Tatars, there are quite a few in our country, too. A  considerable number of them live outside the boundaries of  Ukraine and Russia, they are found even in New York and in  Romania. Our interests with respect to the Crimean Tatars are  not political. All we want is for them to be secure in their  homeland and for them to be treated like people, you see, they  are our brothers.    [Gagua] You probably know that Mr Nazarbayev, speaking at  the  United Nations, accused some Russian officials of conducting an  imperialist policy. How do you assess this declaration?    [Demirel] I think he is concerned about the declarations of  Mr Zhirinovskiy. I know what he thinks, I suggested to him to  maintain peace in Kazakhstan; you see, Turkey knows that a  significant part of the population of Kazakhstan consists of  Russians. And if such is the composition of the population, you  already cannot call the Russians a minority. But they enjoy the  same rights as the other peoples of Kazakhstan. Moreover, the  prime minister of Kazakhstan is of Russian descent, although he  was born in Alma-Ata. You know that the destinies of these two  countries--Russia and Kazakhstan--are closely interrelated and  interwoven. Nazarbayev knows how attentively Russia treats the  30-million strong population of Russian origin that is living  outside the borders of Russia, and Russia rightfully is  concerned about their security. Nazarbayev treats the local  population with consideration, but, as far as I know, he is  afraid of the Russian population, of the emigrants from Russia,  he is afraid that they may separate from Kazakhstan. This is  what he is anxious about. But he told me on January 20 in Davos:  "First of all, I am a Kazakh, then a Russian, and then a Central  Asian." He said that it is necessary to be very attentive so  that Kazakhstan is not separated and torn away from Russia,  because they have a great deal in common. I think that he is a  sufficiently wise man, and I do not think that he will do  anything that could call forth irritation in Russia or among the  Russian population of the republic. I am not defending and  justifying him, I am only explaining, since I am acquainted with  his views, from his point of view, and I know what I suggested  to him.    [Gagua] There are rumors circulating to the effect that  during the recent visit of Mr Aliyev in Turkey an agreement was  signed, according to which an oil pipeline from Azerbaijan will  go through the territory of Turkey. Is this true?    [Demirel] No. In general, this is not a political, but an  economic question. We would like for such a pipeline to go  through Turkey, but we are not nudging and we are not pressuring  other countries. Especially not those which have cultural and  historical ties with us. All right, if such a decision will be  in the interest of Azerbaijan. However, if this is only in the  interest of Turkey, but does not benefit their country, we will  not occupy ourselves with this. If this is useful to the people  of Azerbaijan, we are glad about it, but, as I already said,  this is not a political question.    [Gagua] Mr President, today in the republics of Central  Asia,  after a period of some euphoria, a certain disillusionment is  noticeable. It would appear, they expected more from Turkey. Can  you say anything in regard to this?    [Demirel] You know that these countries are our brothers,  and  for the duration of almost 70 years we have practically not had  any relations with them. Two and a half years ago they became  independent. We have concluded a number of agreements with them,  we maintain telephone contact with them, they watch Turkish  television broadcasts, there is a lively air traffic between our  countries, citizens of ours are in these countries. About 1,000  Turkish companies are operating in the republics of Central  Asia. We are encouraging these states to step out into the world  arena, to become members of the CSCE, the United Nations, etc.  We have opened our embassies in these countries, and students  from these countries are being trained in Turkey. We have  granted them credits in the amount of more than $1 billion. Some  part of the credits has already been used by these countries.  Moreover, we have made it clear to them that we do not intend to  control these countries, that they must govern themselves. We  only want for them to preserve and maintain their independence  both within their countries and with their neighbors, for them  to support the development of their countries. To tell the  truth, we are not afraid of any disillusionment on their part.  We meet, we discuss various problems. They need to take up the  realization of concrete projects, but they do not have  sufficient personnel for this. As far as we are concerned, we  are prepared to continue to do everything possible for them. If  they are ready to continue work on these projects in the course  of 10 years, this would be very useful.    [Gagua] Turkey reacted very sharply to the conduct of a  Kurdish conference in Moscow. Do you believe that incidents of  that sort can seriously complicate international relations?    [Demirel] You know how concerned we are with the problem of  terrorism in our country. Up to now, Russia, our friend and  neighbor, has conducted a very cautious policy in this question.  You see, Russians know how we are suffering because of this.  Moreover, all countries, including Russia, are devoted to the  idea of the condemnation of terrorism and support the countries  fighting against it. Chechen, Tatars, and representatives of  other peoples come to Turkey from Russia, and if their stay is  undesirable in Turkey, Russia should not allow them to do this.  We have businessmen who work in Kazan, Tatarstan, Bashkortostan,  Chechnia, and our policy is that we do not incite anyone against  Russians. To the peoples that live in Russia we say that they  must have good relations with the Russians, since they are part  of Russia. You see, if misfortune befalls them, no one will help  them, simply no one can help.    As far as the new independent states are concerned, such as  Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and  Azerbaijan, we share the commonality of languages with them, the  commonality of religion, and we tell these countries that they  must have good relations with Russia. In no one's mind must the  impression be created that terrorists receive any kind of  support from Russia. I know the leaders of your country, Mr  Yeltsin and Mr Kozyrev. These are very wise people, and I do not  think that they will try to aggravate relations with Turkey in  essence for nothing.    [Gagua] The tendency of the internationalization of the  Karabakh conflict is becoming increasingly more noticeable.  Lately we have learned about cases of the participation of  Afghan mujaheddin in battles on the side of the Azerbaijani  army. What is the position of Turkey on this question?    [Demirel] Turkey opposes any development of events that  could  lead to the internationalization of the continuing conflict  between Azerbaijan and Armenia. In this conflict, Azerbaijan is  the party whose territory is occupied, and this gives it the  inalienable right to defend its territory against aggression. Of  course, the CSCE countries agreed among themselves to seek ways  of solving this conflict peacefully. Specifically for this  purpose the Minsk Group was established, and it is the only  forum where a just and long-term peaceful solution of the  problem can be found. As far as the interference of foreign  "volunteers" in this conflict is concerned, you should address  this question to the parties involved in this.    [Gagua] Turkey has accused Armenia that camps of Kurdish  terrorists are located on its territory. Armenia, in its turn,  has characterized these accusations as groundless and as being  made to please the domestic Turkish opposition. Could you not  talk about this in greater detail?    [Demirel] Indeed, we are encountering signs of the presence  of the RKK (Kurdish Workers Party) in various regions of Armenia  and in territories occupied by Armenia. Turkey is continuing the  conduct of investigations in regard to such information and is  verifying the authenticity of this information.    The authorities of Armenia have several times expressed  their  determination not to allow any activity of the RKK. However, it  would appear, the government of Armenia does not have full  authority and control in certain territories.    I firmly believe that a clear-cut position taken against  terrorism is a natural obligation for all states, and I am  convinced that the authorities of Armenia will be attentive to  the observance of this high obligation.    [Gagua] From the very beginning of the Karabakh conflict,  Turkey has undertaken active efforts to solve it. Does it not  seem to you that the presence of diplomatic relations with  Armenia and an embassy in Yerevan would facilitate these efforts.    [Demirel] Turkey is prepared to establish diplomatic  relations with Armenia if Armenia withdraws its troops from the  territory of Azerbaijan and begins to fulfill the norms of  international law after having put an end to the aggression  against Azerbaijan. It should be remembered that Turkey is the  first country which recognized the independence of Armenia and  invited this country to take part in the creation of the  Organization for Economic Cooperation of the Black Sea Countries  as a founding member. We have told them many times that they are  wrong. We have conducted negotiations with Mr Ter-Petrosyan and  other leaders of Armenia, we have proposed to them to take  practical steps. Our policy with respect to Armenia is not based  on enmity and we do not intend to carry out any hostile actions  in regard to Armenia.    But if they want to exist in this region as an independent  state, they must have good relations with Turkey. And then they  can have access to Turkish ports and to Turkish highways, and  they can make use of means of production in Turkey.    Armenian representatives have come to me and said that they  need assistance, that their population is starving. They asked  for wheat and I promised them supplies, they asked for electric  power, and I promised them a supply of electric power. But, you  see, they continue to kill people! They continue to occupy the  territory of Azerbaijan!    We have stated to the leaders of the European countries that  if the Western countries will publicly and openly support  Armenia, and the Muslim countries will come to the assistance of  Azerbaijan, a Muslim-Christian war will begin in the Caucasus.  We are friends of Azerbaijan and when they turned to us:  "Please, help us. We need your support and assistance, including  military," we replied: "We can do this. But then what? You see,  then the peoples of other countries will turn to us for  assistance!" We want the settlement of the conflict within the  framework of the existing state borders. I think, to a certain  extent we will be successful. When I was in Moscow, I talked  with Mr Yeltsin. We came out with joint declarations to the  effect that we will promote the settlement of this conflict. But  the opening of an embassy in Armenia will not help things from  the point of view of our public opinion. At the same time, you  know, Mr Ter-Petrosyan has come to Istanbul and to Ankara a  number of times. What is more, several days ago representatives  of Armenia and Azerbaijan were here. We talked very openly with  them.    [Gagua] What is your view of the criticism being expressed  by  Western countries in regard to the violations of human rights in  the south-eastern regions of Turkey?    [Demirel] Human rights constitute one of the cornerstones of  the new European and world order. We share the position  according to which this is no longer an internal issue of the  state, that this is the common concern of the world community.    In the last few years a number of important initiatives in  the sphere of human rights have been undertaken. An important  improvement in this has been introduced by the Turkish criminal  code, which allows arrested persons the presence of their  lawyers at every interrogation. The same law provides for a  significant reduction of the time in custody. Another  significant event is the recent closing of all tribunals for  extraordinary cases and the transfer of these cases to civil  courts. Moreover, the courts are actively involved in the cases  of the bureaucrats and officials who have committed human rights  violations, and they will hand them a court sentence if their  guilt is proved.    The situation with human rights in Turkey must be assessed  in  the context of the terrorism that the country has encountered.  Terrorism is the chief enemy of human rights. Terrorism is not  only in and of itself the most serious and large-scale form of  violation of human rights, but it is also an obstacle to  progress in the sphere of human rights. Thus, Turkey, by taking  all measures for the struggle against terrorism within the  limits of the observance of human rights, is fully resolved to  liquidate this evil in order to protect the rights of its  citizens.    [Gagua] Not long ago you advocated the abolition of the  United Nations sanctions against Iraq. Do you thing that Irak  has fulfilled all the conditions enacted for this country by the  world community, or were you guided by some other reason?    [Demirel] When I turned to the question of United Nations  sanctions against Iraq, I expressed the view that the sanctions  have not led to positive changes, but, on the contrary, have  brought the people a great deal of suffering. I also mentionedd  the very heavy burden which Turkey continues to bear because of  the sanctions.    However, I also pointed to the fact that Iraq continues to  fulfill the requirements advanced by the United Nations in order  to again occupy a place in the world community. I emphasized the  significance of Iraq's return into the world community, both for  Iraq itself and for the entire region. In what way this will be  attainedd must be decided within the framework of the United  Nations.    In conclusion of our conversation I would like to say that  my  message to Mr Yeltsin, transmitted through our prime minister,  contains the wish for the successful completion of the reforms  in Russia.    The attention of the entire world is now riveted on Moscow.  If Moscow continues to be trusted, this will only be to its  benefit and advantage. I wish Russia the successful completion  of the transition from a communist state to a democratic state,  from Marxist to a market economy. We know that this is not easy.  But Turkey wishes Russia success, perhaps more than any other  country in the world.</p>

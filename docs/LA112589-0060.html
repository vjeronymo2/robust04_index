			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES: A STRENUOUS WEEKEND  </P> <P> Can Brian Kerwin survive this weekend? It's still up in the air.  </P> <P> By Sunday, the actor will have prepared two Thanksgiving dinners, finished  memorizing his lines for the one-man "A Poster of the Cosmos" (for the Dec. 11  "Because We Care" AIDS holiday benefit at the Taper), and put in eight 3  1/2-hour performances of "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" at the Doolittle --  one on Tuesday, two on Wednesday, two on Friday, two on Saturday and one on  Sunday.  </P> <P> "After the first rehearsal, I just shook," says Kerwin, who's Nick to John  Lithgow and Glenda Jackson's George and Martha.  </P> <P> "For 3 1/2 hours, I'm either being berated or berating someone else. It's also  a progressive situation of drunkenness. I walk in the door already loosened up  and go downhill from there. By the second show, I really do feel hung-over, a  little woozy. I went to a doctor once who said, 'Your body doesn't know you're  faking up there.' It's true."  </P> <P> "Cosmos" offers its own Angst.  </P> <P> "Lanford Wilson wrote it to be done at AIDS benefits," Kerwin says of the  25-minute monologue, a man's statement to the police after the death of his  AIDS-stricken lover. Although he had been introduced to the piece some time ago  by director David Galligan, the call to do it for this benefit came out of the  blue -- and right in the middle of his Doolittle run. "I said, 'Sure, I've got  all the time in the world.' "  </P> <P> If he survives his theater commitments, the actor can relax and look forward to  "Challenger," ABC's upcoming three-hour TV-movie about the 1986 shuttle  explosion.  </P> <P> "Of course, there was a lot of sadness," he says of his experience playing  pilot Mike Smith.  </P> <P> "But you can't play that tragedy. For them, there was no foreboding. Our movie  ends with the countdown, the engines starting -- and the astronauts' faces  beaming as they go into outer space." JANICE ARKATOV  </P></p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Germans press EU cause A weekend meeting between European Union and east European ministers highlighted German ambitions to advance the cause of EU enlargement to the east during its six-month presidency of the union. While ministers from Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Romania and Bulgaria remained enthusiastic about preparations for inclusion in the single market, they also outlined the difficulties of bringing their economies into line with richer neighbours. The challenge facing the six countries with associate membership is to set up appropriate legal and institutional frameworks and to harmonise legislation on competition and state aid. The commission plans to produce a White Paper next year establishing a programme for the associated countries to follow for adjusting their economies to the obligations of the internal market. The east European ministers said the greatest difficulties lay in competition policy. Harmonisation of rules on intellectual property rights was also singled out along with the introduction of technical standards on food, health products and the environment.</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Banker says aluminium prices are too low to finance smelter borrowing BANKS WOULD want to see the aluminium price at between USDollars 1,600 and Dollars 1,700 - nearly 50 per cent above the present depressed levels - before offering loans for new aluminium smelters, said Mr Louis Vincinguerra, former finance director of Pechiney and now a general partner at Banque Rothschild in France. Only at that price level would new smelters cover their full costs. Prices would return to that level if the industry shut down 1.5m tonnes of annual capacity, he suggested. That was far higher than recent estimates made by other analysts, but Mr Vincinguerra was considering not just the west in isolation but all the world, including eastern Europe. Eastern European producers should contribute to these cuts, he suggested, adding: 'They must learn that it is better to sell less aluminium at significantly higher prices.' Mr Vincinguerra said at Metal Bulletin magazine's annual aluminium conference in Montreal that only 3 per cent of western smelter capacity was profitable at today's prices. If annual aluminium demand grew at only 1 per cent it would be virtually impossible to claw back to a price of Dollars 1,600 a tonne. However, if the previous 3 per cent growth rate was resumed world stocks would start to go down from 1995 onwards, though it would take several years for all the excess to be absorbed. Nevertheless, there was no reason to be pessimistic about the future of the industry, he said. All the main markets - transport, construction, packaging and electric cable - were growing. Some 300,000 tonnes of aluminium capacity in Brazil, about 25 per cent of the total, was threatened with closure because of high power costs, Mr Ivo Barone, president of the Brazilian Aluminium Association, told the conference. Inefficiency and poor management at the state-owned power companies had boosted the cost of hydro-electric power to a level where it was absorbing as much as 35 per cent of the revenues of some smelters and making energy the single most significant cost. Alcan Aluminium had already shut 36,000 tonnes of capacity because of increased power costs and others in the industry would follow unless special power rates could be negotiated. Even the two new large export-oriented smelters in the north of Brazil - Albras and Alumar - were threatened when their special power contracts ended in 2005. One solution would be for the industry, which exports about 75 per cent of its production, to build its own power plants, but at present companies were not generating enough cash to do this because of the low world prices for the metal.</p>

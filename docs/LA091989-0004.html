			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 3 ABORTION FOES SURRENDER TO DO JAIL TIME BY CHOICE  </P> <P> Three anti-abortionists, convicted of trespassing during a July protest at a  San Marcos medical clinic, surrendered Monday in Vista Municipal Court to begin  jail terms, saying they preferred jail to the probation terms that would have  let them remain free.  </P> <P> The three, who were sentenced Friday by Vista Municipal Judge Harley Earwicker,  arrived at his courtroom promptly at 9 a.m. Monday, accompanied by about 10  supporters who sang the hymn "Amazing Grace." The three were handcuffed and led  away by sheriff's deputies.  </P> <P> "Probation would have been the easier way for them to go," said attorney Burton  Shamsky, who represented one of the three jailed defendants. "But they opted  for jail time because they didn't want any part of the restrictions that went  along with probation."  </P> <P> Earwicker had offered four defendants in the same case a suspended sentence and  probation instead of jail. But the terms of the two-year probation included a  promise on their part that they would not picket any closer than 100 feet at  the office of Dr. George Kung in San Marcos, that they commit no similar crimes  -- including trespassing, and that they pay fines and do community service.  </P> <P> One of the four, Nancy Scofield, 40, of Poway, agreed to the terms and was  released on probation Friday. But the other three defendants -- Dean Mesa, 30,  of San Diego, a former deputy sheriff who was also convicted of resisting  arrest; Georgina Cheek, 37, of Santee, and Angela Phelps, 31, of El Cajon -- on  Friday rejected Earwicker's offer. Cheek and Phelps face 60-day jail terms and  Mesa was sentenced to 120 days.  </P> <P> The judge ordered them immediately handcuffed and readied for jail, but then  agreed to let them remain free over the weekend so they could set their  personal lives in order, on the promise they would return to his courtroom  Monday morning.  </P> <P> All four were convicted Friday by the same jury of trespassing during the July  incident that attracted about 15 anti-abortionists to Kung's office on South  Rancho Santa Fe Road. All of the protesters left the office but the four, who  locked themselves together at their necks with U-shaped bicycle locks.  </P> <P> Mesa, who had been arrested at other abortion protests in San Diego County, was  also arrested for delaying and obstructing justice after he lifted his feet off  the ground as he was being led out of the office.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. James Romo, who prosecuted the case, said he had never  before heard of a misdemeanor case in which the defendants accepted jail time  over probation.  </P> <P> "The judge took great pains to explain to them that the terms of probation  didn't mean they couldn't picket or protest, but just that they had to stay 100  feet from that particular doctor's office," Romo said.  </P> <P> Still, the three preferred jail time. Romo said they would likely spend only  two-thirds of their time in jail -- based on expected good behavior -- and  could conceivably be released by the Sheriff's Department earlier, depending on  jail crowding. Both women were sent to the County Jail at Las Colinas.  </P> <P> Because they are serving time, they will face no restrictions on picketing  after their release -- as would have otherwise been the case had they accepted  two years' probation.  </P> <P> Mesa and Cheek represented themselves in court. Shamsky, who represented  Scofield and Phelps, said he concurred with the decision by the three to go to  jail rather than submit to the terms of probation.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RENEWAL PROJECT TO GET BOOST;  </P> <P> REDEVELOPMENT: MONTEREY PARK PREPARES TO INVEST ANOTHER $5 MILLION IN ATLANTIC  SQUARE. CONSULTANTS SEE LITTLE PROFIT FOR 30 YEARS.  </P> <P> Already embroiled in a property dispute that will delay completion of the  Atlantic Square Shopping Center project for at least a year, the City Council  is preparing to sink $5 million more into the redevelopment deal.  </P> <P> And although city officials say the new, revamped Mediterranean-style mall at  South Atlantic Boulevard and Floral Drive will give residents an attractive  place to shop, they concede that the benefits of increased tax revenue will be  long delayed.  </P> <P> "It will take many, many, many years for it to pay for itself," City  Councilwoman Marie T. Purvis said. "At least residents will have the  convenience of shopping in their own city. It would be foolish to back down at  this point."  </P> <P> Because of tighter lending policies due to the savings and loan crisis, the  city and its partner in the project, Champion Development Inc. of Long Beach,  will have to put up as much as $8 million more than the original $27-million  price tag, said Keith Breskin, the city's director of economic development.  </P> <P> Champion, which was originally to put up $15 million for the project, has  agreed to pay $18 million. Monterey Park officials must decide whether to make  up the difference, which could be as much as $17 million, Breskin said. The  city originally planned to spend $11.6 million on the project.  </P> <P> Although officials thought they could finish the project by Thanksgiving,  construction has not begun, mainly because of a dispute over how much the city  Redevelopment Agency should pay the mall's current owner, Milton Bilak.  </P> <P> A court hearing is set for Jan. 7, 1991, to determine the value of the land.  Breskin said that if all goes well, the developer will break ground next  spring.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a consultant's report released last week shows that Monterey Park  stands to make little, if any, net profit during the first 30 years the new  Atlantic Square operates.  </P> <P> By 2022, the city will have made about $100,000 profit on the project in 1990  dollars, according to a study by Kotin, Regan &amp; Mouchly Inc. of West Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> The consulting firm said total revenue to the city over the 30 years from sales  taxes, property tax increments under redevelopment law and other sources will  be $73.2 million, without allowing for inflation.  </P> <P> But the effects of inflation will be considerable, the report said. For  example, after 30 years the city will have received a total of $16 million in  sales taxes from the mall, but that will be only $3.4 million in 1990 dollars.  </P> <P> "We've never said this was a great business decision for a private entity to  make," Breskin said. "But this is a city. We don't do redevelopment to make  money. We've got to do things that benefit the populace. If we don't rejuvenate  (Atlantic Square) . . . we'll have a huge black hole in the city."  </P> <P> Mayor Judy Chu agreed. "It's not made to be a wildly successful financial  thing; that we knew coming into it," she said.  </P> <P> But if the city abandons Atlantic Square and allows it to decline further, Chu  said, the city's business outlook would be dim. Monterey Park's per-capita  sales tax revenue is among the lowest in the San Gabriel Valley, and rebuilding  Atlantic Square, which has lost a number of restaurants, department stores and  groceries, is seen as a key to boost the area.  </P> <P> The outlook for Atlantic Square has left one councilman doubting that the  city's projected benefits outweigh the risk.  </P> <P> "We are going to be saddled in heavy debt," said Councilman Samuel Kiang, who  cast the lone vote against tentative approval of the new financing agreement in  a closed session last week. "We will not recoup the costs. We will never recoup  the entire investment."  </P></p>

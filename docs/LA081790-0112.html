			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WOMEN MARINES GEARING UP TO GO TO MIDEAST;  </P> <P> DEPLOYMENT: THEY MAKE PLANS FOR THEIR CHILDREN, CARS, HUSBANDS, BILLS AND A  HOST OF OTHER THINGS SO THEY WILL BE READY TO MOVE FAST IF ORDERED TO SAUDI  ARABIA.  </P> <P> Women Marines at Camp Pendleton are scrambling to find a place for their  children, get inoculations, sign wills, figure out how to handle bills and what  to do with their cars -- all in preparation for possible deployment in the  Persian Gulf area.  </P> <P> "Women serving in roles that are going to be needed are preparing to go," said  Capt. Rose-Ann Sgrignoli, a Camp Pendleton Marine Corps spokeswoman. "If her  job is essential to the mission, she will be there."  </P> <P> That has meant special hardships for some Marines. One Camp Pendleton-based  Marine took her two mentally handicapped toddlers to stay with a sister in  Florida in case she is called. Another made arrangements with an Oceanside day  care center to have her husband pick up their children. And as U.S. military  muscle gathers in the Middle East, women in such units as the First Force  Service Support Group at Camp Pendleton are scurrying to get ready for possible  deployment.  </P> <P> Still, they say, they will be ready should the time come.  </P> <P> "My father didn't think I had it in me to complete Marine Corps training," said  Cpl. Dawn Anderson, 24, "but I did it. And if my country needs me, I am ready."  </P> <P> Women throughout the military face the same dilemma: They can carry a gun but  they are not suppose to fight -- though they are allowed to defend themselves.  Prohibited by law from actually fighting, women can work in a variety of  non-combat positions, such as technicians, mechanics and doctors. During the  invasion of Panama, however, American military women were reportedly fired upon  and returned fire.  </P> <P> About 10% of all Marines, and those at Camp Pendleton, are women. The North San  Diego County camp is home to about 36,000 Marines, but officials refused to  reveal how many women were destined for the Middle East.  </P> <P> At El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, spokesman Lt. Gene Browne said no women  stationed at the air base were among troops sent so far to the Mideast. He said  there are no current plans to train or ready any El Toro female Marines for  deployment to the region.  </P> <P> Elsewhere in the military, the Navy has 140 female sailors aboard support  vessels in the North Arabian Sea; of those, 34 are aboard the West Coast-based  ammunition ship Flint, Navy officials said. Army officials, while unwilling to  give actual numbers, confirm that they have sent women. And about 12% of the  Air Force now deployed in the Middle East "is, in all probability, female,"  said Major Lou Figueroa, a spokesman in Washington.  </P> <P> "Normally, women make up almost 14% of the Air Force, and we have not made any  exceptions over there," Figueroa said. "They do the same things they would  normally do with their units."  </P> <P> At Camp Pendleton, the tension is almost palpable. Public affairs officials  have added extra phone lines. And to help busy parents, who are now putting in  longer than usual shifts, two of the five on-base day care facilities at Camp  Pendleton have lengthened their hours so they tend children until 8 p.m.  </P> <P> All Marines who are parents have already signed an agreement indicating that  they have made provisions for their children, should they be deployed. In some  cases, the other spouse or family members are on standby to take care of  children.  </P> <P> But sometimes, a Marine will not have much time and a fellow Marine will care  for a colleague's child until family members arrive.  </P> <P> "In the Marine Corps, we take care of our own," Sgrignoli said.  </P> <P> At the base, both men and women are trying to prepare their personal world so  they can be uprooted at any moment.  </P> <P> "It is not the intent of the Marine Corps to preclude women from participating  in Operation Desert Shield," Sgrignoli said. "In keeping with Marine Corps  policy and operational concepts, the initial scheduled assault waves will not  include women. However, as Marine Corps service support (personnel) are  established and functioning ashore, women will serve alongside their male  counterparts."  </P> <P> And the strain of parents' preparations and deployments has begun to trickle  down to the children of Marines, day care center operators in Oceanside say.  </P> <P> "How do you explain to an 18-month-old? They don't understand," said Dorothy  Baker, director of the Ivey Ranch Day Care Center. "One day they have a parent;  the next day the parent is gone."  </P> <P> At Ivey Ranch, teachers are planning to have children tie yellow ribbons on the  walkway outside the facility. Teachers there cared for the two mentally  handicapped toddlers whose mother abruptly took them to Florida.  </P> <P> "Those little girls couldn't understand. I just hope it ends soon," Baker said.  "The mother was just distraught."  </P> <P> Women Marines, dubbed "WM's," who have endured the grueling 13-week boot camp,  say they are prepared.  </P> <P> "I don't have any apprehensions whatsoever," one female 17-year veteran of the  Marine Corps said. Her husband already has been deployed, she said, but she  figures her 15-year-old son can fend for himself if necessary.  </P> <P> "When you've put in as much time as I have, you don't hesitate when you have a  call to arms."  </P> <P> This woman, however, said she had, in fact, never been called to a combat area.  </P> <P> One female officer, based at Twentynine Palms, said she was looking over her  apartment, figuring out which of her possessions she might manage to pack along  to the Middle East. Marines will heft a duffel bag, wear a pack and tote a  carry-on bag, which can be filled with personal items.  </P> <P> Unlike others, she was more open about her anxiety.  </P> <P> "It's fear of the unknown. I don't think anyone goes to a situation like that  facing a madman and says they are not going to be scared," said the 24-year-old  officer, who requested anonymity. "It's just a natural fear -- one that a man  or a woman would feel."  </P></p>

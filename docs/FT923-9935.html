			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Gambling on the price of a ticket BUYING from an air ticket bucket shop is like trading on the futures market, according to Mr Chris Rogers, chief trading standards officer at Westminster City Council. The risk is high, but if you take the necessary precautions the financial benefit can be great. There is no need to buy from non-bonded bucket shops, said Ms Kim Winter, a project officer at the Consumers' Association magazine Holiday Which?. 'There are enough fully bonded specialist . . . operators, such as Trailfinders and STA Travel, for people not to risk anything outside,' she said. People dealing with unbonded bucket shops risk losing money or being stranded if the tour operator, travel agent or airline collapses. According to Holiday Which?, the best protection is to pay by credit card, making out the voucher to the airline, not the travel agent. If the flight or holiday falls through, the Consumer Credit Act makes the credit card and the travel company jointly liable. Mr Riaz Dooley, owner of Travel Bazaar, a non-bonded bucket shop in west London, said most scheduled flights required no insurance. 'The government of the national airline would be too embarrassed to leave passengers stranded if something went wrong,' he said. Package holidays can be fully protected with a travel indemnity insurance costing between Pounds 5 and Pounds 10, Mr Dooley added. Bucket shops that advertise at one price and try to sell at another should be avoided. Clients, he said, should pay no more than a Pounds 50 deposit on flights and the full fare should be paid in exchange only for the ticket. Charter flights have to be paid for in advance, said Mr Dooley, and customers should get a receipt with the Air Travel Organisers Licence number, which will guarantee a refund if the company fails.</p>

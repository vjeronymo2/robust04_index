			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Channel 4 loses programme battle Channel 4 has failed in the first round of its battle to take the Broadcasting Complaints Commission to judicial review over a programme involving two former chancellors of the exchequer, Lords Lawson and Howe. Mr Justice Popplewell has refused Channel 4 permission to go to judicial review after looking at written submissions. However Mr Michael Grade, Channel 4 chief executive, is determined now to seek a full hearing. The row between the channel and the BCC is over a programme on monetary policy, A Brief Economic History of Our Times, made by Fulcrum Productions. The commission found that the programme was accurate but decided that if the two Conservative peers had known how critical the programme was going to be of their handling of the economy, they would not have agreed to take part.</p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Observer: Semantics The mooted Anglo-French wedding between retailers Kingfisher and Darty has run into problems already. While Kingfisher's statement merely mentioned 'discussions', Darty's went further and said the talks concerned a 'rapprochement'. The British news services checked their dictionaries, translated the word as a 'link-up', and rumours that Kingfisher was merely discussing taking a stake in Darty started to spread. In the end Darty had to swallow its pride and admit that its 'rapprochement' was more akin to the Anglo-Saxon definition of the word takeover. Didn't Yves Saint-Laurent use the same linguistic ploy before it was gobbled up by Sanofi?</p>

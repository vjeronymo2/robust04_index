			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Survey of Design in Europe (2): Skin-deep styling is not enough / Assessing industrial design's commercial clout over the past 15 years From Olivetti to Fiat, Braun to Citroen, the commercial power of industrial design in Europe's mass markets - not merely the elite niches occupied by the likes of BMW and Bang &amp; Olufsen - has been evident for decades to any manager who cared to look. During the past 15 years, under a variety of influences (notably the exemplary effect of Sony and other Japanese imports), the proportion of companies which exploit industrial design to its full creative potential, rather than simply treating it as skin-deep styling, has started to soar. Converts since the late 1970s include Philips, Volkswagen and Ford of Europe  -whose commitment paved the way for its US parent company's conversion. The remarkable success of the Ford Taurus, launched in 1985 and last year still the best-selling car in the US, has not only changed the face, but also the character, of American cars. And, more than any other single exemplar, it has fired a new commitment to design among a wide range of other US companies: for example, its arch-rival General Motors, Apple, Black &amp; Decker, and Rubbermaid. (The last four companies all won gold awards in this year's US Industrial Design Excellence Awards, announced last month.) The new-found pre-eminence of design in these companies' priorities is not merely a matter of copying the actions of successful rivals. It is also the result of careful strategic analysis. This shows that, with technology, quality, low-cost manufacturing and high-class service all becoming competitive commodities as industries mature, a product's shape, feel and character - together with, wherever possible, some unique functional features - are some of the few ways in which a company can now differentiate itself from the competition. Yet behind the new organisational awakening of design lies a set of paradoxes. If its commercial power has been manifest since at least the 1930s, why do so many managements still fail to recognise it? Why, when they do, have so many failed to give it sufficient weight within their organisation? Why, in spite of repeated design-led successes in the marketplace, have many of the design pioneers allowed their commitment to design to decay? The problem is not merely the generic tendency of any established organisational philosophy or practice to erode over time - much as marketing has shrunk in many consumer goods companies from an imaginative, broad-lensed way of thinking to a narrow set of processes and procedures. Design's problem is much greater for several reasons: It tends to be overlooked in the strategic concepts which most managers use. Academics and consultants have failed to develop a powerful typology of the various constituents of design - the equivalent of marketing's 'four P's'. Design's historically junior position within the corporate hierarchy, buried deep beneath marketing or engineering, makes it hard for management to give it sufficient weight alongside other functions. This is true even in the rapidly growing number of companies where product development has been reorganised from a traditionally sequential set of department-by-department activities, into a parallel process in which specialists of all kinds work together in integrated teams. Even in companies where design is at last being taken seriously, it tends still to be seen only as a 'soft', lightweight, right-brained activity by managers whose education has been largely left-brained, verbal, linear and analytical. Various 'harder' aspects of design need to be recognised. In countries - unlike Italy and Japan - where right-brained, visual, synthesising skills carry a lower social status than left-brained, analytical ones, designers are seldom taken seriously by the organisations for which they work. They tend to be seen as third class citizens, rated even more lowly than the engineers. Even when top management recognises the potential power of design and the versatility of designers, and tries to unleash their hidden potential, the way is often barred by turf warfare with engineers and/or marketing specialists. Even among the corporate design pioneers, these inhibiting factors tend to assert themselves as the years pass, especially when the original top management gives way to a new generation. This is true of Olivetti, Braun and IBM. For all these reasons, most companies need to undertake a voyage of 'executive discovery' - or rediscovery - about design's potential role in strategy. Under Mr Don Petersen, its former chairman, Ford undertook that voyage successfully, at least in the US. In Europe its commitment faltered a decade ago after launching its avant-garde Sierra, partly because of the car's early commercial problems but also because the company's long-standing power barons (its departmental heads) fought against the introduction of an effective cross-departmental system of 'programme management.' Only when this was finally given its head, in the European-US Mondeo development project, could the European designers again pull their full weight as equal members of the product development team, along with engineering, production, marketing and so forth. Ford's start-stop-start use of industrial design in Europe holds any number of lessons for companies which have yet to embark on their own voyage of executive discovery about the commercial power of design - or need to take a revision course. The themes in this article will be explored in greater depth in Developing Strategic Thinking, a book edited by R. Garratt which will be published by McGraw Hill in the autumn.</p>

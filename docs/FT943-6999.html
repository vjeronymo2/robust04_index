			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: Pioneer advances to ADollars 152m for year Pioneer, the Australian-based building materials and petroleum refining group, yesterday announced a ADollars 152.3m (USDollars 111.90m) profit after tax and abnormal items for the year to the end of on sales of ADollars 5.62bn. The figure contrasts with ADollars 136.6m in the previous year, when sales were ADollars 5.24bn, but comparisons are muddied by abnormal items and asset sales. The company took a ADollars 99.8m charge in the latest year to cover asset write-downs and rationalisation costs which followed a group-wide review of the company's position. This was partly offset by profits from the sale of two significant assets, leaving the net abnormal charge at ADollars 37.9m. In the previous year there was an abnormal surplus of ADollars 11.4m. Pioneer said that operating profit, before interest charges, improved to ADollars 371.1m from ADollars 312m. The upturn came entirely from the building materials interests, which span Europe, the US and Asia, as well as Australia. These made an operating profit of ADollars 272.3m, compared with ADollars 149.2m last time. Pioneer said that product volumes had increased slightly, and market conditions improved in most areas. It added that the increase was driven by increased efficiencies. On the petroleum refining and marketing side, it reported a fall in operating profits from ADollars 194.1m to ADollars 143.8m. This was due to retail discounting and weak refining margins. However Mr John Schubert, who took over as managing director last year, said that he expected some improvement on both fronts this year, as economic conditions continued to improve and refining margins edged higher. Earnings per share after abnormals were 17.3 cents, up from 15.7 cents.</p>

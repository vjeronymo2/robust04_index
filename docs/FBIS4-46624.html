It made  an attempt to dispel only one myth--the supposedly high combat  readiness of the Black Sea Fleet and its ability to defend the  interests not only of Russia, but also of Ukraine at the  southern maritime boundaries.    In the article offered here I would like to dwell once again  on some of the persistently widespread myths surrounding the  Black Sea Fleet, and express my own view of the realities.    Since the time the state sovereignty of Ukraine was  proclaimed, the command of the Navy of the Russian Federation  and the Black Sea Fleet, many political figures in Russia and  some highly placed officials in the Crimea and Sevastopol,  Russian and pro-Russian, and the mass media so inclined, have  obsessively and purposefully tried to instill in the  consciousness of the citizenry the idea that Ukraine does not  need its own Navy, that its interests, like the interests of  Russia in the southern maritime regions, are soundly protected  by the Black Sea Fleet.    My prior article discussed the emptiness of that assertion  because of the poor fighting ability of the Black Sea Fleet,  which is continuing to grow weaker, and its poor current and  future combat readiness. That is just one side of the coin, and  not even the main one. The main one is the fact, as practice  shows, that the Black Sea Fleet has not once in the last two  years shown itself to be disposed in a friendly manner toward  Ukraine, to be passionate about its sovereignty and state  interests. Its command and certain structures, including such as  the editors of the newspaper FLAG RODINY, the press center and  some others, are constantly spreading--among the personnel and  inhabitants of Sevastopol, Crimea and outside its boundaries--an  exclusively negative attitude toward Ukraine and its armed  forces, especially the Navy. This frenzied anti-Ukrainian  propaganda, often based on shameless lies and disinformation, is  growing stronger. It is not for nothing that the Minister of  Defense of Ukraine was recently forced to declare that the press  center of the Black Sea Fleet, in being transferred to the  territory of Ukraine, was waging direct subversive activity  against it.    The command of the Black Sea Fleet, while constantly  professing its readiness to protect the interests of Ukraine,  acts quite the contrary when even small practical steps are  required of it. When, for example, a mine was discovered  recently at the mouth of the Danube, they refused passage to the  Ukrainians to disarm it. The same thing had occurred in the  Black Sea Fleet before, when ordnance was found on the territory  of Holland. One cannot count on the Black Sea Fleet, as we see,  even on such issues. But the events in Odessa and many other  instances provide convincing grounds to conclude that even  today, when the Black Sea Fleet is still the joint property of  the two states, Ukraine not only cannot count on the protection  of its interests, but is also itself in need of protection  against its provocative and unfriendly actions. And what will  happen when it becomes the property of Russia alone?    The situation that has taken shape in Crimea and Sevastopol  shows that anti-Ukrainian political forces see in the Black Sea  Fleet solid support for their attempts to violate the  territorial integrity of Ukraine and separate the Crimea from  it. The Black Sea Fleet command is not only not impeding the  dragging of the fleet into political intrigues, but is even  encouraging them and serving as an example of them themselves.    The command of the Navy of the Russian Federation and the  Black Sea Fleet, trying in every way possible to discredit the  Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and its Navy, accusing them of  supposedly forcibly resubordinating some of the subunits and  units of the Black Sea Fleet to themselves. Matters have even  come to such absurd assertions as, they say, an officer of the  Ukrainian Navy has in some way resubordinated more than a  hundred units and subunits. They are quite silent about the  "prigrabization" actions of the Black Sea Fleet therein. Those,  meanwhile, are quite striking, and were launched much earlier,  back in 1992. They are being carried out in three  directions--seizing what is others', moving things to the  Russian Federation, and selling things off.    The Black Sea Fleet, in unilateral fashion grossly violating  the agreements that had been reached earlier between Ukraine and  Russia, grabbed--so that they would not get into the armed  forces of Ukraine--all of the units and subunits in the Black  Sea region that used to be subordinate not to it, but rather to  the USSR Ministry of Defense and the Naval Main Staff--that is,  to central elements.    That fate befell, for example, the test center in Feodosiya  with its subordinate units stationed on a territory of 256  hectares. A shipyard in the same Feodosiya, which occupies an  area of more than 30 hectares. The Metalist shipyard in the city  of Balaklava was seized, with grounds of close to six hectares  that belonged to it. In Sevastopol they include the 13th  Shipyard (16.2 hectares), the missile and artillery weaponry  repair plant (7.4 hectares), and certain design bureaus (0.72  hectares).    The naval planning institutes, the general-contractor  administration of the chiefs of operations, ZBI plants, plants  for metallic structural elements, the directorate for production  and engineering equipment and many other facilities of the navy  of the former USSR in Sevastopol, Yalta, Yevpatoriya, Myrnyy,  Sakakh and other garrisons passed to the possession of the Black  Sea Fleet in the same manner.    The Black Sea Fleet began the redeployment of a number of  ships and vessels and the removal of valuable equipment and  property to the Russian Federation as early as February of 1992.  Decoding gear whose estimated value is approximately 120 million  dollars was removed from Odessa.    Three special vehicles of the medical service were sent to  Moscow in May of 1992, along with five UAZ vehicles from the  inviolable reserves of the Black Sea Fleet chemical service in  Novorossiysk. An experimental submarine was sent for repairs in  November, and has not returned to the Black Sea Fleet.    A similar practice of replenishing the other fleets of  Russia  at the expense of the Black Sea Fleet has continued in 1993 as  well. Two assault craft and the VOKhR command of the Black Sea  Fleet air forces were relocated from Sevastopol to Novorossiysk  in May. A small ASW ship went to the Northern Fleet. This is a  far from complete list of the transfers of forces and funds of  the Black Sea Fleet to Russia without the consent of the  Ukrainians. That is how the Black Sea Fleet is "protecting" the  interests of Ukraine.    Seventy percent of the facilities from the system of  communications gear uniting the 170 laboratories of the Black  Sea Fleet have been commercially leased since the start of 1992  by their chief, Colonel V. Kostrov. The Samarkand small  enterprise was given a hectare of land at Kozachiy Bay for the  organization of its production the same month by decision of the  Black Sea Fleet command.    Eleven motor vehicles that belonged to the Black Sea Fleet  medical service were sold to commercial structures for 300,000  rubles apiece in August of 1992, with the sanction of the  commander of the Black Sea Fleet. The commander of the Black Sea  Fleet approved a purchase-and-sale agreement for a fleet  facility for 60 million rubles the same month.    The commander of the Black Sea Fleet issued a directive for  the refitting and sale of two motor vehicles of the chemical  service of the Black Sea Fleet through the 115 traffic service  offices in October of 1992.    The chief of the OFI of the Black Sea Fleet gave written  permission in 1992 to the Akhtiar small enterprise to sell as  scrap metal four decommissioned submarines on which the removal  of equipment containing non-ferrous metals, including precious  metals, had not even been carried out.    Two submarines and the PS Kuban that had been repaired in  Bulgaria were left in that country, supposedly in payment for  debt, in 1993 by decision of the deputy commander-in-chief of  the Navy.    The Donbass exploratory vessel was sold to commercial  structures that same year.    Ukraine is to receive 50 percent of the funds from the sale  of Black Sea Fleet property in accordance with the international  agreements. It has not received a single kopeck, however. That  is how the Russian admirals show their "concern" for the  interests of Ukraine and the combat readiness of the Black Sea  Fleet; while selling off the Black Sea Fleet, they are noisily  shouting that the Ukrainian Navy is encroaching on it,  constantly increasing tensions so as to hide their dishonorable  deeds. That is why they have offered so much resistance to the  desire of the Ukrainians to inventory the Black Sea Fleet.    The Russian media, from the representations of the Black Sea  Fleet press center, are constantly stirring up public opinion  and making attempts to accuse Ukraine and its Navy of  destabilizing the situation in the Crimea and Sevastopol.  Numerous instances, however, testify to something else--the  Black Sea Fleet itself is doing all its can for that purpose. It  is today incapable of performing the operational-strategic tasks  in the Mediterranean and other areas of the world's oceans that  it used to be assigned; not knowing what to do in the Black Sea,  it has, based on the territory of Ukraine, selected for itself  one of the main tasks of opposing the affirmation of its  independence and the building and emergence of its Navy.  Corrupting itself and destroying itself, it has an attitude  toward the Ukrainian Navy not as the fleet of a friendly nation,  on the territory of which it resides and whose waters, land and  means of existence it makes use of, but rather as its enemy.    Here are just a few instances of this aspect. As soon as the  staff of the Ukrainian Navy [VMSU] had begun to be formed in  April--May of 1992, a mobile reconnaissance system of the Black  Sea Fleet mounted on a GAZ-66 truck made a systematic radio  survey of the radio systems and radio emissions of the  communications gear of the VMSU.    A group of Marines from the Black Sea Fleet made an  incursion  onto the territory of a SAM brigade of the Ministry of Defense  of Ukraine on 31 March 1993, and attacked its servicemen.  Private Levchuk was beaten, and the windows in the housing  complex were smashed.    An Mi-8 helicopter of the Black Sea Fleet air forces made  unsafe overflights and photographed the military compound of a  battalion of Marines and other facilities on 2 July 1993.    The patrol service of the Black Sea Fleet at a checkpoint  near the entrance to the city of Sevastopol committed the  illegal act, on 12 July 1993, of detaining and listing  servicemen from the Ukrainian Navy, with the discovery of the  numbers of their military units, ranks, positions and so on.    Similar and more sweeping unlawful actions by the Black Sea  Fleet against the armed forces, including the Navy, of Ukraine  have not stopped. Periodic announcements to units and formations  of "enhanced combat readiness," the recent attempt to attack the  command post of a PPO [air-defense] unit in Sevastopol, the  sending of their agents to naval subunits, the ban--by order of  Chief of Staff of the Black Sea Fleet Vice-Admiral P.  Svitashov--on unsanctioned contacts by officer personnel with  the officers of the VMSU, the removal of some pilots of  Ukrainian nationality from flights in units of the air forces of  the Black Sea Fleet--this is a far from complete list of the  "fraternal" acts of the Black Sea Fleet with regard to Ukraine  and its servicemen.    Much could be said about the dishonorable acts of the Black  Sea Fleet command. And however they may strain, whatever  unpleasantness and ill will some Black Sea admirals and officers  may resort to, independent Ukraine will never yield the right to  have a mighty, battleworthy and modern Navy on the Black Sea. As  for the statements of the commanders of the Black Sea Fleet  about its high battleworthiness and ability to protect the  southern borders of the interests of Ukraine and all of the CIS  countries as well as Russia, that is nothing more than empty  talk. As the facts cited above and many others testify, the  Black Sea Fleet, first of all, does not want to do it, and  second, as I emphasized already in my last article, it is  not--to put it mildly--battleworthy.    The Black Sea Fleet had already begun to deteriorate as  early  as the end of 1989. As many as a hundred combat vessels have  been decommissioned over the last year and a half alone. While  its combat core used to be close to 350 ships, it has only  15--20 percent of that number today.    The statements of Admiral A. Kalinin, the former commander  of  the Black Sea Fleet, are of a certain interest in this regard.  He justly complained in a recent television appearance that  whereas several years ago the combat might of the Black Sea  Fleet was roughly at a ratio of 4:1 compared to the Turkish  Navy, this year it is at 1:1 and could even fall further. The  commander of one of the SKRs of the Black Sea Fleet that has  been under repair for several years now declared quite candidly  on that same television program that the Black Sea Fleet is  aging, it is dying, that it would not be battleworthy at all in  2--3 years.    And that is indeed so. Virtually all of the combat vessels  of  the Black Sea Fleet are 15--25 years old, and their planned  repairs and dockwork are not being performed on time. Russia is  not currently building a single ship for the Black Sea Fleet.  They are pilfering, selling off and carrying off property, the  shore support infrastructure for the ships and units. The Black  Sea Fleet, as a result of all this, is already unable to perform  the task of covering maritime sectors of the territory of both  Ukraine and Russia. It requires protection itself now. Ukrainian  PPO units are forced to provide air cover for its ships and  shore facilities, insofar as it does not have its own system of  air defense.    The interaction of the fleet with the Odessa Military  District, which is part of the armed forces of Ukraine, and with  the Ukrainian naval border units has been lost virtually  entirely through the fault of the Black Sea Fleet command.    The financial situation of the Black Sea Fleet is very  grave.  It is, so to speak, in debt up to its ears. The officers and  warrant officers have not received their pay for two or three  months in some subunits and units, especially in Odessa,  Ochakov, Izmayil and some other remote garrisons.    This situation is naturally having an effect on their morale  and psychological state. And they are coming to serve in the  Ukrainian Navy--a new and promising structure--entirely  voluntarily, without any pressure on the part of the Ukrainians  and without any promises whatsoever.    Some may not believe me, but the naval command has appealed  to those collectives that have decided to pass under the  jurisdiction of the Ukrainian fleet to think seriously about  that step, warning that the salaries in the navy for both  servicemen and for civil employees are lower than in the Black  Sea Fleet. The commander of the Ukrainian Navy, Vice-Admiral V.  Bezkorovaynyy, has moreover directed the attention of the Black  Sea Fleet command to the alarming signals from the Ochakov,  Mikolayevka and some of the other so-called remote garrisons.  They have only promised "to investigate without fail" in the  Black Sea Fleet, however. This ended with the fact that the  people who did not want to be hostages to the situation, to  watch as the fleet disintegrated and is sold off, made the  choice in favor of the Ukrainian Navy.    I can thus state with all certainty that the information  that  has been spread about some forced resubordination of certain  units and subunits to the Ukrainian Navy is malicious slander  that cannot withstand any critical analysis. Only in  contradiction to any common sense could one imagine that the  navy would permit the formation of its subunits from people who  were forcibly transferred into them.    The Ukrainian fleet is being built and developed. The fleet  of Ukraine will exist despite any opposition. And only it should  and will protect the national interests of its state on the  Black Sea. And Ukraine, strictly speaking, has never made the  request that the Black Sea Fleet protect its state or any other  interests. We believe that it will not rely on such protection  in the future all the more. And for granting its bases, its  territory and facilities, its waters in lease to the fleet of  Russia in the future, it has the right to count on a fraternal  and good attitude toward it and respect for its laws, its armed  forces, its citizens. How could it be otherwise? How could any  lessor nation permit its own lessee to have an ill-disposed, the  more so hostile, attitude toward it?</p>

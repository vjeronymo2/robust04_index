			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> L.A. PHILHARMONIC TO REPEAT PROGRAM AT THE CENTER  </P> <P> An orchestral program of Mozart, Richard Strauss and Brahms sounds about as  predictable and familiar as possible. From these composers, however, Andre  Previn drew a curious and audacious agenda for the Los Angeles Philharmonic on  Thursday evening at Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.  </P> <P> The program, which repeats at the Orange County Performing Arts Center tonight,  began with a small contingent of strings and timpani, huddled together in the  middle of an otherwise empty stage. Their employment? The "Serenata Notturna"  by Mozart, K. 239, a witty, effervescent contemporary of the much better-known  "Haffner" Serenade.  </P> <P> A comic concerto grosso, the serenade offered gracious, grateful solo work to  violinists Sidney Weiss and Harold Dicterow, violist Dale Hikawa and bassist  Christopher Hanulik, with the buffo timpani punctuation provided by Mitchell  Peters. Previn kept matters well balanced and moving, though intonation  suffered surprising lapses.  </P> <P> The stage was not much more fully occupied for Strauss' "Metamorphosen." In  style a sort of heroically swollen chamber music of the gods, in spirit an  autumnal elegy, it received a suitably moody reading from Previn and 23  strings, clean and taut but also sounding muted and remote in the Pavilion  expanses.  </P> <P> These chamber orchestra offerings were matched with Brahms' Violin Concerto.  Contrast was clearly intended and inevitable, but soloist Joshua Bell also saw  to it that there was a real measure of integration.  </P> <P> Not that there was anything small-scale about his interpretation, although his  sweet, slender tone was occasionally overwhelmed in the big climaxes. Indeed,  his account was warmly expansive, restrained in tempos and generous in spirit.  </P> <P> But it was expressed with the conversational directness of chamber music.  Excepting some quirky accentuation, as in the beginning of the finale, it was  without rhetorical exaggeration.  </P> <P> Bell plays with a natural grace and simplicity, despite body language that  suggests a man trying to jump out of shoes glued to the floor. He seized the  bravura work with concentrated zest but left the deepest impression through  winning, ardent lyricism.  </P> <P> His substantial cadenza had in it much of Kreisler, as well as a fearlessly  personal and piquant development of Brahms' Hungarianisms.  </P> <P> The Philharmonic backed Bell with a solid, cohesive effort, sonically ripe and  focused. Previn maintained close contact with his soloist, reining in his  orchestra's intermittent attempts to forge ahead.  </P> <P>  Andre Previn conducts violinist Joshua Bell and the Los Angeles Philharmonic  tonight at 8 at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center  Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $10 to $30. Information: (714) 556-2787.  </P> <P> </P></p>

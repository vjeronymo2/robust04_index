			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COPPOLA TO RESHOOT PORTIONS OF 'GODFATHER, PART III'  </P> <P> After spending $55 million and six months behind the camera, director Francis  Ford Coppola will return to Italy to reshoot portions of his upcoming epic,  "The Godfather, Part III," according to sources close to the project.  </P> <P> The $5 million in reshoots -- one week in Sicily in early September, followed  by one week in New York, and involving stars Al Pacino and Diane Keaton -- will  boost the cost of the troubled production to more than $60 million, the sources  said. Coppola has said that the film was budgeted at $44 million.  </P> <P> Paramount Pictures President Sidney Ganis denied that there were problems with  the movie. He said "any costs associated (with the reshoots) were absolutely,  unequivocally budgeted" and involve "no major material whatsoever, only  incidental scenes."  </P> <P> Ganis declined to say whether Pacino and Keaton are involved in the new  footage.  </P> <P> Sources say the additional filming involves a love scene between Michael  Corleone (Pacino) and his ex-wife (Keaton) and the clarification of a plot line  about Corleone's connection to the Vatican.  </P> <P> "Godfather III" focuses on Corleone's attempts to legitimize his empire by  acquiring a European real estate firm, his Vatican connection and his  relationships with his estranged son and wife. When Corleone takes ill during  the height of a renewed gang war, he passes the baton of power to his  illegitimate nephew (Andy Garcia).  </P> <P> Both Paramount and Coppola have a lot riding on the much-heralded project. The  first two "Godfather" movies -- released in 1972 and 1974 -- together grossed  more than $700 million at theaters and earned another $100 million in TV and  video sales.  </P> <P> Paramount, which has lost its historical dominance at the box office, could use  another artistic and commercial success of that magnitude. The studio has been  trying to get "Godfather III" off the ground since 1974, when the first sequel  to Coppola's epic became a smash box-office hit and earned an Academy Award for  best picture.  </P> <P> For Coppola, "Godfather III" is a chance to revive his sagging reputation as  one of the country's premier filmmakers and to pay off debts that forced him to  put his Zoetrope Productions into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. He is being  paid $6 million to direct the film, sources close to the project say.  </P> <P> Staff writer Jack Mathews contributed to this story.  </P></p>

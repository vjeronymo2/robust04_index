			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALCOHOL, DRUG USE CITED IN ROSS FIRING  </P> <P> Fired sheriff's investigator Rickey Ross, freed from jail earlier this week  when murder charges against him were dropped, was terminated because of several  violations -- including the use of alcohol and drugs and misappropriation of  narcotics evidence, according to a letter released Wednesday by the county  Civil Service Commission.  </P> <P> The allegations, contained in a four-page April 27 letter to Ross from Sheriff  Sherman Block, represent the first public explanation of why the deputy was  fired.  </P> <P> The letter was released in response to reporters' questions to the Sheriff's  Department about whether Ross would be rehired in the light of Monday's  decision by the district attorney's office to dismiss three first-degree murder  counts against him. Ross had been held in County Jail since his arrest Feb. 23.  </P> <P> "By your actions, you have brought discredit and embarrassment to yourself and  the department," Block wrote.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Decision Appealed  </P> <P> Ross, 40, an 18-year veteran of the department, appealed Block's decision last  week. The commission is to decide Wednesday whether to hold a hearing on the  appeal.  </P> <P> None of Block's allegations were linked to the accusation made by the sheriff  and Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates in February that Ross had slain  three South-Central area prostitutes with his service handgun.  </P> <P> Reached at his Rialto residence Wednesday evening, Ross said, "On the advice of  my attorney, I have no comment" on Block's allegations.  </P> <P> His lawyer, Jay Jaffee, said he, too, could not comment because he had not  analyzed the allegations.  </P> <P> The Ross case, in the words of a ranking LAPD official, served to "tarnish" the  image of the department, because it was the LAPD's crime lab which --  apparently mistakenly -- linked Ross to the three slayings after forensic tests  on his 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Outside Evaluation  </P> <P> The official said Tuesday he would propose to Gates that outside experts, such  as those from the FBI, be brought in to find out whether the lab's operations  are flawed. Gates was not available to meet with staff on Wednesday, said the  source, who asked for anonymity.  </P> <P> The Ross case developed the morning of Feb. 23, when the off-duty deputy was  stopped in South-Central Los Angeles by police officers on what was described  as a routine traffic check. He was seated next to a prostitute and he drove  erratically away from the curb as officers approached the car, police said at  the time.  </P> <P> At the time of his arrest, Gates said there was evidence that Ross and the  woman had been smoking crack cocaine. No drugs, however, were found in the  deputy's system.  </P> <P> Block and Gates subsequently told a news conference announcing Ross' arrest  that he was a suspect in the murders of three prostitutes, based on the LAPD's  ballistics tests of a handgun found in the trunk of the deputy's county-owned  car.  </P> <P> Block, in his letter to Ross, alleged that the woman with Ross told  investigators "she was a prostitute who exchanged sexual favors for drugs. She  said that you provided a small piece of cocaine and at the time the officers  approached your vehicle, you and she were smoking cocaine together. She said  you were using a Pepsi can as a pipe, and she was about to perform an act of  oral copulation upon you." Additionally, Block said that after the alleged  incident with the prostitute, "an audit was conducted" of narcotics evidence  Ross handled during his recent assignment as part of a federal drug task force  at Los Angeles International Airport. It revealed, Block said, "that you had  failed to follow proper Sheriff's Department procedure in handling narcotics  evidence under your control."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Handling of Evidence  </P> <P> For example, Block alleged, Ross had indicated in a ledger he "had sent  narcotics evidence to the state for disposal. However, the transmittal document  for that transaction as well as the narcotics evidence has not been located."  </P> <P> The controversy over the LAPD's testing of Ross' handgun was similar to an  error in another high-profile case three years ago.  </P> <P> When murder suspect James Hawkins Jr. was arrested in 1986, police found two  guns they believed might have been used by Hawkins to kill two alleged drug  dealers.  </P> <P> Police firearms examiners had already determined that both men were killed by  bullets fired by the same gun. After examining bullets test-fired from one of  the recovered guns, they concluded that that gun was the murder weapon.  </P> <P> However an independent examination sought by defense lawyers found the gun was  not a conclusive match. Harvey Giss, a deputy district attorney in the county  prosecutor's special trials section, said he did not learn about the flaw in  the LAPD lab until confronted with it by the defense attorney during opening  arguments.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Second Examination  </P> <P> Subsequently, Giss said, he sought a second independent examination of the gun,  which confirmed that no conclusive matching of the weapon to the fatal bullets  was possible.  </P> <P> Unlike the Ross case, prosecutors were able to introduce other evidence which  resulted in the conviction of Hawkins.  </P> <P> Assistant Dist. Atty. Curt Livesay said Wednesday that after the district  attorney's office "communicated our concerns," the LAPD began requiring all  ballistics examiners' findings to be confirmed by a second examiner.  </P> <P> In the Ross case, a second examiner confirmed the errant finding by the lead  examiner, Detective Jimmy L. Trahin.  </P></p>

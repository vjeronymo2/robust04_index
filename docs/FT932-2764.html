			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Observer: Watchdog wanted Expect word shortly on who is going to replace Gerry Corrigan, as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Corrigan is not due to depart until August 20th. But today will be the last monthly board meeting of the NY Fed before Corrigan goes off on a long vacation and there is also a big farewell bash for him in New York tonight. The delay in naming Corrigan's successor is starting to cause a headache in the rest of the central banking community since he is also chairman of the Basle committee on banking supervision. Brian Quinn of the Bank of England would be an obvious candidate for the Basle job. But his chances might have been hurt by the fuss over the BCCI affair, and anyway the committee's first two chairmen, George Blunden and Peter Cooke, were both Bank of England types. Jean-Louis Butsch, secretary general of France's La Commission Bancaire is one possibility and the Dutch provided Corrigan's predecessor, the late Huib Muller. But Corrigan is the most senior central banker to do the job to date and the fact that the Basle committee is waiting to see who replaces him before making its own choice suggests that there is no obvious front runner.</p>

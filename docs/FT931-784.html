			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Books: Taste of the sublime - FT Children's Book of the Month THINK OF AN EEL by Karen Wallace, illustrated by Mike Bostock Walker Books Pounds 6.99, 32 pages PUBLISHERS of information books for children seldom overcome a problem inherent in the very idea of communicating information. The information bearer is, by his very nature, a passionless creature who exists to draw attention to his message. He must not stand in the way of what he lives to communicate; he must not make an independent spectacle of himself. He must be a superlative technician, and not an author in his own right. Proof of the fact that publishers of this kind of book approve of this approach and, indeed, consider it necessary for economic and other reasons, is to be found in umpteen series of books - because information books are, generally speaking, published in multiples. Consider, for example, the new Kingfisher 'Little Library' series, the first eight titles of which are published this month. The format, pagination and price (at Pounds 1.99 each they represent extraordinarily good value for money), are all uniform and the first eight titles cover the following subjects: jungle animals, ballet, castles, space, dinosaurs, jet airliners, horses and helicopters. Text, illustrations and artwork are crisply and competently executed, and no young reader is likely to come away dissatisfied. And yet there is a problem, and it centres on that question of authorship. All these books are written by the same person, Christopher Maynard, who has done an excellent job throughout within the limits imposed by the idea of the series itself. But how can Christopher Maynard hope to bring an individual, let alone a quirkish, approach to such a vast range of subjects? That is the problem: he is not so much an author as a jobbing technician who is hired for his general level of expertise in a remarkable variety of subject areas; next month, such a person might well be at work upon a four-volume history of the Crusades of 128 pages each for ten-year-olds. Another matter is the question of re-use of material from other books. According to a note that appears on the copyright pages, some of the material used in the 'Little Library' series is not original - it was first seen in the 'Kingfisher Dippers' series of 1989. Publishers of non-fiction - especially of cookery books - have in the past made a habit of re-using artwork, and the practice itself underscores the argument that the desirable end in view from the point of view of the publisher is not so much a book that is particular to one author (Christopher Maynard's name does not even appear on the covers of his books; you have to look at the title pages to discover who has written them) as an appealing amalgam of words and visuals at an irresistible price; not so much a book as a commodity. This month Walker Books have done something a little different from the rest of the pack by introducing an element of real authorship - and therefore a degree of passion and pleasing quirkishness - into the business of publishing information books. You can tell that something interestingly odd and unpredictable is afoot by the very titles of the first six books in the 'Read and Wonder' series: I Like Monkeys, Caterpillar Caterpillar, Think Of An Eel, All Pigs Are Beautiful, A Piece Of String Is A Wonderful Thing and Think Of A Beaver. Here we are already worlds away from the instincts of a marketing department whose aim is to provide 'books at competitive prices on subjects that children have a perennial interest in', namely dinosaurs, space, horses, et cetera. The texts are as various as their subject matters: one is written in a kind of rhythmical prose, often close to a chant; another is told as a story. Other useful items of information are strewn about the pages at random, not neatly boxed, as is usually the case. Nor are the illustrations closely guarded inside uniform grids and they differ in approach from book to book - oil pastels for one; black ink and water colour washes for another. There is everywhere a feeling of space, and a refreshing degree of inventiveness. But, above all, the authors have managed to give a sense of real individuality to the texts: there is both feeling and curiosity, and a wish to share particular enthusiasms. The well-known childrens' novelist Dick King-Smith, author of Sophie's Snail and The Whistling Piglet among many other titles, has written All Pigs Are Beautiful - and that seems entirely appropriate, because he spent 20 years of his life working as a dairy farmer. And which one is the best of this first batch? The most original in subject matter is undoubtedly Judy Hindley's unravelling of the mysterious history of string; but first prize must surely go to the collaboration between Karen Wallace and the illustrator Mike Bostock in Think Of An Eel. Why does this book succeed so well? The illustrations - watercolours, painstakingly built up in layers - capture the sinuous movements of eels to a quite uncanny degree; and the text itself is so bare and so simple that it enables the extraordinary facts of an eel's life - that strange progress from the Sargasso Sea and back again to the spawning ground - to speak for themselves. The world is a sublime and mysterious place, and children, whether infants or juniors, will get more than a taste of it - and for it - in this book.</p>

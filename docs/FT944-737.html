			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / SFO denies suppressing evidence in Guinness trial The Serious Fraud Office yesterday denied that it had deliberately suppressed evidence relevant to the first Guinness trial. Mr George Staple, director of the SFO, which prosecuted the case, said the decision to withhold from the defendants details of share operations similar to those at the heart of the Guinness case was based on legal advice that such details were not relevant. On Thursday, the Home Office ordered the Court of Appeal to review the convictions of the four businessmen prosecuted in the 1990 case: Mr Ernest Saunders, Guinness's former chief executive, Mr Gerald Ronson, the property developer, Mr Jack Lyons, the financier, and Mr Tony Parnes, the former stockbroker. 'We are not here to deny people's human rights. We are here to ensure so far as we can that people have a fair trial,' Mr Staple said. One of the main reasons for the Home Office's decision is that the defendants had not been made aware by the SFO during their trial of a judgment made by a City of London tribunal in 1988 on the legality of a series of share transactions carried out by TWH Management Limited. TWH had been involved in an operation to support Guinness's share price during the brewing company's takeover bid for Distillers in 1986. It had also been involved in six other share transactions, in which guarantees were given to the purchasers that they would suffer no losses from the deals. The tribunal ruled that 'there is no evidence that such transactions were improper'. However, the case against the four Guinness defendants was in part based on their involvement in similar operations to support Guinness's share price. Mr Alistair Darling, Labour's spokesman on the City, said the system of prosecuting and investigating fraud cases needed a complete overhaul. He said the Securities and Investment Board, the City regulator, should be more involved in prosecuting financial crime. The SFO's future is the subject of a government review by Mr Rex Davie, a former civil servant. Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, is expected in January to decide whether to end the SFO's independence and put it under the aegis of the Crown Prosecution Service. A merchant banker said: 'This leaves everybody deeply uncertain. On the one hand there is this beating of the drum about regulation and on the other hand any time anything gets into court it gets messed up.' Lord Spens, a defendant acquitted in a second Guinness trial, alleged that 'someone quite high up' must have ordered the suppression of information. Mr Staple denied that.

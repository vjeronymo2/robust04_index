			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Labour moves to head-off 'smears' LABOUR last night moved to confront alleged attempts to undermine Mr Neil Kinnock, the party leader, and its election campaign by pro-Conservative newspapers. In a highly unusual step Mr David Hill, the party's communications director, held an on-the-record briefing to disparage an as yet unpublished Sunday Times report on Mr Kinnock's connections with the Soviet embassy in the early 1980s. He said he had taken the action to head-off a growing campaign of attacks. Mr Hill claimed that the report, to be published tomorrow, was the latest in a series of attempts to 'smear Neil Kinnock and destabilise the Labour party'. Inquiries by Labour officials concluded that the report centres on documents sent by the Soviet embassy to the Communist party Central Committee in Moscow dealing with meetings between diplomats and the Labour leadership. Mr Hill said he wanted to draw advance attention to the story and efforts by Sun reporters to investigate Mr Kinnock's early life in Wales. He said it had been decided that in the period up to the general election attempts at character assassination would not pass unchallenged. Mr Hill went on to say that nothing had occurred in meetings between Mr Kinnock or other Labour leaders with Soviet ambassadors dating back to the 1970s that could damage the party. 'I do not believe there is anything that Neil Kinnock can have said that will be of embarrassment,' he said. Mr Andrew Neil, editor of The Sunday Times, said that this story was 'more fascinating than damaging', refuting that there was any element of a smear. He said that the story centred on comprehensive diplomatic traffic from Soviet ambassadors in London to Moscow on conversations held with Labour leaders including Mr Kinnock and Mr Michael Foot. It also contained Mr Kinnock's views on Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, during the year-long miners' strike, and those of Mr Scargill on Mr Kinnock.</p>

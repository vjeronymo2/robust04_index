			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Row over financing threatens future of UN development fund for small farmers THE FUTURE of the Rome-based International Fund for Agricultural Development, the United Nations' small farmer agency, is in doubt after the failure of donor countries to agree about a replenishment of its finances. Ifad is jointly funded by western countries and members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries; it is widely recognised as one of the most cost-efficient UN agencies. Set up in 1977, it makes interest-free loans to small farmers in developing countries and has lent about Dollars 3.6bn for 337 projects in nearly 100 countries. It claims these projects are helping to grow more than 40m extra tonnes of food a year. But Ifad has been bedevilled by funding arrangements under which western countries have traditionally contributed 60 per cent and the oil countries 40 per cent of its money. This arrangement has given rise to constant disputes in the last 10 years, with oil countries arguing that they should pay a smaller percentage because of lower oil prices. Four meetings last year failed to resolve the issue of who should pay how much for the fund's work for the next three years. A fifth meeting in Rome last week again ended with no agreement. Both groups agree that Ifad should be given about Dollars 600m for its next three years' work. But while the West wants to maintain the 60:40 ratio, the oil exporting nations want to contribute less. Saudi Arabia, the largest contributor in the Opec group, last week aroused consternation by refusing to say how much it was prepared to contribute. That gave rise to speculation that its support for Ifad was on the wane. In what seemed a veiled reference to Saudi Arabia, Mr Peter Freeman, Britain's representative on Ifad's governing council, which also met last week, said: 'If Ifad is to continue to perform a useful operation as a separate institution it needs the support of its membership as a whole. If some of the more prominent members feel that it has outlived its usefulness then there will come a point at which we have to recognise that fact. In my view we have not yet reached that point'. Ifad's hopes of survival are now pinned on its new president who was elected at the council to succeed Idris Jazairy of Algeria; Mr Fawzi Hamad Al-Sultan of Kuwait, an executive director of the World Bank, who served as director of the Kuwait Emergency and Recovery Programme in the aftermath of the Gulf war. The experience he gained in rebuilding Kuwait's economy is thought to have been the decisive factor behind his election. Mr Al-Sultan, who takes over as Ifad president this week, said he was keen to get the replenishment talks going again as soon as possible. Ifad now has about Dollars 150m a year coming in from its investments and loans, but unless donor countries contribute it may not be viable as a separate body. It hopes to lend Dollars 336m for 25 new agricultural projects this year. Just before leaving office at the weekend, Mr Jazairy said: 'If our funds are not replenished we shall have to cut down next year'. African countries who need support to move towards food self-sufficiency could be hit hard by Ifad's demise. More than two-fifths of its loans have been to Africa. The fund is now trying to finalise a loan that would help Somali farmers who were hit by last year's disastrous drought. But such work is in jeopardy unless it wins its survival battle.</p>

			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HANDYMAN Q&amp;A: HOME IMPROVEMENT;  </P> <P> DON'T GET TIED UP ON REMOVING SASH CORDS  </P> <P> QUESTION: One of the double-hung windows in our house has gone haywire. I am  fairly certain the trouble is with the sash cord. Can the cord be removed or is  it too much of a job?  </P> <P> ANSWER: Removing the sash is not difficult. Merely take off the stop moldings  on the inside. Use a chisel or putty knife and work very carefully, especially  if you intend to use the moldings again. If your aim is to replace the sash  cord with another of the same type, be sure to observe how the cord is  connected so you will be able to replace it without too much trouble.  </P> <P> Before you do this, however, look into the kinds of sash cords now on the  market. They are easier to use and install and are virtually indestructible.  </P> <P> Can Plywood Be Nailed Directly to Studs?  </P> <P> Q: When paneling an extra room with plywood, I can save a lot of time by  nailing the plywood directly to the studding. But I read somewhere that it is  much better to nail the panels to furring strips that have been attached to the  studs. This seems like extra work. Is it necessary or can I go ahead and nail  to the studs?  </P> <P> A: You can nail the plywood right to the studs, but then you risk the studs  warping or shrinking later on and causing the wall to be uneven. The furring  strips minimize the possibility of this taking place. In still another method,  you put up a drywall and then attach the plywood to it. In any case, no matter  which method of installation you use, buy the plywood ahead of time so it can  be kept in the room several days before application. This will give it time to  acclimate.  </P> <P> Powdered Pumice: Where to Buy It  </P> <P> Q: You recently told someone about using powdered pumice to smooth the surface  of a piece of furniture that had just been finished. I was unable to get it in  my local hardware store, which referred me to the local pharmacy. Sure enough,  the drug store carried it. Thought your readers would like to know.  </P> <P> A: Thanks. While most hardware stores and home center dealers carry the  powdered pumice, so do some drug stores and some art supply establishments.  </P> <P> Sawing Metal Takes Different Strokes  </P> <P> Q: I have cut a lot of wood, but I have never used a hacksaw. This time I have  to cut some metal. Is there any trick to it or do I just saw the same way as  with a crosscut saw?  </P> <P> A: Forget about the way you cut wood. With a hacksaw, you do not apply pressure  on the backstroke. The hacksaw must be held as flat as possible for an even  cut. Put the pressure on the forward stroke, release the pressure on the back  stroke. When possible, keep both hands on the hacksaw frame. Start the cut with  several short foward strokes. When putting the blade in the frame, the teeth  should slant forward.  </P> <P> Should Molding on Plywood Be Glued?  </P> <P> Q: To cover the edges of plywood, I plan on attaching molding to them. Should I  use glue or nails or what?  </P> <P> A: Use glue and then a couple of well-placed nails. Depending on the kind of  project you are working on, the finishing nails can be driven a bit below the  surface and the indentations filled with wood putty or other filler.  </P> <P> Patches Available for Hiding Holes in Wall  </P> <P> Q: The wallboard in our living room needs patching. I can handle most of the  job, but I'm not sure how to go about filling the few spots where there are  openings in the wall without anything behind them. Can I apply masking tape  over each opening and then cover with a patching compound?  </P> <P> A: Yes, but one of the modern products that will fill the bill is a ready-made  patch available in most paint stores and home centers. Tape it on according to  the directions and you will find it easy to disguise the patch when it is  painted.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The techniques of using varnish, shellac, lacquer, stain, sealer, bleach,  remover, etc., are detailed in Andy Lang's booklet, "Wood Finishing in the  Home," which can be obtained by sending $1 to Know-How, P.0. Box 477,  Huntington, N.Y. 11743. Questions of general interest will be answered in the  column.  </P> <P> </P></p>

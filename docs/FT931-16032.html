			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Unions may lose more members UNIONS are likely to lose a further 8 per cent of their members this year, Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU general union, said yesterday. In 1991 unions affiliated to the Trades Union Congress lost only about 5 per cent of their members and last year's figure is expected to be only slightly higher. However, a disproportionate number of the big job losses announced over the past few weeks have come from large unionised companies. There will also be greater pressure on jobs in the public sector with this year expected to be the toughest for them since the recession began. The membership of TUC unions will probably fall below 7m. The TGWU expects to lose about 8 per cent of its members - a slightly better record than in the past two years - and total membership will probably fall to just under 1m. The union has been hit by some examples of derecognition in the past year, but most of the membership loss has come through redundancies. Mr Morris said the financial and organisational state of the union had improved substantially since he took office nine months ago and would continue to do so this year. For the past year the TGWU is expected to report a surplus of nearly Pounds 5m compared with a deficit of Pounds 12m in 1991. That was achieved through cost-cutting and increasing subscriptions. Mr Morris stressed that internal reorganisation would continue this year. He said that the union had 'moved beyond factionalism and is now driven by a unity of purpose that has not been seen for a very long time'. He even predicted some areas of membership growth this year, particularly in civil air transport and among women. Union mergers could also boost the union and yesterday Mr Morris met leaders of FTAT, the 34,000-strong furniture union, to discuss possible terms for a merger. He called the planned change to the law which would require more regular approval of the automatic check-off of union subscriptions by employers 'a vindictive act by small-minded people'. But he added that it could have the benefit of forcing activists to collect union dues personally thus helping to put them back in touch with the members.</p>

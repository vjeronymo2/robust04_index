Data needs with respect to the FR 2004 series have changed in light of the Joint Report on the Government Securities Market submitted to the Congress in January 1992 by the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury Department, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Based on that report, significant changes to the FR 2004 series of reports have been recommended. A summary of those changes follows.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the Weekly Report of Dealer Positions (FR 2004A):  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Money market instruments and the addendum section are eliminated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Pass-through mortgage-backed securities and all other mortgage-backed securities are combined into one category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Federal agency securities are combined into one maturity category and two maturity categories of Treasury securities are eliminated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Option positions are reduced to long and short categories rather than purchased and sold calls, purchased and sold puts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Forward positions are reported with immediate positions under the title ``outright positions''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the Weekly Report of Cumulative Transactions (FR 2004B):  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The addendum section is eliminated and the Treasury, agency and mortgage-backed categories are abbreviated as on the proposed revised FR 2004A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;``Buys'' and ``Sells'' categories are combined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Primary Dealers are combined with ``customers'' (now called ``with others'') rather than brokers, and the ``all other'' category is eliminated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Forward transactions are reported with immediate positions under the title ``outright transactions''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the Weekly Report of Dealer Financing (FR 2004C):  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Customer categories are eliminated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Term agreements are reduced to one category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The categories ``cash collateral'' and ``securities and LC's'' are eliminated and replaced by securities received as pledge or pledged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Fails are condensed on the proposed report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the Daily Report of Dealer Positions in Treasury Financings (FR 2004WI):  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Gross long and short positions are replaced by purchases and sales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Net financing commitments are added.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the new Report of Specific Issues (FR 2004SI):  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;This is an entirely new report that is similar to the addendum sections of the current FR 2004A and B, except that it incorporates financing and fails.

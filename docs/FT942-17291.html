			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / World Trade News: Pace of global trade growth slows in 1993 World trade growth slowed last year but a hoped-for economic recovery in western Europe and Japan may offer brighter prospects for 1994, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade says in a report published today. The volume of world trade in goods rose by 2.5 per cent in 1993, well below the 4.5 per cent of 1992 but still ahead of world output growth of just under 2 per cent. The value of world merchandise trade fell by 2 per cent to Dollars 3,600bn (Pounds 2,425bn), reflecting the dollar's gain against European currencies and lower world prices for fuels and other minerals. Although only limited data are available, Gatt economists estimate that trade in commercial services may have increased by around 3 per cent last year, against 12 per cent in 1992, to reach Dollars 1,030bn. The report blames the 1993 slowdown primarily on recession in western Europe. Lower trade volumes and exchange rate effects led to a 10 per cent drop in the value of the region's merchandise trade, unprecedented in the post-war period. If trade within western Europe is excluded, the value of world goods trade rose by almost 2 per cent last year. The outlook for 1994 remains uncertain. Merchandise trade volumes could expand by more than 5 per cent if recovery takes hold in western Europe and Japan by mid-year, Gatt predicts. 'If, instead, delays occur. . . , trade growth is likely to be closer to last year's 2.5 per cent.' Trade and output grew fastest in North America, Asia and Latin America in 1993. Exports from Latin America and from six Asian exporters of manufactures (Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand) jumped by 9.5 per cent in volume terms, boosted by rising North American demand. This was reflected in changed rankings among the world's leading goods exporters. The US, Germany and Japan retained their top three places but, further down the league table, Hong Kong, Singapore and Mexico moved up two spots to 8th, 16th and 17th respectively, while Malaysia jumped three places to 19th. China, which is pressing to rejoin Gatt this year, ranks 11th. The rankings for commercial services exports show the US in first place, followed by France, Italy, Germany, Britain and Japan. Here, too, Asian exporters are gaining ground. Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan all feature in the top 20.</p>

For health reasons you are not attending your  trial as a participant in the August 1991 putsch. How, then,  can you take part in sittings of the Duma?    [Lukianov] I am genuinely sick, suffering from complications  linked with pneumonia, which is why I will have to return to the  hospital in two weeks. That explains my absence from the trial.  However, as you know, in the Duma every vote counts and costs  dearly. That is why I preferred not to take my temperature or  spare my efforts to place myself at the service of the Duma.  Furthermore, contrary to all expectations I have been appointed  the senior representative of the block of independent  representatives. Consequently, I will have to shoulder the  responsibility of temporary president of the chamber while  awaiting the election of the real president.    [Celerier] You were president of the Supreme Soviet, the  parliament of the USSR. What common points do you see between  that body and the Duma?    [Lukianov] Our Duma is an institution which has barely seen  the light of day, but it still bears traces of its Soviet  predecessors. Above all, it defends the interests of the people  who elected it.    Thus, the voters are entitled to recall their deputy if he  fails to respect the urgent mandate entrusted to him. The  deputy is bound by an indissoluble link with the people who  elected him.    [Celerier] And the differences?    [Lukianov] In the era of the Supreme Soviet and the supreme  body of the Congress of People's Deputies, the multiparty system  only appeared at the very last moment, just before our Soviet  system was destroyed. Unlike in the West, back then our parties  had emerged from political groups that had broken away from the  Communist party.    With the Duma, for the first time in more than 70 years,  party- based elections have been held. In the future, many  issues will have to be settled by agreement between these  parties.    [Celerier] Is it possible that the Communists and the  agrarians, of whom you are one of the leaders, will join forces  with the ultranationalists led by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy?    [Lukianov] You are wrong, the only group with which we could  really collaborate is the democratic party of Nikolay Travkin.  For, you will be surprised to hear, in my considered opinion,  the positions adopted by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy are closer to  those of the Choice of Russia (the presidential party - LE SOIR  editor's note) than to ours. For instance, he supported the new  Constitution and its presidential regime as well as the  abolition of the old Supreme Soviet by the coup d'etat in  October. All these being measures that we fought, but which fit  in remarkably well with the slogans of the "democrats."  <H5>  "The West Should Not Try To Destabilize Us" </H5>   [Celerier] How do you value Bill Clinton's visit to Moscow?    [Lukianov] This meeting with Mr. Yeltsin is necessary, but  it  will only prove beneficial if the U.S. President understands  that our president did not succeed in winning a vote of  confidence in the elections of 12 December. Unfortunately, I  fear that the U.S. Administration is not ready to take account  of the new hand that has been dealt, or of the fact that in  Russia the specter of politics looms much larger than the  "democrats" in power would like to have them believe.    If I could meet with President Clinton I could ensure him  that we are not anti-American. However, on the other hand,  neither the United States nor Europe should try to destabilize  our geopolitical position, especially with NATO.    [Celerier] Precisely, how do you see Bill Clinton's efforts  at mediation in the dispute between Russia and the Ukraine on  nuclear weapons?    [Lukianov] In private I would dissuade him from becoming  involved in either our internal or external affairs. However,  if he really wants to lower the popularity of Boris Yeltsin,  then he should by all means interfere. Remember Gorbachev. Any  foreign arbitrator in a conflict involving two Slavic countries  runs the risk of being sorely disappointed. Nonetheless, I wish  him good luck.</p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Boston bank sale exceeds plans BANK OF Boston said that it had sold 9m Series E Preferred shares - 3.2m more than the 6m preferred shares it originally planned to offer, Reuter reports from Boston. The bank which raised Dollars 223m in net proceeds from the offering, said the underwriting group, led by Merrill Lynch, exercised their right to purchase the maximum over-allotment of 1.2m shares. The offering would raise the bank's capital ratios by about 0.75 per cent, bringing the pro forma Tier I and total capital ratios to 6.7 and 11 per cent respectively, the bank said.</p>

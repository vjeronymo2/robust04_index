			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Qiu Xiaohua (6726 2556 5478): "Further Eliminate </F> Remnants of Old Concepts"]    [Text] Anyone who has been paying close attention to  China's experience in opening and reform can see that every time  there is some major accomplishment in this area, it is always  accompanied by a major breakthrough in people's conceptual  views. The history of China's 15 years of reform is really a  history of the Chinese people's continually studying, debating,  liberating their thinking and changing their ideas, all under  the leading banner of Deng Xiaoping's "building socialism with  Chinese characteristics".    After Deng Xiaoping's visit to the south of China in 1992,  many people breathed a sigh of relief. They believed that the  theoretical puzzle which had been murky for years had now been  clarified now by comrade Xiaoping's thunderous voice, and the  theoretical barriers to further reform and opening theory had  been eradicated, and the only question remaining in establishing  the socialist market economic system was how to operate it. But  I am not so optimistic.    To be sure, the 14th Party Congress determined that China's  reform objective is to establish the new socialist market  economic system, thus ending disputes over the goals of reform.  It reached agreements concerning the general direction of reform  for the party and the nation, such as, "the ice jam has been  broken, the shipping channels are open." However, to really  break the invisible conceptual shackles on reform and opening  and social development, there is much hard work still remaining  to be done. This is because it will for some time be hard to  heal the remnants of old concepts produced by traditional  socialist theory and practice, and these are still preventing us  from going forward. These "remnants" concentrate on three  aspects: 1) "Is it the socialism or capitalism"; 2) "Is it State  ownership or private ownership"; 3) "What is the real  relationship between plan and market"? Although comrade  Xiaoping's speech on his visit to the south of China brought  people a great way forward in understanding these questions, it  is still far from resolving many people's uncertainties. In the  practice of reform and opening, it is usually the case that  these ingrained "remnants" quietly pop up, affecting people's  vision and restricting their activities.    So, it is still necessary for us to hold multiple  "consultations" on these "remnants."    --Concerning "capitalism or socialism." In reality, there  has  never been fixed, inflexible capitalism, nor fixed, inflexible  socialism. Real capitalism and socialism have in many regards  surpassed what they were designed to be in Marx's time. Marx  never put socialism absolutely in opposition to capitalism;  rather, he stressed that socialism spun off from capitalism,  developing capitalism's good factors and abandoning its bad  aspects. Socialism with Chinese characteristics is no longer the  socialism in the past meaning of a planned economy rejecting  markets, but a combination of China's situation and socialism.  This socialism combines the general socialist system with market  economics, a socialism which embodies the future course of  societal development. The nature of socialism is to create much  higher efficiency than capitalism can, liberating and developing  productive forces but not other things. Therefore, we shouldn't  adopt some pattern as the principle, but should adhere totally  to the principle of development. But regardless of whether we  call it "socialism" or "capitalism", if it is favorable to  developing the productive forces, strengthens the Chinese  people's capacities, and improves their standard of living, we  will take advantage of it and use it. Otherwise, no matter what  it is, we should abandon it.    --Concerning "state ownership" or "private ownership." It is  most difficult to change ideas on this question. In spite of  repeated emphasis by the party and the state that while we "must  adhere to state ownership being the main part, multiple economic  elements can still coexist and develop together", many people  can agree with this verbally, but in their practical work they  turn pale at the mention of "private ownership". In their view,  without "the state" title, we cannot have an orthodox public  ownership system, an example of how the existence of private  ownership is further restricted.    This sort of "private ownership panic" does considerable  harm  to developing our national economy. We cannot assume that this  phenomenon is normal--on the one hand, stressing that the people  are the masters of society, while on the other hand fearing the  masters owning a portion of that society's wealth; on the one  hand believing that three farmers back in the fifties organizing  a cooperative was "public", while on the hand believing it is  not public ownership if thousands of people establish  enterprises by investing in stock. We should be more bold in  admitting that "private ownership" is to a certain degree an  intrinsic requirement of socialism, and that socialism  absolutely does not reject "private ownership"; on the contrary,  it is more extensive and deep than it is in capitalism. Only in  this way can it embody social and historical progress. Of  course, this sort of private ownership within socialism is not a  totally chaotic mutual massacre, mutually predatory, but an  orderly, fair, competitive "private ownership" which takes  socialist public ownership as the dominant factor, under State  intervention and supervision. This means that this kind of  "private ownership" is clearly characterized by fairness.    "Public" and "private" are interchangeable, they are only  one  important aspect in production relationships, just bringing  about the developmental "pattern" of the productive forces. They  must both comply with the demands of productive forces, but must  not replace the productive forces as our standard for judging  success or failure. If something is favorable to liberating and  developing productive forces, we should not be obsessed with the  "public" versus "private" argument. In other words, the only  standard for accepting or rejecting "public" or "private" should  be whether it liberates and develops the productive forces. No  matter whether "private" or "public", if they can promote  development of the productive forces, then they deserve our  protection; if not, then we should abandon them.    --Concerning "plan" and "market." In the contemporary world,  there is no economy which is dominated absolutely by a planned  economy, no matter what type of social system, nor is there an  absolutely market-dominated economy either, both types are  always mutually compatible and supportive. Plans always have  certain subjective features, representative of governmental  will; markets always have certain objective features,  representative of mutually supportive rules inside matters.  "Plan" and "market" are both only means of resource allocation,  and this is so no matter what their nature, no matter whether  good or bad, "capitalism" or "socialism." Overall, planned  measures can be adopted, and so can market means if they are  favorable to liberating and developing the productive forces. We  need not be obsessed with debating whether the "plan" or the  "market" is right or bad, which is the more important or the  less important.    We must completely abandon those "leftist", unsuitable, and  impractical old concepts of socialism in our minds, we must be  cured of the remnants of old concepts brought on by traditional  socialist theory and practice. The only good treatment is  insistence on the party's ideological line of seeking truth from  facts.    Seeking truth from facts is the quintessence of Mao Zedong  thought, and is also the moral nature of Deng Xiaoping's basic  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. For a  long time, especially prior to the 3rd Plenary Session of the  11th Party Central Committee, we made a big mistake in that  while building up socialist theory we deviated from the  ideological line of seeking truth from facts, emphasizing  thought drawn from abstract principles and ignoring the  practical base of theories. The result was that while things  always looked perfect in theory, with nothing to criticize, they  obviously departed from reality, and the degree of  accomplishment of these theories was very low. A great person  has said that the value of a theory lies in the degree of its  accomplishment. We cannot imagine that a theory can be  dissociated from reality but still be regarded as correct and  valuable. The reason why traditional socialist theory has  suffered setbacks is that it has never really been rooted in the  fertile land of the various socialist countries. Theory is one  thing, practice is another, and separating the two must make for  a lack of vitality. This is also precisely the reason why people  are calling strongly for reform and theoretical renewal.    Therefore, in the process of establishing a socialist market  economic system, we cannot commit the same mistakes of  traditional socialist theory, but must adhere to starting out  from practice. One part of this practice is the basic national  situation of China. Its major characteristics are: a huge  population, especially the rural population; backward productive  forces, especially the backward rural economy, and the gap  between the urban and the rural; unbalanced regional development  and a substantial imbalance in industrial development; high  gross economic value, but a low average level. On the other  hand, to be a member of the world, we must take into account  doing business in compliance with international regulations.  This is our reality, this is where we stand in constructing the  socialist Chinese market economy, and neither in formulating  theory nor in renewing theory can we ignore this reality.    The three fundamental principles of "if it favorable to  developing socialist productive forces, if it is favorable to  strengthening the overall capacity of a socialist country, if it  is favorable to improving the people's living standard" set  forth by comrade Xiaoping's speech during his visit to the south  of China, shine brightly in ideological brilliance. These are  the basic standards which determine and judge each step in our  reform, and are also our effective proof in seeking to  accomplish the goals of reform. In our practice, we must  abandon those ideologies and concepts that do not match up with  the "three favorable" principle, and we should persist in the  correct and correct the wrong, to be worthy of this great  historical mission.</p>

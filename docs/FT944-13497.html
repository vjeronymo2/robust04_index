			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / UK biotechnology pioneer Porton sold for Pounds 65.5m Porton International, one of Britain's first biotechnology companies, yesterday closed the chapter on a history dogged by failure to deliver promised profits and blockbuster products by agreeing to sell its business for Pounds 65.5m. The private group, founded in 1983 by Mr Wensley Haydon-Baillie - a reclusive multi-millionaire - has recommended an offer by Beaufour Ipsen, the family-owned French pharmaceutical company. As part of the deal, worth Pounds 13.40 a share in cash or loan notes, Mr Haydon-Baillie stands to receive more than Pounds 20m on his 33 per cent holding in the company. Since he stepped down as chairman two years ago, the group has sold off non-core businesses and concentrated on manufacturing pharmaceutical products. Saying that the company had turned over a new leaf, Mr Tony Gover - executive vice-chairman and a long-time associate of Mr Haydon-Baillie - said the past problems had been caused by 'one or two products which did not come to fruition'. During the 1980s, institutions invested Pounds 76m in the group following company forecasts that its products would generate profits of Pounds 140.6m by 1990. In the event, its main anti-herpes medication proved ineffective and profits fell well short of targets. At the same time, the company spent large sums on opulent offices and executive salaries. It also earned a reputation for excessive secrecy, with Mr Haydon-Baillie employing a former member of the crack Special Air Service as a personal security adviser. Political concerns, meanwhile, were aroused when MPs demanded to know why the government signed a deal with Porton allowing it to develop commercial uses for ideas pioneered at the state-owned Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research (CAMR). While not commenting on Porton's past problems, Lazard Brothers, Beaufour Ipsen's financial advisers, said: 'This is a company on a significant recovery trend.' In the first half of this year, it reversed earlier losses with pre-exceptional profits of Pounds 1.85m on turnover of Pounds 25.6m. The deal, financed with Pounds 58.3m of borrowings and Pounds 7.2m of shareholder equity, offers Beaufour Ipsen manufacturing and distribution facilities in Britain and the US. Porton's existing senior management and staff will continue run the business as part of Speywood Holdings, a new subsidiary set up by Beaufour Ipsen.</p>

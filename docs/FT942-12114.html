			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / International Company News: French finance group ahead at FFr1.26bn Caisse Nationale de Prevoyance (CNP), one of the French state-controlled financial institutions scheduled for privatisation, saw net profits rise by 12.5 per cent to FFr1.26bn (Dollars 210m) in 1993 from FFr1.12bn in 1992, despite the pressures on the financial sector. Mr Pierre Darnis, chairman, said the group was on course for further growth this year. He forecast an increase in net profits of between 10 per cent and 15 per cent for 1994, the same rate of growth that the group has maintained for each of the past seven years. CNP, which specialises in personal insurance, saw turnover rise by 51.6 per cent last year to FFr64.3bn from FFr42.4bn. Pre-tax profits before exceptional items rose by 9.2 per cent to FFr1.53bn from FFr1.4bn. The board proposed raising the dividend to FFr10 from FFr9.</p>

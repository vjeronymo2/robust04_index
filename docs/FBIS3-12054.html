			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Second of a series of interviews" with Lieutenant Colonel </F> (Octavio Geronez) of the Havana Province Ministry of the  Interior Office by police reporter Alemany; place and date not  given -- recorded]    [Text] [Alemany] Despite the nation's resource limitations  resulting from this special period, the Cuban Government is  making tremendous efforts to harvest almost 3 million quintals  of potatoes, cabbage, garlic, carrots, and other products.  Special measures have been adopted in Havana Province to see  that these products reach their destination, that is, the  population. Thus, checkpoints have been created, and the trucks'  itineraries are monitored. So far, these measures have yielded  satisfactory results.    [(Geronez)] All these measures being adopted in the fields  and in monitoring the trucks on their way to the wholesale  markets have considerably reduced the diversion and illegal sell  of agricultural products. We want to point out that last year,  many trucks used to arrive at the markets and packing plants  with great weight differences. They also used to have great  document problems, problems that used to facilitate illegal  activities, and these problems stem directly from illegal  actions in the fields or while the trucks are circulating.    The practical effect of the checkpoints on the roads and the  new measures we have taken to identify the itineraries has been  to prevent the truckers from deviating from their itinerary to  unload part of the cargo in some particular place or to sell  these products to people who take advantage of these illegal  actions to acquire a large amount of products so as to to then  resell them.    [Alemany] According to Lt. Col. (Geronez), in 1993, these  trucks used to arrive at the packing plants or wholesale markets  showing a tremendous difference in weight.    [(Geronez)] I want to point out that last year, the  difference in weight when these trucks arrived at the wholesale  markets or packing plants was so great that we called them gross  problems or gross differences. Now, since 28 February when we  began this harvest campaign, we have had no gross differences  yet as regards the weight of the trucks. There are some problems  with the documents, but after the investigations we conducted,  we found out that these problems are not the result of attempted  criminal actions but rather normal problems that sometimes  occur, perhaps through ignorance or negligence on the part of  certain colleagues or perhaps for certain other reasons, but  they are not the result of evil intentions.    [Alemany] All the Interior Ministry's forces are  participating in the struggle against the theft of agricultural  products in Havana, and the population is supporting these  measures. Government officials have also acted severely, to  punish those conducting illegal business in agriculture with the  force of the law.    [(Geronez)] Well, these measures have helped reduce theft  considerably. Last year, during the first week of the campaign,  the incidence of criminality in this connection and the number  of people tried in the courts was high. This year we have  conducted a great publicity campaign and people are aware of the  measures we are adopting. Moreover, the criminals will be  punished severely, especially for crimes involving these  agricultural products, which are meant to provide relief for the  nation and the population during the current crisis.    [Alemany] At the same time tomorrow, we will release the  last  part of the interview with Lt. Col. (Geronez) concerning the  measures adopted to prevent the diverting and stealing of  agricultural products in Havana Province.</p>

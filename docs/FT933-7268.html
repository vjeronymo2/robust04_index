			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Economics: Waiting for a Bundesbank initiative ATTENTION will focus on Germany this week, with the Bundesbank's policy making central council meeting for the first time after the summer break on Thursday and preliminary cost of living data expected in the days ahead. Hopes of an early cut in the Bundesbank's 6.75 per cent discount rate were fueled late last week after the bank published remarks by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, its vice president and president-designate, that a big appreciation of the D-Mark within Europe was 'undesirable' because of the need to preserve exporters' competitiveness. However, price developments in Germany will be of vital importance in persuading the council members whether or not to lower official interest rates. The Bundesbank policy makers and financial markets should be able to judge on the strength of the inflation performance in states such as Hesse, North Rhine Westphalia, Bavaria and Baden Wurttemberg, which are expected to publish their August cost of living figures early this week. The preliminary cost of living data for western Germany may be published nearer the end the week. Forecasters polled by MMS International, a financial information company, expect the cost of living in Germany will be in a range from unchanged to 0.2 per cent higher in August compared with July. However, the year-on-year rate is expected to show little change from July's comparatively high 4.3 per cent. The estimates reported by MMS range from 4.1 per cent to 4.3 per cent. The week should also produce further insights into government policy in Japan and France. Today, the new Japanese prime minister will be spelling out his government's policies while the French cabinet will meet in the aftermath of this month's upheaval in the European exchange rate mechanism. European and trade matters are expected to top the agenda in Franco-German talks in Bonn on Thursday. The main economic statistics and events of the week follow. The figures in brackets are the median of economists' forecasts from MMS International. Today: Japan, prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa gives policy speech.

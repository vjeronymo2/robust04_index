			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 24 SAPA -- Police on Sunday  confirmed seven killed people died and 92 were injured when a  carbomb exploded on Sunday [24 April] morning on the corner of  Bree and Von Wielligh Streets in central Johannesburg. Speaking  at a press conference, Witwatersrand Police liaison officer Col  Steve Senekal said: "This is by far the largest bomb that ever  went off in Johannesburg. It was comparable to the Pretoria  Church Steet bomb blast" on May 20, 1983. Police were not  certain what type of explosive was used and said it would take  some time to complete the investigation.    Col Senekal said two policemen on general patrol were a few  metres away from the cream or beige Audi when it exploded. One  of the policemen was slightly injured, he said.    Col Senekal said police did not have an idea of what the  motive or target for the blast was. "It is not for us to  speculate. There are various offices in the area such as the  SADF [South African Defense Force], PAC [Pan-Africanist  Congress] and ANC regional offices."    Col Senekal welcomed African National Congress spokesman  Carl  Niehaus' intervention when a crowd gathered near the scene. Mr  Niehaus asked the crowd to be calm and not to retaliate. "We  certainly appreciate it. We certainly don't need retaliation."  He also appealed to other organisations to ask their members to  remain calm.    A 70 to 90kg bomb was placed inside or underneath the Audi,  which was totally destroyed. Buildings shopfronts and vehicles  in the area were severely damaged. The area has been cordoned  off and will remain so until at least Monday.    Police have already offered a reward of up to R500,000  [rand]  for information leading to the arrest of "those responsible for  this irresponsible and unbelievable deed".    A journalist asked police whether another incident was  related to the bomb blast. Apparently a black Toyota Cressida  was seen in Bree Street near the Smal Street mall. Three black  men were seen lying on the ground spread-eagled. Police could  not confirm the incident.    Television crews from ABC and CNN were being shown around  the  blast scene shortly after 1PM. Print journalists will be  allowed onto the blast site in groups of two and three later on  Sunday.</p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Motorola may spark showdown The first shots in a US-Japan trade showdown could be heard today over a complaint by Motorola that the Japanese have not complied with a cellular telephone agreement to open their market. The US company, which is the world's leading manufacturer of cellular telephones, has struggled for years to make inroads into the Japanese market. A review of the pact was launched early this year, with today set as the deadline by Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative. President Bill Clinton yesterday said sanctions against Japanese cellular telephones imported by the US were under consideration. He said the review deadline today was 'quite concidental', but 'illustrative' of the difficulties facing foreign companies in Japan. Mr Kantor could launch retaliation proceedings, followed eventually by sanctions. That process could take months. In 1992, US telecommunication equipment sales to Japan accounted for about 4 per cent of the market and were dropping, from Dollars 699m (Pounds 477m) in 1991 to about Dollars 555m.</p>

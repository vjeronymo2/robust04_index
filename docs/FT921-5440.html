			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: S&amp;P plans to widen credit risk services STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, is planning to widen its coverage of credit risk. New services would provide customers with ratings on risks associated with complex derivative instruments and the defaulted debt of distressed companies. The agency has set up a six-person working group that will 'look at ways to complement its current ratings service by providing additional information describing risks other than pure credit risks in transactions', said Mr Tom Gillis, a managing director at S&amp;P. The group hopes to complete its study and have proposals drawn up by the end of the second quarter of this year. Mr Gillis said changes were being considered because S&amp;P's ratings need to reflect the growing complexity of debt instruments. The working group will also look at improving ratings of bonds in default. 'After a bond defaults, depending upon the issuer, investors will get back different amounts. We would like to comment on what those various amounts might be,' Mr Gillis said.</p>

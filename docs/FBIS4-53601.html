			<p>BFN     [Text] Australia has expressed reservations about the size  of the new United Nations mission for Rwanda. Foreign Minister  Gareth Evans says Australia will not offer troops to the force  until there is a proper mandate and enough soldiers to do the  job.    Senator Evans said it was unclear whether the Rwanda  operation could be done with the 5,500 troops proposed by the  United Nations, and he said there was some distance to go before  the Security Council decision could be translated into something  that was workable in Rwanda.    The international medical aid organization Doctors Without  Borders says the deployment of United Nations troops to Rwanda  may come too late to help save thousands of Rwandan civilians.  It urged the Security Council to speed up deployment, saying  that there are hundreds of people facing systematic slaughter.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] India has again strongly protested against  Pakistan's bid to raise the Kashmir issue at the international  forum. The minister of state for external affairs, Mr. R.L.  Bhatia, told the NAM [Nonaligned Movement] foreign ministers  meeting at Jakarta that Pakistan is misusing the forum by  raising an issue which has to be resolved bilaterally. He said  the foreign secretaries of the two countries had met recently  and New Delhi had made proposals on resolving bilateral issues.  Islamabad's reply is still awaited. He said violating the  well-established NAM tradition, Pakistan had raised the Kashmir  issue. He asserted that Kashmir is an integral part of India --  the largest practicing democracy with independent judiciary and  a free press. Fundamental human rights for all its citizens are  enshrined in the Indian Constitution. Mr. Bhatia was using the  right to reply after a Pakistani delegate raised the issue at  the meeting yesterday.</p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / US waste group seeks Pounds 405m WASTE Management, the US group, is to sell 20 per cent of its international operations in a share placing and offering estimated to raise Pounds 405m. The Chicago-based group, the largest US waste management company, is preparing a war chest for opportunities it expects to arise from tightening environmental regulations in Europe and growth in Asia. The international operating company, Waste Management International, anticipates an offer price between 530p and 645p. At 587.5p, the mid-range price, the offering values the company at 30 times 1991 earnings, well above UK companies in the sector. About 26m of the 75m new Waste Management International shares will be placed in the UK, 30m are being simultaneously offered in the US and nearly 19m will be offered for sale outside the UK, the US and Canada. Cazenove is broker to the UK placing while Merrill Lynch is acting as global co-ordinator to the offer. After the offerings and flotation Waste Management International will have almost no debt, shareholders' funds of about Pounds 500m and a Dollars 750m (Pounds 433m) credit line from its parent. Waste Management has also effectively guaranteed up to Pounds 170m for any potential future environmental liabilities at its 80 facilities. The prospectus says Waste Management will be seeking further acquisitions and also permits and licences for new greenfield sites. The group has collected citations for pollution violations from the US Environmental Protection Agency. In recent years, Waste Management has made efforts to improve its image. In the fourth quarter of 1991, the parent company took a Dollars 260m pre-tax charge for the estimated clean-up costs at old dump sites. Waste Management's after-tax profits last year fell from Dollars 684.8m to Dollars 606.3m as a result. In the Security and Exchange Commission filing, Waste Management International says Pounds 227m of the funds raised by the offering will repay debt owed to the parent company.

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / 'Social tasks of business': The following is a digest of Monday's presidential address by Samuel Brittan at the British Association A couple of developments in business thinking, logically separable but often linked together, need probing. The first is the idea of the 'social responsibility of business'. An organisation entitled Business in the Community, which has the Prince of Wales as president and with which several business leaders are associated, has said in one of its documents that it means 'companies using some of their people, their expertise, their surplus product, premises and equipment, and sometimes cash to help tackle problems like urban deprivation, school-business links, job creation and environmental improvements'. The second is the fashionable cult of the businessman as the person to run and advise on everything. Both the Thatcher and the Major governments have attempted to recruit corporate leaders to run industrial training, manage schools, reorganise Whitehall, run the health service, and heaven knows what else. What the two developments have in common is that they are attempts to achieve public policy objectives on the cheap and on the side and are thus unlikely to be too successful. The cult of the businessman is less objectionable when executives spend a spell working full time in the public policy area. But it is difficult for a good manager just to take a couple of years off to work for a public authority and then return to his old career; and retired directors are a variable asset. The big objection is to corporate executives being expected to undertake a large burden of public duties in their own or their companies' time. I often wonder how the favoured executives can manage their own organisations if they are also supposed to sit on hospital boards, run numerous other quangos and have a chance of normal family life and leisure. People function best if they have specific responsibilities. If a businessman is partly responsible for government policy, and an official regards himself as responsible for the profitability of companies, then everyone is responsible for everything, and no one is responsible for anything in particular. The advocates of 'socially responsible' business make very large claims; and their slogan writers regard any questioning of their rationale as an attack on objectives such as urban renewal, support of the arts or employee welfare facilities. If one is not careful they will insinuate that one is to the right of Genghis Khan, not to speak of 'monetarist'. There is a systematic ambiguity. Do the proponents claim that the extra activities will indeed help a business's long-term profitability? Or do they assert that a business should follow different objectives? Too often they try to have it both ways. 'Corporate responsibility' lacks the legitimacy of either the market or the political process. It is not for managers to set themselves up as taxing authorities over funds which belong to shareholders - who may be their own employees or other workers investing through pension funds. The 'constitutionalist' opponent does not have to be starry-eyed about real world markets. He is saying that if there are market failures or inadequacies, it is up to the government to set up incentives for people to behave differently, by taxes or subsidies or, if necessary, by regulation or financing public services. Income can be redistributed via the tax and social security system. The government can intervene to improve incentives for training or for letting homes. But it is not for corporations to take on a pseudo-governmental role. The weakness of the constitutionalist position is that it falls into the trap of supposing that flesh-and-blood government will conform to some textbook model. But of course official programmes will be driven or distorted by interest groups, or by the self-interest of the providers of public services. Education, training and environmental programmes will often be very different from those that would help most. As corporate executives may have readily tapped dispersed local information, why not make use of their know-how? So the argument is not as clear-cut as readers of Milton Friedman might suppose. In the last analysis, however, even our imperfectly enfranchised shareholders will ensure that companies do not devote more than a modest proportion of their resources to non-bottom line activities; so both the business enthusiast and the government are deceiving themselves if they expect 'socially responsible companies' to carry the public policy load.</p>

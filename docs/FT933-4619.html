			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Regulating the regulators AN IMPORTANT sub-plot during the Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation of the gas industry was British Gas's attempt to curb its regulator's power. As the full MMC reports published this week show, British Gas pressed the line that its regulator Ofgas was aggressive, unpredictable and strident. The MMC rightly rejected the company's more extreme criticisms, concluding that the system was fundamentally sound. But it did suggest that a broader review of utility regulation might be in order. The idea is a good one. But before embarking on any such review, it is important to appreciate that there is no regulatory crisis. Utilities have not been reduced to quivering wrecks by overmighty regulators. If anything, they have been able to earn handsome profits at the expense of the consumer. There have, of course, been rows. But these are not evidence of regulators running amok. Rather they are the consequence of strong personalities such as Sir James McKinnon, Ofgas's chief, battling for consumer interests against utilities which have naturally wanted to cling to monopoly profits. It is no accident that the biggest rows have been in gas and telecommunications, which were left as integrated monopolies when privatised rather than being split up. If regulators' wings were clipped, they would be less able to ensure fair treatment for consumers. Similarly, the criticism that there is no adequate appeals process against regulatory decisions is exaggerated. On most important issues, a utility can appeal to the MMC. The fact that British Gas has been able to persuade the MMC to recommend relaxation of some of its regulatory controls shows that the checks and balances are working. Nor is the argument that regulators have too much discretion convincing. It is true that in some respects regulatory discretion is wide. But what is the alternative? A more legalistic system is used in the US. But the consequence has been that utilities have used their greater financial resources and control of information to tie their regulators in knots. Another possibility would be to hand regulatory power back to ministers. But that hardly seems a good idea when one advantage of privatisation has been to reduce political interference in commercial decisions. The more telling criticism of the system is its lack of openness. Often regulators fail to give reasons for their decisions, too many of which are taken behind closed doors. As a result, it can be difficult for interested parties to influence and challenge regulatory decisions. But regulators are not solely responsible for secrecy. Utilities have often tried to prevent the publication of detailed financial information that lies behind regulatory decisions on grounds of commercial confidentiality. Moreover, there are signs of improvement. Ofwat has been a model of consultation in its preparation of new price controls for water companies, while Oftel is about to experiment with a roundtable seminar to determine telecommunications interconnection terms. Undoubtedly more needs to be done and this is why the government should take up the MMC's suggestion of a broader review, which could draw up a code of practice as British Gas has advocated. One candidate to conduct such a review would be the MMC itself. But since its powers and procedures should ideally also be examined, a better candidate would probably be the Office of Fair Trading. Either way, given that secrecy is the current system's main defect, the review should be open.</p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Carlos Pizarro, leader of Colombia's leftist M-19 guerrillas and once its  most-wanted criminal, is to be the group's presidential candidate in next  year's elections. Pizarro, 38, was nominated to represent the group in the May  presidential vote, M-19 said in a statement from its mountain headquarters of  Santo Domingo, an Andean village in southwestern Colombia. M-19 has agreed to  lay down its arms and form a political party, two of the steps suggested in a  peace accord signed with the government. The group has operated underground  following its failed takeover of Bogota's Palace of Justice in November, 1985,  in which 95 people, including 11 Supreme Court justices, were killed.  </P></p>

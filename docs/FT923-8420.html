			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / International Company News: Procter &amp; Gamble rises 5.6% PROCTER &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products company, yesterday reported a modest 5.6 per cent improvement in after-tax profits during the year to end-June. The company made Dollars 1.87bn at the net level, compared with Dollars 1.77bn in the same period a year earlier. The figure was scored on sales of Dollars 29.4bn, an 8.6 per cent advance on the previous year's Dollars 27bn. However, the final quarter of the financial year showed a slightly stronger trend, with after-tax profits advancing by 11.5 per cent to Dollars 339m, and sales gaining 6.6 per cent at Dollars 7.17bn. Mr Edwin Artzt, P&amp;G's chairman, noted that 'after a slow start' and an earnings dip in the first quarter, the profits improvement had averaged 10 per cent over the past three quarters. He added that there had been 'continued economic softness' in many markets, including the US, Canada and parts of Europe. During the year, domestic profits rose by 7 per cent to Dollars 1.46bn after tax. P&amp;G said volume growth was 'particularly noteworthy in the paper, laundry and food and beverage businesses', while softness in pulp prices dented earnings growth. On the international front, P&amp;G made Dollars 625m, up by 19 per cent over the previous year. The Cincinnati-based company added that every region showed double-digit volume growth, from Europe to Asia Pacific. The shares fell Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 49 1/4 in early trading.</p>

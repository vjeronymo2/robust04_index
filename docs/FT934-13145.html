			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Drugs strong Drugs stocks were among the best performers in the London market yesterday as the caution that has hovered over the sector looked to be fast dissolving. The positive sentiment has been growing recently with a steady stream of bullish comments - US broker Wertheim Schroder being the latest investment house to become more positive on the sector. Yesterday the feeling burgeoned, producing some squeezing in the stock and pushing prices higher. While yields have been one attraction, another consideration is that some stocks - particularly Wellcome and Zeneca - have underperformed the market this year and attracted attention from those in the market who believe the selling overdone. Wellcome was one of the sector's strongest features yesterday, pushing well past its important 800p level - the price at which the Wellcome Trust sold its second tranche of shares to institutions - and closing at 823p, a rise of 36 1/2 on the day. With volume at 3.5m there was some feeling that a shortage of stock helped to boost the price increase. The stock was also still benefiting from recent drug test results. Market anticipation is also growing ahead of Wellcome's results next week. And, as a great deal of the activity in the stock came after the opening of Wall Street, some industry specialists suggested US interest was also growing. Glaxo moved ahead in strong volume of 8.7m, making a gain of 23 at 723p. One analyst said that yield factors lay behind the performance. SmithKline Beecham 'A' added 12 1/2 at 434 1/2 p and Zeneca appreciated 4 1/2 to 783 1/2 p.</p>

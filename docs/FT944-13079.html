			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Kenya shilling falls sharply The Kenyan shilling plunged against the dollar yesterday by more than 20 per cent in panic selling caused by the liberalisation of the oil industry, Several banks, including Barclays, Standard Chartered and Citibank, quoted the shilling at an average of 43.83 against the dollar, down from 35.48 on Thursday. The liberalisation from midnight on Thursday and expectations of it on Wednesday created an instant demand for dollars as oil companies moved to build up their oil stocks. 'The rush by some oil companies and manufacturers ..to finance stocks for the next three months or so has resulted in an excessive demand for dollars, causing the exchange rate to depreciate,' said Mr Micah Cheserem, central bank governor. He said the panic buying of dollars was unjustified as his bank held hard currency reserves in excess of Dollars 800m, 'sufficient to meet the country's import requirements for the next six months'.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text]  <H5>  Substance Circulation Research in a Closed System </H5> <H5>  Environmental Science and Technology Research Institute </H5> <H5>  The Construction of a Simulation Facility Rokkasho-mura </H5>   The Science and Technology Agency (STA) has embarked on a  plan to build, starting next fiscal year, an "Ecosphere  Substance Circulation Simulation Facility" in Rokkasho-mura in  Aomori Prefecture. The purpose of this facility is to cast light  on the behavior of radioactive substances in an ecosphere.    This facility is one which will carry out simulation  experiments on the behavior and circulation characteristics of  radioactive substances both on land and in the water, with the  goal of grasping, over the mid- to long-term, the impact of  radioactive substances on the environment. This facility is to  be built in response to strong concerns over the influence of  the radioactive substances found on the site of the nuclear fuel  system facility on the environment and on humans through contact  through things such as the food chain.  <H5>  The Food Chain Will Also Be Studied </H5>   This research facility will be composed of two facilities,  the water-system ecosphere facility and the land-system  ecosphere facility. The environmental conditions within the  facility can be freely controlled to perform experiments  imitating various kinds of environmental conditions.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-65A>      A Bird's-Eye View of the Simulation Facility </FIG>    Because the land system ecosphere facility will study the  conditions that would occur if radioactive substances escaped  into the environment, the propagation of plant life, the  movement of these substances to animals through the food-chain,  and their introduction into the water sphere through means such  as rainfall, this facility will be built to include:    1. A greenhouse with rainfall equipment;    2. An animal breeding building for the breeding of small  animals; and    3. Dwellings to be used as residences by the researchers.    Furthermore, because the water system ecosphere will study  things such as the food chain from plankton to fish species, it  will include features such as:    1. A closed-system pool which imitates ocean surface  conditions; and    2. A high pressure water tank that imitates conditions in  mid- to deep-water.    Moreover, along with intercepting substances either entering  from or exiting to the outside environment, both the land and  water systems are equipped with circulation support equipment,  such as temperature adjustment equipment, equipment to adjust  gases such as carbon dioxide, oxygen, and nitrogen, and  equipment to control the quality of the water, which allow both  ecospheres to maintain their simulated environmental conditions.    These facilities have the following special characteristics:    1. Because they can imitate various natural environmental  conditions, experiments can be performed under conditions close  to those occurring naturally.    2. At the same time, they can imitate conditions in which  measurements and experimentation would be difficult in the  actual environment.    3. Furthermore, because there is no substance infiltration  from, or escape to the outside environment, the course and  conditions of the transference and circulation of substances  within the facility can be correctly ascertained.    4. Moreover, the mutual influence of living things and the  environment can be ascertained through the breeding and  cultivation of animals and plants.  <H5>  Interest Is Great, Even Internationally </H5>   STA has requested &yen;4.6 billion in the FY94 budget for  facility and equipment costs, and plans to equip the facility  over a five-year plan starting next fiscal year. Construction  and operation will be carried out by the Environmental Science  and Technology Research Institute (non-profit organization).  Other than the facility discussed in this article, this research  institute is also promoting the planned "Closed-System Research  Facility" studying the influence of radioactive substances on  agricultural products and other plants.    These facilities will study the impact that radioactive  substances have on living organisms and the environment, and  because these are epoch-making facilities for environmental and  ecological scientific research, they will probably be seen as  core research centers for international environmental protection  research.</p>

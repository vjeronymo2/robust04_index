Aid-relief agencies have threatened to pull out of the  war-ravaged country because of continued attacks against their  personnel and equipment.    "There are some crimes which are carried out by the forces  of  the royal government, we do not shy away from informing you  about the truth of this," Hun Sen told an audience of aid agency  and diplomatic officials.    The co-premier said he called the meeting after he and  fellow  co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh received a letter from aid  organisation representatives voicing concern over highway  holdups and the theft of vehicles. "I would like to take this  opportunity on behalf of his royal highness Prince Norodom  Ranariddh to appeal to you to understand the situation in  Cambodia and not to stop aid to Cambodia," he said.    Aid officials said they welcomed the fact that the  government  was paying attention to the problem but complained that the  co-premier did not offer any real concrete measures to improve  the overall situation.    "I didn't see anything specifically new coming out of this.  I  can't say that it was really encouraging," one official said.    Hun Sen said the audience was rightfully concerned about an  incident on January 13, when four of 11 bandits who stole two  all-terrain vehicles belonging to the United Nations Development  Programme turned out to be bodyguards for high-ranking leaders.    Two bodyguards were shot dead by police at the scene and two  were captured later, Hun Sen said.    One of the dead had acted as a barber for senior party  officials and "gave me a haircut on Janaury 11," Hun Sen said.  But just because their bodyguards committed crimes does not  mean the senior leaders were also involved, Hun Sen said.    In response to charges from the aid community that the  military was often involved in highway extortion and robbery,  Hun Sen said it was easy for anyone to buy military uniforms in  the marketplace.    "But that does not mean that the government does not have  bad  forces, within every thousand there is one bad," he said.  However, he said, if all government forces were withdrawn it  would leave the roads open to attacks and robberies by the Khmer  Rouge.    The co-premiers, in conjunction with the ministries of  defence and interior, were taking measures to improve the  situation in the countryside, Hun Sen said. But he said the  government was caught between the problem of security and that  of the Khmer Rouge.    He said police were aware of illegal weapons in some houses,  but they did not take action because of concerns about  "violating human rights."    Similarly, the police knew the identities of some criminals  but had to wait to catch them in the act.    "This is the difficulty faced by the government. The  government has become a buffer zone between criminals and human  rights," Hun Sen said.    The co-premier, however, said he thought the problem could  be  brought under control.    He advised embassies and aid agencies to check with police  before hiring local staff to ensure they had no criminal records  and also suggested they advise appropriate authorities of their  plans before travelling in the countryside. The ministry of  interior could also provide bodyguards, Hun Sen said.    "Rest assured, the ministry will select good forces for  you,"  he said.</p>

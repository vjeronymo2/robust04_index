			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Lenders weigh up housing benefits: Private investors are alarmed Private investors which have furnished Pounds 5.5bn to housing associations since 1989 to provide homes for the poor and disadvantaged have become increasingly alarmed about their dependence on the escalating housing benefits budget. Ministers have identified housing benefit as a prime target as they seek to contain public spending. Commercial lenders say a move to cap or reduce payments would jeopardise returns and undermine future housing investment plans. Rent rebates and allowances are estimated to have increased to Pounds 8.65bn in the 12 months to the end of March, a rise of 130 per cent since 1988-89. Housing accounts for more than 10 per cent of all benefit payments compared with 8 per cent five years ago. Mr Douglas Smallwood, controller for policy and marketing for Halifax building society's commercial lending division, said last week that investors would no longer see associations as low-risk investments if their involvement meant rents were to rise much higher. Mr Mike Lazenby, head of housing at Nationwide building society, said: 'There is a clear political risk that ministers may intervene if rents and benefits continue to increase sharply.' The message from this week's Tory party conference in Bournemouth is that payments may not be cut in the present spending round but the issue is unlikely to go away. At the heart of the dilemma is the increased proportion of private-finance associations are required to raise, under the 1988 Housing Act, to pay for new developments. Rents have risen sharply to generate sufficient returns to attract private investors, which from next April will be expected to provide 42 per cent of associations' finance, compared with 25 per cent private investment in 1989-90. According to the National Federation of Housing Associations, average weekly housing association rents for new developments between 1988 and 1993 rose from Pounds 29.18 to Pounds 52.45, an increase of 80 per cent. It said that the proportion of new tenants eligible for housing benefit since 1989-90 had increased from 67 per cent to 83 per cent. More worrying for the government is that 49 per cent of tenants with jobs are now eligible for benefit compared with 27 per cent five years ago. Large numbers of tenants are caught in a poverty trap which means almost all additional income is lost through a corresponding drop in benefit providing little incentive for extra employment. Commercial lenders have argued strongly that the government should not increase the private-sector contribution to 42 per cent next April from its present 38 per cent. The Council for Mortgage Lenders warned in a letter to Mr David Curry, housing minister, that further reductions in public-sector grants to housing associations would mean 'a consequent increase in the level of exposure and risk faced by lenders'. Nationwide, which has lent associations almost Pounds 1bn in the past five years, says it is likely to become more selective in its choice of investment. Mr Lazenby said the society would 'prefer an established association which has been around for a number of years and has older properties which currently generate a surplus from rental income which can be used to cross-subsidise new rents and prevent them from rising too high'. The outcome is that some associations, those not fitting the Nationwide description, are likely find it more difficult to attract private investors in future when the government is seeking to reduce the level of grants it provides.</p>

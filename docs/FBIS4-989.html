			<p>BFN     [Text] In Maringue, Afonso Dhlakama has been reelected  president of the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] and  chosen to run for the October presidential elections. The  decision was made at Renamo's special congress, which closed  yesterday.    About 400 delegates and guests to the congress, which began  on 12 April, also adopted the electoral strategy and adapted  Renamo's structures to the ongoing political situation, some six  months before the first multiparty elections are due to be held.    Speaking at a rally in Maringue yesterday afternoon,  Dhlakama  said Renamo has definitely made the transition from an armed to  an unarmed party. Dhlakama urged the whole world to stop  regarding Renamo as an armed movement as of yesterday. He  pointed out: We no longer have arms and I have been demobilized.    He said it was against his will that he was reelected Renamo  president and candidate to the presidential elections. He  added: I am very tired. I wanted to take a break. He said his  continued leadership is a vote of confidence on the part of his  colleagues in his political ability.    Dhlakama revealed that Renamo's electoral strategy will be  based on two principles -- namely, the massive registration of  voters and the education of sympathizers so that they may vote  for his movement in the October elections.    Renamo's electoral campaign will be run by a foreign  enterprise whose name he declined to reveal. He admitted,  however, that it is Portuguese and includes experts from other  nationalities. The Renamo leader said he felt surrounded by  powerful adversaries, but is convinced of a victory for him and  his movement.    The Renamo leader once again accused the government of  transferring thousands of troops into the police force, and of  training youths in Cabo Delgado, Nampula, and Niassa to fight  his movement should it win the elections. He said private  security companies are specifically designed to intimidate the  people. He added: those problems pose a threat to peace in  Mozambique.    Also a threat was what he described as the continual support  for Frelimo by several neighboring countries which he did not  identify. He said such countries plan to send about 500,000 of  their citizens to vote for Frelimo in the October elections.  Dhlakama said he believes Mozambicans will know how to make the  best choice.    He said those problems could be resolved at the negotiating  table between President Joaquim Chissano and himself. He said:  I need to talk to Frelimo to guarantee that there will never be  war in Mozambique. He urged neighboring countries to assist in  Mozambique's democratization process.    At its special congress, Renamo adopted a new flag. In  addition to the old colors, the new flag shows a guinea fowl and  three arrows, though these are displayed horizontally.  According to Dhlakama, the arrows stand for passive resistance.  The guinea fowl is a bird that refuses to be tamed, and once in  captivity commits suicide.    A resolution adopted by the congress says Renamo now has  provincial, district, and location councils. The National  Council remains. New tasks have been allocated to all delegates  and to advisers serving with provincial governors. It appears  that Afonso Dhlakama and his followers have bet on the influence  that former traditional leaders may have among the rural  electorate, in view of the large number of chiefs who attended  the congress.    Dhlakama introduced to newsmen the ministers of Renamo's  shadow cabinet. He said if it wins the elections, Renamo's  cabinet will include members of other political parties,  including one from Frelimo.</p>

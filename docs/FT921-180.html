			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Management (The Growing Business): The doctors' dilemma - John Willman takes the pulse of the changing UK general practitioner service For 600 small businesses, the outcome of the UK general election will be of particular interest. They are family doctor practices which have been - or from 1 April will become - GP fundholders, each controlling a health service budget in excess of Pounds 1m a year. If Labour wins the election, fundholding will be abolished, bringing to an end an experiment which has been opposed by the majority of Britain's family doctors. If the Conservatives win, many more practices are likely to opt for fundholding, in the belief that fundholders will be treated more favourably when it comes to handing out money. For the eight GPs who belong to Dr Ian Wild's partnership based at the St John's health centre in Twickenham, south-west London, fundholding has been an opportunity to improve the quality of treatment for its 14,000 patients. The 'Wild Bunch', as they are known locally, control a budget of more than Pounds 1.6m to buy a range of diagnostic services and treatments on behalf of their patients. They can therefore shop around the half dozen hospitals in the area for the shortest waiting lists on behalf of their patients - unlike non-fundholding GPs who must normally refer patients to hospitals commissioned by the district health authority (DHA) which pays the bill. 'We saw fundholding as a way of tackling the growing waiting lists in this area,' says Mansukh Unadkat, the partner with responsibility for fundholding. 'It can take six to eight months just to see a consultant for an opinion and we felt that as fundholders, we could choose the hospitals which offered more to the patients. 'Information about costs and waiting times is held on computer so that it takes only a couple of minutes to choose a hospital for an operation. It gives us tremendous flexibility, and is already producing benefits for the patients in faster treatment.' But GP fundholding offers much more than sophisticated shopping around for the fastest operation, according to a study published last month by the King's Fund Institute, the respected health service think-tank.* It found that fundholders were using their market power to change and improve the services to patients. Wild and his partners, for example, have negotiated for surgeons and consultants to leave their hospitals and provide consultations and treatment at the health centre. A monthly ophthalmology clinic has been arranged and patients can also see specialists in cardiology, ENT (ear, nose and throat), gynaecology and urology without travelling to a hospital. A surgeon performs minor operations at the centre, including the treatment of varicose veins, removal of lumps and other procedures which do not require an overnight stay. In the longer term, the practice is considering providing some overnight beds and therapy facilities at the health centre - ironically, a converted former cottage hospital. 'Not only does this cost less than booking appointments at a hospital, it reduces the waiting times significantly,' says Unadkat. Being a fundholder inevitably involves more paperwork and administration. Though it does not actually handle the fund, the practice must provide the regional health authority with information on contracts and referrals necessary for the hospitals to be paid. Grants are given to ensure that fundholders have adequate computer systems, and specially-written software has been approved by the Department of Health to handle the accounting. Help with the cost of business planning is also available from the Department of Trade and Industry. The Wild partnership used the consultants McIntyre Hudson to help in drawing up the business plan required to win fundholding status. The practice has also been able to employ a part-time business manager, Peter Dean, with the allowance payable to fundholders to cover the cost of administration. A retired bank manager, he brings experience of dealing with a wide variety of small businesses which has been invaluable in getting the new systems up and running. Dean is also an enthusiast for fundholding: 'Doctors have never had to have much of a hand on the cheque book, apart from handling their own money and expenditure in the practice. Fundholding has brought home the cost of treatment and given them the incentive to provide better value for money and improve the service.' He expects to show a small surplus on the first year which can be ploughed back into the practice under the fundholding rules - it will be used to buy more equipment for minor surgery. The only drawback is that the regional health authority is trying to reduce the budget for next year. 'The region felt that they had overestimated costs in some areas during the first year of running the scheme,' Dean says. 'Although we are still discussing the budget, it is likely to be tighter next year than this.' Rejecting fundholding for the present are the five doctors in the practice of Marc Rowland and partners which is based at the Jenner health centre in Forest Hill, south east London. They are no less keen to improve the quality of health service for their patients, but want to achieve this by increasing co-operation between different health agencies. 'The health service is a very fragmented service,' says Rowland. 'We want to work more closely with dentists, health visitors, district nurses, chiropodists, as well as housing agencies, social services and voluntary groups, to become the local focus for dealing with the health needs of our area. 'If someone comes to see us with stomach pains, there's no point in sending them to a gastroenterologist to have tubes stuck in every orifice and X-rays shone through them if the cause is their marriage breaking up or bad housing.' Rowland believes that becoming a fundholder would make it harder to develop the relationships with other local agencies which the practice is trying to foster. And he worries about the loss of integration in a health service where hospitals increasingly compete for business. Rather than the more competitive approach which fundholding implies, he is keen to work with other family doctors in the area to develop 'locality commissioning'. 'If we and other practices in the area expressed our preferences for hospitals and other providers, the commissioning authority would have to give good reasons for ignoring us. Locality commissioning would give us the same clout as fundholders enjoy, without the bureaucracy and paperwork.' Rowland admits that this more consensual approach to change is inevitably slower: 'It is very hard work to get progress on such radical ideas.' But the practice has usually been able to get what it wanted even if it has taken a long time. 'Our approach avoids trampling over local relationships with other agencies which we've worked hard over the years to foster,' he says. He accepts that fundholding could offer a short cut round the lengthy process of building consensus. And he does not rule out fundholding if the election result suggests that it is here to stay. But for the moment, he and his partners prefer to pursue their alternative approach to raising the standard of health care. * A foothold for fundholding, King's Fund Institute, 126 Albert Street, London NW1 7NF.

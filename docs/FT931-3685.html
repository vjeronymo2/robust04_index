			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / British Gas offers to decentralise BRITISH GAS is to propose a compromise to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to counter radical proposals by its regulator for a full-scale break-up of the company. British Gas is understood to have proposed splitting its UK gas business into three wholly-owned subsidiaries, covering sales to the industrial market, household supply and pipelines. The company could then disband its central gas purchasing function, leaving its two sales units to buy their own gas from the North Sea. British Gas submitted itself to an MMC inquiry last August as a way of preserving 15,000 jobs in its gas business. Regulatory demands on the company, including a tough pricing formula, would have forced it to reduce costs by Pounds 400m over five years and it would still have been incurring a loss of Pounds 300m on its household sales business by 1997. The MMC is due to present its report on April 30 to Ofgas, the industry regulator, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. Two weeks ago Ofgas called for British Gas to be broken up into 12 regional companies, a purchasing arm and a stand-alone pipelines company. British Gas believes a full break-up could cost as much as Pounds 3bn over 10 years, including Pounds 2bn to provide extra storage. In addition, the company is understood to be fighting to keep its monopoly over household supply, arguing that removal of the monopoly could compromise safe-ty standards, endanger security of supply and service to disadvantaged customers, and mean the end of uniform gas costs across the country. British Gas contests claims by competitors that UK households would see substantial savings - 10 per cent a year on gas bills - from the introduction of competition to domestic supply. The company says that if prices reflected the full cost of supply, some 12m of its customers would pay more and 6m would pay less. Prices for customers using less than 100 therms a year would nearly double. By splitting up the gas purchasing arm, British Gas would make it easier for independent gas shippers to have more access to North Sea supplies. The company has been the dominant buyer in the North Sea for many years and rival gas marketing companies have complained they could not compete with its purchasing power. The company is also believed to be discussing the creation of a market in peak gas supplies which would address the problem of opening up the interruptible supply sector to competitors. Interruptible customers are the largest users of gas, paying less in return for being cut off during periods of peak demand in the domestic market. The peak trading market could herald the start of a spot market in gas sales. Lex, Page 14</p>

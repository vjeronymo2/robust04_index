Forming the Consultative Committee (part 2  of 2): Chen Chih-hui [7115 1807 6540], Tseng En-bo [2582 1869  3134], and Pu Shao-fu [0592 1421 1133] Did Not Respond; An Zijie  [1344 1311 0094] Objected To Putting Chen Yao-cai [7115 5069  2088] on the Committee    We should consider soliciting the opinions of Taiwanese  forces in Hong Kong. Back then, the Taiwanese Government's  attitude toward the mainland was still very inflexible, and they  were against the Sino-British negotiations over the Hong Kong  question. After the Sino-British Joint Declaration was made  public, the Taiwanese Government also issued its own declaration  saying that they reserved the right to enter into negotiations  in the future to take back Hong Kong. But it was unclear whether  they would stay in Hong Kong or leave after 1997; it was all  very confusing. To ease Taiwan's concern and win their support  in drafting and promulgating the Basic Law and influence their  view on the principle of "one country, two systems," we had to  find ways to enlist the participation of the influential among  them. Even if they were not willing to participate out of  personal concern, or perhaps the Taiwanese Government was  unwilling to let them participate, we should still be able to  make public our united stand for the sake of the country. I  therefore openly named three people, indicating that they were  welcome to participate: The first was the de facto  representative of the Taiwanese Government in Hong Kong and  secretary of the KMT's Hong Kong-Macao headquarters, Chen  Chih-hui; another was Tseng En-bo, chairman of the board of Hong  Kong's SHI PAO; the third was Taiwan Legislative Yuan member Po  Shao-fu. Of the three, Po was more open-minded and had a more  populist stand and was considered the most likely to attend, and  therefore his name headed the list. But at the end, none  responded. Later, Po Shao-fu published an article in the  newspaper entitled, "Thank You, Xu Jiatun," in which he gave a  friendly response. We subsequently selected three replacements  who also had close ties with Taiwan to join the Consultative  Committee.    With regard to the "Fei-Shi incident" ["flying rock  incident"] -- the incident involving Liu Chien-shi [0491 0578  4258], I was probably being too extreme. Liu was head of the  Hong Kong Christian Industrial Council and leader of Hong Kong's  intermediary unions. Back then, it was thought that he had  political background and that certain forces were trying to use  him to start a Polish-style solidarist union in Hong Kong and  turn him into a Walesa-like personality. Many Hong Kong  industrialists and entrepreneurs regarded Liu as an adversary.  In labor wage disputes, his union often asked for unrealistic  raises, making the terms unacceptable for the owners. Based on  my unwillingness to give him even more publicity, I disagreed  with the "leftist" union's -- the Federation of Trade Union  [FTU]--idea of putting Liu Chien-shi on the Consultative  Committee. Since the FTU had already made some public  announcement, my decision caused them to openly break their  promises, causing them trouble, which made the  middle-of-the-road and leftist unions unhappy and brought  unfavorable public response. Facts proved that the FTU was  right and my rejecting Liu Chien-shi only made him even more  popular, contrary to what I had wanted. Moreover, even people  with background have friends; they too must work.    After the Consultative Committee list was approved by the  Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee, An Zijie suggested  adding several foreign personages in financial and business  circles to serve as consultants. The several vice chairmen had  no objection, but to balance things, I suggested adding Chen  Yao-cai, retired veteran labor leader from the "leftist" "FTU."  An Zijie objected immediately and was very adamant about it,  which was very unexpected. The several vice chairmen at the  scene were stunned and quite embarrassed. Not wanting to make  things difficult for everybody, I did not pursue the matter.    When preparing for the Consultative Committee, there was an  incident involving the election of the executive committee  members, chairman, and vice chairman which Hong Kong media  described as "storm in a teacup." The election was held at the  downtown Lane Crawford Building. The building was one of Mr. Pao  Yu-kang's [0545 3768 3068] properties after his purchase of  "Wheelock." He himself offered to turn over one floor to the  Consultative Committee to be used as an office.    Election of the executive committee members went fairly  smoothly. Nineteen members were elected from among the entire  Consultative Committee. The only thing was, Cheng Yao-tang [6774  5069 2768], labor representative and head of the FTU whom we  thought had high hopes, lost by one vote.    After the executive members were chosen, there was a break,  and the five initiators talked about electing the chairman and  vice chairmen. I indicted that based on experience in the  mainland, we should let the executive members work out a list of  candidates before proceeding with the election. But the others  wanted an election right away, and I did not insist. In that  way, after electing the executive members, the first executive  committee meeting was convened; it was presided over by Pao  Yu-kang. He immediately announced the election of a chairman and  vice chairmen and read from a list of candidates. The executive  committee members were taken by surprise. Pao Yu-kang asked if  there were any objection, and one executive committee member  indicated that he had no objection. Thereupon, Pao said, "if  there are no objections, please applause, and the motion is  carried." Everybody applauded, and that was that. After the  meeting, the executive committee members were not pleased,  saying that it all moved too fast, that they were not prepared,  and the process did not comply with committee regulations and so  on. The reporters asked me about it, and I could only made some  excuses. Of course, we could not blame it on anybody. It only  showed that the several vice chairmen, including myself, lacked  training in democracy. To salvage the situation, I asked Mao  Jun-nian [3029 6874 1628] to consult the others and follow  regulations to draw up a new list of candidates and hold another  election. Although it turned out that the original winners were  again elected, it still brought some criticisms.    On 18 December 1985, the day before the anniversary of the  formal signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Hong  Kong SAR Basic Law Consultative Committee was formally  established. Ji Pengfei [1213 7720 7378], in the capacity of  chairman of the Basic Law Drafting Committee, spoke at the  meeting. At that time, he was in Hong Kong at the invitation of  the British Hong Kong government and the Hong Kong branch of  XINHUA SHE. [Installment No 47]  <H5>  [21 June 93 p 2] </H5>   [Text] 4. Democratic Consultation, Cooperation, and  Compromise (part 1 of 2): Hong Kong People's Wishes Were Taken  Into Full Consideration; the Drafting Process Was Completely  Democratic    The air of democracy during the drafting of the Basic Law  was  unprecedented.    The drafting process in fact was a process of cooperation,  consultation, and compromise among the parties (primarily  between China and Hong Kong), and it was also a completely  democratic process. In a period of four years and eight months,  the drafting committee held eight conferences, five special  topic small groups, and met more than 60 times. The mainland's  drafting committee members came to Hong Kong on several  occasions to solicit ideas from various parties in Hong Kong,  and on two of those occasions, formally organized groups were  sent to solicit opinions in a comprehensive way. They were known  as the "two ups and two downs." The first of these visits was  made between May and September of 1988 to gather written  suggestions for the Draft Basic Laws. The second was made  between February and 31 October of 1989, whereby opinions on the  Sixth Session of the Seventh People's Standing Committee's  examination of the "Draft Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR" were  solicited.    The Consultative Committee took an objective and  comprehensive approach when gathering ideas. The committee  members had a full schedule in Hong Kong and often went to  Beijing to report on ideas they had collected. On the two  occasions they made their comprehensive survey of ideas, they  gathered many suggestions and compiled them into a written  report. To preserve the originality of the ideas, no  comprehensive editing was made, but each item was recorded  individually and reported truthfully, without distortion or  simplification. The suggestions were "categorized" to make  reading easier.    In addition, through its contact with individuals, groups,  and others, the Hong Kong branch of XINHUA SHE had also gathered  many suggestions. XINHUA SHE made special studies of those  ideas, and some Chinese-funded organizations also heard and  gathered ideas and brought them to the branch XINHUA SHE. The  Sino-British Joint Liaison Group and the Hong Kong-Macao Affairs  Office also obtained some information, and so did party and  state leaders when they were meeting people from different  circles in Hong Kong and Macao.    It is fair to say that the Hong Kong people's wishes were  given full consideration in those four years and eight months;  most ideas were deemed very valuable. They were studied and  discussed repeatedly, especially by the Drafting Committee.    Members of the Drafting Committee in Hong Kong represented  different interests and different stands; there were few  consensus. The committee had no problem with the more simple,  reasonable, and less controversial issues. For example, the  question of the New Territories' native inhabitants' right to  inherit land only involved residents of the New Territories;  there was no controversy, and it was ratified easily and was  written into Article 40 of the Basic Law. Another example was  the churches' right to use and inherit properties and accept  financial aid, which was a concern of the churches but not vital  to the others, and was quickly decided in the Basic Law.    But things were different when it came to issues that  involved other interests, that were confrontational and  controversial. For example, on the questions of the Hong Kong  people's autonomy and the relationship between the central  government and the government of the SAR, there were many  disputes. The Drafting Committee had a principle: Do the easy  things first; that is, tackle the easy, less controversial  problems first to lay the foundation for the Basic Law and take  ample time to consider and discuss the difficult problems.    As far as the Drafting Committee itself was concerned, in  order to deal with the relationship between members of the  mainland drafting committee and the Hong Kong drafting committee  and between the committee and the outside world, many mainland  practices were changed to facilitate cooperation and compromises.    For example, it is customary to keep everything secret in  the  mainland. The secretariat followed mainland practice and brought  up the secrecy issue at the Drafting Committee' first meeting.  Hong Kong's Drafting Committee members and the media objected,  and public opinion demanded that the Drafting Committee's  activities be made public, and so at the chairman's meeting the  secretariat asked for a debate and suggested accepting the idea,  changing past practices. And so it was decided that after each  special topic small group meeting, a spokesman would talk to  reporters about the contents of each meeting, but there was one  provision, that while the contents of all discussions could be  disclosed, what was said and who said it was strictly  confidential. If individual committee members chose to disclose  what he or she had said at a meeting, the Drafting Committee had  no right to intervene, but the formal briefing (the background  explanation sessions) would name no names, giving individual  members the right to choose. Subsequently, the meetings became  increasingly public. The entire drafting process was basically  an open process and was completely transparent, drastically  changing the mainland's usual workstyle and approach.

Democratic Consultation, Cooperation, and  Compromise (part 2 of 2): The Hong Kong People Were Satisfy With  the Basic Law Prior to "June 4"    Between the mainland committee members and the Hong Kong  committee members, it was the former who tried hard to let the  latter express their opinions, to accept their ideas, and in the  actual writing, they tried their best to satisfy the Hong Kong  drafting committee and honor the Hong Kong people's reasonable  wishes as much as possible.    Meanwhile, the Hong Kong drafting committee members also  adjusted to the mainland's regulations and discussion  procedures. For example, when the Consultative Committee drew up  its regulations, some members objected to the reference to  "democratic consultation," saying that the term was "imprecise  and unscientific," and they also felt that it connoted the sense  that the democratic parties and factions were in agreement with  the ruling Communist Party. But in the mainland, democracy and  consultation always go hand in hand. Later a compromise was  reached, and the term was included in the regulations. I once  said that consultation was part of democracy, and for that I was  criticized by some Hong Kong people.    Actually it was just a misunderstanding. Consultation can be  on equal grounds. In the consultative process, there is an  assertive side, and there is also a side that accepts and  agrees, or both sides may compromise. Subsequently, in the  actual drawing up of the Basic Law, many in the Hong Kong  Drafting Committee and the Consultative Committee accepted this  approach, and everybody talked things over on equal footing. It  became a way to give expression to democracy.    Prior to the second plenary session of the Drafting  Committee, the secretariat sent copies of the outline of the  Draft Basic Law to the chairman and the vice chairmen. The  reporters came to me, and I said, "I have read it, but I cannot  disclose the contents." Little did I know that would cause  trouble. Liu Yiu-chu [1675 3852 3796] asked, "We are all  members. Why should he get to look at the draft first?" I  learned my lesson. In the mainland, usually we pay little  attention to procedure at meetings. To let someone in charge  look at a draft first was nothing unusal, but in a capitalist  society, procedure, also known as the rules of the game, is an  important part of democracy.    Later, Li Hou [2621 1775], the Drafting Committee secretary  general in charge of the secretariat, said, "At first, we  thought that the outline was not an essential issue; it had no  substantive content, and we thought that we might as well make a  rough draft, not knowing that it would lead to such  misunderstanding. Because of this incident, we have decided to  set up a special topic small group composed of mainland and Hong  Kong committee members." Practice later proved that the small  group approach was very effective.    The Basic Law was based on ideas suggested by mainland  experts and personages concerned about the Hong Kong question as  well as people from all walks of life in Hong Kong, including  some foreigners. By way of meetings and the broadcast media, and  through debates and consultations, the "comment-soliciting  draft," "rough draft," and "Decision" were written. In my  opinion, overall, the Hong Kong people were quite satisfied with  the Basic Law: Prior to "June 4," they were mainly interested in  whether the Basic Law would really be implemented after 1997.  After "June 4," they became more dissatisfied with the final  version of the political system as written in the Basic Law,  especially regarding Article 23 which amended the  anti-subversion clause.    Overall, the Basic Law was founded on the wisdom of the  masses and compiled after a complicated consultative process. It  was the result of compromises and the product of the expression  of wisdom on both sides. Even today, I still think that it is a  good choice that will put the people of Hong Kong on the road to  democratic autonomy.  <H3>  5. Trouble Over a Booklet (part 1 of 4): British Hong Kong  Published "Green Paper" and "White Paper" </H3>   The British Hong Kong government put out the "Green Paper"  on  the reform of the system of representative government in July,  before the Draft Joint Declaration was signed by China and  Britain in September 1984, and in November, before the formal  signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration in December, it  rushed to publish the "White Paper." In Hong Kong, these actions  caught our attention, and we began studying them.    The British Hong Kong government's goal as stated in the  "Green Paper" was to "gradually establish a political regime, so  that its power is firmly rooted in Hong Kong and has the full  authority to represent the Hong Kong people's views and is held  responsible to the Hong Kong people even more directly." By the  time the "White Paper" was published, the goal was even more  clear: It was to "gradually establish at the central level a  system of representative government that is even more directly  responsible to the Hong Kong people and is firmly rooted in Hong  Kong."    The British Government's goal was very clear. It was to set  up a system of representative government in Hong Kong and  practise so called "returning the government to the people."    From our own intelligence and from public opinion trends, we  had proof of British intention to radically change the basic  framework of the Hong Kong government prior to 1997.

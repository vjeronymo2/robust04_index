			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / World Bond Markets: New York US credit markets face a heavy flow of economic statistics this week, which could unsettle a market which has already lost the momentum from a two-week rally. The benchmark 30-year Treasury issue fell  3/8 on Friday, with its yield dropping to 7.31 per cent from 7.27 per cent after the release of May producer prices figures. These showed a drop of 0.1 per cent, but this was due to large falls in volatile food and energy prices. The core rate of inflation rose by a larger than expected 0.4 per cent, raising concern that inflation is gathering speed, and that this will prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy again. The market's more cautious tone will be tested tomorrow with the release of May's consumer price index. Analysts are forecasting an increase of 0.3 per cent, compared with a 0.1 per cent rise in April, with core prices up 0.3 per cent, against 0.2 per cent. Figures for May industrial production, due on Wednesday, are expected to show a rise of just 0.1 per cent, down from 0.3 per cent in April, partly because of a decline in output from vehicle manufacturers. Operating rates were probably around 83.5 per cent, compared with 83.6 per cent in April. Retail sales, also due tomorrow, appear to have been uninspiring in May, with sagging sales at car dealerships and chain stores.</p>

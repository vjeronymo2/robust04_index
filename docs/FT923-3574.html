			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: RTZ The most interesting feature of RTZ at present is its sensitivity to currency movements. The metals company went to some lengths at its half-year presentation yesterday to demonstrate that the impact of foreign exchanges on its earnings is generally less than it seems, and that the long-term economic value of a shareholder's investment can often be broadly unchanged. Cynics will say that the exercise was designed to explain the 12 per cent under-performance of RTZ's shares since the end of June; the rejoinder is that the company may be talking itself out of a rebound in its price if the dollar recovers, or if sterling devalues within the ERM. RTZ's analysis is as relevant to other overseas earners. It makes the often forgotten point that when one bilateral currency relationship changes, others do not necessarily remain constant. Thus, while a 10 per cent fall in the US dollar against the pound might typically knock Pounds 50m off half-year earnings, an accompanying 10 per cent fall in the Australian dollar saves Pounds 17m in costs. Though difficult to quantify, a falling US currency tends over time to lead to a rise in commodity prices, a development which might add back a further Pounds 18m in the above example. Finally there is the lower sterling value of foreign currency debt, of which RTZ has Dollars 1.8bn. The message is clear. The shares may be fair value on a 5.5 per cent yield and above average earnings multiple. They should not be chased uncritically.</p>

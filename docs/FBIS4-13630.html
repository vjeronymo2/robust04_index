			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ma'an Mukhawwal: "Why the Fundamentalist </F> Movement is Weak in Morocco"]    [Text] The bloody events in Algeria have added other things  to Morocco's concerns, such as the possible spread of the  conflict to this country. Morocco's official stance has ranged  from caution to semi-silence, avoiding any involvement in the  conflict. This is in contrast to the stances of the Moroccan  political parties. Some of these parties, such as the  Independence Party, support the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS]  while others, such as the Socialist Union of Popular Forces,  support the Algerian Government.    Undoubtedly, the fundamentalist movement began to grow in a  serious manner in the sixties and mid-seventies. This does not  mean that the Moroccan parties did not contain Islamic factions.  On the contrary, these Islamic factions were able to make their  words heard within their own parties, such as the faction of  Shaykh Mohamed Ben-al-'Arabi al-'Alawi in the National Union of  Popular Forces and the faction of Habib Farkani in the Socialist  Union of Popular Forces.    The religious issue spawned by the growth of the  fundamentalist movement is influenced by a number of pressing  factors that come from the very core of society. These factors  have diminished the political Islamic groups' ability for  movement, maneuvering, preaching, and guidance. Although  Morocco, like other Islamic and Arab states, is experiencing a  conflict between two kinds of logic that barely coexist--the  logic of the state and the logic of the Islamic call--it has  sought from the outset to use the call to serve the state. It  has not done this in a crude way but has made the call one of  the factors for building the state.    The state opened a number of channels through which it  sought  to control the call's course by controlling the scholars, who  were the main activists. It supervised their work, guided them,  and put them under surveillance. The state established the "Dar  al-Hadith al- Hasaniyah" in 1964 and entrusted it with taking  care of higher Islamic studies, which specialize in the science  of the Koran and Sunna [body of Islamic custom and practice  based on Prophet Muhammad's words and deeds]. The political  authority's success in containing the call and controlling its  work has enabled it to undermine competing and undesirable  channels. The Scholars Authority was merged into the civil  service. If the Friday preachers violated the directives of the  Ministry of Awqaf, the latter would prevent them and even  dismiss them if necessary. The scholars' role was confined to  protecting the unity of the nation on the level of religion and  creed.    King Hassan II said: I am afraid for Islam from the Muslims.  He adds: There is no exaggeration, no excessiveness, and no  bigotry in religion. No one is a custodian of others. No one  must dictate to others behavior, ethics, and daily activities of  society.    In the seventies Morocco witnessed extremist leftist  currents  that tried the course of political violence but failed. In the  eighties Islamic extremist groups such as "Fasil al-Jihad" and  "Katibat Badr" tried to adopt a strategy of violence to bring  about political change. The security authorities, however,  succeeded in dismantling them and convicting their members in  1984 and 1985. Not only did fundamentalism in Morocco fail in  its armed violence but the call also did not receive an  attentive ear for several reasons:    1. The longevity of the monarchy in Morocco, which dates to  the eighth century when Idris Bin-'Abdallah sought refuge in  Morocco after his escape from a massacre during the 'Abbasid  era. The Aurbah tribe gave him refuge, honored him, and  established ties of marriage with him. This tribe and others  chose him as king and recognized his only son, Idris II, as his  successor.    In 1809 [as published] Idris II founded Fes and made it his  capital. With time, and thanks to the efforts of the 'Alawite  kings, it became one of the most important centers of Islam. It  is no coincidence that the monarchy in Morocco is popular and  Islamic. If it were not for the congruity between monarchy and  Islam, we would not be able to speak about a Moroccan nation  that has its prerequisites and unity. King Hassan has  maintained harmony among the people and has achieved and upheld  the country's unity despite the existence of multiple tribes and  divergent views. The state's sole authority controlled the  remote areas and the interior of the country in a secure,  legislative, and economic unity encompassing shepherds, farmers,  merchants, and sailors.    2. The Salafiyah [early 20th century movement led by  reformers wishing to reconcile Muslim traditions with modern  life and justify Muslim tenets through rational arguments] is  the backdrop of the Moroccan nationalist movement. Since it  took shape in the early thirties, the nationalist movement in  Morocco leaned heavily on Islam in its fight against the  protectorate [French] authorities. Thanks to its great pioneer,  Alal el-Fassi, the national movement maintained a healthy  Islamic attitude, dismissing dogmatic ideas, and denouncing  misguided practices.    The Salafiyah played an important role in the resistance  against protectorate powers. The national movement did all it  could to join forces with other groups involved in resisting the  occupation, including mystic schools and Sufi [Muslim esoteric  societies usually featuring a guru, initiation rites, and claims  of psychic powers] movements. All differences were set aside in  the common cause of achieving reform and liberation.    Thus, all the above-mentioned groups joined in one movement  whose aim was Moroccan nationalism: liberation and independence.  Mystic traditions blended with the desire for reform, creating  a sense of flexibility and a clarity of goal that greatly suited  the simple tenets of Moroccan Sufism.    3. The civic code. A collection of laws regulating family  relations was passed under the aegis of political authorities  wishing to combine Islamic tenets, traditions, and the teachings  of Imam Malik [early Muslim legislator] in one body of laws. A  committee of ulema, judges, and legal experts were put to work  and finally produced a civic code reminiscent of that of  Tunisia. In many instances, the code recognizes equality  between men and women.    Despite widespread liberalism in Morocco, there is a certain  balance between liberalism and Islamic values. Social freedoms  steer clear of Muslim sensibilities. The port city of Sale, for  instance, boasts many sidewalk cafes, busy with customers  whiling away the time in the winter sun, but not one liquor shop.    Morocco may be a Third World country that needs assistance,  but neither its government nor its people are destitute. Its  agricultural reform plan was a dazzling success. Morocco has  met its international financial obligations, reinforcing  confidence in its future.    Morocco does not only enjoy political and economic  stability,  it also has political parties with a Salafi penchant. These  parties are always trying to win over the Islamic tide. These  efforts have robbed the fundamentalists of much of their lure  and have diminished their political appeal.    The fundamentalists have no grassroots support among the  working classes or any presence to speak of in the countryside.  Their activists work exclusively in big cities and among  students.    The Moroccans are open minded and moderate by nature. They  see no contradiction between going to the mosque and adopting  modern ways. The Moroccan family acts as a safety valve, for it  greatly influences the cultural and professional lives of its  members. Family bonds are stronger than political ones in that  country.    For all the above reasons, Moroccan fundamentalism has been  unable to "strike back" and claim an exclusive mandate in  matters of faith. Its field of action is confined to things  political, which puts it in direct competition with other  parties. Its appeal is ineffective and its record unimpressive.  For lack of a better cause, Shaykh Abdessalam Yassine, a top  fundamentalist preacher, advocates a brand of Sufism "that  cannot be learned by study and earnest reading" or be found  between the covers of a book.    Morocco is a country with challenges on its mind. Shaykh  Yassine's other-worldly appeal is no help in facing these  challenges.</p>

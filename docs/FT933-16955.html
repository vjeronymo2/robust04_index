			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Survey of German Banking and Finance (5): 'Lean-banking' is the buzz word - Recession has not yet affected the prosperous banking sector MR Ulrich Cartellieri, a board director at the Deutsche Bank, is fond of arguing that the banking sector in Germany is potentially the steel industry of the 1990s. The thrust of his argument is that there are too many credit institutions in Germany (4,453 at the end of 1991 - the latest figure provided by the Bundesbank), and that this number must shrink over the course of the decade amid a restructuring as drastic as that which has afflicted the European steel industry. As yet, however, there is very little evidence of his prediction coming true. On the contrary, judging by the robust profits still being generated by the larger, quoted German banks, the banking sector seems to be an island of prosperity amid the deepening gloom of Germany's worst recession since the war. Germany's bigger banks all enjoyed a record year last year. The top five quoted institutions posted annual increases in total operating profits ranging from 7 per cent at Deutsche Bank (the biggest) to 21 per cent at Commerzbank and 33 per cent at the Bayerische Vereinsbank. Moreover, operating profits do not appear to have run out of momentum during the current year. Deutsche Bank reported that total operating profits rose by 'a good 20 per cent' in the first four months of 1993; Dresdner Bank (the second biggest in Germany) has reported that profits increased by 15 per cent over the same period and Commerzbank said that they climbed by more than a quarter in the period from January to March. The performance has been recognised by investors: the banking sector (excluding Deutsche Bank) outperformed the German stock-market as a whole by more than 17 per cent; Deutsche outperformed the market by 5 per cent (reflecting the higher rating normally accorded to the bank by investors). But how long can it continue? Mr Peter Pietsch, an economist at the Commerzbank in Frankfurt, observes: The increase in profits to record levels over the past two years reflects a steep rise in the demand for credit - total bank lending to non-banks excluding treasury bill credits grew by DM240bn last year - 8 per cent - with a much higher rate of growth in medium and long-term credits. Although demand for funds has reduced with the onset of tougher conditions in the economy, it is still 'brisk,' says Pietsch, with DM10.6bn of new credits granted in February. This reflects a number of factors, including lower interest rates and the continued availability of government subsidies to help finance investment in eastern Germany. Another consideration is that increased public sector borrowing is picking up the slack created by reduced demand for funds from private companies. Much of the increase in banks' total profits in the early months of this year reflect buoyant equity and bund markets. The DAX index of 30 leading shares climbed sharply in the early part of the year and last year's bund rally through to the middle of April, with yields on the 10-year Bund dropping to under 6.5 per cent from over 9 per cent in the summer of last year. This benefited the banks on two counts: they increased their fee income via providing securities-related services to their clients, and they made profits for themselves via own-account dealings. These factors help explain the growth in operating profits in the past, and provide some comfort for the outlook for the rest of the year. But to a large extent, as Pietsch readily admits, the operating profits provide an unrealistically positive picture of the German banking sector's prosperity - because they are calculated before provisions for bad and doubtful debts. It is understandable at a time of deepening recession, when the number of bankruptcies has risen sharply, that the banks have been increasing their provisions. By just how much is not clear: the banks do not disclose the figure - although they will begin to do so later this summer, when they release their full figures for the first six months of the year. Analysts have already been able to make a guess at the scale of provisions, following hints dropped by the banks' chief executives at recent press conferences. Goldman Sachs, for example, calculates that provisions against domestic credit risk doubled in 1992 to roughly 1 per cent of total lending. This reflects an especially high increase in provisions to cover loans to small and medium-sized businesses. Deutsche Bank disclosed that nearly three quarters of its provisions were against loans for less than DM10m, mainly in manufacturing. Mr Ian McEwen, European bank analyst at Merrill Lynch, has studied the numbers and come to the conclusion that net provisions as a proportion of operating profits range from 43 per cent at Deutsche Bank to 64 per cent at Dresdner Bank and a massive 95 per cent at Commerzbank. McEwen says that in the light of the banks' poor disclosure policies these calculations are 'subject to considerable uncertainty.' But he argues that the truth about bank profitability is startling - only Deutsche, of the big three banks, has a comfortable relationship between the net provisioning and the level of profits. 'This means that the boom years for the German banks have already ended,' says McEwen; but this has yet to feed through to the bottom line. He predicts that strong lending and buoyant markets will enable the banks to post further gains in operating profits this year. Next year, however, he expects operating profits to fall by 10 to 15 per cent - although these figures will not be disclosed until well into 1995. By then, the bad debts situation will have deteriorated still further. Pietsch, at Commerzbank, is adamant that by international standards the German banking sector will continue to look relatively strong. 'We don't have all the dramatic developments here in Germany that have afflicted the banking sector in the US or Japan,' he says. 'Although there is a downturn in the property sector, for example, there is no structural crisis. 'Of course industry is weak in Germany, but total industries are not vanishing as they have in the US. Perhaps the only really dramatic developments are in the machine tool sector - in the motor industry, by contrast, we are experiencing a cyclical downturn rather than catastrophe.' Moreover, Germany is not facing a savings and loans crisis of the kind experienced in the US - nor do the banks have to deal with the aftermath of imprudent lending to finance highly leveraged takeover transactions. But, perhaps in recognition that more difficult times are head, the buzz word in the German financial services sector at present is 'lean-banking': after a period of years in which costs have risen sharply, banks are beginning to take more care of cost management. This can mean reducing staff levels: Commerzbank, for example, plans to reduce its staff levels by 1,000 from 30,000 by the end of next year. It has recently denied reports that it is planning to lay off twice as many people as part of a slimming-down of its Frankfurt head office. That a review of head office costs is underway is no secret: the McKinsey consulting firm has prepared a report on the issue, and the Commerzbank board will decide on rationalisation measures at the end of July.</p>

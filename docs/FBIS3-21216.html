(Maeda Tubes), a secondary concrete product manufacturer,  disclosed its development of ultra-high-strength concrete with a  bending strength comparable to that of aluminum.    Maeda Tubes was able to develop the high strength by filling  the space between cement particles with a mixture of a  thermosetting resin and a special additive. Professor Teruo  Kishi of the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology  at the University of Tokyo, who was present when the  announcement was made, said the following: ``This performance  makes the material applicable to aircraft structural  materials.'' Maeda Tubes plans to market the new product to a  broad field of industries.    The trade name of this new product is ``Maeta Power Ceramics  (MPC).'' The product was developed in cooperation with Professor  Masaki Hasegawa (Polymer Chemistry) of Toin Gakuen Yokohama  University. Ordinary concrete has a structure in which cement  grains are bonded with each other through the formation of  hydrates as a result of the reaction between cement and water.  Such concrete has many gaps between grains, resulting in low  bending and tensile strengths because the strength of the  bonding material itself, i.e., the hydrate, is poor.    In contrast, MPC can be hardened by heating a molded,  clay-like mixture of cement, a resin and an additive, without  any water, for several hours at approximately 200xC. A small  amount of water from the resin forms an extremely thin hydrate  film on the surface of cement grains, and the film and the resin  that fills the space between grains react to produce a bonding  material with high strength.    According to Maeda Tubes experiments, MPC showed a bending  strength of 1,200-2,200 kgf/cm[.sup]2[/], as compared with 70  kgf for ordinary concrete and approximately 1,500 kgf for  metallic aluminum. As for the tensile strength, MPC registered  540-1,000 kgf, in contrast to 470-1,200 kgf for aluminum.    The density of MPC is approximately 2.2 g/cc, which is lower  than aluminum. In addition, MPC is fire-resistant,  corrosion-resistant, and readily machinable. In the future,  Maeda Tubes plans to distribute samples to machine and transport  manufacturers and construction companies to seek new  applications. MPC sheets with a thickness of 2-3mm are expected  to be priced at &yen;10,000-15,000 per square meter.</p>

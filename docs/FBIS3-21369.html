			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Abderrahmane Tlili, secretary-general of the </F> Unionist Democratic Union, by Fatiha Ferchouche; place and date  not given: "`The Problem of the Arab World Has Been and Remains  Democracy'"; first paragraph is REALITES introduction]    [Text] The secretary-general of the UDU [Unionist  Democratic Union] here makes a general survey. He talks about  pan-Arabism, the SAP [Structural Adjustment Program], and the  upcoming elections in this interview.    [Ferchouche] What distinguishes the UDU from other parties  and the RCD [Constitutional and Democratic Rally]?    [Tlili] We are the only Tunisian party to have incorporated  the Arab dimension into its political program. All the others,  on the other hand, and I am not being polemical here at all,  have added that element to their--demagogic--rhetoric purely as  a matter of opportunism since the crisis in the Gulf.    [Ferchouche] Isn't that paradoxical--didn't the Gulf crisis  reveal the failure of pan-Arabism or at least of a certain form  of pan-Arabism?    [Tlili] For our part, we feel that nationalism is a basic  fact among peoples. This is true even in the most authoritarian  regimes like the former USSR, where, despite the support of  Marxist ideology, the transfers of populations, and the  "integration" policies, it was impossible to wipe out  nationalism. What has happened in the Arab world is the failure  of Arab nationalists, not of Arab nationalism. It is the same  failure as that experienced by all those who have not  incorporated the democratic dimension into their platforms and  actions--all those who have used the just aspirations of the  people as the basis of their dictatorships. The problem of the  Arab world has been and remains democracy. For that matter, the  simple reason why all attempts at union have always failed is,  basically, the absence of democracy, on which the fate of any  political plan depends nowadays.    [Ferchouche] What is your economic program?    [Tlili] It is premature to talk about an economic program  when the election campaign has not yet officially begun. We will  have plenty of time to explain our entire election platform to  you. But here are the main outlines: we will place special  emphasis on three problems: employment and vocational training,  regional development, and exports. It is true that those  problems are current topics and that they are being dealt with  by the authorities, but the UDU is trying to find better  solutions to them.    Employment, which is currently the scourge of the West,  could  become a real problem in coming years if care is not taken.  However, and this is not among its least advantages, the  Tunisian economy still has several pools of jobs, although some  sectors may be called upon sooner or later to undergo severe  restructuring. Besides the need to carry out public works  projects that are essential for modernizing our infrastructures,  it would be sufficient, for example, to implement a new urban  policy, if only by applying the legal arsenal available to the  municipal governments, to create thousands of jobs.    Vocational training is such an overworked subject that it is  tending to become a pet theme. Without going into detail, I will  say that we will propose an upgrading of training in the basic  and service occupations, a coordination of training with the  needs of the economy, and, above all, the supplying of training  that will meet the requirements of relocation, particularly as  regards certain jobs with a future such as data processing,  telematics, and so on. Just consider that Swissair subcontracts  its accounting to Bombay, India, whereas we are continuing to be  subcontractors in areas where we will soon be supplanted by the  Asian countries, especially China and Vietnam!    As far as regional development is concerned, we will propose  the establishment of economic zones and development centers that  will have their own funds, which will be determined in  proportion to their rates of growth.    [Ferchouche] Are you talking about decentralization?    [Tlili] It is no longer a question of decentralization, but  rather of regionalization. Those regions will also have certain  prerogatives clearly defined by law to enable them to take full  or partial responsibility for certain sectors of economic,  social, and cultural life that have traditionally been managed  by the central government (schools, hospitals, and so on). This  should result in genuine interregional competition.    As regards exports--another subject that everybody talks  about but very few understand--we feel that our export products  will not be able to survive international competition,  especially after 1995, which is when the GATT agreements will  take effect, unless they are competitive in terms of quality,  enter the distribution channels, and carry guarantees of quality  and origin.    All of this will require a great deal of financial  investment. Are domestic savings sufficient to carry out all  those programs? We do not think so. Hence the need for foreign  investment, and we estimate that at least $1.5 billion per year  will be needed for 10 years or so. And it seems obvious to us  that Tunisia is not benefiting sufficiently from the  opportunities for financial investment from abroad or from the  relocation of industry from North to South: China attracted more  than $130 billion in foreign investment in 1993.    [Ferchouche] The great majority of the parties have  criticized the SAP. What is your position on that subject?    [Tlili] The SAP is a necessity, and regardless of our  judgment and opinion of that program, it has obviously made  steady progress over the past several years. Its first phase is  drawing to a close. It has yielded favorable results from the  standpoint of overall balances and growth. Those successes are  due basically to the fact that Tunisia, through the personal  impetus given by President Ben Ali, has managed to safeguard its  social gains, something that is not the case in other countries,  where we have seen the rise of discontent and even popular  revolts following implementation of the SAP.    For our part, we ourselves were saying from the start that  those social gains--the quality of social services and public  service--should not be victims of the SAP, because we feel that  growth in the GNP [gross national product] is worth the trouble  only if it does not make the rich richer and the poor  poorer--that is, if it guarantees a maximum of general  satisfaction.    [Ferchouche] How do you intend to approach the elections?    [Tlili] Under our internal rules, it is the National Council  that decides election policy and appoints candidates. To begin  with, work has been done at the regional federation level to  draw up consensual slates of candidates. Now it will be up the  National Council to ratify those rank-and-file decisions or  arbitrate disagreements.    [Ferchouche] Are alliances planned in connection with the  elections?    [Tlili] Alliances are no longer the order of the day.  Putting  together a coalition based on a common platform is out of date,  and the timetable does not allow for it. That being said, we  have been consistently calling for the formation of a democratic  front since 6 April 1989, but we have also been insisting that  such a front should be based on a common platform, not on a  temporary coalition, because right from the start, we were  afraid of combinations with a subjectively ephemeral character.  On the other hand, I think there is still time for technical  agreements among the parties aimed at ensuring that the  elections go smoothly. At any rate, all we can say at this stage  is that policies of one-upmanship must be avoided, because any  one-upmanship leads to the appearance, if only temporarily, of  extremes, meaning, in our case, a victory by all those who do  not want Tunisia to get in step with the multiparty system and  democracy.    [Ferchouche] In your opinion, what are the necessary  conditions for the success of the election campaign?    [Tlili] Political action cannot be regulated solely by laws.  The law is often ahead of reality, and mentalities must also  change. That change is slowly but surely taking place in our  country. Because of that, and speaking generally, we want the  campaign on radio and television in particular to take place in  conditions that will allow the various parties to express  themselves and clearly set forth their platforms, thereby  enabling the citizens to vote for the party they choose on the  basis of its platform rather than on the basis of clever  slogans. Because when all is said and done, the big challenge in  the elections lies not so much in their competitive nature and  the results they lead to as it does in the awareness that the  voter gains through his action as a citizen capable of  influencing, not to say directing, his country's policy on the  basis of his basic choices.    [Ferchouche] How do you see the postelection period?    [Tlili] It is difficult to foresee the postelection period,  but what one can say today is that on 21 March, all the parties  in the race will have to assess the operation. Will we witness a  movement to found new parties or realign some old ones? Perhaps.  For our part, we have already scheduled a National Council  meeting for the period after the election. There we will have to  genuinely assess our election results and, on that basis, decide  what steps to take. One such step might even be the calling of a  special congress this fall.</p>

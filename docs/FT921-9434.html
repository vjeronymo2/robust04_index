			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / International Company News: Riyad Bank flotation heavily oversubscribed A SHARE offering by Riyad Bank, representing the biggest flotation in Saudi history, was oversubscribed by more than three times, Reuter reports from Manama. Sheikh Ahmed Abdul-Latif, managing director, said 689,000 Saudi investors had applied for shares worth SR12.6bn (Dollars 3.34bn). The bank, the second biggest in the kingdom in terms of assets, offered 8m shares worth SR3.8bn to the Saudi public last month. Shares were priced at SR475 each, compared with trading levels of about SR750. Established in 1957, Riyad Bank has assets of about SR44bn. It posted a net profit of SR248m in 1990. Sheikh Ahmed said share trading on Saudi Arabia's unofficial stock market would continue to boom because of high liquidity and a lack of other investment opportunities.</p>

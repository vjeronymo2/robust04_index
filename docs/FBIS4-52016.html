			<p>BFN     [Text] Regarding the news report that the United States  has issued warrants for the arrest of Thais, including a member  of the House of Representatives, on charges of narcotics  trafficking, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said that Thailand  will have to wait for further information from the United States  because no charges have been clearly stated so far. He said  that if the case is confirmed, it will be the duty of the  persons concerned to give explanations.    [Begin recording] [Chuan] According to the information  received on past events, the issue is connected with what  happened several years ago. An American was arrested on a charge  of narcotics trafficking. The suspect confessed and said that  he bought the drugs from Thais.    [Unidentified reporter] Do you mean he referred to Thais?    [Chuan] He referred to Thais. The U.S. narcotics suppression  authorities requested our Office of Narcotics Control Board  [ONCB] to check the assets of those Thais. Therefore, I assume  this issue would be in consequence with the said incident. Now,  we have to wait for additional information or report that the  United States will provide for us. As of now, nothing has been  confirmed nor denied.    [Reporter] Did the American suspect give the names?    [Chuan] Yes, he gave the names.    [Reporter] One name or many?    [Chuan] Thai names were stated. I think more than one, but I  am not sure how many. The suspect also said the operations had  been carried out for many years.    [Reporter] [Question indistinct]    [Chuan] Nothing. No charges have been clearly stated yet.  It is the event in the United States, and no clear details have  been sent to us. We have only known from news reports.    [Reporter] But now the Thai Parliament [words indistinct].    [Chuan] We must follow up on it. If it involves individuals  or there is any confirmation, then it will be the duty of those  persons involved to give explanations.    [Reporter] What has the ONCB been authorized to do, because  this matter also affectes the image of Thailand?    [Chuan] The ONCB is following up on it to get more  information. Right now we cannot give any more details than what  we have received. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Boris Glebov article: "Sevastopol Will Stick in General </F> Grachev's Memory for a Long Time"]    [Text] In addition to the diplomatic failure of the talks  on the Black Sea Fleet between the defense ministers of Russia  and Ukraine, General Grachev's visit to Sevastopol also  distressed him personally. After the virtual collapse of the  talks Ministers Grachev and Radetskyy publicly exchanged caustic  remarks: In a statement on Ukrainian television Gen. Vitaliy  Radetskyy bitingly "nicknamed" Pavel Grachev "pan general."    Already standing on the steps of the "ministerial" Tu-154,  Gen. Grachev in turn told the Ukrainian officers seeing him off  his opinion of the reception given him and the entire Russian  delegation on Ukrainian soil. The crux of Minister Grachev's  statement boiled down to this: Of course, Ukraine is still a  very young state, but this certainly does not excuse the way  foreign delegations are received here (Grachev had in mind the  Russian Defense Ministry delegation). Pavel Grachev went on to  insert a sentence about the Ukrainian side's lack of concepts of  diplomatic etiquette and said that he would not have been at all  surprised if, instead of leaving for Moscow, Ukrainian  special-purpose troops had arrested the Russian delegation right  at the airport and clapped him -- the Russian Federation  minister of defense -- in handcuffs!    The persons accompanying Grachev were evidently not the only  ones to appreciate the general's joke, for by a "strange"  coincidence the Ukrainian air traffic controllers (the Russian  delegation was flying from the "Belbek" military airfield of the  Ukrainian Air Defense Forces) prohibited Grachev's aircraft from  taking off. From 1600 through 1740 hours -- for almost two  hours -- Ukraine did not grant the Russian delegation the right  to leave Ukrainian soil. It all ended in Pavel Grachev, now  beside himself, issuing a personal order to the commander of his  Tu-154: "To hell with them, we're taking off!..." The airliner  with the Russian delegation on board took off from "Belbek"  without permission from the Ukrainian air traffic controllers.    Incidentally, according to recent data, at the time of the  Russian-Ukrainian talks in Sevastopol Admiral Eduard Baltin,  commander of the Black Sea Fleet, took no part in them because  he was on the "sick list" with a heart attack. The Black Sea  Fleet leadership was represented by Vice Admiral Vitaliy  Larionov, deputy commander of the Black Sea Fleet.    The Ukrainian side greeted the Russian delegation more than  strangely: A military subunit of the Ukrainian Air Defense  Forces stationed on Cape Khersones, in full combat gear,  rehearsed...the defense of the approaches to Khersones against  attack by units of the Russian Black Sea Fleet! At the same  time, on the roof of Sevastopol dolphinarium, servicemen of the  Ukrainian Navy's marines had ostentatiously set up a post for  round-the-clock observation of the Black Sea Fleet Marines  brigade (based in "Kazachya" Bay, within the limits of  Sevastopol). Observation is still being carried out using  special facilities: night-vision devices and the latest  communications equipment. Ukrainian servicemen do not conceal  their animosity toward the target of observation.    Directly after the Russian Federation Defense Ministry  delegation left Sevastopol, the Ukrainian side put very strong  pressure on senior officers of the Black Sea Fleet Marines  brigade (from "Kazachya" Bay) to make them switch to the  Ukrainian side and take the Ukrainian oath.    They even telephoned certain Russian officers of the Black  Sea Fleet at home, agitating for Ukraine. In their official  zeal the "agitators" -- Ukrainian Navy officers Captain First  Rank Yevgeniy Ivanov and Lieutenant Colonel Aleksey Murashev --  went so far in their "agitation" that they even disavowed a  statement by their own President Kravchuk and explained to the  Russian sailors that Sevastopol will no longer be a base of the  Russian Black Sea Fleet!    There then followed, naturally, promises of high official  salaries and ranks in the Ukrainian Armed Forces right up to  those of a general. And all this just for switching the Black  Sea Fleet Marines brigade in Sevastopol to the Ukrainian oath  and command.</p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: Venezuela PRICES on the Caracas Stock Exchange recovered slightly yesterday after a fall of over 6 per cent on Monday, the first trading day since Friday's failed coup against the government of President Carlos Andres Perez, writes Joseph Mann in Caracas. Monday's decline continued the slump in Venezuelan shares since a failed military uprising on February 4. The Caracas Stock Exchange index closed at 19,125.61 on Monday, down 35 per cent from the start of the year and 44 per cent below the 1992 high reached on February 3. In the currency market, strong support by the central bank limited the decline in the bolivar. The currency closed at 78.60 bolivars to the dollar on Monday, down from 78.35 on Thursday, which represents a fall of more than 27 per cent this year.</p>

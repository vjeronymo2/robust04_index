			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 11 (XINHUA)-- Chinese rural  residents put over 126 billion yuan into banks in 1993, which  brings the total private deposits in the Agricultural Bank of  China (ABC) and rural credit cooperatives to a record high of  610 billion yuan.    The figure ranks the Agricultural Bank of China first among  the four state specialized banks in terms of the personal  savings each bank holds.    According to an ABC official, the bank recalled some 5.8  billion yuan extended to non-financial institutions under the  name of inter- bank lending by the end of last year, meanwhile  providing 230 billion yuan in direct loans to agricultural  production, representing a net increase of 30 billion yuan as  against the previous year.    And thank to the ABC's strict management of funds, there  were  much fewer cases of "IOU" reported throughout the country during  the purchase of grain and other agricultural products last year.    To help the growth of township enterprises, the bank made  loans of over 335 billion yuan to the rural firms and a  considerable portion of the loans went to the under-developed  central and western regions.    The bank official revealed that the central government has  decided to increase the amount of loans to the agricultural  sectors to some 10 percent of total bank lendings this year from  six percent in 1993.    This year, ABC's lending will mainly go to agriculture  production which either has high economic returns or can earn  more foreign currency.    It will also support the technical renovation of some  efficient rural industries so as to make their products more  competitive, said the official.</p>

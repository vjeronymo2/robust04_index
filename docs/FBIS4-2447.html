			<p>BFN     [Text] Shijiazhuang, April 11 (XINHUA) -- North China's  Hebei Province has concentrated its efforts on building and  upgrading technical and professional education with the aim of  helping promote economic prosperity.    The first group of 60 technical and professional training  schools (also called professional education centers) have been  set up, equipped with advanced educational appliances and  equipment such as computer systems.    Each of the schools has an average of 17,000 sq m of floor  space and 1,620 students.    Such schools used to be run by individual counties and they  were small and short of teachers and teaching facilities.    Statistics from 1990 show that each county with a population  of about 300,000 had nine such schools on average, with only 100  to 200 students.    With progress made in the rural economy, more and more  peasants are eager to learn new knowledge and skills.    In 1991 the provincial government urged various counties to  concentrate their efforts on building one or two comprehensive  education centers.    The second group of such schools is now under construction  and they are expected to be operational in July this year.    The province plans to build one such high-grade  comprehensive  technical school in every county by 1995.</p>

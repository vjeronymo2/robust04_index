			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nisar Ahmed Qaim Khani: "India's Attitude </F> Towards Kashmir and the Possibility of War"]    [Text] The decision of Pakistan's Government to "try its  best to raise the Kashmir issue at the United Nations" and to  unmask India's atrocities at every forum is a correct and timely  decision. Our prime minister is taking a step in the right  direction by dismissing plans to hold direct talks with India.  Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said in her speech to the Kashmir  Committee that she will not fall prey to any kind of expedient  move. This dispute is a life and death issue for Pakistan and  the government will use all its resources to resolve this issue  according to the UN resolutions and the desire of the people.  She told the nation, "No power in the world can stop us from  helping the Kashmiri people. Kashmir is burning and we cannot  leave it alone. We must stop the Indian atrocities. Kashmir is  not only our heritage but also our history." She further said  that Pakistan will gave examples of human rights violations in  occupied Kashmir to the UN Human Rights Commission. "I will  present the case of Kashmir to the Human Rights Commission  personally. Our efforts are aimed at making the world aware of  this problem and wakening the world conscience." We know that at  times the world opinion is full of double standards. However, we  must continue our political, diplomatic, and moral efforts in  this changing world. We are sure that in the long run these  efforts will bear fruit and Kashmir will win its right to  self-determination." The prime minister's decision makes it  clear that the government is determined to talk about the  Kashmir issue on every platform and its stand on this issue is  correct, solid, and clear.    The year 1994 can be a very important year for Kashmir. This  is the final round of struggle for independence in occupied  Kashmir. All Kashmiris are willing to embrace death and the  people are supporting the freedom fighters. This was related by  U.S. correspondent Martin Sugarman after spending one month in  occupied Kashmir. Despite strict restrictions on journalists in  Kashmir by the Indian security forces, Martin Sugarman traveled  the valley extensively as a tourist. He said that there is no  other example in the world of what is happening in occupied  Kashmir. The people are totally unarmed and have risen against  the third largest military force in the world. No outside hand  is behind this freedom struggle. He said that calling their  struggle foreign interference is an insult to the Kashmiri  people. He said that India was not willing to permit any human  rights organization or journalists to observe its dirty game. He  had gone there as a tourist and had to be very careful during  his one month's visit there. Three Iranian journalists who were  in occupied Kashmir as tourists were caught by the security  forces. These three died during interrogation by the security  forces.    A large number of British Parliamentarians assured their  support for self-determination to the Kashmiris and ending  Indian atrocities there. They have expressed their determination  to raise the Kashmir issue in the Parliament. They had made this  announcement while addressing the university where Sultan  Mehmood Chowdhery, leader of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation  Front, works. Rogers Godsave, chairman of All Parties Kashmir  Parliamentary Committee, has assured that 60 members of his  committee will continue to support the Kashmiri people in the  British Parliament. These statements make it clear that the  whole world feels the need to resolve the Kashmir issue and the  world opinion is against the atrocities India is committing  there. Even India's friend, Russia, has expressed a similar  reaction. Russian President Boris Yeltsin had expressed concern  over human rights violations in occupied Kashmir in a letter to  Prime Minister Narasimha Rao and has asked India to solve this  problem equitably. Even India's friends that support it over  Kashmir are pressuring India not to delay an impartial  resolution of this problem. The Indian security forces are  involved in such hair-raising crimes as killing innocent  Kashmiris, burning houses, and mass rape under the pretext of  implementing the Public Security Act and the Terrorism Control  Act. These incidents have shaken up the international conscience  and are being condemned everywhere. All nations in the world and  international human rights organizations are aware of this  "Indian bestiality" and are raising voice against human rights  violations and torture committed on Kashmiri people. Each  passing minute sees increase in the volume in this voice. The  whole world is aware and actively asking to accelerate efforts  to solve this problem. Indian actions are condemned by the whole  world. India cannot face this international pressure for long as  India is already isolated in the international community. Even  public opinion in India is changing. The thoughtful press there  and Inderjit Gupta, a prominent Indian parliamentarian, have  expressed their opinion against the Indian actions in occupied  Kashmir. The Indian people have begun to question why are they  fighting a losing war in Kashmir. The Indian people believe that  their government's policy is not right. In addition, according  to an Indian estimate, India is spending 180 to 200 million  rupees per day in Siachen at a time when the people are dying of  hunger on footpaths and streets. The Indian economy has  deteriorated. The Indian armed forces have lost their fortitude  and an army without fortitude cannot win. Therefore, India  should forget that it can control Kashmir with the army for  long. The sooner India agrees to resolve the Kashmir issue  according to the UN resolutions, the better it would be for  India itself. The present situation is very dangerous to India's  internal stability and security.    Kashmir has become the worst example of atrocious actions  and  human rights violations. According to the reports issued by the  Amnesty International, Asia Watch, and other human rights  organizations, 30,698 Kashmiris have been killed between January  1992 and September 1993. Four thousand three hundred and eighty  incidents of rapes have been recorded. Extreme torture has  resulted in the death of 4,574 persons. In addition to this all,  more than 40,000 persons are in various jails and an equal  number is missing. However, the brave Kashmiris are still  fighting.    The Kashmiri freedom fighters have opened a new chapter on 9  January 1994 in the history of their four year struggle. They  attacked the radio system complex at the Avantipura airport in  southern Kashmir and killed nine Indian airmen and officers.  This was the first time that Kashmiri freedom fighters had  entered a sensitive military zone and returned without any  casualties after killing nine Indian soldiers. High Indian  officials and military officers were greatly perturbed by this  incident. The Indian defense forces have declared this incident  to be very threatening. According to news received from Jammu,  the Kashmiri freedom fighters took a light machine gun, a sten  gun, five self-loading rifles, and a wireless set from the  Indian ordinance storage.    This incident is a new development in the struggle of  Kashmiri freedom fighters and points to the new turn their  efforts have taken. The Kashmiri freedom fighters have given a  warning to the Indian government and high-level military  officials through this attack on the Indian air base to stop  crossing all the limits of atrocities, think about the  consequences, and protect themselves from the vengeful  activities of the freedom fighters.    India has also started "aggression" in the areas bordering  Azad Kashmir. At the same time, it is threatening Pakistan with  a war. This situation is dangerous for peace in South Asia and  the international community should take immediate notice of it.  It should not only increase pressure on India to resolve the  Kashmir issue, but also announce through the United States,  Russia, Great Britain, France, and other major world powers that  economic defense and space air space restriction would be  imposed against India. The Kashmir situation has reached a point  where war between India and Pakistan could erupt any time. If  this war starts, we cannot say what horrible results this  continent and the world will face.  *</p>

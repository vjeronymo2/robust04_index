The agreement foresees the radar base at Skrunda, Latvia, to  operate under Russian command during the next 4 years and to be  then dismantled within 18 months.    The EU in the statement says that the temporary agreement on  the Skrunda base will contribute to progress in Latvian-Russian  talks on the withdrawal of Russian troops. The EU regards the  agreement as containing no threat to Latvia's sovereignty, and  calls for approval of the document.    The good will demonstrated during the talks gives hope that  good- neighborly relations will be established between Latvia  and Russia, the EU statement says.</p>

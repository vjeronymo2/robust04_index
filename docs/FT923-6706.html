			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Good buys, but a risky business: Japanese shares look cheap by international standards, but history offers a warning to investors When Japanese shares touched their latest six-year low in the middle of the week, they appeared to offer some remarkable bargains. Even after the 13 per cent rally in the Nikkei index in the past three days, you can still buy blue-chip Japanese stocks at prices that have not been seen in years - ones that look particularly cheap when you compare them with the levels of share prices on Wall Street. Companies such as Matsushita, the electronics giant; Nissan, the car manufacturer; Hitachi, the electrical and electronics producer; and Fujitsu, the computer company, are all selling at below the book value of their assets. You can buy Toyota shares at only 11 times its last reported earnings per share; on this basis, Ford and GM, both lossmaking in their latest financial years, are more expensive. Fuji Photo is selling at 13 1/2 times earnings; Kodak at 13 3/4 . When you buy a share, you are acquiring rights to a future stream of corporate earnings. The rate at which those earnings rise is a critical determinant of how successful the investment will prove. If you can buy a Japanese company's current earnings stream at roughly the same price as you can buy that of an American company, the better bet is the one that is likely to grow faster. Now, given the developments of the past 40 years, which do you think is likely to raise its earnings faster, a Japanese company or an American one? Alas, western investors fell for a similar line of argument a year ago, with the Nikkei index at 22,000. International fund managers piled into Japan; Scottish fund managers, famous for their caution and long-term view, found prices particularly attractive. This week, they found themselves sitting on paper losses of nearly 40 per cent. International fund managers are therefore holding back, unsure whether current Tokyo share prices represent the buying opportunity of the decade, or yet another false bottom. After all, the Nikkei is still swinging wildly; some people say it could halve again. Unlike last autumn, investors now have Japanese economic conditions to worry about: in the process of deflating Japan's huge late-1980s bubble of property and share prices, the government has squeezed the economy to a standstill. Companies are suffering. The price/earnings ratios mentioned earlier are historical ones, relating in some cases to fiscal years that ended in the middle of 1991. Since then, Japanese earnings have fallen steadily. Toyota's historical p/e ratio, based on the financial year that ended in June 1991, is indeed 11; but the consensus estimate for the year that ended in June 1992, as calculated by the IBES survey of analysts' forecasts from around the world is 19. The estimate for the year now under way is 18. That may be too optimistic. Corporate earnings forecasts for the fiscal year to March 1993 have began to seem too bullish, as the expected economic recovery in the second half is now seen as unlikely to materialise. Consumer demand, which was expected to help the economy rebound in the latter half of this year, is declining rapidly, and economists are revising down their economic growth forecasts. On current forecasts, the market is a whole is selling at a price/earnings ratio of 35. But, says Mr Craig Chudler, strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in Tokyo: 'A 10 per cent downward revision in earnings forecasts for the year would bring up the p/e ratio to about 40 times, which is still expensive internationally and historically.' But price/earnings ratios do not tell the whole story. Japanese reporting conventions arguably understate companies' profitability, so investors have been used to buying their shares on far higher price/earnings ratios than those of western companies, even before the 1980s Tokyo stock market surge. The opportunity to buy some, at least, of Japan's blue-chip companies at broadly comparable ratios to their US rivals is unusual. Just as important, Japanese companies invested so much in capital equipment in the late 1980s that they now have huge depreciation charges, which hold down their profits. 'On a price/earnings ratio, only Fuji Photo looks really cheap,' said one international fund manager this week. 'You have to look at price/cash flow ratios to find the real bargains.' Cash flow - profits with depreciation added back in - is a measure of underlying trading performance. Nissan and Fujitsu, for example, are both selling at less than four times cash flow, if you consolidate the figures for all the companies in these groups. Calculations by Salomon Brothers, the investment bank, illustrated in the main chart, show that a group of big blue-chip Japanese companies, after years of selling at a higher price in cash-flow terms than their American equivalents, finally became cheaper this spring. Since then, the gap has probably widened. Cash-flow arguments highlight the real uncertainty from an investor's point of view: just what will the companies do with their cash? In the 1980s, Japanese companies raised money at extraordinarily low interest rates, and ploughed it into low-return investments, both at home and abroad. 'There was a blow-out in discretionary expenditure in the late 1980s, and total lack of interest in feeding any of it through to the bottom line,' says one international money manager. A Tokyo analyst adds: 'Many of these activities increased rather than decreased the break-even point.' If Japanese companies continue the pattern of the past, investors should not necessarily count on obtaining the benefits of all that cash flow; so its apparent cheapness may prove illusory. Assessing the value of Japanese stocks thus turns on the question of whether anything has happened to change the way Japanese managers behave. One thing has happened. The cheap money of the 1980s has vanished, and Japan's cost of capital has risen sharply. Managers, chagrined by the low returns on their splurge of capital expenditure, are assessing projects much more rigorously. Companies, faced with repaying cheap money and replacing with with much more expensive borrowings, are thinking much harder about profitability. Mr Richard Koo, an economist at Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo, wrote a much-talked-about paper in the spring, focusing on Japanese companies' chronic inattention to profitability, and arguing that it was now about to change. This week he said: 'Quite a few Japanese companies are taking that paper very seriously. The problem is they are stuck with existing product lines.' Products suitable for a volume-oriented strategy are not those on which a successful drive for greater profitability can be based. You will not see the results of a change in strategy, he argues, until the next product cycle. In the meantime, however, Japanese companies have one option: they can turn off the spending taps. That could produce a much more rapid bounce-back in profits when the economy starts to recover than Tokyo analysts expect. But investing on that basis is a bet on the timing of the Japanese economic cycle, a risky business given the strains to which the economy has been subjected. There are signs that the Japanese government is at last taking the situation with the seriousness which the markets believe it deserves. Much hangs on the government's economic package, scheduled for August 28. If that is judged less than the occasion demands, this week's brief stock market recovery could be speedily undone. There is one additional factor for investors to consider. Even if everything goes right for Japanese companies from here on, that does not mean share prices will respond in the way they would in the west. Western stock markets - particularly Anglo-Saxon ones - have had many decades of judging share prices in terms of valuation: weighing up the likely future income streams of companies, and calculating how cheap or dear that makes their shares. They do not always get it right, and they are prone to swings of mood that drastically affect the projections of future earnings and the value placed today on a dollar of earnings tomorrow. But the analytical framework is a shared one, and investors can be reasonably sure that, if they identify bargains correctly, others will in time come to adopt their views, driving the share prices up and rewarding early purchasers. In Tokyo, things are different. 'There is no discipline of valuation in this market,' says one British banker based there. Japanese investors have traditionally held a large portion of their assets in a passive form, determined as much by long-term corporate relationships as by investment judgment. The portion left over for discretionary investment has been used to place short-term bets on stocks which were already moving up - what is known as the 'momentum' theory of investing. The momentum approach says that you do not bet on a stock that is down. During the bubble years, when shares were going up along with everything else, industrial companies poured some of the cheap money they were raising into the stock market. That was fine when the market was going up, but now the market has halved. What seemed like sure-fire investments are now hopeless money-losers. Industrial companies - and retail investors - are deeply unhappy with their share portfolios, and keen to get out if they can do so with any degree of honour. Any rally is a signal for selling - so rallies do not last long. In the very long run, of course, a bargain stock remains a bargain. But in Tokyo, the mechanism that will drive it up from its low levels is imperfect. So buying now in expectation of a rise as others come to share your view about a stock's appeal is a dangerous business. As one New York-based investor put it this week: 'I've covered all my short-sales in Tokyo - but I haven't started buying yet.' Additional reporting by Emiko Terazono in Tokyo</p>

			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ANTELOPE VALLEY CHRISTIAN WINS 8-MAN TITLE  </P> <P> Antelope Valley Christian High's 54-26 victory over Visalia Central Village  Christian on Saturday at Antelope Valley College gave the Lancaster school its  first Southern Section 8-man Small Schools football title in three years of  trying. It also was first-year Coach Ted Knapp's 100th win as a high school  coach.  </P> <P> But there was little question as to which accomplishment was more important to  Knapp.  </P> <P> "I haven't even thought about the 100th win," he said. "I am proud that these  boys could be a part of that, but I am much more proud to have been a part of  their championship. The 100th win takes a back seat in a long-stretch limousine  to winning the (Southern Section) title."  </P> <P> After dashing to a 20-0 lead midway through the second quarter, top-seeded  Antelope Valley Christian (13-0) maintained at least a two-touchdown lead  throughout the game.  </P> <P> After a punchless first half in which it could score only once and had only two  passing yards, second-seeded Central Valley Christian (7-6) twice cut the lead  to 14 points but could get no closer.  </P> <P> Tight end Craig Cieslik ran for touchdowns of 51 and 66 yards in the second  half for Antelope Valley Christian.  </P> <P> Both scores came on a reverse, a play that was developed this week by Knapp and  his staff.  </P> <P> "I was very excited to run the ball. Most of the time it's just catch, catch,  catch," said Cieslik, who also caught a touchdown pass in the first quarter.  </P> <P> "The blocking on those plays was great. We knew it could work against their  defense and I knew I could get the yardage. We made it work."  </P></p>

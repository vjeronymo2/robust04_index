			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / UK Company News: SFO raids in Butte and Richmond inquiries THE SERIOUS Fraud Office raided a number of addresses in and around Stoke-on-Trent earlier this week in its investigations into a group of quoted natural resources companies and a separate alleged advance fee fraud which may extend to the US. The SFO yesterday confirmed that it had searched, among others, the premises of J Paterson Brodie &amp; Son, the Stoke-on-Trent accountants. The search was carried out on Wednesday morning in conjunction with City of London and Staffordshire police. The SFO has stressed that the raid on J Paterson Brodie was not part of an investigation into the accountants, but part of a wider inquiry. Several private residences were also searched. Police are believed to have confiscated documents concerning companies linked with natural resource groups, Butte Mining and Richmond Oil &amp; Gas, and Mr Charles Deacon, a Staffordshire solicitor. They are also understood to have taken all correspondence and files concerning the financial affairs of Mr Clive Smith, the Midlands entrepreneur who has been linked to the flotation of several natural resource companies in the late 1980s and early 1990s. J Paterson Brodie were auditors and financial advisers to Mr Smith for more than a decade. Mr Smith was active in the affairs of Butte Mining and held a stake in Richmond Oil &amp; Gas. Most recently, he has received attention for his role in backing the 1992 purchase of Alpine Double Glazing, the windows company which recently collapsed. The raid is the latest in a series which began in April last year with a swoop by Jersey fraud police on the offices of local accountants, Bryant &amp; Co. Documents uncovered there sparked a wide-ranging SFO inquiry into share dealings and transactions in UK-quoted Richmond Oil and Butte Mining. Since then the SFO has also raided the offices of Mr Deacon, who has had dealings with at least one of the resource companies, in connection with alleged advance fee frauds. Sources close to Mr Deacon said they doubted whether there was any connection between the SFO investigation into Richmond and Butte, and the advance fee inquiry. Mr Deacon, who has not practised as a solicitor since December, was declared bankrupt in April, claiming debts of more than Dollars 254m (Pounds 169m).</p>

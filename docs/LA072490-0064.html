			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> MOORPARK COUNCIL BACKS OFF FROM GROWTH MEASURE; LAWSUIT FEARED  </P> <P> Threatened with a lawsuit from builders, the Moorpark City Council on Monday  decided against placing on the Nov. 6 ballot a controversial measure that would  have forced elections on many growth issues.  </P> <P> The proposed measure was blocked by its own co-author, Councilman Scott  Montgomery. He withdrew his support at Monday night's council meeting after  members of the building industry threatened to sue the city.  </P> <P> Montgomery said he was unwilling to expose the city to a legal challenge after  City Attorney Cheryl Kane told the council that a lawsuit could cost as much as  $250,000 to fight in court.  </P> <P> "Moving ahead with the ordinance will guarantee the council will be sued,"  Montgomery told his fellow council members, who decided to send the measure  back to a committee. By not voting Monday, the council failed to meet the  deadline for placing the measure on the ballot.  </P> <P> The proposed law, called "a comprehensive planning ordinance," would haved  triggered an election each time new development involved zoning changes that  would push traffic volume over specific limits.  </P> <P> For instance, voters would have to approve any change at a 25-unit apartment  house, say from medium- to high-density to allow more units, that would push  the number of car trips generated by the building above 203 per day.  </P> <P> Such changes now require only approval by the City Council.  </P> <P> The proposal grew out of complaints about traffic in Moorpark, a city of nearly  27,000 people.  </P> <P> Paul Tryon, executive director of the Building Industry Assn., which represents  350 builders and developers in Ventura County, questioned the measure's  legality.  </P> <P> "I think it has reasonable merit for a legal challenge," he said.  </P> <P> Robert Holmes, legislative advocate for the Building Industry Assn., said the  proposed measure would violate state law that grants cities power to set  land-use policies -- powers they cannot pass on to the voters.  </P> <P> In a July 11 letter to the City Council, the builders group attacked the  proposed ordinance, saying, "Voters will be forced to make important decisions  based on 60-second sound bites."  </P> <P> "We're going to ask the public to make these critical decisions," Tryon said in  an interview. "What does it turn into? Maybe a guy gets his project approved  because he's good at politics."  </P> <P> Councilman Clint Harper, co-author of the measure with Montgomery, called the  builders association's attacks a smoke screen intended to keep voters from  having a say in critical decisions which affect them.  </P> <P> Harper said Moorpark voters are well-informed about growth issues, especially  the ones affecting their neighborhoods.  </P> <P> Harper said he was dismayed by Montgomery's change of heart, but said he  intends to draft an identical ballot initiative and seek enough signatures to  place it on a future ballot.  </P> <P> "The reason that the ordinance is being attacked by the building industry is  that if were implemented it would be effective," Harper said. "They see this  ordinance as a threat."  </P> <P> He said the building industry, "is not concerned the public won't understand.  They're concerned the public will understand it and will agree with the  concept."  </P> <P> Three years ago, when voters passed a growth-control ordinance called Measure  F, the association sued to block it. The suit was settled when Moorpark agreed  to increase the annual limit on building permits from 250 to 270.  </P> <P> "I think the city won," Harper said. "Measure F is still in place."  </P> <P> But the measure also raised objections among members of the City Council,  including Councilman Paul Lawrason and Councilwoman Eloise Brown.  </P> <P> "We've got a pile of litigation on our hands now that we can't seem to get out  from under," Lawrason said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Khmelko, doctor of philosophical </F> sciences, chairman of the department of sociology at the  University of the Kiev Mohyla Academy [Universytet  "Kyyevo-Mohylyanska Akademiya"], under the rubric "Politics":  "Who Supports Which Parties?"]    [Text] This question was answered to some degree by the  representative survey of the adult urban population of Ukraine  conducted in December by the Kiev International Institute of  Sociology (KMIS) and the department of sociology of the  University of the Kiev Mohyla Academy. A total of 1,677 persons  aged 18 and older were polled y means of interviews in Kiev and  102 other cities and towns [selyshcha miskoho typu] in all 24  oblasts and the Republic of Crimea.    The first thing that the survey showed is that the  percentage  of urban voters who prefer to cast their votes for candidates  who do not belong to any party is not all that large -- they  make up 18% of those polled. Twice as many voters are  inclined  to vote for candidates put forward by one party or another. Of  these respondents, 21% have already decided on their  choice and  named the party for whose candidates they would vote. Of the  voters who expressed no preference regarding whether a candidate  represented a party or not (they number 46%), only  one-quarter  is planning to vote in the elections. The attitude to voting in  the elections is quite different among those supporting parties:  nearly nine-tenths of them (89%) plan to vote. Among  supporters  of candidates that do not belong to any party, the number that  plans to cast a vote is significantly lower -- 71%.    There is more support for party candidates among men  (39%)  than women (34%); among members of older generations  (over 60  -- 42%, between 46 and 60 -- 38%) than among  younger voters  (under 30 --32%, between 31 and 45 -- 33%); among  those with a  higher education (41%) than those with a secondary  education  (35%) or lower (34%). The proportion of supporters  of party  candidates is especially high among managers at various levels  (48%) and significantly lower among white-collar workers  (38%), and particularly among specialists (21%).    Support for party candidates decreases geographically as one  moves from west to east and from north to south. Supporters of  party candidates make up 41% of the electorate in the  Western  region, 37% in the Central region, 35% in the  Eastern region,  and 34% in the Southern region. In part, this stems from  the  fact that there are fewer supporters of party candidates among  Russians (34%) than among Ukrainians (38%),  especially among  Ukrainian-speaking Ukrainians (40%).    The second question to which we sought an answer in our  study  was which parties have most supporters and among which  categories of urban voters.    As far as the urban electorate of Ukraine as a whole is  concerned, at the beginning of the year only three parties had  voters ready to vote for them in numbers exceeding the 10%  mark: 16% for the Democratic Party of Ukraine (DemPU),  13% for  Rukh, and 11% for the Communist Party of Ukraine (KPU). At  present, these three parties are the largest components of the  multiparty political system that is forming in Ukraine. They are  its "first rank," so to speak.    he "second rank" in this system, numbering fewer than  10%  supporters but no less than 5%, is currently "vacant." No  party  has the support of this percentage of voters.    The "third rank" of political parties among the urban  electorate consists of five parties, each of which is supported  by less than 5% but more than 2.5% of the  electorate. These  are the Party of Democratic Rebirth of Ukraine (PDVU), the Green  Party of Ukraine (PZU), the Social Democratic Party of Ukraine  (SDPU), the Socialist Party of Ukraine (SocPU), and the  Ukrainian Party of Justice (UPS) -- each with 3%  supporters.    The last, "fourth rank" is comprised of nine parties, each  of  which has the support of at least 1% of the electorate.  (We  should point out that 1% of the urban electorate of  Ukraine  amounts to more than 250,000 persons.) The Peasant Party of  Ukraine has the support of 2% of the urban voters, while  the  Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists, the Liberal Party, the  People's Party, the Party of Labor, the Labor Congress of  Ukraine, the Ukrainian Republican Party, the Ukrainian Peasant  Democratic Party, and the Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine  each have 1%.    An analysis of the data makes it possible to determine the  breakdown of support enjoyed by the named parties among various  categories of the urban electorate. Thus, the number of  supporters of the DemPU among men is 1.5 times greater than  among women (18% as against 12%). The ratio  between the  supporters of Rukh is the same (14% as against  9%). In  contrast, the KPU has almost twice as many supporters among  women than among men (14% as compared to 8%). In  addition, the  5% "hurdle" is cleared by men in the case of the SocPU  and by  women in the case of the UPS.    The leading position of the DemPU is particularly marked  among young voters. It is supported by 18% of those under  30  years of age as against 7% for Rukh, 6% for the  KPU and the  UPS, and 5% for the PDVU and the PZU. Most appealing to  voters  between the ages of 31 and 45 are Rukh (16%) and the DemPU  (14%), while the "second rank" of parties includes the KPU  (6%) and the SDPU (5%). The highest degree of  support among  voters between 45 and 60 goes to Rukh (17%) and the KPU  (15%),  somewhat less to the DemPU (12%), and 6% of these  voters and  voters over 60 prefer the SocPU. Among the latter group, only  5% support Rukh, and the leaders are the KPU (17%)  and the  DemPU (16%).    Among voters with a lower than secondary education, support  is highest for the KPU (16%). The DemPU has only  11% and Rukh  7% in this category. The DemPU has more supporters among  those  with a secondary education (17%) than Rukh (13%)  and the KPU  (11%). Whereas voters with a higher education are more  inclined  to prefer Rukh (14%) and the DemPU (13%) than the  KPU (9%),  and 6% of voters in this category are ready to support  the PZU  and the SocPU.    Among blue-collar workers, support runs highest for Rukh  (18%) and the DemPU (14%), and no other party  reaches the 5%  mark. The Communist Party has the support of only 3% of  blue-collar workers, and the Socialist Party of only 1%.  Among  white-collar workers there is more support for the KPU and Rukh  (14% each) than for the DemPU (10%). In addition,  7% of the  white-collar workers are inclined to support the PZU and  6% the  PDVU. Among specialists and the technical and humanitarian  intelligentsia, support also runs highest for the KPU and Rukh  (14%), but third and fourth place in this group is shared  by  the PDVU and the SocPU (9% each), while the DemPU has  only 5%  of supporters -- the same number as the SDPU and the Labor  Congress of Ukraine.    In the Western region, only two parties have the support of  more than 5% of the polled urban voters, but Rukh has  more than  1.5 times as many supporters as the DemPU with a ratio of 29:18.  Only these two parties are supported by more than 10% of  the  urban population of the Central region: Rukh -- 18% and  the  DemPU -- 15%. Three parties fall into the "second rank"  here:  the KPU with 9%, the SocPU with 7%, and the UPS  with 5%.  Among the urban electorate in the Southern region, first and  second place are shared by the DemPU and the KPU (16%  each).  Rukh has the support of only 7% of the electorate here,  and the  PDVU and the Peasants' Party, of 5% each. In the Eastern  region, support among urban voters runs highest for the KPU  (14%) and the DemPU (12%). The SDPU is in third  place here  (5%), while Rukh is supported by only 2%.    This breakdown of support for the different parties in the  regions is rather closely linked with the breakdown of  supporters in the principal ethnic and linguistic-ethnic groups.  Among urban Russian voters, the KPU has markedly more supporters  (16%) than the DemPU (12%), and many more than  Rukh (3%).  Conversely, the KPU has markedly fewer supporters among urban  Ukrainian voters (10%) than the DemPU (15%) and  Rukh (15%).  While there are significantly more supporters of the KPU among  Russian-speaking Ukrainians than among Ukrainian-speaking  Ukrainians (14% as compared to 4%), and,  conversely, Rukh has  many more supporters among Ukrainian-speaking Ukrainians than  among Russian-speaking Ukrainians (24% as against  9%), DemPU  has almost an equal number of supporters among all Ukrainians --  16% among Russian-speaking Ukrainians and 15% among  Ukrainian-speaking Ukrainians.    In examining the above data, it is important to keep in mind  that our elections will be held in accordance with a majority  electoral system rather than a proportional one, and therefore  the final distribution of deputy mandates among the  representatives of the various parties and candidates with no  party affiliation may differ considerably from the proportions  described above.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Astra milked training payouts, Labour claims THE controversy over Astra Training, which has gone into receivership, intensified yesterday when the Labour party claimed that the organisation, one of the largest providers of training, had been milking the training payments system. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment spokesman, claimed that Astra had been offering former trainees temporary jobs - lasting as little as one week - so that the company could collect bonuses of Pounds 600 to Pounds 1,000 per person. Astra, set up three years ago when the government privatised the Skills Training Agency, has been operating in an increasingly competitive marketplace. The Training and Enterprise Councils - which administer publicly funded training schemes in England and Wales such as those Astra provides - are increasingly having their funding related to the success training providers have in delivering jobs and qualifications - rather on the basis of the number of training places provided. Tecs can pay bonuses to training organisations under some circumstances, for example where a trainee has a job 13 weeks after completing training. Mr Dobson alleged that Astra had, in some cases, given former trainees one week's work with the company or friendly employers for the 13th week after training. The Department of Employment, which said yesterday it had no evidence that Astra had broken any rules, defines a job as including full-time or part-time work which may be permanent, temporary or casual. Labour has consistently criticised the government's privatisation of its skill centres. Astra was paid Pounds 11m to take most of them over. Four other centres, taken over by TICC, went into liquidation last year. Training providers have had a difficult time recently - not only because of new funding regimes but also because of the recession and its impact on training. Mr John Troth, chairman of North-east Wales Tec said yesterday: 'There is an an increasing tightness of funding that has forced providers into a more and more competitive situation and some unfortunately cannot cope, particularly those which have been based on charitable status.' Labour has called on the government and the Charity Commissioners to investigate the collapse of Commercial and Industrial Training Services. The company, a registered charity limited by guarantee, was based in Caerphilly. It had 42 staff and contracts with the Tecs of Mid Glamorgan, South Glamorgan and Gwent. It is believed to have considerable debts but it has not yet been placed in receivership. Mr Ron Davies, shadow Welsh secretary, said: 'CITS has lost large sums of money despite being pumped full of public funds.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] After four rounds of official and unofficial  discussions, the UN Security Council [UNSC] adopted and  announced today a presidential statement urging North Korea to  comply with the obligations of the nuclear safeguard accord.  The following is a report by correspondent Nam Son-hyon from UN  headquarters.    [Begin Nam recording] The UNSC held a plenary meeting on the  morning of 1 April Korean time and unanimously adopted a  presidential statement urging North Korea to accept nuclear  inspections. Saying that the statement was adopted upon  agreement of all the UNSC member states, Jean-Bernard Merimee,  president of the UNSC, read the statement in which indirect  expressions replaced precise wordings of additional measures on  North Korea and a negotiation deadline.    In the presidential statement adopted today, the clause  regarding additional measures on North Korea was mildly  expressed by stating that additional evaluation will be made on  the compliance of the agreement with the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] if North Korea refuses nuclear inspections.    As to the negotiation deadline, which was one month, no  specific date was fixed, but the IAEA secretary-general is to  report the result of negotiations with North Korea to the UNSC  at the next inspection. The presidential statement comprises  five articles including that the UNSC will continue to deal with  the North Korean nuclear issue and urge North-South dialogue.    Today's statement was a presidential statement, which is  milder than a binding resolution, without any strong expression  including sanctions or measures on North Korea. It is analyzed  that China had strong influence on the statement and the United  States, United Kingdom, and France made considerable concessions.    However, a high-ranking official of the ROK mission to the  United Nations, said that the United States explained the draft  statement to the ROK in advance and evaluated that it is more  meaningful to adopt a presidential statement with the  participation of China and have China actively involved in the  North Korean nuclear issue in the future than to adopt a  resolution and exclude a few countries from measures on North  Korea.

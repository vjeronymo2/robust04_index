			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Indonesia (1): Everything to play for - President Suharto's election for a sixth term of office has muted discussion of Indonesia's political future. Concern now focuses mainly on the economy as domestic consumption increases while output of oil, the main currency earner, declines THE installation in March of President Suharto for his sixth term of office as Indonesia's undisputed leader has temporarily dampened the long-running debate about who should succeed him - he is 71 - and about how the country should engineer a peaceful transfer of power. A more urgent topic of discussion these days among apprehensive Indonesians in the capital Jakarta, and in booming industrial towns like Surabaya in East Java, is the future of the economy. For the past 25 years Indonesia has successfully followed a pattern common to several fast-growing south-east Asian economies, absorbing foreign aid and investment and exploiting its own natural resources to finance the creation of labour-intensive export industries. With oil production falling and domestic energy consumption rising, Indonesia may become a net importer of oil in the next decade, but textile factories, shoe companies and television plants, springing up on what were once Java's rice-fields, are replacing lost revenue. The Dollars 5bn of manufactured goods exported annually is now on a par with gross exports of crude oil. Poverty is declining and last year Indonesians continued to enjoy real economic growth of almost six per cent. Yet just as Indonesia faces the need to spend tens of billions of dollars on industry and on the infrastructure projects required for further growth - power stations, roads, ports and telecommunications, not to mention schools or the Dollars 16bn plan to develop the offshore Natuna gas field - it is meeting some unwelcome competition for investment funds from China, India and Vietnam. Foreign investment flows to Indonesia appear to have peaked and domestic investment has fallen sharply, prompting officials from President Suharto downwards to promise improved incentives and new measures to cut through Indonesia's notorious red tape. Mr Saleh Afiff, the senior minister who oversees the economy and finance, acknowledges that Indonesia's rivals are economic threats. 'We have to compete for funds which are shrinking,' he says. 'A couple of years ago, no-one would go to Vietnam. Ten years ago China was small. Suddenly they are in the field and we have to compete.' Some of Indonesia's problems are geographical. With about 187m inhabitants - more than the other five members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) put together - it is the world's fourth most populous nation and has plentiful supplies of cheap labour to tempt investors. The territory ruled by Jakarta, however, extends nearly 5,000km across more than 13,000 islands. Indonesia encompasses the intensely Islamic people of Aceh on the northern tip of Sumatra, the densely populated main island of Java, the tourist resorts of Bali, the island of Flores (where more than 1,200 residents were killed by an earthquake and tidal wave in December last year), the Christians of East Timor (the former Portuguese colony where Indonesian troops shot dead at last 50 supporters of separatism at a funeral in 1991), and the primitive tribes of Irian Jaya in the east. Even if investors confine themselves to the relatively manageable logistics of Java, as most do, they cannot avoid nationwide problems of bureaucracy and corruption which earn Indonesia a reputation for some of the highest hidden business costs in Asia. Another, related deterrent for investors is the tendency of the President's children to seek and win lucrative contracts and monopolies, for everything from toll roads in Jakarta to orange trading in Kalimantan, and to take stakes in joint ventures against the better judgment of the other partners; foreign entrepreneurs and ethnic Chinese businessmen wince at the mere mention of the companies controlled by the President's children. It is not just that such corporations may make only limited contributions in the form of expertise or capital; critics say their presence could actually make it more difficult for a venture to raise finance because of the reluctance of foreign banks or international financial institutions to lend to politically influential figures over whom they have no leverage. The latest transaction to arouse concern was the quiet privatisation, without open tender, of part of Indonesia's state satellite communications business. It emerged that a business headed by the president's second son had acquired 60 per cent of Satelindo, a new holding company, with two state telecommunications bodies holding the rest. Another concern among the economic 'technocrats' who have steered Indonesia down the road of export-led growth is the power of Mr BJ Habibie, the eager minister of research and technology. He and his nationalist, 'technologist' supporters are thought to have gained influence in the sweeping cabinet reshuffle announced in March; the fear is that Mr Habibie's state-owned aircraft, shipbuilding and armaments industries will continue to consume hundreds of millions of dollars of government money each year without making adequate commercial returns. Mr Habibie argues that high technology and trained professionals will be vital for Indonesia's future industrial development. Indonesia's economy is also burdened by public and private foreign debt  - which, swollen partly by the recent strength of the yen against the dollar, has risen to more than Dollars 85bn, and by the poor health of many domestic commercial banks. None of these problems is insurmountable; indeed many countries would be proud if they could emulate Indonesia in balancing their budgets, repaying their foreign debt obligations on time and maintaining economic growth averaging nearly seven per cent a year for a quarter of a century. But the uncertainty about the investment climate, about the shenanigans of the president's children, about the ambitions of Mr Habibie and the fragile state of the banking system is compounded by a lack of transparency and a lack of public debate which is out of step with the increasing sophistication of Indonesians. Reporting by the media remains constrained by government pressure. Rumours, whether about the bad debts of state banks or the number of people allegedly killed in a recent riot at a rock music concert, are the stuff of Jakarta dinner party conversations. Late last year, people in Jakarta learned that Moslem radicals had launched a series of attacks on Christian homes and churches in east Java and Sumatra. Many Indonesians fear such incidents could revive tensions between the Moslem majority and the Chinese minority (many of whom are Christians). Tens of thousands of Indonesian Chinese were killed in the turmoil surrounding the fall of Sukarno between 1965 and 1967. In Indonesia as in other south-east Asian countries, a small number of ethnic Chinese citizens dominate commerce and industry and are resented for it, a situation often used to justify the economic favours granted to Mr Suharto's children and to Mr Habibie. Today the ethnic Chinese, having been criticised for dominating local business, are being accused of disloyalty for investing in China instead of in Indonesia, although much of the money channelled to projects in China is already held offshore in Hong Kong or Singapore. In the immediate future the task of reconciling the various groups with vested interests in the Indonesian economy will fall on the newly-appointed Mr Afiff and his ministerial colleagues; he has promised a robust pursuit of free market policies. In the longer term the stability of Indonesia still seems to depend on Mr Suharto. A former army general, he has held the country together and guided it towards prosperity since replacing Sukarno, but he is as reluctant as ever to name a successor. Opponents of his authoritarian style believe he should act soon to arrange an orderly succession and lessen the risk of a power struggle. As one dissident intellectual put it: 'What good is the success of economics or whatever else they may have achieved, if it's put in jeopardy because you never know what will happen next?'</p>

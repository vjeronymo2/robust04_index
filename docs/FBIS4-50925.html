			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 24 (XINHUA) -- A green pigeon carrying  an orange ribbon in its bill has flown off with top prize in the  logo design contest for the fourth world women's conference,  according to results published here today.    The selected logo is round, with the words "'95 Beijing"  etched in white on the ribbon. The green pigeon design is the  symbol of the United Nations Fourth World Women's Conference and  represents women and equality. The ribbon also flows in the  shape of a "C", the first letter in "China", indicating that  China is the host country of the world women's conference.    The logo was designed by Professor Chen Hanmin from the  Central Institute of Arts and Crafts. It was selected from the  3,269 works sent in by Chinese citizens for the contest  co-sponsored by the Chinese organizing committee of the world  women's conference and 18 mass media organizations in Beijing.    All the entries were appraised by a group of experts from  the  Ministry of Culture, the Chinese Artists' Association and other  organizations.    According to the organizers, the logo designers included  artists, workers, peasants, soldiers, government officials,  teachers and students. The chosen logo has been registered with  the patent office, with a copyright belonging to the Chinese  Organizing Committee of the World Women's Conference.    The Fourth World Women's Conference will be held in Beijing  in September next year. It will be the largest international  meeting ever hosted by China. All the member states of the UN  will send high-level governmental delegations to attend the  conference.</p>

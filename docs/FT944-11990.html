			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Bellway's 67% rise beats City forecasts Shares in Bellway rose 14p to 208p yesterday as the housebuilder outstripped City forecasts to announce a 67 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the year to July 31. Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 28m (Pounds 16.7m) on turnover up 37 per cent at Pounds 201.3m (Pounds 147.2m). Operating margins were lifted from 10 to 13.5 per cent. Mr Kenneth Bell, chairman, said the company's performance was the result of 'our policy of controlled expansion of the management, the organisation and the land portfolio throughout the recession'. The middle-market group sold 3,010 homes, a rise of 31 per cent, at an average price which rose 6 per cent to Pounds 65,000. Mr Alan Robson, finance director, said: 'Our sales are 20 per cent up in the current year. We have been expanding over the last four years by about 25 per cent per annum and I think there is good momentum in the market at the moment.' He added that the company expected prices and margins to remain static this year. Cash fell from Pounds 44.3m to Pounds 6.42m as the group purchased Pounds 100m of land at low prices last year. Year-end net cash stood at Pounds 1m (Pounds 44m). Bellway has some 12,000 plots with planning permission, representing more than three years' building. The company further committed itself to Pounds 18m of land in the first three months of the year. The group won Pounds 15m of City Grant awards to build 649 units in Manchester and 479 units in London. The latter is part of a long-term development to build 5,500 houses in Barking. Earnings per share rose 63 per cent to 17.3p (10.6p). The board proposes a final dividend of 4.8p to make a total of 7p, compared with 6p last year. COMMENT Bellway seems to have weathered the recession with a healthy balance sheet and strong sales. Yesterday's figures owe much to the group's shrewd purchasing policy, which should allow consistent growth this year. It is now expected to gear up to about 30 per cent to maintain its purchasing programme. Pre-tax profits are forecast at Pounds 32.5m, which gives a fairly low p/e of 10. Given the group's steady performance in recent years and growth prospects, this looks like an undeserved discount to the sector.</p>

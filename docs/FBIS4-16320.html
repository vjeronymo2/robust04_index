			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Pacific Ocean" Program] </F>   [Text] As always, the subject of the Kurils remains  topical. On this occasion, the SOVETSKIY SAKHALIN newspaper  reports that apparently not only Japan, but also the Maritime  Kray is laying claim to the southern Kurils. At a March press  conference in Vladivostok, Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, governor of the  Maritime Kray, said the Kurils should be economically  subordinated to the Maritime Kray. He added that the Maritime  Kray economy would gladly accept the Kurils.    SOVETSKIY SAKHALIN says this interest is understandable  since  a significant amount of foreign-currency-earning raw material  resources from the far east are obtained in this region. As far  as the Kurils' own economy is concerned, its neighbors are  hardly prepared, or able, to take upon themselves the problems  of the Kuril residents. It is not easy being the inhabitants of  the disputed islands, writes SOVETSKIY SAKHALIN.</p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Arts: Today's Television For the past couple of years it has been very cheap to make movies in the countries of the former communist bloc, and now they are beginning to arrive on screen. An Exchange Of Fire is a two-part thriller set in Prague and London, starring Frank Finlay as 'the ruthless head of a terrorist cell'. The president of an east European state sends his daughter to the west where she becomes mixed up in a kidnap plot . . . you get the picture. Part 2 is screened tomorrow evening (10.00 C4). First Tuesday investigates 'the worst terrorist outrage of the Anglo-Irish troubles': the explosion of four car bombs in Dublin and Monaghan 19 years ago. There were 33 deaths and nearly 300 were injured, but nobody has ever been arrested for the crimes, let alone convicted. The producers promise to 'reveal the hidden truths behind the bombings and explain why details have been buried', so it does not sound as though they will be saying who did it (10.40 ITV). BBC2 begins a new series about environmental issues: Nature (8.00) starting with a report on possible health risks arising from the fluoridation of water.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Slovak National Party: Documents </F> Disappeared"]    [Text] Bratislava--"Important documents that Ludovit  Cernak signed as chairman of the Slovak National Party [SNS],  along with Michal Kovac, when the latter was still a  presidential candidate, have disappeared concurrently with  Cernak's departure from the SNS. The publication of these  documents would not necessarily cast a good light on the  president's moral qualities and his credibility," Peter Sokol,  adviser to the SNS chairman, said at an SNS briefing in  Bratislava yesterday. He added that, within the framework of  his election campaign, one day before his election, Michal Kovac  had signed certain agreements, in which he pledged to the SNS to  execute the office of the president in a certain way if he  gained its support. According to Peter Sokol, in recalling  former Minister of Foreign Affairs Milan Knazko, the president  acted completely at variance with this pledge. "I have the  justified suspicion that Mr. Cernak's possession of these  documents may have a certain influence on the president's  conduct," Peter Sokol said.</p>

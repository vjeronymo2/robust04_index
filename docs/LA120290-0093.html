			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE-WAITING-FOR-GODOT APPROACH TO ASBESTOS;  </P> <P> BUT A WISE JUDGE OFFERS A WAY OUT OF THE LITIGATION JUNGLE  </P> <P> It was nearly 20 years ago that asbestos workers filed the first lawsuits  against the Johns Manville Corp. for injuries resulting from their exposure to  asbestos fibers. In that time, Manville has resolved about 22,000 personal  injury claims. But 130,000 are still pending, and no one can predict how many  more will still be filed.  </P> <P> Many asbestos victims -- perhaps 12,000 -- have died before they were able to  receive compensation for the cancer and respiratory illnesses caused by  Manville's asbestos products. Many others, who suffer from major  asbestos-caused disabilities and who have lost income and incurred enormous  medical debts, have been waiting years for their money.  </P> <P> Neither the lawyers nor the court experts in this litigation, however, have had  to endure the same agonizing wait for their compensation. This inequity --  along with questionable filings by plaintiffs' lawyers, deliberate stalling by  defendants, excessive billing by their attorneys and long-delayed payments to  victims -- has plagued this litigation since its beginning. The Manville Corp.  was one of the worst offenders, but by no means the only one.  </P> <P> More than eight years have passed since Manville filed for bankruptcy  protection from the flood of lawsuits filed against it. Now, more than two  years have elapsed since the corporation emerged from bankruptcy proceedings to  begin compensating the tens of thousands of asbestos victims whose claims were  then pending.  </P> <P> Manville's 1988 bankruptcy reorganization, creating the Manville Personal  Injury Settlement Trust, was intended to solve many of the problems inherent in  asbestos litigation. But it failed miserably. Thousands of new claims, far more  than expected, continued to be filed; the money available to pay those claims  proved to be grossly inadequate, and all sides maintained their litigious  posture, causing legal fees to drain as much as two-thirds of the trust's  funds. As a result, the Manville mess has worsened since 1988 rather than  improved.  </P> <P> Last July, New York Federal District Judge Jack B. Weinstein declared that he  was fed up with the "wasteful, inefficient war over asbestos" and ordered the  parties to restructure the Manville Trust so it will pay victims "when they  need it . . . not 10 or 20 years hence."  </P> <P> The judge recently announced an agreement on restructuring. While there is  precious little in this shameful chapter about which the civil justice system  can be proud, the agreement does offer some hope that injured individuals will  now see some of the money due them during their lifetimes.  </P> <P> The agreement breaks new ground in several respects. The sickest workers will  now receive their money before those who are not as ill. Plaintiffs' attorneys  have accepted a cap on their contingency fees. The restructuring agreement also  pumps more money into the trust to pay claims.  </P> <P> The agreement is solid and innovative, as well as long overdue. We urge that  the anticipated appeals be decided quickly and that money finally be paid to  those who have had to wait so long.  </P> <P> Judge Weinstein indicated that he views the Manville agreement as a model for  other asbestos defendants. In so doing, he joins a growing list of jurists,  including U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who are  rightly calling for a fairer, more efficient and more comprehensive approach to  paying asbestos claims.  </P> <P> Sadly, asbestos litigation is far from over. Manville is only one of some 20  defendants; the recent agreement applies only to claims against Manville.  </P> <P> But we can hope that the important Manville agreement will provide the impetus  to finally end this two-decade-long legal war of attrition -- a war that has  for too long been fought over the dead bodies of asbestos workers.  </P></p>

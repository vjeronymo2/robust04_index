			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses feel the need for consolidation Bourses were inhibited by the need for consolidation yesterday, although Milan and Stockholm managed to move firmly ahead, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT eased on the official session but rose in the afternoon, when the Ibis indicated DAX index ended at 2,127.38 after easing 3.34 to 2,115.46 earlier. Turnover slipped from DM8.8bn to DM7.6bn. Chart and technical buying were offered as reasons why Commerzbank put on DM5.80 to DM382.80, and climbed further to DM390.50 in the London afternoon, and why BMW rose DM9 to DM644. Elsewhere, professionals looked for special situations, and found them in AEG, up another DM5.50 to DM185.90 on structural reorganisation talk ahead of today's supervisory board meeting, and in Escada, the garment company, DM28.50 better at DM299 on a lower than expected 1992-93 loss, a return to the preference dividend list and a forecast return to profit in the current year. MILAN overcame mid-session profit-taking and the Comit index added 9.31 or 1.7 per cent to 573.46, reflecting growing optimism over the political outlook and timely passage of the budget. Trading was active ahead of today's national holiday. However, Morgan Stanley, overweight in Italian equities between April and September when it began switching into French defensive stocks, said yesterday that it was maintaining its underweight position ahead of the general election, early next year. Mr David Roche and Mr Richard Davidson attributed their caution to political risks and doubts over whether the PDS would be able to implement the hard nosed economic reform that Italy needed if the debt/GDP ratio was to be mastered. Credito Italiano rose L99 or 4.4 per cent to L2,358, its privatisation offer looking substantially oversubscribed. Foreign buying supported industrials. Olivetti rose L59 or 4.4 per cent to L1,911 in volume of 15.1m shares and Pirelli was L47 ahead at L1,994. Fiat added L25 to L4,214, unable to sustain the day's high of L4,280, in volume of 16.7m shares. PARIS remained caught in a downward correction as concern over the Gatt talks continued to weigh on sentiment. The CAC-40 index sliped 10.62 to 2,176.12, but off a low of 2,167.70 and down from a high of 2,185.82. Turnover was around the FFr3bn level. Club Med, which is no longer a CAC-40 stock, saw sprightly activity on rumours that it was planning a share swap with the German travel group LTU. Club Med denied the reports but the shares ended FFr26.40 higher at FFr341.80. AMSTERDAM paused for breath with the CBS Tendency index moving upwards a bare 0.1 to 139.8. Goldman Sachs, in a global strategy report, remained positive on Dutch cyclicals, expecting this sector to show the largest gains over the next 12 months. The US investment bank forecast a pick up in exports and investments in 1994, 'while consumer spending is expected to show limited growth  .Currently the market is interest rate driven, which is expected to boost the performance of both financials and cyclical companies, the latter also benefiting from a pick-up in exports and restructuring measures'. KNP BT, the paper manufacturer, added 10 cents to Fl 41.10 on news that it was near to reaching an agreement on the sale of a subsidiary. STOCKHOLM saw a rebound in Volvo Bs, which put on SKr26 at SKr461 on a return to the argument that the failure of the merger plan with Renault was good for the Swedish company's equity rating. The Affarsvarlden General index rose 18.5, or 1.4 per cent to 1,356.8. Trelleborg, the mining and metals group, rose SKr5.50, or 7.6 per cent to SKr70.50 with support from firmer metal prices; Electrolux put on SKr8 to SKr296 on the story that it would take over AEG's household appliance subsidiary; and Handelsbanken closed SKr3 higher at SKr109 on the withdrawal of its offer for Gota Bank. ZURICH paused to consolidate the cumulative 4.6 per cent advance of the previous four sessions and the SMI index finished 1.6 easier at 2,834.8. ISTANBUL lost 3.5 per cent as many investors decided to take profits. The composite index fell 636.3 to 17,391.8 in turnover of TL1,660bn.

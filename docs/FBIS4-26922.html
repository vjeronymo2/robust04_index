			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Xu Jingyue (1776 0079 6460) and correspondent </F> Jing Shuzhan (2529 2118 1455)]    (Text] Beijing, 24 Jun (XINHUA) -- The People's Liberation  Army [PLA] has established a motivation and control mechanism in  the selection and promotion of high-ranking cadres who received  training at military academies. Thanks to this mechanism, a  large number of high-ranking military cadres have been promoted  after receiving systematic training at the National Defense  University [NDU] and going through rigorous performance  evaluation. Some 330 of them have been promoted to military  district or region posts.    Assigning cadres to military academies for later promotion  is  a basic cadre training and promotion system established by the  Central Military Commission [CMC] for the Army in the new  period. It is also the route a high-ranking cadre must go  through to cultivate a high degree of political awareness,  master modern military technology, and acquire the art of  command in modern warfare in the new situation. The NDU, which  shoulders the task of training high-ranking cadres for the  entire Army, has fully displayed the role of a collective cadres  headquarters called for by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. In the last  eight years, it has run 23 different kinds of classes and  trained 4,400 students. Some 4,080 students have graduated  (completed the courses). Among those who graduated (completed  the course) from the command training classes and high-ranking  cadres training classes, 147 have been promoted to deputy army  leadership posts, 119 to army leadership posts, 51 to deputy  leadership posts in military regions, and 13 to leadership posts  in military regions.    In operating the school, the NDU upholds Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics as its basic guide; earnestly implements the  CMC's military strategic principles in the new period; works  hard to raise the students' political, theoretical, and  leadership standards; and enhances the students' organizational  and command skills. To more successfully implement this school  operation concept, it established, based on the instruction  issued by CMC leaders, a complete performance evaluation system  for students from enrollment until graduation. This has brought  the work of training high-ranking military cadres to a regular,  systematic path.    The NDU makes persistent efforts to bring into play the  overall superiority of the military academy's performance  evaluation system, uphold the implementation of the various  evaluation rules and regulations, integrate comprehensive  performance evaluations with training and education, and  objectively and fairly evaluate and recommend students. This  kind of evaluation is comprehensive. For instance, evaluation  of students at command training classes includes political,  military, science and cultural standards, intellectual  standards, progress in study, personality and moral  characteristics, physical fitness standards, and potential for  development. Based on the results of an evaluation, a  recommendation containing views on the students will be  presented. Students who are rated outstanding will be  recommended for promotion on a priority basis or for promotion  outside the normal routes. Students who are rated ordinary will  be recommended for regular assignment. Students who are rated  poor will be criticized and educated. Those who fail to improve  after being criticized and educated will be eliminated. In the  past two years, the NDU has sent evaluation materials and  recommendation views on more than 300 high-ranking  cadre-students to the CMC and the General Political Department,  playing an important role in the assignment of outstanding  high-ranking cadres who are have both political awareness and  professional competence.    The performance evaluation system also possesses notable  motivation power for high-ranking cadres studying at the  academy. The proportion of outstanding students in the academy  has gradually increased in recent years, and the quality of  instruction has also notably improved.</p>

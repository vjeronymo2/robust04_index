			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Eco-taxes proposed as job creators ECO-TAXES on pollution and scarce natural resources could play a big role in resolving Europe's jobs crisis, so long as they are preceded by rigorous research to ensure they do not add costs to industry. This is the view Mr Yannis Paleokrassas, EC environment commissioner, advances in his submission to the Commission's White Paper on competitiveness, growth and employment, being prepared for December's meeting of EC leaders, but likely to get a first airing at tomorrow's special EC summit in Brussels. Mr Paleokrassas believes the White Paper could be a seminal document, if it leads to gradual changes in Europe's model of development, designed both to improve the environment and to get jobs and competitive advantage out of being greener. He argues, for instance, that the controversial Commission carbon/energy tax proposal for a levy of Dollars 10 per barrel of oil equivalent by 2000 would fractionally reduce the cost of the average industrial product, by virtue of increasing energy efficiency. Environmental action sharpens competitive edge, he says, and is frequently very labour-intensive. He estimates that an EC-wide plan for energy-saving in housing could yield 35m 'job-years'. 'At the end of the day, you would have more jobs, less pollution, and more competitiveness for European industry,' Mr Paleokrassas said. He has submitted a four-pronged approach for the White Paper: An urgent research programme to measure the costs and benefits of environmental measures; A shift in taxes away from labour and profits onto pollution and resources; The removal of any net costs to industry from environmental measures, on the basis of the research programme's findings; A new system of land-use, building-use and vehicle taxes, to improve the environmental and fiscal position of cities, responsible for about three-quarters of pollution. Mr Paleokrassas' remarks come as the present Belgian presidency of the EC is examining alternatives to the Commission's carbon/energy tax, which is designed to stabilise carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000. Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgian finance minister, has written to Mrs Christiane Scrivener, EC commissioner for taxation, proposing instead that the EC harmonise existing excise taxes on energy. Mr Paleokrassas says he could accept this approach provided it levels excise duties upwards and has the same effect. The energy tax is blocked by UK opposition to any EC tax, by French concern to exempt its extensive nuclear industry, and by misgivings among the four poorest EC member states that it will blunt their development. The northern countries led by Germany remain committed.</p>

These violations pose a grave threat to Iraq's  security, stability, and national unity.    In a letter to Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat  'Abd-al- Majid, Iraq's permanent envoy said on 14, 15, and 16  January, these aircraft continued their violations of the Iraqi  airspace and conducted 129 hostile sorties by flying from bases  in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.    The Iraqi envoy asked that the letter be distributed to the  Arab member states. A list detailing these violations was  enclosed.</p>

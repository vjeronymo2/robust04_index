			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> Anyone familiar with lithography knows the name Clinton Adams. Recognized  artist, UCLA prof by the late '40s, Clinton also co-inspired -- along with June  Wayne -- the now famous Tamarind Lithography Workshop, seedbed for the '70s  print revival in this country.  </P> <P> Billed as a limited retrospective (the size and number of works underscores the  "limited" part), this show includes both prints and paintings. Adams was  perfectly poised at cross roads between West Coast romantic surrealism, East  Coast expressionism and European formalism imported to UCLA in the '50s by the  visiting Stanton MacDonald Wright. He moves from one to the other, or  incorporates combinations without missing a beat.  </P> <P> There's a handsome early work called "Back Stage" that turns banal props into  haunting geometry. Tinged with surrealist portent is the fine egg tempera from  the '50s, "Still Life With Yellow Sky." Several crisp, linear building facades  have the regional warmth of American Precisionist works. If today's art is an  indulged precocious child whose next project we anticipate with a combination  of dread and excitement, the art of Clinton Adams is a staid, thoughtful uncle  who always has something for everyone.

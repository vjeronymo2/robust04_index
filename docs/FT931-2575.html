			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Spring Ram warning A profits warning from Spring Ram sent the shares spiralling downward as they were relisted shortly before midday. As marketmakers struggled to keep pace with the share price collapse on dealing screens, analysts began the task of trying to assess the damage ahead of the group's results on Monday. The shares finally stood at 63 1/2 p, a plunge of 65 1/2 on the day in extremely heavy turnover of 26m. Spring Ram warned that profits would be down towards the Pounds 26m level, against market forecasts of around Pounds 41m. However, with the group being in its closed period, few details emerged which would indicate the scale or the exact whereabouts of the problems, according to analysts. One leading building specialist said: 'The bottom line is which direction are underlying profits taking. Until the results on Monday, the shares are under a cloud of uncertainty.' A bearish move by one of the leading securities houses sent shares in food retailers into reverse. Dealers said BZW, one of the most prominent names in the sector, had turned more cautious, with worries over margins following a bout of aggressive pricing said to be one reason. While Asda was still garnering favour prior to joining the FT-SE 100 Index, the shares adding 1 1/2 at 75 1/4 p, the rest of the sector generally took fright at the bearish talk. Argyll Group fell 12 1/2 to 362 1/2 p, Iceland Frozen Foods 8 to 731p and J. Sainsbury 3 to 515p, while Tesco ended 9 adrift at 243p in turnover of 8.4m. Much better than expected preliminary figures and a proposed one-for-one scrip issue from Schroders, the merchant bank, propelled the stock sharply ahead and prompted sympathetic gains in shares of the other quoted merchant banks. The 18 per cent rise in profits to Pounds 64m was well in excess of market forecasts, as was the dividend. Schroders ordinary shares jumped 115 to a record 1890p, while the more widely held non-voting stock raced up 88 to 1588p, also an all-time peak. SG Warburg advanced 14 to 617p, Hambros, due to report preliminaries in June, moved up 4 to 334p and Kleinwort Benson added 6 at 377p. Barclays and National Westminster continued to outpace the rest of the banks sector, the latter settling 8 higher at 448p and the former - still helped by the recent round of presentations to UK institutions - climbing 7 to 412p. Drugs stocks continued to weaken on fears that the Clinton administration would freeze prices. Glaxo Holdings slipped 14 to 619p, SmithKline Beecham 10 1/2 to 437p and Wellcome 15 to 887p. However, Boots was strong on the back of press reports that the UK prescription business was to be overhauled in favour of larger dispensers. The shares rose 6 to 512p. Figures from United Biscuits came largely in line with market forecasts, but a confident statement aided sentiment and the shares put on 10 at 398p. Results from Guinness were not so well received as the drinks group reported a downturn in the Spanish beer market. Analysts also predicted a flat time in the whisky business over the next year and consequently there were few changes to forecasts. The shares retreated 17 to 468p. The sharp rise in sterling against the dollar brought British Petroleum's strong post-Budget run to an abrupt halt, with the shares, which on Wednesday hit a 16-month high, receding 5 to 299 1/2 p. Turnover in BP was a good 12m shares, continuing the spell of hefty volume levels in the stock. Profit-taking affected the exploration and production stocks, Lasmo slipping 3 to 186p and Enterprise 6 to 498p. The market was cheered by the leap in figures at Legal &amp; General, which sent the shares sharply forward. They strengthened 16 to 481p in light trading of 2.1m. The sentiment in L &amp; G boosted several other stocks in the sector. These included Royal Insurance, 10 up at 318p after 5.5m traded, and Sun Alliance, also 10 ahead, at 361p. Heavy selling of the Trafalgar House nil-paid shares left a hefty 11m traded ahead of today's close of dealing in the stock. A more modest 2.5m was dealt in the old shares. The nil-paid gave up 2 1/2 to 9p while the old shed 3 to 69 1/2 p. Business services group BET declined 5 1/2 to 95p on suggestions that Robert Fleming had downgraded profits expectations. The broker was said to have reduced its current year estimate by Pounds 8m to Pounds 67m, and made a deeper cut on the following year's forecast, lowering it by Pounds 14m to Pounds 96m. Securities house Kleinwort Benson was reported to be positive on British Aerospace, where analysts are currently on a visit to the group's Rover car subsidiary. The shares firmed 2 to 280p. In motors, good figures at Evans Halshaw lifted the shares 19 to 288p, and the sentiment flowing from those results led investors into Lex Service, which helped the stock firm 9 to 319p.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Geneva talks on ending hostilities in  Bosnia-Herzegovina have not yet begun because the Serb  withdrawal from around Gorazde was not confirmed by 1400. Jozo  Curic reports:    [Curic] There has been no change since the 1400 deadline,  when the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] were expected to  confirm that the Serbs had withdrawn from two more points around  Gorazde.    The Croat and Bosniak delegations, President Zubak, Minister  Akmadzic, Prime Minister Silajdzic, and Vice President Ganic met  in the Richmond Hotel in Geneva. New reports from Sarajevo say  that nothing has changed on the ground. Negotiations on a  four-month cease-fire in Bosnia-Herzegovina, initiated here in  Geneva on 13 May by the foreign ministers of the great powers  and the European Union, cannot begin.    Federation President Zubak and Vice President Ganic held  talks this morning with Yasushi Akashi and Generals Rose and de  Lapresle, who are unsuccessfully trying to get the talks  started. The position of the joint Croat-Bosniak delegation in  the talks was that UNPROFOR should present a report confirming  there were no Serb forces in the 3-km zone around Gorazde. Vice  President Ganic said that Butrus-Ghali's special envoy Yasushi  Akashi had not presented a new UNPROFOR report from the Gorazde  area to the Croat-Bosniak delegation by 1400.    Karadzic, Akashi, de Lapresle, and Rose held talks this  morning, lasting for nearly an hour, but without any visible  results. After the talks Radovan Karadzic said that the Muslims  are sabotaging the talks on ending the hostilities. Intensive  diplomatic efforts continue. UNPROFOR has confirmed the  presence of Serb forces within 2,200 metres of the center of  Gorazde.</p>

			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: High on yield A 48-point rise in the FT-SE 100 index at the end of a record 18 consecutive rises and one flat day suggests a degree of hysteria about UK equities. Certainly there were some special factors in London yesterday, not least overseas investors buying from market makers who were chronically short of stock. Yet with eight different equity markets hitting all-time or 1993 peaks yesterday, there is more going on. Sharply reduced worldwide inflation expectations, low and falling short term interest rates and a consequent fall in real bond yields have encouraged investors to overlook historically low equity yields. The 35 per cent rise in the FT-SE 100 - and a 70 per cent rise in small cap stocks - since sterling left the ERM argues for caution, but there is some support from bonds for the current market valuation. If inflation remains subdued, yield is a good yardstick for assessing market valuations. With bond yields around 7.5 per cent and equities yielding 3.7 per cent, the yield ratio is hardly stretched. Comparison with overseas markets is also encouraging. The reward for holding equities as opposed to bonds is still substantially higher for UK shares than many overseas markets - notably the US. Such considerations are doubtless driving the move away from highly rated cyclical shares, which have already more than discounted economic recovery, towards larger companies with solid dividend yields. Still, nervous investors must be wondering how low absolute equity yields can fall. That in part depends on how sustained the remission in inflation proves. Both the monetary aggregates and the yawning output gap suggest that any inflationary threat is some way off.</p>

			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> FLORIDA EX-TAX CHIEF SENTENCED  </P> <P> Florida's former top tax collector pleaded no contest today to a charge of  attempted official misconduct and was sentenced to a year's probation.  </P> <P> Katie Tucker also agreed to pay $500 in court costs.  </P> <P> She resigned from her job as state Revenue Department director in February in  the face of certain dismissal.  </P> <P> Circuit Judge F. E. Steinmeyer III modified the probation to allow Tucker, 46,  to carry out her duties as a reserve officer in the Coast Guard.  </P> <P> Tucker had been charged with misconduct by falsifying documents, a third-degree  felony that carries a maximum five-year prison sentence. The misdemeanor charge  to which she pleaded no contest could have meant a year in jail.  </P> <P> The charge stemmed from a state investigation into whether she had singled out  the businesses owned by Donald G. Resha for auditing. Resha lost a 1985 race  for the presidency of the state AFL-CIO to Tucker's husband.  </P></p>

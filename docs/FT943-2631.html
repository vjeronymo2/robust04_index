			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Sicilian sizzlers to sample - Wine Sicily, with its delightfully obvious and unblemished reminders of Greek, Roman, Moorish, Norman and Spanish invasions, is so bewitching that it even managed to bewitch this determinedly greedy traveller at a time when it had practically no wine of interest and a cuisine in complete thrall to the tomato. In the mid-1980s I spent 10 days on the island before finding a memorable bottle, an early vintage of Regaleali's most serious red, Rosso del Conte, a deep, dark, essence with such a dangerously high alcohol level it should not have been allowed in the businessmen's lunch place in which we finally tracked down some interesting food and wine. The island has in recent times turned its back on its classical reputation as a wine producer and has instead made much of its distance from Brussels. For many years the noble and historic wine of Marsala, once the island's pride, has been ignored at the expense of playing the lucrative European game of subsidies and grants. In the 1980s the island was frequently producing about 4 per cent of the world's entire wine production, but as demand for French basic vin de table has plummeted, so has demand for Sicilian wine to strengthen it. Things seem to be looking up, however, to judge from a recent sampling of some of the island's best bottlings and experimental wine styles. My old friends at Regaleali seem to have done a bit of comparative tasting in the intervening years and have consequently tamed the beast. Their Rosso del Conte 1989 blend of Nero d'Avola and Perricone grapes is no less intense but considerably less of an assault now that it is matured in new oak rather than traditional chestnut casks. Its stated alcohol content, 13.5 per cent, still makes it an unsuitable prelude to an important business decision, but its savoury, concentrated character well qualify it to celebrate one. Valvona &amp; Crolla of Edinburgh stock this famous Sicilian red at Pounds 10.89 a bottle, while its white counterpart, Nozze d'Oro 1992 is Pounds 9.89 and should also be available at WT Palmer of Oxford. Nozze d'Oro's label sports a family photograph of the happy couple, Giuseppe and Franca Tasca d'Almerita, celebrating their golden wedding on the label and is a seriously interesting, discreetly oak-aged blend of Sicily's Inzolia grape with a local speciality, Tasca, grown at the high altitudes which keep the island's best grapes lively. A range of experimental wines made at the government's experimental Cantina di Microvinificazione just outside Palermo provided further evidence that Inzolia (sometimes called Ansonica) is one of the island's under-realised treasures. It is full, nutty and characterful, can obviously withstand oak ageing, and the island's winemakers have more than 30,000 acres of it to play with. Catarratto, another white grape, is Sicily's most planted grape variety by far, and is the chief ingredient in the prettily packaged Terre di Ginestra. The 1993 is still gently floral and has some nice fruit in the middle but seems more vapid than some of its predecessors. Nero d'Avola is clearly a great red wine resource for the island, bringing depth, concentration and longevity to many a blend. A much less expensive way to taste its handsome influence than the Count's heady red, is Safeway's exclusive Nero d'Avola-dominated blend at just Pounds 3.55. This vino da tavola started off life on the Safeway shelf somewhat mysteriously called Don Giovanni, 1991. The next shipment will be called simply Casa di Giovanni. Decanting is recommended. But the two most encouraging wines in the recent tasting, as is so often the case, are not in commercial distribution. A cask-aged wine made from last year's Nerello Mascalese grapes by producers Castiglione was charmingly sprightly in much the same way as a flirtatious young red burgundy, while a Moscato di Noto, a wine type on the verge of extinction like so many of the island's once-famous sweet wines, showed that Sicily could easily seize the Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise market. Time for another tour of Agrigento and Ragusa.</p>

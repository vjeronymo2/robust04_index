			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Highlights" column by Dr. Fahd al-Fanik: "Will We Bend Our </F> Heads to the United States?"]    [Text] The UN Security Council's resolution on 17 March  1994, which maintained the blockade on the Iraqi people, was a  U.S. decision. This resolution represented the utmost in racial  discrimination and hostility toward the Arabs. It was a new  U.S. stab in the back of the Arab nation and dignity, as well as  a violation of simple human rights and Security Council  Resolution 715, which clearly provides for the lifting of the  oil embargo once the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass  destruction is completed. This elimination, however, was  achieved two months ago as was stated by the chief inspector  Ekeus.    Each time Iraq meets the Security Council's demands, despite  their arbitrary nature, the United States presents impossible  new demands and terms. The blockade is not meant to liberate  Kuwait, dispose of Iraq's nuclear capabilities, or eliminate  weapons of mass destruction; it is meant to subjugate Iraq to  the United States.    U.S. sources say that 397,226 Iraqis died as a direct result  of the blockade from 1990 to the end of 1993. This figure  includes 140,181 children under five years of age. This is a  true massacre and "a holocaust" committed against the Arab race.    The world is still feeling guilty due to its silence over  the  racist Nazi crimes, but, the world's conscience is still asleep  despite the continuous massacre against Iraq's children, old  people, and patients.    There are other significant statistics to measure the  repercussions resulting from the crime of this age. Iraqi  medical laboratories issued 1,494,050 reports in 1989. This  figure declined by 27 percent in 1990; by 57 percent in 1991; by  60.5 percent in 1992; and by 61.4 percent in 1993. Due to the  lack of necessary medical supplies, surgeries carried out in  Iraqi hospitals declined by 43 percent in 1990; by 57 percent in  1991; by 63.7 percent in 1992; and by 65.6 percent in 1993.  Moreover, diseases caused by malnutrition have risen 13.6-fold  since the blockade began.    The real pleasure for those in the U.S. Administration, who  pursue the hobby of torturing and annihilating human beings, is  to compel the Arabs and Muslims to join the blockade. This is a  unique way of coercion and humiliation under the slogan of  international legitimacy.    The United States committed a bloody massacre in Iraq in  1991  using the most sophisticated lethal weapons under the Republican  George Bush. Today, the United States is committing another,  yet more atrocious massacre, under the Democrat President  Clinton, represented by denying an entire people their natural  rights to obtain food and medicine. This constitutes an open  call for terrorism, bigotry, wrath, and extremism in the Middle  East.    The humiliating Arab submission to the unfair U.S. blockade  on the Arab people in Iraq means that the Arabs are bending  their heads to the neo-Nazis who describe the wars of  annihilating peoples as a conflict among civilizations.</p>

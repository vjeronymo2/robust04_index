			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Chengdu, March 11 (XINHUA) -- A housing development  project, funded by a loan from the World Bank, has been launched  here in the capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province.    The project will use a 76 million U.S. dollar loan from the  World Bank, part of the 500 million U.S. dollar loan supplied by  the World Bank for the 1993-1995 fiscal year to help China  reform its housing and social security systems.    Under the project, a stock company for housing development  has been formed between the Chengdu Seamless Stainless Steel  Tube Factory, the Jinjiang Motor Factory, altogether 13 large  and medium-sized state-owned enterprises and two government  bodies, with a total of 50,000 employees.    According to the agreement, housing for these participants  totalling 600,000 square meters in floor space will be owned and  managed by the new company.    The new company will combine housing rentals with loans from  the World Bank for housing development to relieve participants  from housing problems and help them improve their operation  mechanism, official sources said.    To raise more funds, the new company will raise the  per-square-meter-floor-space rent to 7.5 yuan for existing  housing and 10 yuan for new homes. The selling price for each  square meter of floor space will be 1,050 yuan, only slightly  higher than the costs, according to the sources.    Sharing the 500 million U.S. dollar loan from the World Bank  are four other cities, including Beijing, Yantai, Ningbo and  Guanghan.</p>

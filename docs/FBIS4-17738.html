			<p>BFN     [Text] President Yeltsin's aide Georgiy Satarov sees the  rejection, by the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, of  the agreement on civic accord as a sign of inconsistency. In an  interview with INTERFAX Satarov accused Communist leader  Gennadiy Ziuganov of failing to voice his objections to the  agreement at the April 22 meeting between Boris Yeltsin and the  leaders of the parliamentary factions. Ziuganov rejected the  agreement at a party conference last Saturday.    Satarov said that at the April 22 meeting Ziuganov came out  with a number of constructive suggestions which were taken into  consideration by the authors of the agreement.    Later Ziuganov said that the agreement aimed to perpetuate  the negative tendencies which led to the destabilization of  society and Russian state structures. Satarov saw his statement  as a clear-cut attempt to call white - black.    In Satarov's view, the agreement aimed to promote social  accord and civic stability. And, he said, the document was  phrased by a working group which brought together  representatives of all parliamentary factions, including the  Communists and Agrarians, meaning, according to Satarov, that  their criticism of the agreement backfires on themselves.    Satarov failed to understand what Ziuganov meant by calling  for sweeping changes in the social and economic policies and  describing the civic accord agreement an ultimatum to the  opposition. What Ziuganov said was something on the order of an  ultimatum rather than a call for accord, Satarov said.    Satarov was confident that in spite of the negative moves by  the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, the YaBloko  grouping and some other organizations, the country's leading  social and political forces would voice approval of the  agreement on April 28.</p>

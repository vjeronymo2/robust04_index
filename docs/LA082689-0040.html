			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> REGINA BELLE AT AT MY PLACE  </P> <P> It's a shame about Regina Belle.  </P> <P> The R&amp;B singer, who appeared at At My Place Thursday night, doesn't have  much good material. She's also caught up in pop trappings that are threatening  to strangle her.  </P> <P> When it comes to sheer vocal skills -- range, power and the ability to convey  feeling -- Belle has few peers in the genre. But on Thursday she was singing  up-tempo songs with Bobby Brown-like arrangements, apparently to appeal to the  kids. She was also singing ballads mired in pop excesses.  </P> <P> Belle's hourlong show included maybe two or three songs worthy of her talents.  With her pedestrian instrumental support, she was like a diamond in a setting  studded with pebbles. She was accompanied by uninspired, plodding musicians who  did nothing to enhance the material. Her backup singers were a help on a few  songs, but most of the time they were just a distraction. Belle is quite  capable of carrying a show vocally all by herself.  </P> <P> Belle's focus is all wrong. She should be going in Anita Baker's direction,  focusing on stirring, quality ballads. Her accompaniment should be spare --  that's all a superb singer like her really needs. DENNIS HUNT  </P></p>

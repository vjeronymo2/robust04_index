			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAGAZINES: WOLFE STARTS A BOOK BONFIRE  </P> <P> American novelists, get real! You're wasting your time, gang.  </P> <P> While you've been noodling around with avant-garde, self-reflective, nouveau  roman clones in hopes of impressing Susan Sontag, the Great American Novel has  been smack in front of your face, wiggling its fingers in its ears, jumping up  and down and shouting: Write me!  </P> <P> At least that's what Tom Wolfe says in the November Harper's Magazine, and you  can bet that penthouse intellectuals soon will be lining up at news racks as if  Moses had just chiseled out an 11th Commandment. With good reason.  </P> <P> America's most renowned popular culture critic's latest pronouncement is simply  this: the Great American Novel of the 20th Century will be a work of social  realism. And it will probably be about New York City.  </P> <P> Wolfe should know. He attempted that selfsame big book in his fiction  best-seller, "The Bonfire of the Vanities." And came pretty darn close to  hitting his mark, he implies.  </P> <P> It seems that even 20 years ago, as Wolfe was starting to pound out such  journalistic benchmarks as "The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test" and "Radical Chic  and Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers," he was worried that someone would, at any  moment, beat him to the punch. Someone must be out there writing a realistic  novel that finally grasps the city and the era in its glorious, chaotic  entirety.  </P> <P> Yet, "To my relief, and then my bafflement, those novels never appeared," Wolfe  writes. "And to this day they remain unwritten."  </P> <P> For reasons Wolfe finds "bizarre and hilarious," serious American authors,  sometime after World War II, accepted the academic truism that the realist  novel was dead and struck off to pursue all sorts of effete and self-indulgent  alternative forms of fiction.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Wolfe himself was wrestling with the giants that fictioneers shied  away from: "the racial clashes, the hippie movement, the New Left, the Wall  Street boom, the sexual revolution, the war in Vietnam."  </P> <P> But eventually he realized that his only hope for getting the "big picture" in  his grasp was through fiction. Hence "Bonfire."  </P> <P> In detailing his decision to switch forms, Wolfe sounds like the brilliant  poetry professor who waits impatiently for a dull class to explicate a favorite  text, then finally figures he'd better do it himself.  </P> <P> Until now, it seems, the world has been painfully slow in grasping how very  important "Bonfire" is and why.  </P> <P> Wolfe is least effective in his evaluation of why other novelists have been so  foolish as to ignore the proper literary route of realism. His simplification  slights the masters who set the alternative course -- James Joyce, Virginia  Woolf, Samuel Beckett, and, later, Latin Americans such as Gabriel Garcia  Marquez -- presumably because they weren't Norte Americanos.  </P> <P> And Wolfe is at his snobbish, xenophobic worst -- none dare call it racism --  when he wonders if the fact that a nonwhite majority will soon rule urban  America will "render these cities incomprehensible, fragmented beyond the grasp  of all logic, absurd, meaningless to gaze upon in a literary sense."  </P> <P> No, the task of the writer will be merely more difficult, he concludes with a  patrician sniff, ignoring the possibility that ethnic diversity might just make  America more comprehensible, more easily grasped by certain novelists -- those  of color, for instance. (After all, "Bonfire" just might have been the Big One  if Wolfe hadn't fallen so far short in his portrayal of the book's nonwhite,  non-privileged characters).  </P> <P> But even readers who decide that Wolfe's world view is prissy and bigoted will  marvel at the dazzling case he builds for social realism.  </P> <P> A big reason writers have feared the realist approach, Wolfe believes, is that  they've seen that modern fact is much more preposterous and entertaining than  fancy ever hoped to be. Not to worry, though. By developing the craft of  factual reporting, as well as fictional technique, a good observer can at once  capture the nuttiness of reality and wrestle it into manageable form.  </P> <P> It was those skills that allowed Sinclair Lewis to write of the fictional Elmer  Gantry, a flamboyant evangelist who gets caught in a tryst with a secretary who  then turns around and demands hush money. And so it was, Wolfe points out, that  Lewis "happened to scoop the Jim Bakker story by 60 years."  </P> <P> Citing the example of 19th-Century French Naturalist (read realist) Emile Zola,  Wolfe issues a cry: "At this weak, pale, tabescent moment in the history of  American literature, we need a battalion, a brigade of Zolas to head out into  this wild, bizarre, unpredictable, Hog-stomping Baroque country of ours and  reclaim it as literary property."  </P> <P> Novelists had better soon muster the courage to take America away from  nonfiction writers like him, Wolfe writes, or be prepared to abdicate their  perch atop the hierarchy of letters.  </P> <P> "If fiction writers do not start facing the obvious, the literary history of  the second half of the 20th Century will record that journalists not only took  over the richness of American life as their domain but also seized the high  ground of literature itself."  </P> <P> The rest of the November Harper's is also full of literary fun. In one piece,  literary scholar Hugh Kenner writes a simple, amusing celebration of the joys  of computer networking.  </P> <P> Another selection, in the "Readings" section, disproves the old folklore that  every poem published in the New Yorker contains some sort of water imagery.  Studying four months of New Yorker poems published earlier this year, Poet  Charles Bernstein found references to "ancient pools," "midnight's watery ghost  house," etc., in only 87% of the poems.  </P> <P> </P> <P> McMartin News  </P> <P> Whatever happens in the McMartin preschool case this year, the media  post-mortems are certain to start rolling in. Without question, the analyses of  the 29-month, $15-million case will be oversimplifications. It just isn't  possible to make sense of that much testimony, delivered over that much time,  without boiling down the information.  </P> <P> In the October Los Angeles Magazine, Mary A. Fischer (with the help of former  Los Angeles Times reporter Bob Williams) does just that. Her story is titled  "McMartin, A Case of Dominoes?" But it's the sort of headline where the  question mark is laughable.  </P> <P> The writer is anything but hesitant here to pass judgment. Arguing that early  reportage on the case fell into lock-step with the prosecution, Fischer comes  down plainly in the defense camp.  </P> <P> In making her case, Fischer does what she contends the prosecution did  throughout the investigation and trial: She all but ignores anything that would  cast doubt on her hypothesis. Still, the evidence, as she presents it, was  convincing.  </P> <P> Fischer concludes that the longest criminal trial in U.S. history was a fiasco,  triggered by a crazy woman and kept tumbling along by a succession of other  players including a police investigator, a social worker, a district attorney,  a television reporter and a prosecutor. She raises questions about the motives  and or competence of each of them.  </P> <P> Her thesis is summed up in the magazine's subhead, another one of those  spurious question mark statements: "Did six crucial players simply invent the  longest, most expensive, most sensational -- and most trumped-up -- case in  L.A.'s history?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Book Lovers  </P> <P> Subscribers who noticed some time ago that they stopped receiving the  Florida-based publication Inside Books can rest assured: The remainder of their  subscription to that short-lived publication will be paid off in copies of the  West Coast Review of Books, a Los Angeles-based periodical.  </P> <P> The publisher of Inside Books officially stopped publication as of Oct. 4, said  David Dreis, editor and publisher of the West Coast Review of Books. "I've  agreed to take on his (6,400) subscribers." But Dreis added quickly: "I'm not  taking on any of his debt."  </P> <P> No one could be reached at Inside Books, and Dreis said the publisher has  closed his offices.  </P> <P> The next issue will be West Coast Review's 15th anniversary issue.  </P></p>

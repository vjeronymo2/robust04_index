			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Vehicle output falling behind US Japanese vehicle production recorded its sharpest fall for 19 years, underlining the depressed state of the economy, according to a report on the car industry published yesterday. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association said vehicle output fell by 10.2 per cent last year to 11.2m units and projected that it would fall below 11m this year. As a result, Japan is expected to lose its status as the world's largest car producer, relinquishing its position to the US for the first time since 1979, according to the organisation. Car output fell by 9.4 per cent in 1993 to 8.5m units, the third consecutive year of decline. Exports of all vehicles fell by an estimated 11 per cent to 5m units, reflecting the impact of the strong yen, while domestic sales were down by just over 7 per cent. Among the leading carmakers, Mazda was the worst performer, with a 19.7 per cent fall in output, followed by Nissan, with a 14.5 per cent decline. Further evidence that the end-of-year gift-buying season failed to encourage Japanese consumer demand came with the publication of figures showing a 1.8 per cent drop in December sales from the Japan Chain Stores Association. That brings to 2.4 per cent the decline in chain store sales for the whole of 1993. The Bank of Japan yesterday contradicted recent market speculation that it might try to stimulate demand by cutting its official discount rate, which has stood at a record low of 1.75 per cent since last September. Mr Yasushi Mieno, the central bank governor, said the easing in credit over the past few months was creating the conditions for a recovery. Companies had made progress in reducing excess stocks, but personal consumption and industrial investment remained 'lacklustre', said Mr Mieno. He was addressing the start of a two-day meeting of branch managers, whose reports on regional economic conditions will be an influence on the bank's monetary stance.</p>

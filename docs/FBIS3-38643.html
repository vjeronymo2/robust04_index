			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with FRG Defense Minister Volker Ruehe by news </F> announcer Ulrich Wickert in Munich on 5 February, "shortly  before the newscast" -- recorded]    [Text] [Wickert] Good evening, Mr. Ruehe.    [Ruehe] Good evening, Mr. Wickert.    [Wickert] Mr. Ruehe, what do you feel, personally, after  such  an attack [on Sarajevo]?    [Ruehe] Already, over the past few days, particularly when I  saw the dead children -- I have children of the same age -- I  thought this was absolutely terrible. But the massacres are  getting worse and worse, and I believe that we will lose our  credibility if we do not, finally, implement new measures now.    [Wickert] As defense minister, what would you personally  like  to do now?    [Ruehe] The United Nations must determine without a doubt  who is responsible for this massacre, and then, I think, the  Security Council and the secretary general must consider  measures to end those horrendous massacres. We cannot act on  our own. Last summer NATO declared its readiness to act on the  order of the United Nations, but it is absolutely true that if  the international community tolerates such massacres right in  the middle of the civilized world, in the middle of Europe,  without doing anything about it, then we all lose our  credibility.    [Wickert] We always hear the United Nations, the United  Nations, the United Nations. What would you, as German defense  minister, like to do now?    [Ruehe] Well, I would not react as you do, because the  United  Nations is the only organization with the legitimacy to give the  go-ahead to military actions.    [Wickert] The United Nations is not an anonymous instrument;  the United Nations also includes Germany, and for once Germany  could exert political pressure.    [Ruehe] No, the Security Council, of which we are not part,  is called on to act, as is the UN secretary general. I agree,  however, that German politicians should make it clear to the  United Nations that one cannot simply proceed with the planned  agenda after such massacres, and that new measures must be  implemented now.    [Wickert] What new measures?    [Ruehe] I believe the United Nations must threaten military  sanctions, and these threats must be carried out in the event of  a violation.    [Wickert] This means, for example, air strikes.    [Ruehe] It may mean that. Air strikes have never been ruled  out in the past. I remember that last summer there was  discussion about measures being necessary if Sarajevo remained  under fire or was being strangled.    [Wickert] But they were not implemented.    [Ruehe] No, they were not implemented, and after this  massacre the credibility of the United Nations is at stake.  What else needs to happen before we take action that will truly  deter those who commit such horrendous massacres.    [Wickert] Are you not afraid that once again nothing will  happen?    [Ruehe] Actually, I cannot imagine that after this  escalation  of violence one can simply proceed with the planned agenda,  because peace is becoming increasingly difficult. How is there  to be a peace treaty? After all, a political solution is the  only hope. People have to live together once again in this part  of Europe. How is this to be possible, if one does not react  clearly to such massacres?    [Wickert] Thank you very much, Mr. Ruehe.</p>

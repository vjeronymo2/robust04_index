Statutory Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Clean Water Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) (CWA) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (42 U.S.C. 9601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) (CERCLA) authorize natural resource trustees to recover compensatory damages for injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources resulting from a discharge of oil into navigable waters or a release of a hazardous substance. CWA sec. 311(f); CERCLA sec. 107. Federal and State officials may be designated to serve as natural resource trustees under CERCLA and CWA. CERCLA also recognizes the authority of Indian tribes to commence actions as natural resource trustees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Damages may be recovered for those natural resource injuries and losses that are not fully remedied by response actions. All sums recovered in compensation for natural resource injuries must be used to restore, rehabilitate, replace, or acquire the equivalent of the injured natural resources. Trustee officials may also recover the reasonable costs of assessing natural resource damages and any prejudgment interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CERCLA requires the promulgation of two types of regulations for the assessment of natural resource damages resulting either from a discharge of oil under CWA or from a release of a hazardous substance under CERCLA. CERCLA sec. 301(c). The type A regulations constitute standard procedures for simplified assessments requiring minimal field observation. The type B regulations constitute site-specific procedures for detailed assessments. Both regulations identify the best available procedures for determining natural resource damages. Assessments performed by Federal and State natural resource trustee officials in accordance with these regulations receive a rebuttable presumption in court. CERCLA sec. 107(f)(2)(C). The promulgation of these regulations was delegated to the Department of the Interior (the Department). E.O. 12316, as amended by E.O. 12580.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Oil Pollution Act (33 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) (OPA) was signed into law on August 18, 1990. Among other things, OPA amended the natural resource damage provisions of CWA. OPA authorized the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to develop new natural resource damage assessment regulations for discharges of oil into navigable waters. The Department is coordinating its rulemakings with NOAA to ensure, to the maximum extent appropriate, that consistent processes are established for assessing natural resource damages under CERCLA and OPA. OPA provides that until NOAA develops final regulations, the Department's regulations may be used to assess natural resource damages under OPA. OPA sec. 6001(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Regulatory History  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department has issued various final rules for the assessment of natural resource damages: 51 FR 27674 (Aug. 1, 1986); 52 FR 9042 (March 20, 1987); 53 FR 5166 (Feb. 22, 1988); and 53 FR 9769 (March 25, 1988). These rulemakings are all codified at 43 CFR part 11. The Department also recently published a final rule that has not yet been codified in the Code of Federal Regulations. 59 FR 14261 (March 25, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The natural resource damage assessment regulations provide an administrative process for conducting assessments as well as technical methods for the actual identification of injuries and calculation of damages. Under the regulations, both type A and type B, assessments consist of four major phases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

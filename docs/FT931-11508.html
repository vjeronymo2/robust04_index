			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Reed International to sell its 3.66% stake in BSkyB REED International is in negotiations to sell its stake in British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television venture. Reed, now part of the merged Reed Elsevier international media group, will, it is believed, receive around Pounds 40m for its indirect stake of 3.66 per cent in BSkyB. The company will also get rid of guarantees and other possible liabilities of more than Pounds 150m. The sale comes as Pearson, owners of the Financial Times, Granada and Chargeurs are completing arrangements for the renewal of financing deals which run out this month. In May 1991 Reed decided not to invest any more money in BSkyB and was diluted to its present 3.66 per cent. It said existing publishing and information businesses would have first call on investment funds. Mr Peter Davis, chairman of Reed International, said yesterday: 'The merger with Elsevier confirmed this view of our strategic priorities and the refinancing this month of the 1990 facilities provides the opportunity for us to complete our withdrawal.' By pulling out now Reed may not get as much for its stake as it might if it held on until a possible flotation in a few years' time. It is clear that Mr Davis wishes to draw a line under the BSkyB investment. Reed no longer has any part in the management of the satellite venture. Mr Frank Barlow, group managing director of Pearson and chairman of BSkyB, said yesterday: 'What we have done is agree a price between us, but that does not give an ultimate valuation (of BSkyB).' Negotiations on the sale of the stake are not yet complete. Pearson, Chargeurs and Granada, the main BSkyB shareholders apart from Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, will split the Reed stake equally between them. The three will each also take on guarantees and other liabilities 'which are not likely to exceed Pounds 50m plus accruing interest, fees and costs'. A report due out this week from stockbrokers James Capel is expected to value the BSkyB equity at Pounds 2bn. Pearson said yesterday it was calling an extraordinary general meeting to approve its proportion of BSkyB's borrowing requirements. The new arrangements are similar to those which expire on February 23.</p>

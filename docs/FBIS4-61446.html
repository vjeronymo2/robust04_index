			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mustafa Dzhemilev, chairman of the Crimean </F> Tatar Majlis, by HOLOS UKRAYINY correspondent Natalya Filipchuk  in Kiev; place and date not given: "It Is Not Alms That We  Need, but Recognition"]    [Text] President L. Kravchuk's edict "On Measures for  Commemorating the Victims of Deportation From the Crimea" was,  at first glance, timed for a specific date. On 18 May, 50 years  ago, the "resettlement" of Crimean Tatars, as well as of  Armenians, Bulgarians, and Greeks, started.... However, some  politicians also saw in the edict official Kiev's political  reaction to recent events in the Crimea. In particular, for the  first time, in an important official document, the Crimean Tatar  Majlis figured as a plenipotentiary representative body. Its  chairman Mustafa Dzhemilev was appointed as deputy chairman of  the Organizing Committee for Preparing and Holding the  Remembrance Program. Mustafa aga [Tatar polite form of address]  arrived in Kiev to take part in the first meeting of the  committee.    [Dzhemilev] I think that, indeed, the edict was to a certain  extent a response to the recent actions by Crimean Republic's  President Meshkov, who openly violates the constitutions of  Ukraine and of the Crimea, as well as accords between the  Crimean administration and the Ukrainian leadership. We are  generally surprised that Kiev has been waiting for such a long  time and, when it does respond to Meshkov's illegal edicts, it  is on paper only. I understand Kiev's striving to avoid  confrontation. However, if one proceeds along the road of  compliance, this may, in the long run, lead to such a conflict  that, by comparison, the troubles, which might result from  decisive actions on the part of the Ukrainian leadership, will  look like minor things.    [Filipchuk] In accordance with your forecasts, will such  uncertain relations between Kiev and Simferopol prevail for a  long time?    [Dzhemilev] The situation in the Crimea largely depends upon  its administration. It is clear that Meshkov feels confident,  since specific Russian statesmen, who are interested in  maintaining instability on the peninsula, are backing him in  pursuance of their own interests, in particular with regard to  the Black Sea Fleet. Kiev's indecisiveness only inspires  chauvinists both in the Crimea and in Russia. I hope that,  eventually, the silence of the Ukrainian leadership will end.    A different development of events is also possible: If  Meshkov's Moscow coaches suggest that he pursue a different and  more cautious policy and if they promise that there will be no  territorial claims upon Ukraine.    [Filipchuk] How will the events develop if the Crimean  administration gets the Crimean Tatars to their side?    [Dzhemilev] As things stand at present, this is not  realistic. Even the fact that 14 of our representatives were  elected to the parliament does not mean that we found  understanding; this is the result of our acts of civil  disobedience. Meshkov himself, who was actually against ethnic  quotas in the parliament, stated in the parliament the next day  after the elections that he did not recognize the Crimean Tatar  Majlis and that Bagrov's parliament had made many stupid things  (he meant, in particular, the quotas), and called upon the new  parliament to "resolve" those problems.    A few days ago, Meshkov's mediator spoke to us -- wouldn't  we  agree to meet with the president at his invitation. If  President Meshkov wants to meet with us as with private persons,  because he does not recognize the Majlis' powers, then does it  really make sense?    Incidentally, we have already been offered rewards for  supporting a specific candidate for the post of chairman of the  Crimean parliament. However, it is not alms that we need, but  full recognition of the rights of the Crimean Tatars.    [Filipchuk] Do official Russian representatives seek  contacts with you?    [Dzhemilev] There recently was a proposal from [deputy  chairman of the Council of Ministers Sergey] Shakhray to meet  with representatives of the Majlis. Readiness was even  expressed to come to the Crimea, if representatives of the  Majlis are unable to go to Moscow. Our doors are open to  anybody. However, before we hold negotiations with official  figures of foreign states, especially under today's conditions,  we want to coordinate this with the leadership of our state.    Russia does really seek contacts with us, but for what  purpose? When, in 1991, they wanted to officially recognize us  and even showed us a Russian Supreme Council's draft decree to  that effect, there was just one "request" for the Crimean  Tatars: To agree to the cancellation of the 1954 decree on the  transfer of the Crimea to Ukraine's jurisdiction. As regards  Crimean Tatars, very many illegal acts against them have been  perpetrated throughout their history, but it would be best to  start with 1783: Russia's unlawful annexation of the Crimea.  That was the end of our "friendship." Nobody mentioned  recognition any more after that.    However, the trouble is that Ukraine delays official  recognition of the Majlis in precisely the same way, fearing the  reaction on the part of the Crimea and Russia. At the same  time, we in the Crimea feel ourselves more Ukrainian than  Ukrainians themselves.    [Filipchuk] Incidentally, neither representatives of Rukh,  nor of Ukraine's democratic parties have been elected to the  Crimean parliament. Do they, today, see their allies in you?    [Dzemilev] Our representatives will primarily defend the  interests of Crimean Tatars, and these interests largely  coincide with the interests of pro-Ukrainian parties. We see  our self-determination as the revival of our national  territorial autonomy within Ukraine and are categorically  against a revision of borders. We are grateful to Ukraine for  agreeing to finance the return of deported peoples to their  historical land. Although there also are problems here: The  allocated funds first get to the administration of the republic  and not to the Crimean Tatars. The administration is the least  interested party here. Our compatriots from Uzbekistan, for  example, cannot sell their houses in order to return to the  Crimea, because the legislation of that state is an obstacle.  Obviously, Ukraine might somehow, on a bilateral basis,  coordinate this issue. It would also be logical if Russia also  allocated certain funds for the return of deported people, as it  considers itself to be a successor to the USSR.    The correspondent's note. On 18 May, Ukraine and the Crimean  Tatars will commemorate victims of the deportation. It is a  just and timely measure. However, the Crimean Tatars hope that  this will not limit the care about deported people. Over the  first quarter of 1994, just 36 billion [monetary unit not  specified] out of the 148 billion set aside for the return of  deported people to the Crimea was received; in the second  quarter -- just 35 billion out of 124 billion. Out of the 40  billion allocated for social needs of the victims, only 5  billion was received. A few days ago, Crimean Tatars occupied  by force the building of the former mosque -- presently used for  storing the Black Sea Fleet archives. They virtually forced  Admiral Baltin to make a written obligation to vacate the  building by 15 May. So that on 18 May, a rally-requiem could be  held in the mosque....</p>

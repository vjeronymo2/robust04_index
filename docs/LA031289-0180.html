			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NCAA INDOOR TRACK AND FIELD CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> ARKANSAS MEN TAKE SIXTH CONSECUTIVE NATIONAL TITLE; LSU WOMEN WIN  </P> <P> Dawn Sowell led Louisiana State to its second women's title in three years and  a relay world best, and Edrick Floreal carried Arkansas to a record sixth  straight men's title Saturday night in the NCAA Indoor Track and Field  Championships.  </P> <P> World bests were set by LSU's women's team in the 1,600-meter relay and by  Clemson in the 3,200 relay. Hollis Conway, the 1988 Olympic silver medalist in  the men's high jump, set an American record of 7 feet 9 1/4 inches.  </P> <P> Sowell won the 200 meters Friday night in a meet-record 22.96 seconds, then  came back Saturday night and took the 55 in 6.62 before anchoring LSU's relay  team that clocked 3:33.98.  </P> <P> However, since the team included Opal Cunningham of Jamaica, LSU's time cannot  be submitted for a world record under international rules that stipulate all  runners must be from the same country.  </P> <P> LSU's time was far superior to the world record of 3:34.38 set by West Germany  in 1981.  </P> <P> With four first-place finishes, including Tananjalyn Stanley's victory in the  55-meter high hurdles Friday in a meet-record 7.47, one second place, two  thirds and a sixth, LSU finished with 61 points.  </P> <P> The Lady Tigers beat runner-up Villanova by 27 points, the biggest margin since  women joined the NCAA in 1983.  </P> <P> Villanova's 34 points put the Wildcats 10 ahead of 1988 champion Texas and  Alabama, which tied for third with 24 apiece. Indiana finished fifth with 21.  </P> <P> Arkansas which has won every men's title since 1984, collected only 34 points  in edging Florida, which had 31.  </P> <P> Floreal, a Canadian, accounted for more than half the Razorbacks' points. After  finishing second in the long jump Friday night, he won the triple jump Saturday  at 56-2 3/4. He needed to finish first or second in the triple jump for  Arkansas to win.  </P> <P> Arkansas scored in two other events, Joe Falcon repeating as mile champion in  3:58.06 and Reuben Reina placing third in the 5,000.  </P> <P> Clemson's time of 7:17.45 in the men's relay went under the accepted world  record of 7:17.8 set by the Soviet Union in 1971. But the Tigers' team included  Phil Greyling of South Africa and Dennis Hines of Jamaica.  </P> <P> Conway cleared 7-3, 7-5 and 7-7 on his first attempts, before breaking Jimmy  Howard's American record of 7-8 3/4, also on his first try. He had the bar  moved to 7-10 1/2, but missed three times.  </P></p>

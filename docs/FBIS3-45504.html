			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 14 Jan (XINHUA) -- The Taiwan Affairs  Offices of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council today  invited officials engaged in Taiwan affairs to a forum on  studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping. They discussed at length the great theoretical  and practical significance of Comrade Xiaoping's scientific  concept of "peaceful reunification and one country, two systems"  and held that all-level leaders and cadres should study further  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought for solving the Taiwan question  to improve work related to Taiwan and promote the motherland's  reunification.    Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the Chinese People's  Political  Consultation Conference National Committee and director of the  Taiwan Affairs Offices, chaired the forum. He said: "One  country, two systems" is a concrete application of  Marxism-Leninism based on China's realities and the special  features of the times; it is a product of the party's  ideological line of seeking truth from facts, as well as an  important component of the theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics. Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  thought, we have scored remarkable achievements in Taiwan  affairs in recent years. The party Central Committee has  attached great importance to work related to Taiwan, of which  General Secretary Jiang Zemin has taken a personal charge.  Under the new circumstances, we should continue to diligently  study and implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping's concept of "peaceful  reunification and one country, two systems," adhere to the  principle of one China, steadfastly safeguard national  sovereignty and territorial integrity, and oppose "two Chinas,"  "one China, one Taiwan," or "Taiwan's independence" in any form.    Wang Daohan, chairman of the Association for Relations  Across  the Taiwan Strait [ARATS], said: The aim of ARATS, which is to  promote exchanges and relations between the two sides of the  strait, is a concrete form of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's concept of  "peaceful reunification and one country, two systems." In view  of the imminent arrival of the 21st century, the two sides  should increase economic cooperation, seek to complement and  benefit each other, and promote peaceful reunification. Comrade  Luo Changqing, who had worked for a long time at the side of the  late premier Zhou Enlai, related his personal experiences in  discussing gains from studying Volume 3 of the Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping. He said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  concept of "one country, two systems" is an inheritance and  development of the guidelines for Taiwan affairs laid down by  Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, and other revolutionaries of the  older generation, as well as the basic principle guiding the  party's work related to Taiwan. Comrade Yang Side, who has been  engaged in work related to Taiwan for many years, said: The  concept of "peaceful reunification and one country, two systems"  is bold in vision, judicious in policy orientation, substantive  in content, and innovative in practice. This concept has helped  us successfully resolve the Hong Kong and Macao questions, and  will certainly guide us in finally settling the Taiwan question  and realizing the motherland's reunification. Comrade Cai  Zimin, chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League  Central Committee, said: The people of Taiwan are imbued with  the glorious patriotic tradition, and they have never reneged  their affection for the motherland. "One country, two systems"  takes into consideration the realities on the two sides of the  strait and conforms with the Taiwan compatriots' aspiration to  be the masters of their own country. This concept has received  the understanding, support, and endorsement of more and more  Taiwan compatriots. Advocates of "two Chinas" or "one China,  one Taiwan" inside and outside the island are doomed to fail.    Sun Xiaoyu, Tang Shubei, Li Qingzhou, Guo Pingtan, and other  officials of relevant departments attended the forum.</p>

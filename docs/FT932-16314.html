			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / International Company News: Embraer follows industry trend with Dollars 258m loss EMBRAER, the state-owned Brazilian aircraft maker, reflected the continuing trouble in the world aerospace industry by posting a Dollars 258m loss in 1992. In 1991, the group lost Dollars 235m. Sales were Dollars 312m last year, down from Dollars 402m in 1991 and Dollars 582m in 1990. The company blamed the poor figures on the recession in Brazil and the US, Embraer's most important market. It also cited reduced government spending on military aircraft due to cuts in the Brazilian air force budget. It laid off 2,468 last year, bringing the two year redundancy total to 6,800, a 54 per cent cut in the workforce. Embraer's best-known product is the EMB-120 Brasilia, a 30-seat regional aircraft. It accounts for about half of Embraer's sales, but last year sales fell to just 22 units, down from 31 in 1991 and 48 in 1990. In a speech to employees earlier this year, Mr Ozires Silva, Embraer president, was optimistic about prospects for 1993. He said he was encouraged by increased demand for aircraft in South America and the possibility of increasing revenues from providing services to other companies. He predicted that between 2 and 3 per cent of sales might come from the services segment this year. Embraer is on the government's short-list for privatisation, but before the move can go ahead the company must resolve an issue involving a group of creditors who hold debentures convertible into non-voting stock. If all of the debentures were converted, the government's majority voting share could be reduced to as little as 3 per cent of total equity. Copesul, a Brazilian petrochemical company privatised last May, unveiled an increase in profits to Dollars 42.5m for 1992. The supplier of raw materials for one of Brazil's three petrochemical hubs, it earned Dollars 30m in 1991.</p>

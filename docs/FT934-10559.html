			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Biffex takes first step in revamp THE BALTIC Freight Index, which provides the basis for the Biffex freight futures contract traded on the London Commodity Exchange, was adjusted yesterday to exclude some smaller ship sizes. The weightings of some shipping routes included in the index were also increased. Mr Philippe van den Abeele, Biffex marketing director, said the shipping market wanted the change to the index 'to provide a closer relationship between the BFI and a more specific sector of the dry bulk shipping market'. He said the change would streamline the index as a first step towards revamping the futures contract, which has seen volume drift down to an average of 200 lots a day. Mr van den Abeele, who took up his appointment this week, is on six months' secondment from Clarkson Wolff, the shipping futures firm. He hopes to increase volume in the contract to 500 lots a day by the end of next year. The changes to the index were announced in January and came into force yesterday.</p>

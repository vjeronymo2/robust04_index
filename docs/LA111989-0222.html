			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION GIRLS' CROSS-COUNTRY;  </P> <P> EDISON'S TAYLOR UP TO LATEST CHALLENGE, CAPTURES 4-A TITLE  </P> <P> There may come a time when Shelley Taylor of Edison High School realizes that  she has become one of the finest female distance runners in Orange County  history. In only her second year of competition, she has accomplished more than  most runners her age dare dream.  </P> <P> But now, Taylor seems content with running, winning and heaping praise on the  few who have been able to challenge her this season.  </P> <P> Such was the case on Saturday at the Southern Section cross-country  championships at Mt. San Antonio College. In the girls' 4-A final, Taylor met  Westlake junior Jeannie Rothman.  </P> <P> Although Rothman pushed her the entire three miles, Taylor had the strength to  pull away in the final 200 yards to win by two seconds and remain unbeaten this  season.  </P> <P> But Taylor seemed less impressed with her performance than with Rothman's.  </P> <P> "Gosh, she ran one heck of a race," Taylor said. "She was breathing so hard. I  mean she really hung in there. What a great race she ran. I really envy her for  that."  </P> <P> Envy? Taylor was asked if she remembered that it was she, not Rothman, who had  won the race.  </P> <P> "Well . . . you know . . . I don't think I run well unless I feel good," she  said. "And I didn't feel that good today."  </P> <P> It's doubtful that those who finished behind Taylor felt much better.  </P> <P> As the race started, Jennie Logan of Wilson immediately opened a 20-yard lead  on the front-running pack that included Taylor, University's Tanja Brix, Villa  Park's Susannah Thrasher, Katella's Martha Pinto and Terri Smythers of San  Clemente. Although Logan led through the first mile, the pack caught her and  soon left her behind.  </P> <P> Up the switchbacks, the pack began to string out with Taylor taking the lead  and Rothman a step or two behind. Through the next 1 1/2 miles, Taylor set the  pace while Rothman struggled but managed to hang on.  </P> <P> "She made me really nervous," Taylor said. "I really was surprised, because  when I started to take off, I felt her drop a little, but then she came back.  I'm not used to people being that close to me, so I wasn't as relaxed as I  should've been."  </P> <P> It wasn't until the two hit the air strip portion of the course, about 300  yards from the finish, that Taylor made her final move. It was not her usual  devastating kick, but it was enough to win in 17 minutes 59 seconds.  </P> <P> Rothman (18:01) was followed by Brix (18:22), Pinto (18:43) and Thrasher  (18:48), all of whom qualified for Saturday's state meet at Fresno.  </P> <P> In the team competition, San Clemente fared best among county teams, taking  third in the 4-A with 137 points. Palos Verdes won its fifth consecutive title  with 51 and Buena was second with 72. Corona del Mar, fifth with 158, will  advance to the state meet in the medium-schools division. El Toro was sixth  (161), Capistrano Valley eighth (199), El Modena ninth (209) and Tustin 12th  (230).  </P> <P> In the 2-A, Woodbridge, competing without two of its top runners -- Kaci Keffer  (bronchitis) and Kim Tardif (stress fracture) -- finished third behind Agoura  and Arroyo Grande.  </P> <P> In the 1-A, Santa Margarita, in its first year of varsity competition, placed  third with 109 points.  </P> <P> Notes  </P> <P> Although Shelley Taylor's time in winning the Mt. SAC Invitational last month  was not her best on the course -- she finished in 17:50, the fourth-fastest  time for any sophomore girl and the third-fastest in Orange County history --  it was enough to earn her the first sectional title for a county girl since  1981, when University's Polly Plumer (4-A) and Sonora's Lesley White (3-A) did  it. Plumer (17:27) and University's Teresa Barrios (17:43) are the only county  girls who have run faster than Taylor at Mt. SAC. The girls' course record is  17:16 set in 1983 by Kirsten O'Hara. . . . La Habra's Tish Williams is it  qualified for the state meet by placing fifth in the 3-A in 19:07.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. THEATER / JAN HERMAN: 'LYSISTRATA' ESCHEWS THE LOW ROAD  </P> <P> The peace cry of the '60S, "Make love, not war," might have been coined in  ancient Greece by Aristophanes, except that he was more tough-minded than the  flower-power generation.  </P> <P> In his feminist, anti-war farce "Lysistrata" -- first produced in Athens in 411  BC, after 20 years of devastating military conflict with Sparta -- all the  women of Greece form a united front against all the men and issue an ultimatum:  Quit making war or we won't make love.  </P> <P> While the goals of both declarations are the same, of course, the tactical  implications are considerably different: One offers seduction; the other  requires self-sacrifice.  </P> <P> "Lysistrata," which opened over the weekend at the Alternative Repertory  Theatre in Santa Ana, leaves no doubt that a bedroom strike won't be easy for  lusty women who claim that they'd rather walk barefoot on hot coals than give  up their carnal pleasures.  </P> <P> Already feeling sexually deprived because their husbands have been gone so long  in battle, they lament the absence of substitute lovers and even the scarcity  of artificial sex toys. As for masturbation, they complain that it just doesn't  equal the real thing.  </P> <P> Furthermore, these women will not simply issue a no-sex ultimatum in the mere  hope that it will be an effective measure for peace. They also will ensure that  it works by enflaming their warrior men with desire and, at the risk of being  raped, turn icy to drive home their point.  </P> <P> In the meantime, that grande dame strategist, Lysistrata, doesn't overrate the  power of sex. Getting the men of Athens to agree to a peace settlement with the  Spartans is also a practical matter of financing. She exhorts the women to  storm the Acropolis and seize the public treasury. "No more money, no more  war," she argues.  </P> <P> Still, Aristophanes never loses sight of the sexual satire. And the best scene  in ART's "Lysistrata" turns out, not surprisingly, to be a sendup of Myrrhine  taking her randy husband Cinesias to bed -- or so he thinks. Imbued with the  spirit of farce, the seduction is too humorous to be obscene but just bawdy  enough to seem, at least for a moment, risque.  </P> <P> In fact, this 90-minute production could use more daring on the whole. Here was  the chance for director Patricia L. Terry to make an outrageous splash with a  gutsy, brazen show that would test the limits of theatrical boldness, not to  mention community standards.  </P> <P> Instead it fusses and winks, unable to decide whether it really wants to take  responsibility for Aristophanes. It seems satisfied to get giggles from his  wealth of double-entendres and phallic allusions. And that is all it gets,  apparently preferring the safety of the timid vaudevillian to the risks of the  master vulgarian.  </P> <P> Part of the blame lies in the choice of the translation, which casts a  pseudo-classical pall on the language. As Lysistrata, Caryn Ronis shoulders the  load to a fault, like a Shakespearean trouper in varying degrees of dudgeon.  Somebody ought to sedate Amy Larson, though. She doubles as Calonice and  Rhodippe in a non-stop, histrionic dither.  </P> <P> By contrast, M. James Breslin scores nicely with a low-key performance as  Strymodorous. His ironic comments are models of precise timing. Breslin also  doubles as Cinesias opposite Terra Shelman as Myrrhine. Scott Andrew Burchard  plays the stentorian magistrate. Others in the cast are Michael McKay, Wendy  Robinson and Lee Clark.  </P> <P> Where this production succeeds most effectively is in Christa Bartels' spare  scenic design. The minimalist set consists of a marble-like floor and four  movable stelae to evoke the Acropolis. It not only looks good, it also solves  the problem of cramped space that has plagued other productions in ART's  61-seat, storefront theater-in-the-round.  </P> <P> Another notable touch is Gary Christensen's sound design as well as his masks,  which lend a certain charm to the lowbrow characters. Karen J. Weller's  peculiar headdresses are too ornate by half, yet they complement the pleasantly  understated costumes.  </P> <P> For all its faults, this lightweight "Lysistrata" holds out the hope that ART's  third season will be brighter than the first two if only because the troupe now  seems willing to entertain. Also, playgoers will not find a more immaculate  little theater anywhere in the county.  </P> <P> 'LYSISTRATA'  </P> <P> A production of Aristophanes' comedy by the Alternative Repertory Theatre, 1636  S.

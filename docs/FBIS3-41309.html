According to its researchers, this  undertaking has proven its viability by showing itself to be a  program that treats drugs systematically, technically, and  effectively. Inasmuch as the parameters of the project are still  evolving, it is likely to propagate itself. This has led to the  establishment of training courses in primary prevention of drug  use among young people who are serving their obligatory military  service in the barracks, the principal universe of their  activities. This year, provided authorization is obtained from  the higher echelons of the Army, the project will be introduced  at the Army's Cadet Preparatory School, the gateway for young  men who want to enter the Agulhas Negras Academy. In the last  half of 1993, professors and psychologists from the CEP held a  practicum for officers from different units of the Military  Command of the East, in Rio de Janeiro. The purpose was to  standardize the application of the program in all military units  of the Army and homogenize the knowledge, procedures, and  techniques used in primary prevention. This is the first step to  making a reality of the CEP's proposal as regards its details  and the positive repercussions leading to its extension into the  military environment. According to CEP leaders, the primary  objectives of the project in Rio de Janeiro are: to promote a  change in young people's attitudes toward drugs, to boost  feelings of self-esteem, to strengthen the ability to resist  social pressures, and to help adolescents organize their scale  of values. The young people in the units where the project has  functioned have left the barracks armed with information against  drug abuse. This year, the Army hopes to extend the project to  other area commands and to the schools that are subordinate to  the Directorate of Specialization and Extension.    The studies that formed that basis for Project Hope, now a  reality, began in 1987 and ended in 1990, the year when it was  introduced on an experimental basis, starting with units in Rio  de Janeiro and at the Agulhas Negras Military Academy, an  officer training school. The Army Center for Personnel Studies,  one of the most important of its type in South America, annually  receives dozens of officers from other countries, who take  specialized courses in communications and other subjects of  military interest.</p>

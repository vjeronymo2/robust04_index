			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Battle looms for North American gold producers A battle is looming between two North American gold producers, Vancouver-based Granges and Atlas Corporation, which has its headquarters in Denver. Atlas acquired 37.2 per cent of Granges for CDollars 50.7m (USDollars 36.9m) from MIM, the Australian resources group. Mr Steve Manz, Atlas president, said recently he had the support of enough other Granges shareholders to take control of that company's board at the next annual meeting - which must be held before June next year. The objective, said Mr Manz, was a full merger of Atlas, Granges and a third company, Hycroft, in which Granges has a 50 per cent stake. This would create a group with an annual output in 1996 of at least 150,000 troy ounces of gold. Mr John Auston, president of Granges, said these comments suggested that Atlas was ready to breach a formal agreement signed at the time of the purchase of the MIM holding. Atlas agreed that the number of its appointees to the Granges board would be in proportion to its shareholding. Atlas also agreed not to take its holding in Granges to more than 40 per cent without making an offer to all Granges shareholders. Mr Manz denied there had been any improper soliciting of proxies by Atlas. 'We were approached by Granges shareholders,' he insisted. As for the standstill agreement, 'we'll let time take care of that,' he declared.</p>

This is what he  said in an ITAR-TASS interview after the ceremony of an official  meeting of Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton.    "All versions have already been discussed," Chernomyrdin  said. He made it clear, however, that a final decision on the  candidatures would be taken after the steering bodies of the  Federal Assembly are formed. "I am very much worried about the  formation of the steering bodies of the State Duma," he added.    Responding to the ITAR-TASS supposition that Oleg Soskovets  and Yegor Gaydar will be appointed first deputy prime ministers,  and Yuriy Yarov and Aleksandr Zaveryukha -- deputy prime  ministers, Chernomyrdin said: "You are almost right."    The prime minister commented angrily on the open letter,  sent  by leaders of the Democratic Russia Movement Gleb Yakunin and  Lev Ponomarev to President Yeltsin on Wednesday. They opposed  the appointment of Aleksandr Zaveryukha to the post of deputy  prime minister. "It is not these people who will determine the  government make-up," he said.    According to Chernomyrdin, professionalism and personal  business qualities were the main criteria for choosing  candidates to the top posts in the government. "The most  important thing is that people working in the government should  share our ideas and realise the depth of the processes taking  place in the country... The government is formed not for the  purpose of meeting the requirements of certain individuals, but  for fulfilling specific tasks," Chernomyrdin said.</p>

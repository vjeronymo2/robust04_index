			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proponents testified that Walla Walla Sweet Onion producers, in order to remain competitive with other sweet onion producing areas, must conduct research and promotion programs to reduce production and marketing costs and increase sales. Such programs should include production and marketing research projects and promotion projects, including paid advertising.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Testimony indicated that voluntary research and development efforts by the Walla Walla Sweet Onion industry have not been successful because of the lack of a coherent research and development plan with broad-based industry support. Also, a relatively small percentage of the U.S. onion crop is produced in the proposed production area in Walla Walla County, Washington, and Umatilla County, Oregon, and individual producers and handlers cannot implement an effective research, marketing development, and promotion program. By contrast, most other onion growing areas in the United States are large enough to convince private entities, such as seed companies, to conduct production research and developmental efforts with the result being new varieties specifically suited to those areas. Proponents believe that an industry-wide program is therefore necessary to enable the pooling of resources to address common problems. A single producer or even two or three producers cannot marshal the resources necessary to conduct effective research, marketing, and promotion programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Small Business Consideration: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. The record indicates that there are approximately nine handlers of Walla Walla Sweet Onions in the proposed production area and 50 producers. Small agricultural service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration (SBA) (13 CFR 121.601) as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of the handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the 1992 season, commercial shipments of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Walla Walla Sweet Onions totaled about 390,000 hundredweight at an average f.o.b. price of $16.60 per hundredweight for a total value of $6,474,000. An indeterminate volume, probably about 10 percent, was sold at roadside stands. While there is a great variance in the size of individual handlers' operations, the record indicates that nearly all of the handlers that would be regulated under this order would qualify as small firms under the SBA's definition. Witnesses testified that because most of the producers and handlers of Walla Walla Sweet Onions are small, they are unable to individually finance the types of research and promotion efforts needed by the industry. A marketing order program would provide a means for these small entities to pool their resources and work together to solve their common problems. Witnesses testified that such action is necessary for this relatively small industry to remain profitable in the face of intense competition from larger industries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Acreage and supplies of Walla Walla Sweet Onions have declined in recent years, and proponents believe that the order would provide a much needed means of halting the drop in grower returns experienced in past seasons. This would be achieved by strengthening demand and developing new markets for existing supplies and encouraging increased production. Also, costs could be reduced through production research. Thus, the order would be expected to have a positive impact on producer returns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The order would authorize the collection of assessments from handlers of Walla Walla Sweet Onions grown in the designated parts of Walla Walla County, Washington, and Umatilla County, Oregon. Assessment funds would be used to finance production research projects that could reduce costs by reducing the occurrence of onion diseases, controlling plant pests, and developing varieties with more desirable flavor, quality, and size. Assessment funds could also be used to strengthen demand and expand markets for Walla Walla Sweet Onions through marketing research and development, and product promotion programs, including paid advertising. Projects to develop better methods of handling, shipping or storing onions, to explore additional or alternative uses of onions, to check nutritive values, and similar research are some examples of marketing research. Examples of marketing development projects include exploring marketing possibilities, contacting buyers, distributing educational material relating to the handling and marketing of onions, and the dissemination of the results of current or past marketing research projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The order would be administered by a committee composed of Walla Walla Sweet Onion producers, handlers, and a public member nominated by growers and handlers and selected by the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary). Daily administration of the order would be carried out by a staff hired by the committee. The order would not regulate the production of Walla Walla Sweet Onions and would place no restriction on the quality or quantity of Walla Walla Sweet Onions that could be handled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

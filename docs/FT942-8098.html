			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Aden may face renewed assault Northern Yemeni forces appeared yesterday to have won control of part of Al-Anad military base as they tightened their grip around the southern stronghold of Aden, Reuter reports from Al-Anad. Heavy shelling prevented independent witnesses from getting closer than 3km south of Al-Anad, but southern Yemeni forces were retreating at that point. A Reuter report says southern tanks were moving south on transporters. Artillery positions were also moved south from the important base, which lies near a junction about 65km north of Aden. In spite of the apparent retreat, southern officers at the front said southern units still controlled the air strip and buildings in the southwest part of Al-Anad base. They said infantry were fighting northern forces loyal to Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh in and around the base, and more soldiers were seen heading northwards as reinforcements. Southern warplanes yesterday pounded rival positions north of Al-Anad, showing the air force was active despite an attack on Aden airport. President Saleh launched an offensive on May 4 to crush his estranged vice-president, Ali Salem al-Baidh, based in the port city.</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy The latest KPMG survey of UK companies going into receivership paints a tantalising picture of the economy. The 31 per cent rise in receiverships in the first quarter was in sharp contrast to a year-long plateau. Though the approach of the election complicated the picture, the increased preponderance of retailers and service companies among the failures is consistent with the idea of businesses having been hanging on for a Christmas recovery that failed to materialise. The difficulty lies in interpreting the evidence further. The survey tells us nothing about the size of company going under, so it is hard to measure the impact on the economy or the banking sector. It will be another quarter or two before any change in the trend is apparent, if only because for every company going down there may be two which the banks are quietly keeping afloat for the moment. In part, the banks are keen to avoid bad debts on top of their already hefty provisions. Equally, they may have written the debt off already and be holding on until the market for bankrupt assets improves. In either case, history suggests a further round of companies will go bust for lack of working capital when recovery gets decisively under way. It is perhaps the more curious that the Hoare Govett small companies index lost a mere eight constituents to receivership in the first quarter, but lost 13 to takeover, some admittedly at fire-sale prices. The failure rate is running one-third below last year's level when logic suggests it should be rather higher. Whether this is a sign of recovery is anyone's guess. But it may fill one gap in the KPMG survey - the majority of companies going under are presumably too small to have gone public at all.</p>

			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Middle East Peace Deal: PLO suffers its worst split since inception - Opposition is mounting ON THE EVE of the signing of a historic accord with Israel, the Palestine Liberation Organisation is suffering from the most serious split since its inception. Opposition to the agreement with Israel is mounting, both inside and outside the PLO. The opposition, which now includes more than 10 groups ranging from the Islamic resistance movement, Hamas, to the leftist Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine DFLP and the Popular Front of Palestine (PFLP), is seeking to form a broad alliance to thwart the accord. The opposition has, however, pledged not to resort to violence against the future Palestinian autonomy authority, although it has not decided yet if it should form an alternative organisation challenging the legitimacy of the PLO. Over the last three weeks Messrs Mohammed Darish, an independent, Shafiq al Hoot, PLO representative in Lebanon, Abdullah Hourani, an independent, Taysir Khaled of the DFLP, and Abdul Rahmin-Malloul of the PFLP have resigned from the PLO executive committee as demonstrations against Mr Arafat continued in the refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon. As a result of the resignations the 18-member PLO executive committee is now mainly confined to Fatah, the mainstream movement led by Mr Arafat, and the Palestine People's party (the former communists), a group that has sizeable influence in the Israeli occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip. But even Fatah, which remains dominant inside and outside the occupied territories, has been afflicted by divisions over peace with Israel. Three of the co-founders of the movement, including the PLO foreign minister Farouk Al Kadoumi, who has historically been closer to the left, and the two brothers Khaled and Hani Al Hassan, who are ideologically associated with the right, have publicly contested the terms of Mr Arafat's agreement with Israel. PLO executive committee member Suleiman Najab, who voted in favour of the peace agreement last week, said yesterday he saw no need to rush into signing it in Washington, as Mr Arafat has done. 'We should first secure Arab agreement and backing through an emergency summit. This would be more in harmony with our pan-Arab commitments and with agreements we have made with our Arab brothers,' he said in a statement. 'We should also have obtained the approval of the PLO central council before signing it,' he added. The PLO plans to call a meeting of the 100-member council to ratify the agreement after the signing ceremony in Washington. Opposition within Fatah is particularly strong in Jordan and Lebanon, where former fighters in the movement feel betrayed by the leadership commitment to prevent acts of violence against the Israeli occupation forces. According to Fatah sources, at least 180 former fighters - based in Jordan - have refused to join the new Palestinian police force Mr Arafat is to form as part of arrangements for the Palestinian autonomy. 'We are ready to serve in a nationalist police force in an independent Palestinian state but not to be tools to suppress our people's resistance against the Israeli occupation,' said a Fatah fighter, who has been a member in the movement for the last 16 years, on condition of anonymity. Such fears were cited by senior PLO officials who resigned from the top level decision-making body. 'This agreement transforms the Palestinian autonomy authority into a repression apparatus against our people in favour of Israel,' said Mr Abdullah Hourani, the latest independent member to resign from the executive committee, in reference to provisions in the limited autonomy concerning security co-operation between Israel and the Palestinians.</p>

Arab and foreign news agencies  correspondents attended the news conference held at the  al-Khalisah compound in al-Yarmuk camp.    Attending the news conference were: Comrade 'Isam al-Qadi  al-Sa'iqah, secretary general; Abu Musa [Sa'id Musa Muragha],  secretary of the Fatah Movement's Central Committee; Ahmad  Jibril, secretary general of the Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFLFP-GC]; Dr. Fathi  al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad  Movement; Khalid 'Abd-al-Majid, secretary general of the  Palestinian Popular Struggle Front [PPSF]; 'Arabi 'Awwad,  secretary general of the Palestinian Revolutionary Communist  Party [PRCP]; Abu-'Ali Mustafa, assistant secretary general of  the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP];  Ibrahim Ghawshah, Hamas Political Bureau member and official  spokesman; Abu-Layla [Qays al-Samarra'i], member of the  Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP]  Political Bureau; 'Ali 'Aziz, Palestine Liberation Front [PLF]  Political Bureau member; and several representatives of these  factions' commands.    At the start of the news conference, the formation of the  Alliance of Palestinian forces comprising the 10 Palestinian  factions was announced.    A statement in the name of the alliance was then read. The  statement stresses the need to abide by the Palestinian National  Charter, and the Palestinian people's inalienable national  rights to Palestine, their homeland, and to repatriation,  self-determination, and complete national independence. The  statement also emphasizes that the Palestinian cause is an Arab  and Islamic cause and that the liberation of Palestine is the  responsibility of the Arab and Islamic nation, most of all the  Palestinian people.    The statement stresses the importance of the Palestinian  people's unity, territorial integrity, and the unity of their  cause, objectives, and national fate, and the abidance by all  their national and historical rights. The statement says that  no one has the right to give up any of these rights, and views  the Gaza-Jericho agreement as not binding for the Palestinian  people. The statement calls for clinging to Palestine as an  irreplaceable historical homeland for the Palestinian people,  and for opposing all the schemes for a substitute homeland,  resettlement, transfer, compensation, or attempts to obliterate  the Palestinian people's national identity.    In its statement, the alliance calls for continuing  intifadah activities. It emphasizes that the Palestine question  is the core of the Arab-Zionist conflict, and stresses the need  for bolstering joint Palestinian militant ties.    The statement emphasizes the right of the Palestinian people  in the diaspora to exercise their militant responsibilities  alongside the nationalist, Arab, and Islamic forces to promote  liberation, return, self-determination, and full national  independence.    The statement calls for stepping up cooperation with the  Islamic, Asian, and African states as well as with all the  friendly nations standing by the struggle of our Palestinian  people and supporting their inalienable national rights. It  emphasizes the importance of forging an alliance with all the  forces for liberation and progress around the world--the forces  that support our national rights.    The statement calls for work to disseminate all that relates  to the Palestinian cause and the national struggle to win the  widest public opinion over to the cause of our struggle and  rights, and to make the case that Gaza-Jericho agreement neither  amounts to a solution nor brings peace.    The statement says the alliance will form a Central Command,  which will be responsible for formulating its decisions and  policies that are based on the alliance's political tasks.    The Central Command will include two representatives of each  faction, while its secretariat will include one representative  of each faction.    The Alliance of Palestinian forces groups the following  factions: The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas; the PFLP-GC;  the Palestinian National Liberation Movement, Fatah; the PFLP;  the DFLP; al-Sa'iqah Organization; the PPSF; the Palestinian  Islamic Jihad Movement, the the PRCP; and the PLF.    The secretaries general then answered questions posed by  journalists on issues relating to the situation in the  Palestinian arena.</p>

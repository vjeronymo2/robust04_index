			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Unknown quantity on the party line  -The rise of an MP with a business background FOR Tory MPs urging the promotion of 'exciting new faces' in the next reshuffle in order to regain the political initiative, Mr Roger Freeman is an unlikely prospect for the cabinet. Among the growing number who would settle for competence, however, there is less surprise that his name has been appearing third or fourth on the shortlists of those tipped for the cabinet. The Commons debate on rail privatisation next week will determine whether it stays there. So far, Mr Freeman and the bill he has piloted through the detailed 100-plus hours of committee discussion have survived the process almost unscathed. In January last year, however, he underwent some days of public apologies for remarks that post-privatisation franchise holders might want to run 'cheap and cheerful' services for typists and different services at other times. That apart, he has attracted favourable reviews from backbenchers for his courtesy and diligence. Some rightwingers suggest Mr Freeman as the next Treasury chief secretary because of his numeracy and mastery of detail - he qualified as an accountant. But to many of his colleagues, he remains an unknown quantity. Since becoming an MP in 1983, he has had little opportunity to express personal views rather than departmental policy. Seven of his 10 years as the first Tory MP for Kettering since John Profumo have been spent as a minister: first at the Ministry of Defence, then at the Department of Health and, since 1990, at transport. He says the reason he went into politics was that he is 'fascinated' with the process of government and of parliament. 'I don't think I'd make a very good backbencher - I like the challenge of translating a policy into results.' While a backbench MP, he was on the influential cross-party Treasury committee, and in October 1985 was one of the Tories who voted - unsuccessfully - for the committee to recommend a decision in principle to enter the European exchange rate mechanism, instead of concluding that there should be no change in the status quo over the short to medium term. Having spent almost 20 years before entering parliament as a partner at Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, in charge of the international office, he opposes political union and says he is 'a European for business reasons'. Overall, Mr Freeman gives the impression that he is a Conservative largely for business, rather than political, reasons. He strongly believes in enterprise, innovation and effort; in bringing the private sector into government affairs; and in a low rate of direct taxation, together with moves towards ending tax perks and allowances. He takes an austere view of the politician's role - though supporting the education reforms and having worked on the health service reforms, for example, he has not campaigned in his constituency for individual schools to become grant-maintained or for GPs to become fund-holding practices.</p>

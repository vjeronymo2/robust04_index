			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast: Video report by A. </F> Parfenenkov and Yu. Sysoyev, identified by caption]    [Text] [Parfenenkov over video of city street, bus] The  people of Krasnoyarsk-26, a city which until now was closed to  everybody except for taiga inhabitants and those sent there to  work, have finally undertaken to share events close to their  hearts with the outside world. The world's first nuclear heat  and power station is 30 years old. To this day, it faithfully  supplies heat to the homes of this beautiful city with its  100,000-strong population on the right bank of the Yenisey  River. The power plant is located deep down under the rocks.  The tunnels forged there are adorned in marble in many places,  and they rival the St. Petersburg subway in terms of length.  But let's be honest about this -- it is not for the sake of a  fairly modest nuclear power generator that people dug their way  into the rockface....    [P.G. Gusakov, nuclear heat and electric power station  chief,  identified by caption] In this city most people work at the  Mining and Chemical Combine, which belonged to the defense  sector and the nuclear complex, and its task was to produce  weapons-grade plutonium.    [Parfenenkov] Krasnoyarsk-26 still has the capacity to make  a lot more of this stuff that goes into nuclear weapons, but the  demand is no longer there. So what will the people of the city  do? Work to alter the quality of the weapons-grade plutonium is  under way. Henceforth it will be used as fuel -- that same fuel  which has provided heat for the last 30 years, and which will  continue to keep the city in the Krasnoyarsk taiga warm into the  future.

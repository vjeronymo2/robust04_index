			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Northern Telecom shares fall sharply after warning NORTHERN Telecom's share price tumbled by about 10 per cent yesterday morning after a surprise announcement by the Canadian telecommunications equipment maker that first-quarter earnings will not match either last year's levels or analysts' expectations. In one of Mr Jean Monty's first statements since becoming chief executive, he ascribed the shortfall to heavier spending on research and development, lower software product sales, higher overseas marketing costs and price-cutting in the north American central-office switching market. The company declined to estimate the likely shortfall in first-quarter earnings, which are due to be published on April 27. Earnings for the first three months of 1992 were USDollars 104.2m and for the year as a whole Dollars 548.3m. Northern's share price dropped Dollars 5 to close at Dollars 37 7/8 on the New York stock exchange yesterday. It reached a peak of USDollars 48 last year. Northern's parent company, BCE, also lost ground. The biggest contributor to the fall in earnings is understood to have been the fall in software sales. Although revenues are only modestly lower, earnings have been more severely dented by the high margins on these products. The jump in R&amp;D spending partly reflects work on a cellular phone system in Australia being developed between Northern and Matra, the French company in which Northern bought a stake last year. Higher marketing costs were ascribed mainly to a venture with Bosch, the German electrical group, to develop the German market, and to extra spending in Latin America and Pacific rim countries.</p>

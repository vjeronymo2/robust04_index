			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / People: Dew quits Thornton The weekend departure of Peter Dew from his post of managing director at Thornton group, the fund manager owned by Dresdner Bank, was 'entirely amicable and friendly and to do with a change in the management system,' according to Lord Peter Walker, the former cabinet minister who chairs the group. 'There is no longer any real role for a conventional chief executive,' says Lord Walker, who wants to see Thornton engage itself more actively in Europe, with funds jointly managed in, for example, Paris, Frankfurt and London. 'We will be producing more European products and I see expansion both there and in the Far East.' Dew has long been regarded as a leading figure in Far East investment, and joined Thornton in 1988 after a period running his own property business. Among his positions before that had been a 16-year stint as director of Mercury Asset Management. Thornton has plans to acquire Aetna UK's unit trust business and Lord Walker says 'we will be making a number of other expansions and acquisitions, and I want to bring in a younger generation to manage the business over the next 15 years or so. I have made sure that Peter Dew has been treated very generously; the parting has been very amicable.'</p>

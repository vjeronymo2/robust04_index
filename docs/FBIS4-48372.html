			<p>BFN     [Text] There has been a government reshuffle in Chad today:  nine ministers out of 16 are leaving the cabinet, while civil  servants are still on strike. Dieudonne Djonabaye reports:    [Begin Djonabaye recording] Nine ministers have left Kassire  Coumakoye's new government, the most important of which is  General Kamougue Wadal Abdelkader, who held the civil service  portfolio and represented the government side in talks with the  civil servants who have been on strike for three weeks. He has  been replaced in this post by Mr. Salibou Garba, who is also the  leader of an opposition party [National Alliance for Democracy  and Progress], but who certainly will have his hands tied in the  negotiations with the trades unions over the social pact.    The other departure is that of Mr. Ibni Oumar Mahamat Saleh,  of the department of planning and cooperation. Mr. Ibni Oumar  Mahamat Saleh's chair goes to Mrs. Mariam Mamadnou, who was  secretary of state in the same department in 1990.    The make-up of this new government is inauspicious as far as  the negotiations with the trades unions over the social pact are  concerned. The departure of Kamougue and of Ibni Oumar Mamahat  Saleh, regarded by the unions as moderates, will be a heavy blow  to the negotiations which have been held up for five days over  the thorny question of the application of the decree regulating  strikes. This is Dieudonne Djonabaye in Ndjamena for RFI [end  recording]    It should also be noted that the son of Chad's first  president, President Tombalbaye, has entered the cabinet.</p>

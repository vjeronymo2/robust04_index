			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: ICI falls on sell circular THE ICI share price was sent tumbling by a strongly worded sell recommendation from County NatWest, although the securities house initially went to great lengths to distance itself from the situation. The nub of the argument was that the present dividend will be cut by around 15p after the chemicals and pharmaceuticals giant is split in early 1993. Mr Ian John, County's chemicals analyst, said: 'It is our view that prudent dividend policies for each company will result in dividend payments which, when combined, will produce a net dividend of less than 55p in 1993. We would expect a combined net payout of 40p as a reasonable expectation.' Rumours of a County sell circular had leaked into the market on Tuesday and were partly responsible for that day's 28p fall. However, County had denied that it was issuing a note and even yesterday morning was refusing any comment. Mr Mike Lewis, County's specialist salesman, said he had discussed the note with no one on Tuesday and all the information was embargoed until 8am yesterday. Most analysts were highly sceptical of a dividend cut, but ICI shares were marked down by more than 40p at the start of trading yesterday - principally as a spoiling operation by rival marketmakers. The stock recovered slowly throughout yesterday to close only 7 off at 1055p after turnover of 2.4m shares. Industrial gases group BOC's rise of 14 to 629p was prompted by switching out of ICI. ECC plunges The market again suffered the effect of bad corporate news yesterday when English China Clays (ECC), considered by many to be the 'glamour' stock in the 'other industrial materials' sector, fell sharply after the company reported lower profits than had been expected. Interim profits were down to Pounds 40.8m, against expectations of around Pounds 57m, leading to one of the busiest sessions in ECC stock on record. The shares retreated 30p on the figures, but it was the gloomy meeting with City analysts that moved them to cut full-year profit estimates. One said: 'Not a single positive point was made.' Dealers rushed to sell the shares, briefly causing a price backwardation - a situation in which the bid and offer prices are temporarily reversed. At worst the shares were down 82 at 364p. Bargain hunting left the stock at 371p, down 75 on the day after turnover of 7.3m, the highest daily figure for more than five years. Mr Chris Alexander at Lehman Brothers, who reduced his figure for the year from Pounds 114m to Pounds 95m, commented: 'The shares will not bounce soon and they will be derated further as investors are reminded again that the company's markets are cyclical, and currency will continue to be a potent negative.' Hillsdown drops Diversified foods group Hillsdown experienced an ignominious finale to its membership of the FT-SE 100 Index. The stock suffered the biggest fall in percentage terms in the London market with a slide of 23 to 83p on turnover of 10m shares. First-half profits came in marginally higher than last year's but at the bottom of the range of estimates. They were accompanied by news of heavy borrowings and a gloomy statement predicting a difficult second half. Nomura lowered its full-year estimate by Pounds 18m to Pounds 175m. C and W setback News that US West, the US telecoms carrier, is forming a new electronic directory service in the Minneapolis/St Paul area of Minnesota along with France Telecom caused a sharp slide in shares of Cable and Wireless, owner of Mercury, the UK telecoms group. US West has been seen as a likely candidate to acquire a minority stake in Mercury. Telecoms specialists were surprised at the extent of the drop in C and W, which ended 15 down at 511p on relatively thin turnover of 1.2m. 'This news has not knocked US West off the list of potential suitors,' said one analyst, who added that there were plenty of buyers of a sizeable stake in Mercury 'at the right price'. The C and W weakness was also attributed to a rather clumsily handled selling order. Taylor Woodrow weakened 8, or 18 per cent, to 35p after cutting the interim dividend and recording a Pounds 16m loss. Blue Circle suffered a 10 per cent fall, closing 15 off at 134p in front of today's interims. These are expected to show profits in the region of Pounds 42m, down from the Pounds 57.5m recorded in the first half of last year. Sun Alliance was unsettled after SG Warburg Securities was said to have adopted a more cautious stance on the stock, highlighting the group's exposure to property and the equity market. The shares ended 13 lower at 241p. Prudential closed 6 higher at 236p after the good interim figures. Calor Group outpaced a subdued oil and gas sector, responding to a buy note issued by County NatWest. The shares rose 5 to 179p. Position-taking ahead of Glaxo's results affected all the big pharmaceutical stocks. Wellcome picked up 11 to 854p: the impact of quick-turnover speculators who came in after the recent share issue has now faded. SmithKline Beecham gained 7 both in the 'A' shares and the US-driven units after sizeable switching between the two classes of stock. Fisons rallied 10 to 160p as the opinions of more positive analysts filtered through following Tuesday's announcement of poor first-half results. Nomura Research was one that issued a buy recommendation. J. Sainsbury lost 8 to 446p, with Lehman Brothers pointing out that the rating differential between Sainsbury and Tesco (off a penny at 211p) had widened too far. Supermarket chain Asda saw heavy turnover of more than 16m shares on the back of the chairman's agm statement. The shares eased to 27p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (5).

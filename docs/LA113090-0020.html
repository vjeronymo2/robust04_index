			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Director Must Pay: A Greek court has fined director Costa-Gavras $10,000 for  defaming extreme-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen during a television talk show.  </P> <P> The controversial Le Pen sued the Greek-born director of the political  thrillers "Missing" and "Z" for remarks he made in March about Le Pen's past,  his personal life and his wealth. Le Pen sued both the director and the show's  host who, he said, should have immediately forced the director to temper his  remarks. Le Pen, president of the anti-immigration National Front, has lost  numerous defamation suits and has been fined for racist and anti-Semitic  remarks, according to wire reports.

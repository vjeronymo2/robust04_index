			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because DOE has not accepted any spent fuel containing uranium enriched in the United States for more than five years, several foreign research reactor operators are running out of storage capacity and facing safety and regulatory issues associated with the presence of spent fuel at their sites. If the United States is unable to commit now to the near-term acceptance of a small amount of foreign research reactor spent fuel, several reactor operators soon will either shut down their reactors or ship their spent fuel offsite for reprocessing. Neither option would serve the nonproliferation interests of the United States. Thus, at the urging of the Department of State, DOE is proposing to accept a small number of highly enriched uranium spent fuel elements in the near term for storage in an existing federal facility in South Carolina.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOE believes that preparation of the Environmental Assessment, which analyzes the potential environmental impacts of the proposed urgent-relief acceptance of a small number of spent fuel elements before the Environmental Impact Statement is completed, fully complies with the National Environmental Policy Act and its implementing regulations. The proposed near-term acceptance is justified independently of the decision on whether to establish a new policy on the proposed long-term acceptance of foreign research reactor spent fuel. Until the Environmental Impact Statement is completed and a decision made whether to implement the proposed long-term acceptance policy, the proposed acceptance of a small number of spent fuel elements is necessary to maintain the United States program of encouraging the conversion by research reactors to low enriched uranium fuel. Further, while there is an obvious relationship between the two proposals, a decision to accept such a small number of fuel elements does not foreclose or prejudice future decisions regarding establishment of a new spent fuel acceptance policy, or the decisions regarding interim storage or ultimate disposition of spent nuclear fuel. (In the Programmatic Spent Nuclear Fuel Management Environmental Impact Statement, due to be completed by June 1995, DOE is considering where to manage all spent fuel within the DOE complex nationwide for the interim period prior to ultimate disposition.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In October 1993, to ensure that countries currently possessing spent fuel continue to support the nonproliferation initiatives of the United States embodied in the Reduced Enrichment for Research and Test Reactor Program until the ongoing Environmental Impact Statement can be completed, DOE issued for comment a draft Environmental Assessment which evaluated the proposed urgent-relief acceptance of up to 700 elements of foreign research reactor spent nuclear fuel containing uranium enriched in the United States. It was apparent from the comments that DOE received in response to the October 1993 draft that many people did not agree that there is a need for the United States to accept this spent fuel. Others expressed concerns regarding DOE's plans for implementing the proposed action. Subsequent to the release of the October 1993 draft Environmental Assessment and after consideration of comments received, teams of experts from the United States visited foreign research reactors in Europe and Australia to assess the near-term need for acceptance of foreign research reactor spent fuel elements before the Environmental Impact Statement on the proposed long-term acceptance policy is completed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In February 1994, a revised draft Environmental Assessment, which included revisions made in response to comments received on the October 1993 draft Environmental Assessment, was prepared and issued for public review and comment. The proposed action evaluated in the February draft Environmental Assessment was to accept 448 highly enriched uranium spent fuel elements shipped by sea to any one of seven ports (Newport News, Norfolk, or Portsmouth, Virginia; Charleston, South Carolina; Wilmington, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; and Jacksonville, Florida) and then by truck to DOE's Savannah River Site near Aiken, South Carolina, for storage. The comment period on the revised draft Environmental Assessment was scheduled to close on March 7, 1994. On February 10, 1994, DOE and the Department of State co-hosted a meeting of stakeholders from State and local governments, Congress, environmental and non-proliferation public interest groups, other private sector interest groups, foreign research reactor operators and key affected communities. The purpose of that meeting was to involve stakeholders in a meaningful and constructive dialogue on the proposed urgent-relief acceptance of a small number of spent fuel elements from foreign research reactors. Subsequent to that meeting and based on concerns raised by local communities potentially affected by the proposed action, DOE extended the comment period on the February draft Environmental Assessment until April 8, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The DOE proposes to accept up to 409 spent nuclear fuel elements containing highly enriched uranium of United States origin from eight research reactors in seven European countries (Austria, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland). The spent fuel would be shipped across the ocean in up to 15 spent fuel transportation casks from the country of origin to one or more United States eastern seaboard ports. The casks are expected to be transported in the next several months either by commercial container ships or chartered ships. Several casks could be transported together on a single ship to any one of the five proposed ports of entry: Wilmington and the United States Army's Military Ocean Terminal at Sunny Point, North Carolina; Charleston, South Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; and Jacksonville, Florida.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

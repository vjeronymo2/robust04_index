			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Management: Unhappy returns - Elroy Dimson and Paul Marsh warn that many companies are in danger of underinvesting Over the last few years, real interest rates and inflation have fallen in most leading industrialised countries, while stock markets have climbed to new peaks. How have these changes in capital market conditions affected the cost of capital? More important, have companies fully adjusted to this brave new world? For most companies in most countries, the cost of capital has fallen. Yet when considering new investment projects, many are still living in the past, and seeking a required rate of return (RRR) which is simply too high. By ignoring the worldwide fall in the cost of both debt and equity capital, there is a real danger that these companies will underinvest, or wait too long before embarking on important projects. This could seriously affect their competitive position. The biggest losers will be companies whose capital budgeting systems are the least responsive to changes in market conditions. Underinvestment would be particularly ironic in today's market conditions. Stock markets have risen partly because of the lower RRR which investors are now demanding. If companies ignore this when appraising their own investments, this would not only be inconsistent, but would reflect a lack of shareholder orientation. Markets have also risen because of the better profits outlook and the increase in profitable investment opportunities. Companies which underinvest and fail to exploit these will find their share prices prove unsustainable. Part of the problem is that managers are often unclear about the effect capital markets should have on their investment decisions. There is too much focus on accounting systems, and too great a rigidity in project appraisal criteria. As a result, it can be difficult to ensure that an organisation is using the right cost of capital in the right way. This problem is not new. Some years ago, an organisation which was investigating underinvestment in the UK initiated an informal survey of capital budgeting procedures used in large British companies. An important question was, what level of return on capital was required for a project to be regarded as acceptable. Based on the first batch of responses, it became clear that the 'hurdle' rate of return ranged from less than 10 per cent to 40 per cent or more. A partial explanation for this puzzlingly wide spread was provided by the next company approached. Here, the finance director asked for clarification. What, precisely, was meant by required return? Was it the accounting rate of return, or the discounted cash flow rate? Was it the return on capital or on equity? Was it the real or the nominal return? The pre- or post-tax return? And for what time period and level of risk? At this point, the researcher realised that he would need to re-interview all his previous respondents to ask them what they had meant. Clearly, asking 'What is your required rate of return?' can produce varied responses. In the debate on whether companies are demanding too high a return on capital, it is crucial to define what we mean by the RRR. Investment projects, by definition, involve spending money 'up front' in the hope of a financial return later. Best practice in terms of project appraisal involves estimating both the initial costs and expected future cash flows, and then discounting these at the appropriate RRR to determine whether the investment adds value for shareholders. The initial investment in any project clearly has a cost, namely the expected return which would otherwise have been available from investing the money in the capital markets over the same period and at similar risk. The RRR is the opportunity cost of capital for a stock market investment that is comparable to the proposed project in terms of maturity, risk exposure and tax treatment. Taking each of these factors in turn, a project's maturity might broadly be thought of in terms of the classifications used by the Financial Times for fixed interest securities, namely up to five years, five-15 years, or more than 15 years. Second, the project's risk exposure may be visualised on a continuum from riskless government bonds to equities (or even a leveraged position in equities). And third, the project's cash flows should be estimated after deduction of corporate tax, which in many European countries, including the UK, incorporates prepayment of personal tax on dividends. For a risk-free investment, a rough guide to the required return on a five-15 year investment is the yield to redemption on index-linked or conventional government bonds of appropriate maturity. In the UK, after deducting personal tax and rounding to the nearest whole number, this is currently some 2 per cent in real terms or 5 per cent in money terms. This implies an inflation rate of around 3 per cent per annum. Risky investment can only be justified if it commands a risk premium. Historically, equities have generated an average annual real risk premium of approximately 8 per cent compared with government bonds. The typical company uses debt as well as equity in its capital structure, however, which makes its shares more risky than its underlying assets. A typical risk premium for a company's underlying investments would therefore be lower, say 6-7 per cent after tax. For an investment project of typical risk, we must add a premium of 6-7 per cent to the real risk-free interest rate of 2 per cent. The required rate of return is around 8-9 per cent in real terms, or 11-12 per cent in money terms. The days of looking for 20 per cent or more are behind us - at least for the moment. There are naturally differences between the required returns that are appropriate for low risk projects, and those that should be demanded of higher risk proposals. Companies may classify investments according to their risk, and then adjust the cost of capital according to each project's risk attributes. But the starting point for these adjustments should typically be the company's overall cost of capital. Our contacts with companies suggest that many have not responded sufficiently to falling inflation and lower real interest rates. As a result their managements are demanding an excessive return from new investment projects. They run the risk of investing too little and too late, and of failing to share fully in the economic recovery.

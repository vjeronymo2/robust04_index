			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: NAMES IN THE NEWS  </P> <P> Javelin thrower Tom Petranoff bettered his own American record in a meet at  Port Elizabeth, South Africa. Petranoff, who is from Oceanside but has been  living in South Africa for more than a year, threw 283 feet 7 inches to break  his old mark of 283-2. His record may not be recognized, however, because South  Africa is not a member of the International Amateur Athletic Federation, the  governing body for track and field.  </P></p>

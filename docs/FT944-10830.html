			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Peace process flies free of jails issue: Dublin's IRA prisoner release announcement Dublin's announcement that it intended to release several IRA prisoners before Christmas sparked a critical reaction yesterday from unionists and some Conservatives. But there seemed little prospect of the move blowing the Northern Ireland peace process off course. British and Irish officials working on the framework document, which the two governments hope will form the basis of a durable political settlement in the province, are understood to be making headway again after a period when little progress was achieved. The recent suggestion by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, that the much-delayed document should be ready before the first anniversary of the signing of the Downing Street declaration on December 15 does not seem to be regarded as unrealistic in Whitehall. Mr Reynolds and Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, would have an opportunity to discuss the matter at the European Union summit in Essen, Germany, on December 9 and 10. More may become clear following a meeting between Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, which is expected to take place next Monday in Ireland. Meanwhile, there seems no reason to suppose that preliminary talks between the British government and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, should not start before the end of the year, as Mr Major has indicated. Topics to be covered would include the dismantling of republican arsenals. The two governments disclosed last month that officials had started talks on the logistics and mechanics of arranging for weapons in the hands of paramilitaries to be given up. But Mr Major declined to say whether the handing over of weapons was likely to begin in advance of the preliminary talks. Unionist reaction to Monday night's announcement by Dublin was divided. The hardline Democratic Unionist party (DUP) referred to a 'secret agenda' under which London would agree to the IRA's demands. But the moderate Ulster Unionists (UUP) said they were worried about the 'increasing divergence' between London and Dublin. Mr Ian Paisley Jr, a DUP spokesman, said: 'The Irish government has behaved recklessly in announcing prisoner releases. It confirms what we have been saying all along. The British government is surrendering to the IRA and the republic.' Mr Ken Maginnis, UUP security spokesman, said: 'I do not think there is a two-handed conspiracy between Westminster and Dublin. Quite the reverse. I am worried about the increasing divergence between the two governments; between Ireland's piecemeal approach and Mr John Major's correct structured approach.' Mr David Trimble, UUP legal affairs spokesman, said: 'I think the prisoner releases underline the growing differences and widening gap between London and Dublin. Dublin is trying to put pressure on London over prisoners because London put pressure on Dublin over arms surrender.' Mr Andrew Hunter, chairman of the Tory backbench Northern Ireland committee, described the announcement as 'a serious miscalculation by the Irish government'. He said: 'The peace process can only maintain its momentum if it retains the confidence of both sides of a deeply divided community . . . this is the first incident which, if repeated, could spell trouble.' Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, said the republic's decision did not mean arbitrary releases. He said: 'It is an approach which should be applied in Northern Ireland through review procedures so that as peace lasts, so the prison population decreases in a way which would signal a new era for Northern Ireland.' Downing Street emphasised yesterday that Dublin's policy on the release of prisoners in the Irish Republic had no implications for London's policy on convicted prisoners. It said it had repeatedly made clear that those convicted of criminal offences would serve their sentences. Dublin's move was widely seen as evidence of its concern to maintain the peace initiative's momentum in order to bolster moderate voices in the republican movement. According to security and republican sources, the Sinn Fe'in leadership is coming under increasing pressure from hardliners in the IRA to obtain significant political concessions from the British government. Restlessness is deepening among IRA volunteers in the rural areas of Armagh and Tyrone who feel that the peace process is bringing about no radical change in the British government's position on Northern Ireland. This section of the IRA is seeking an early release of political prisoners, a withdrawal of troops, and a commitment to united Ireland. The republic has 56 IRA prisoners in its jails compared with about 400 in British jails.</p>

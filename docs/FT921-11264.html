			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The ticking of the hidden clockwork - London Markets THE turn-of-the-century spy novels of John Buchan give the impression that public events form a thin veneer over a whirling clockwork mechanism of intrigue, in which nothing is what it seems, and every innocent milk-cart or postman is no more than a cog in a world-wide conspiracy. Eighty years on, the Company News Service of the London Stock Exchange appears to have taken up where Buchan left off, full of unexpected references to a clandestine world of spies and terrorists. Last year, it was Robert Maxwell and his alleged links with Israeli intelligence. This week, it was Wace, the pre-press printing services group, denying rumours about a connection with the IRA - rumours that eventually led to the departure of John Clegg, Wace's managing director. The company's statement on Friday, reporting Clegg's departure, emphasised that the rumours were entirely unfounded. None the less, the statement said, the rumours' persistence had led Clegg to conclude that he would best serve the company's interests by resigning. Over the past five years, Wace's share price has risen from 69p to a peak of 418p in July 1989. The shares were trading at 177p a week ago, before the Sunday Telegraph reported that an unnamed rapidly growing public company was under investigation for laundering funds for the IRA. On Monday morning, Wace's share price fell from 177p to 155p in relatively heavy trading. The company put out a statement denying any connection with the IRA, and the shares recovered to close at 166p. By Thursday night, the shares had recovered to 168p. On Friday morning, Wace announced Clegg's departure, and the shares lost 38 per cent, to close at 104p. The John Buchan view of the world was at work elsewhere this week - for example in the CBI's January industrial trends survey. Stolid Midlands businessmen, filling in their CBI forms, have succumbed to the Californian persistence with which the organisation urges on them the question 'yes, but how do you really feel?'. As the chart on the right shows, although their expectations of their own forthcoming output have dipped only slightly, their assessment of how everyone else feels (in answer to the question 'what is the trend of general business optimism') has worsened much more sharply. In the depths of the recession, business-people have clearly started to judge the outlook less by their own everyday experience of sales-calls and orders than by the workings of some hidden clockwork. The stock market has been listening to a different set of muffled tickings this month, wrong-footing those who thought December's sharp recovery would pre-empt the usual January rise. The FT-SE index closed at 2,571.2 yesterday, up 60.8 on the week and 3 per cent on the month. At one point yesterday, it touched 2,580.2. It is now back to the levels reached last August, just before the - mistaken - belief in an immediate economic recovery sent it to record levels in September. Favourable opinion-poll results for the Conservatives took some of the credit. So did the strength of the pound; though it is only just above its ERM minimum against the Spanish peseta, it is a good ten pfennigs clear of its D-Mark floor, which is arguably the rate that matters. Early in the week, there was talk that a cut in UK base rates from their current level of 10.5 per cent might be on the way. Friday, the usual day for interest rate changes, came and went without any such move, however. Tiny Rowland - who might, come to think of it, have steped out of Greenmantle or Prester John - was again in the news, as shareholders in Lonrho recovered from last week's dividend cut. An FT report that Lonrho is to lose control of UK import and distribution of Volkswagens and Audis from the end of 1993 had only a short-term impact on the shares; they closed at 123p, up 2p on the week, down 21 per cent since the beginning of the year. Two other swashbuckling figures, Lord Hanson and Lord White, revealed some of the inner workings of their empire, by announcing that they do not plan to bid for ICI. Nine months ago, before Hanson bought a 2.8 per cent stake in the chemical company, ICI was trading at 1100p. Its shares closed on Friday at 1275p, up 30p on the week, and 16 per cent higher than before the Hanson stake-building exercise, during which period they have outperformed the market by 13 per cent. As one intriguing mystery ended, another began: the market became convinced that someone was building a stake in Fisons, the pharmaceutical company that has run into problems with America's drug regulators and recently lost its chief executive. The shares closed at 394p, up 59 1/2 p on the week and 21 per cent higher on the month. In one respect, the week was a triumph for the prosaic, non-Buchan view of the world. For years, economic conspiracy theorists have wondered why, if big British companies routinely show up as among the world's most consistently profitable, the earnings of the corporate sector as a whole should do so badly on international rankings of return on capital. Surely this must reflect some hidden weakness in corporate Britain? Not so, said the CBI this week. Those international rankings have got it all wrong: if you compare like with like, British profitability is perfectly adequate. In one respect, though, the hidden universe of paranoia overlaps with the mundane world of industrial reality: as the chart on the left shows, there was a steady gap between British and German profits for all but the most ebullient year of the 1980s; and UK profitability has now turned sharply down. Meanwhile, off the coast, a submarine silently waits . . .</p>

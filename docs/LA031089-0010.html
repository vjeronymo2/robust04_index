			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROBERTS LEADS BY ONE IN COLD AND WINDY FLORIDA  </P> <P> Loren Roberts battled cold and wind for a five-under-par 66 and a one-stroke  lead Thursday in the first round of the $800,000 Nestle Invitational golf  tournament at Bay Hill Country Club.  </P> <P> The conditions were miserable.  </P> <P> "The coldest it's been this year," Roberts said. And most agreed that, overall,  this winter has been the coldest start to the PGA Tour within memory.  </P> <P> "By far the worst I've been in this year," Ted Schulz said.  </P> <P> "The coldest I remember in a long time," Tom Kite added.  </P> <P> Nick Price, wearing gloves, a ski cap and five layers of clothing over his  upper body, said nothing. He just shivered, but birdied the final three holes  for a 67.  </P> <P> The temperatures reached only into the low 40s. A brisk wind reduced the chill  factor to 25. Mist and fog rose from the lakes and ponds dotting the course and  obscured some fairways.  </P> <P> Kite holed a 173-yard, 6-iron shot for an eagle-2 on the 16th hole and was tied  at 68 with Schulz and Tom Purtzer.  </P> <P> Don Pooley, Steve Pate and John Huston were next at 69.  </P></p>

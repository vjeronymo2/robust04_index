			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AID FOR 2 MILLION CHERNOBYL VICTIMS ASKED  </P> <P> A Soviet republic Tuesday asked for international help to relocate and give  medical aid to more than 2 million people, including 600,000 children, affected  by the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident.  </P> <P> The sudden plea -- more than four years after the accident -- comes after  Soviet scientists acknowledged that the situation is much worse than Moscow had  portrayed.  </P> <P> One-fifth of the republic of Byelorussia's more than 10 million people have to  be moved from areas contaminated by radiation, said Victor Borovikov, a  Byelorussia diplomat. He said this includes 27 cities and more than 2,600  villages.  </P> <P> "We have no energy, no transportation, no communications" in these regions, he  told reporters. He was in Brussels for the departure today of a truck convoy  carrying donated children's medicine to Minsk, the republic's capital.  </P> <P> He noted that thousands were moved after the April 26, 1986, accident in the  Ukraine. But he added: "Then Moscow said there was no panic, no danger. In the  past four years, we've realized the situation was not so simple."  </P> <P> Byelorussia, which has no nuclear power plants, got 70% of the fallout from the  nuclear power plant at Chernobyl.  </P> <P> He said the republic had planned to spend $14 billion to move 180,000 people  from the high-radiation zone by the end of 1995 but would now try to do it by  the end of 1991.  </P> <P> Soviet scientists recommend that all people in all the contaminated areas be  evacuated at an estimated cost of $70 billion.  </P> <P> Borovikov said experts now say it could take up to 200 years "to totally wipe  out" effects of the accident in the area.  </P> <P> "We have no experience in this field, which is why we're asking for  international help," said Borovikov, the republic's U.N. ambassador in Vienna.  </P> <P> Borovikov said that after the accident, people were paid by the Soviet  authorities to stay in the contaminated zones, but they are now demanding  immediate relocation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> Human error was blamed in the blast at Chernobyl, 60 miles north of Kiev, in  the early morning hours of April 26, 1986. First word of the disaster came from  Finland and Scandinavia, where high radiation levels were detected. The Soviets  did not acknowledge that a nuclear disaster had occurred until April 28. About  135,000 people were evacuated, Soviet officials reported. Hundreds of people  were treated for severe cases of radiation illness; 18,000 more were briefly  hospitalized. The death toll at Chernobyl was 31.  </P></p>

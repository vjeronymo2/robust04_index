			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / International Company News: Canadian provinces face downgrade Canadian provinces face further downgrades to their credit ratings, according to Dominion Bond Rating Service (DBRS), one of Canada's two bond rating agencies. Accumulated government deficits are so large that normal improvements stemming from economic recovery are likely to prove ineffective, the rating service says in a report sent to provincial officials. Last month the Toronto Dominion Bank predicted that Canadian federal and provincial deficits would reach a worst ever CDollars 780bn (USDollars 570bn) by next March. DBRS said corporate and personal taxes are so high that it would be difficult to get more revenue from traditional sources, both at the federal and provincial levels. While some provinces have checked rising health costs, British Columbia and Quebec are said by DBRS to be understating their fiscal 1995 deficit by CDollars 1bn each. However, Ontario's budget deficits are the highest. The federal government's interest bill has doubled since 1985 and the average maturity of its debt has dropped to 4.3 years. This makes it more vulnerable to higher interest rates, DBRS warns.</p>

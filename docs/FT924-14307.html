			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow declines as hopes of a rate cut fade Wall Street US share prices fell sharply yesterday on a report that the Federal Reserve has no plans to cut interest rates in the near future, after another rise in bond yields and a big fall in Ford, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 39.45 at 3,136.58. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended lower, down 5.08 at 402.67, while the Amex composite gave up 2.16 at 364.85 and the Nasdaq composite slipped 3.35 to 570.53. Turnover on the NYSE was 179m shares, and declines outnumbered rises by two to one. Hopes that the Fed would ease monetary policy, possibly in conjunction with the Bundesbank in Germany, crumbled yesterday in the wake of a Financial Times story in which a senior Fed official ruled out a rate cut before the November 3 election. The story sent bond prices tumbling, and pushed the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond back above 7.5 per cent. Investors are also worried about the third-quarter reporting season, and that the market's expectations for corporate earnings may be unreasonably high. Ford's share price dropped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 34 3/4 in turnover of 4.6m shares after the company disclosed in its prospectus for a Dollars 1bn preferred stock offering that it may make a loss in the third and fourth quarter because of economic uncertainty afflicting its European markets, and continued stagnation in domestic sales. The bad news from Ford hit the other two big motor stocks. Chrysler fell Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 22 1/8 and General Motors, which suffered from a string of analysts' downgrades earlier in the week, dropped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 29 1/8 . AMR, parent group of American Airlines, fell Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 54 7/8 after the carrier announced it was abandoning the four-tiered fare structure it introduced in April because of intense price competition among US airlines. Concern that the price war will continue to cripple the industry weighed on other airline stocks, with Delta dropping Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 55 1/4 , United Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 112 1/8 , and USAir Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 11 7/8 . Brilliance China, which owns a majority stake in China's largest mini-bus manufacturer and is the first Chinese company to raise equity finance in the US, made an impressive debut yesterday. The stock ended at Dollars 20 1/8 , a handsome premium on the issue price of Dollars 16. Caesar's World fell Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 34 1/8 after the company warned of lower first-quarter profits. Canada TORONTO stocks ended moderately lower, but a lack of players in the market due to the Thanksgiving three-day weekend limited the losses, dealers said. 'There's just no volume. A lot of traders left early. Everybody's going home for turkey,' one trader said. The 300 composite index closed down 18.73 points at 3,218.49, within half a point of the day's low. Declines led advances 261 to 216. Volume was a slow 24.59m shares and transactions were valued at CDollars 286m. Bramalea plunged CDollars 0.14 to CDollars 0.37, a new 52-week low. Trizec Corp, which is Bramalea's major shareholder, had its class A shares drop CDollars 0.25 to CDollars 3.65.</p>

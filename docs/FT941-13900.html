			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Gardening: Wild beauty tamed The more you see, the sharper your tastes become. Gardeners spend their middle years forgetting that they began by liking things which now seem beneath them. Time passes, tastes broaden and we all come back for another look at the old untouchables. I am not about to praise heather. Instead, I must pay a tribute to an outstanding performer of the past three months, although its name conjures up a bush with branches like fishbones, covered with berries which are much too bright for their background of yellow brick. Cotoneasters are given a wide berth by gardening converts (by converting they feel they have escaped from them). Like most converts, they have bolted too quickly and owe their past another look. Throughout this winter, cotoneasters have been magnificent. Huge crops of berries are supposed to predict a cold winter, but we can now infer that a huge crop on a cotoneaster predicts floods and an earthquake. There is more to the family than the common horizontalis, the fishbone form which turns up on home extensions. Think of China, their natural home, of bees, berries and beauty when nothing else is out. A bad plant can also be a good plant in a bad place. The fishbone cotoneaster will grow anywhere, even in a wind-corridor beside the dustbins, but we should not assume that the rest of the family deserves nothing better. It includes some star turns, of which my favourite is Exburyensis, an evergreen hybrid which was bred by one of the Rothschilds' gardeners. Its berries are a heavenly shade of pale yellow and appear from late October onwards. The narrow leaves are up to 5in long and remain green while the berries are at their best. This fine plant will grow on a wall and so gardeners tend to put it on a north wall believing it will grow anywhere. And it will, reaching 12ft and a manageable width. But it is twice the plant if it faces west or south-east: the sun plays on the berries and the plant can be brightened in the summer by a clematis growing through its stem. Its pair in the family is another hybrid, cornubia, which also arose at Exbury. No other cotoneaster has such brilliant red fruit and it remains dazzling well into November. Again, it tends to be tucked into shade or pinned on to angular walls between London neighbours. Left to itself, it will spread far and wide and develop too many side-stems. It is much better if it is pruned each spring and limited to a single trunk and encouraged into the shape of a tree. I have seen superbly-trained Cornubias, pinned up a west-facing wall on London houses where its growth has reached to the fourth floor after six years. These two children from Exbury are exceptional evergreens, but there is an equal from the wild which gardeners underestimate. Cotoneaster lacteus was brought back from Yunnan 80 years ago, but gardeners neglect it because they think it must be ordinary, a plant for cover beneath trees. After watching it nearby, I realised that it has magic. The way to grow it is as an evergreen hedge, lightly clipped in early spring and allowed to reach a height between three and six feet. The hedge is thick to the base if you clip it from its first year onwards. It is cheap, completely hardy and varies in colour between a grey-green when its shoots are young and fiery show of berries as the season ends. On a clipped hedge they are prolific so long as you clip early and allow the plants to flower in early July. The berries and evergreen cover are so good that I prefer this variety to a hedge of franchetti, a more elegant shrub when in leaf but not so bright in berry or so evergreen. On both accounts, I prefer Cotoneaster conspicuus decorus which has reached us from Tibet. This Tibetan in exile will grow almost anywhere in Britain and bears the most beautiful berries in light shade. It lasts longer than any other because the birds seem to ignore it. But it spreads to a height of about three feet and makes a clump, not a hedge. There is more, then, to this family than fishbones and too much scarlet. I think we forget what wild beauties we have tamed. Life on an urban fencing panel is a far cry from a hillside in western China. The more we see cotoneasters pinned and splayed against a bad background, the harder we find it to imagine them growing in a romantic site in an uncluttered landscape. We need to disassociate them from the setting which we have imposed and then we will start to recognise what useful beauty this despised family brings with it.</p>

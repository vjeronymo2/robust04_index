			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Arye Arad] </F>   [Excerpt] Twice over the past two days, the government has  issued seemingly routine announcements that create the  impression that Israel is sending a message to Syria regarding  the future of the Golan Heights.    Two days ago, the Public Works Department announced that it  will invest 2.5 million shekels in building a new road between  Ramat Magshimim and Nator. Yesterday, Transportation Minister  Yisra'el Qeysar announced that he is allocating 750,000 shekels  to solve transportation problems on the Golan. He made the  promise in a meeting with the heads of the Golan Regional  Council. The current sum is earmarked for works within the  Jewish settlements, but Minister Qeysar promised that the  government will also invest in improving existing roads and  building new ones for the Druze on the Golan. There are  currently 18,000 Druze and 12,000 Jewish residents on the Golan.  [passage omitted]</p>

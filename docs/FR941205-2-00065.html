Mr. Berger represents that he has undertaken the following duties as independent fiduciary to the Plan with respect to the Lease:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) to review the Plan's proposed purchase of the Property, and in that connection to determine whether the purchase will be at fair market value as determined by an independent real estate appraiser and based upon arm's-length negotiations, and whether the purchase will be in the best interest of the Plan and its participants, taking into account the diversity of Plan assets and the Plan's need for liquidity;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) to review the Lease (and any proposed renewals thereof) covering the Property to confirm in each case that the Lease (or renewal) is in the best interest of the Plan and its participants;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) to confirm that the Lease (or renewal thereof) reflects the current fair market rental rate as determined by an independent real estate appraiser;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) to review all financial statements and other documents to be filed by the Plan in connection with the Lease (or the renewal thereof);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) to monitor the Lease to ensure that all actions are taken that are necessary or proper to safeguard the interests of the Plan; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) to review the Plan's assets periodically to determine whether the value of the Property remains less than 25% of the total value of Plan assets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Mr. Berger represents that he completed his analysis of the transactions and, based upon his review and analysis, it is his opinion that the Property is an appropriate investment for the Plan and the acquisition and Lease thereof is in the best interests of the Plan's participants and beneficiaries. Mr. Berger represents that he has reviewed the Plan's investment portfolio and determined that while it is prudently diversified among its various securities, less than 20% of the total corpus is invested in intermediate and long-term securities. Mr Berger believes that it would be appropriate to further diversify the portfolio with a long-term investment such as the Property and the subject Lease.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Mr. Berger represents that after having examined the purchase contract, the proposed Lease, the appraisal report, the physical Property and the Plan's assets, he considers the purchase of the Property to be a sound and secure investment which will earn a fair market return for the Plan and will enhance the diversification of the Plan's assets and provide a more consistent and level flow of current income. Mr. Berger represents that he will continue to monitor the Lease throughout its duration and take whatever action is necessary to protect the Plan's rights under the Lease.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

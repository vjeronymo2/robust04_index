			<p>BFN     [Text] Hohhot, May 16 (XINHUA) -- North China's Inner  Mongolia Autonomous Region has made painstaking efforts to boost  its rural industry and the endeavor has begun to bear fruit.    Statistics show that in the first four months of this year,  rural and township enterprises in the autonomous region  generated 6.71 billion yuan of output value and produced 800  million yuan of profits and taxes, both more than doubling that  in the same period of last year.    The implementation of the central government's strategy of  accelerating the development of rural and township industry in  the country's central and northwest areas has created a  favorable environment for Inner Mongolia to develop rural  industry, but its growth has long been hindered by a shortage of  funds.    Early this year, the autonomous region set up a leading  group  to coordinate rural and township enterprises and initiated a  special development fund for rural and township enterprises.    The fund is established with the purpose of helping existing  rural enterprises to enlarge production and helping poor and  remote rural areas start more rural enterprises.    To ensure effective input of funds for rural enterprises and  guarantee efficient use of money, the autonomous region has also  worked out rules which stipulate that rural and township  enterprises should report their new projects and detailed  procedures for starting the projects.    The establishment of the fund has provided a financial  guarantee to help boost the autonomous region's rural industry.    According to local officials, Inner Mongolia invested one  billion yuan to develop rural industry in the first quarter of  this year.    It also plans to pump a total of 2.5 billion yuan in loans  into the development of rural industry this year, an increase of  50 percent compared with last year.</p>

After meeting  for over four hours on Bosnia, Juergen Chrobog, the Foreign  Ministry political director, said in Bonn this afternoon that  the senior officials participating in the meeting had expressed  their readiness to give unreserved support to the process of  negotiations between Croats and Bosnians.    The conference participants want to exploit the dynamism  resulting from the success of Sarajevo. They decided to work  closely together in order to promote a speedy solution of the  conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The prospects of a peace  settlement have improved. The latest developments in Sarajevo  are an important step toward ending the war in the whole of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, the conference participants said  they were very concerned about the serious situation in other  regions of Bosnia.    As a first step, the conference wants to see to it that the  cease-fire in and around Sarajevo is stabilized through an  effective disengagement of troops. The reappearance of the heavy  weapons withdrawn from there in other arenas of war must be  prevented. Free access by road to the capital of  Bosnia-Herzegovina must be guaranteed, and normal life in  Sarajevo must be restored with the help of the United Nations.  Free access for humanitarian aid supplies must be achieved for  Srebrenica, Zepa.    The conference also urges a speedy opening of Tuzla Airport  for humanitarian aid. An effective cease-fire should be imposed  in Mostar. Military disengagement measures should be taken in  central Bosnia to achieve a cease-fire between government troops  and Bosnian Croat forces. Free access for humanitarian aid  should also be secured in Maglaj.    Chrobog stressed the aim of the conference had been to take  stock rather than make decisions. The results of the analysis  would now be submitted to the foreign ministers of the countries  involved. Whether they then meet or whether a conference of  heads of state and government takes place hinges not least on  the further development of the peace process between the warring  parties themselves.</p>

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Markets: Why the Midland battle matters - Serious Money SHOULD Midland depositors care whether Lloyds or Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai takes over their bank? There are two fundamental issues. If Lloyds takes over, will the elimination of one of the big High Street banks mean a reduction in competition and a poorer deal for the consumer? Or will a takeover by either bank strengthen Midland sufficiently to improve the service to its customers? The case from Lloyds is that the cost savings which would result from a merger (Pounds 700m over four years) will be reflected in more competitive pricing of products and a higher quality of service. Lloyds also argues that its own customers will benefit from a larger and geographically more diverse range of branches - Midland is stronger in the north and Lloyds in the south. In addition, the merger would result, says Lloyds, in significant advances in information technology and, as a consequence, in products and services. Finally, Lloyds says that a merged bank will be able to offer all its customers the best products and services from the ranges currently offered separately. The other side of the coin is that Midland depositors will inevitably see a large number of their branches disappear, as part of the Lloyds cost cutting drive (even though they will now have access to existing Lloyds branches). And the Midland name will disappear, which means new cheque books, cards etc for depositors - which could be a considerable inconvenience. The cynical might also wonder whether the cost savings will really be as large as Lloyds suggests. All too often, the 'economies of scale' that are supposed to result from big company mergers turn out to be illusory. Mergers can be motivated by mere 'empire-building' on the part of company managers. Indeed, there is a more fundamental point. Even a 'more efficient' Midland - whether under the aegis of Lloyds or Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai - might still not be able to offer the kind of service that Weekend FT readers need. Long gone are the days when consumers popped down to the branch every week to have a word with their friendly bank manager. Many are happy simply to use the cashpoint machine to withdraw money and therefore rarely enter their branches at all. Many building societies and smaller banks have lower costs and greater flexibility than the big High Street banks. It is hard to think of a service offered by a big bank that is not available elsewhere. And it would probably be profitable for many depositors to move their accounts. Remember all the fanfare about interest-bearing current accounts? Well, at Lloyds, depositors get just 2.53 per cent gross on balances of up to Pounds 5,000, at Barclays and NatWest the rate is a measly 2.02 per cent. Midland has a rather better record in this area. Its Orchard account pays 3.04 per cent on positive balances. And First Direct, its innovative telephone banking system, pays a healthy 4.34 per cent on balances of over Pounds 1,000. (Lloyds has indicated that it will be happy to keep First Direct.) But the Save &amp; Prosper/Robert Fleming Classic account pays 7.25 per cent gross on balances of over Pounds 1,000 (and 2.53 per cent of balances below that figure). Cheque books, standing orders, direct debits etc are all available on the account. Add in the many high interest cheque accounts, or the money market unit trusts where double-digit returns are available on deposits of Pounds 1,000 plus, and it is clear that it is only inertia which has kept many customers at the high street banks. The public image of banks is certainly low at the moment. The general suspicion is that banks have tried to recoup their losses on Third World and property loans by racking up charges on individual and small business customers. It is certainly true that banks have come to realise that their personal customers are a highly valuable resource. Which other industry has such intimate knowledge of the financial strength of its customers? Although none of the banks has made much of a fist at selling shares to their depositors, they have made great strides in the field of life insurance. Lloyds has perhaps been most successful at this - via Lloyds Abbey Life. With NatWest linking up with Clerical Medical, bank customers in general can look forward to being on the receiving end of an insurance marketing blitz in the 1990s. There is unlikely to be any escape from such 'cross-selling' - many of the other institutions offering banking services have the same ambitions. Customers should not be surprised that people are trying to make a profit from them - that is the nature of the capitalist system, after all. The answer is to be hard-nosed and businesslike in selecting your financial institution. So, to return to the question of whether customers should care who wins the Midland takeover battle - they should take the opportunity to look round the marketplace and see if they can get a better deal elsewhere. By all means give a combined Lloyds/Midland or Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai/Midland a chance to prove they can improve service. But if a merged bank fails to deliver, vote with your wallet and switch your account.</p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / School heads reject performance pay HEAD TEACHERS oppose government plans to introduce performance-related pay for teachers, the National Association of Head Teachers said yesterday . It published a survey by the independent Institute of Manpower Studies based on 3,300 responses from a sample of 5,081 heads in England and Wales. The survey indicated that heads were almost universally sceptical about performance pay. But the survey also found that heads felt the current pay system did not give them enough scope to reward teachers. While just under half the teachers in the schools of heads surveyed received an incentive allowance, 80 per cent of the awards were for extra responsibility. Only 3 per cent were awarded for classroom performance and little use was made of other flexibilities in the pay system. The heads generally welcomed greater control over their school budgets but there was considerable concern over additional workload and stress.

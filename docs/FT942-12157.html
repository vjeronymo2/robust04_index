			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: It's the cask that counts For the lucky few who penetrate the headquarters of Norway's hypersensitive drinks' monopoly in Oslo, there is the chance to meet Halvor Heuch, the ebullient production manager. Heuch's job is to make excellent cask-aged aquavits. In his spare time he conducts experiments with oak. One he showed me demonstrated how much influence a second-hand cask can have over the spirit which takes it over. He had aged two samples of plain ethyl alcohol, one in an old Limousin cognac barrel and the other in an old Jerez brandy cask. In the former, the spirit had picked up a light cognac character; in the Jeresano the alcohol had developed a big, fruity, brandy taste which was all the more remarkable given that the brewage has never been anywhere near a grape. Across the North Sea, in Scotland, there is a similar interest in the properties of casks. Modern whisky relies entirely on second-hand barrels: chiefly old bourbon whisky casks and reused bourbon staves from the US, plus a small amount of sherry oak from Spain. In the case of bourbon oak, quality has declined over the past few years causing alarm in the whisky business; in Jerez the sherry producers have modernised production and have less need of the sort of casks sought by whisky makers. On a visit to a cooperage in Kentucky I was astonished to see that reeds are no longer used to bind the casks. The leakiness which I saw in local distilleries must have been a direct result. The reeds have been eliminated in the interests of cost-cutting; but that is a minor drawback when it comes to the modern bourbon cask. George Espie, of Scotland's Clyde Cooperage, says the casks he is getting today are often made from wood which has been kiln-dried rather than seasoned, or dried in the open air for a minimum of two years. American coopers are also cutting fast-growing oaks rather than the slower sorts preferred by distillers. Instead of automatically accepting the consignments which come from America, Scottish distillers are now examining other possibilities. At Glenmorangie distillery, on the Dornoch Firth, they have been selecting casks at the Kentucky cooperages and monitoring their development in bourbon warehouses. They have also experimented with ageing bourbon in Scotland. For George Espie the solution may be more drastic. He is interested in cutting out the bourbon stage altogether and ageing whisky in new American white oak casks. This would be a departure from post-war tradition, but Espie reminded me that before the war there was no bourbon wood and, apart from the second-hand sherry, port and wine casks so eagerly recycled by the thrifty Scots, the industry used English oak casks which were raised in Scotland. Since the war the coopering business in these islands has dwindled to little more than rebuilding and repairing; so we can no longer hope for whiskies with hearts of English oak. Nor is it true that European oak - the oak used in old-fashioned sherry casks - is unsuitable for whisky. The problem, says Espie, is porosity: French coopers cleave and do not saw. They are also expensive. The sweet and fruity taste of a typical Speyside whisky comes partly from old sherry casks. At the Macallan distillery Frank Newlands has the difficult job of selecting the casks for this 100 per cent sherry oak whisky. First Spanish oak barrels must be bought and offered to smaller growers in the Jerez region. These casks must be used for one or two fermentations before ageing dry oloroso sherry. Now that the larger sherry houses have ceased to ferment their wine in oak it has become harder and harder to ensure an adequate supply of these casks. Espie reckons that every Spanish oak cask made in the past 10 years was paid for by the Scotch whisky business. Different houses have different solutions on how to maintain the right oak treatment for whisky without paying the earth. United Distillers has conducted successful experiments by treating American oak casks with specially imported sherry-style wines: Pajarete and Montilla. Lang's, in Glasgow, is the producer of Lang's Supreme blended whisky and Glengoyne, an elegant and slightly sweet malt from the southern Highlands. The company was able to show me a range of experiments with sherry casks which would have struck an instant chord with those conducted by Halvor Heuch in Oslo. The experiments are designed to see to what extent Spanish-coopered American oak casks can be used to replace the almost-extinct Spanish oak casks in whisky maturation. The oldest whiskies treated this way are now seven years old. Some had been housed in casks in which sherry had been fermented, others simply in casks which had aged dry or sweet oloroso. The whisky for the American casks was far paler and more buttery. From a cask where no wine had fermented the whisky had a really toasty 'chardonnay malt' character. The Spanish oak whiskies were dark and markedly fruity. The wood seemed to affect the whiskies far more than the fact that the cask had contained a little sweet wine as well as dry oloroso. American oak simply did not have the same effect. It is not a conclusion that can bring much comfort to malt whisky producers who rely on the rich, fruity flavours derived from Spanish sherry casks.</p>

			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Tootal attacks Coats over its 'failed acquisition' strategy TOOTAL, the textile group battling against a Pounds 252m takeover bid from Coats Viyella, yesterday attacked its suitor for its 'failed acquisition strategy' and 'record of commercial failure'. Coats, which last week announced its second and final offer of 83.3p per share, dismissed Tootal's claims as a 'misrepresentation' of its strategy and 'deliberate use of incomplete information'. The battle between Coats and Tootal, which two years ago agreed terms for a Pounds 395m friendly merger, has become increasingly bitter in the two months since Coats unveiled its first offer. In a document posted to shareholders yesterday Tootal attacked Coats' commercial record. It claimed that reported profits from each of Coats' textile divisions have 'fallen sharply' since 1987 and that a number of its businesses have 'serious commercial problems'. Tootal also criticised Coats for providing 'inadequate information' on the profitability of its South American operations and questioned its method of accounting for its interests in the region. Similarly it attacked Coats' acquisition record saying it had spent more than Pounds 1bn on acquisitions between 1982 and 1986, but that its market capitalisation was just Pounds 644m before the Tootal bid. Coats, which has already attacked Tootal's record and accountancy practises, is reorganising its European interests by transfering thread production from Austria to Italy and Portugal. This should save Pounds 2m in a full financial year and produce Pounds 2.5m in surplus asset realisations this year. Coats is also investing Pounds 1.5m in a new zip plant in Portugal.</p>

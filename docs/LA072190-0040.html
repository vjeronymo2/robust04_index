			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE SAYS GIRL, 7, WAS RAPED, LIFTS LICENSE OF FOSTER HOME  </P> <P> The foster home license of a Whittier couple has been revoked by an  administrative law judge who ruled that the foster father had sexual  intercourse with a 7-year-old girl in the home and that the foster mother was  aware of the molestation, the state Department of Social Services said Friday.  </P> <P> The case of the Steve and Becky Brown foster home, which was closed this  spring, is one more symptom of the troubles in Los Angeles County's children's  services system, according to Lawrence Bolton, assistant chief counsel with the  state agency.  </P> <P> No criminal charges have been filed against the Browns and the couple insist  that they are innocent. Becky Brown refused to comment Thursday on the  revocation of the couple's license.  </P> <P> The announced ruling in the Brown case followed Thursday's resignation of  Robert L. Chaffee, director of the Los Angeles County Department for Children's  Services.  </P> <P> Chaffee stepped down from his post amid mounting criticism of his agency,  pressure from the County Board of Supervisors and disclosures that top  department officials ignored warnings of their investigators about the alleged  physical and sexual abuse of foster children.  </P> <P> Bolton said that in the Brown case, Children's Services officials delayed an  investigation into a molestation complaint for two months last spring before he  prevailed on them to look into the matter.  </P> <P> However, Children's Services workers involved in the investigation maintained  that the case was handled properly.  </P> <P> Four sisters had been removed from the Brown home in February, 1989, after  medical examinations indicated that three of them had been sexually molested.  Both the Browns and the family of the children were suspected, but no one was  charged and the Browns continued to operate their foster home.  </P> <P> Social worker Deborah Laurita, who has since resigned from the department, said  she became convinced that one of the children, then 7, implicated Steve Brown,  but that Children's Services officials refused to conduct a further  investigation.  </P> <P> Laurita noted in her departmental log on April 24, 1989, that her request for  an investigation into the youngster's allegation of abuse was refused.  </P> <P> "I called Marcia Trowbridge (a supervisor in the foster home investigative  unit)," wrote Laurita, "and explained the allegations about the molest and Ms.  Trowbridge told me that this case goes so high up that she would not  investigate. I argued that the allegations were pretty serious since there were  still two kids there (in the Brown home), but she still refused to  investigate."  </P> <P> Trowbridge on Friday denied making such comments to Laurita.  </P> <P> "I did not say that to her," Trowbridge told The Times. "We investigated that  case very thoroughly." Another source familiar with the investigation also said  the case was handled properly and there was no interference from superiors.  </P> <P> When the investigation ordered by Bolton was finally conducted, officials said  they found no justification for closing the Browns' home. But county social  workers continued to be suspicious of Steve Brown and recommended that the  sisters who were removed from the home last year be placed with their  relatives. Over the objections of social workers, however, a juvenile court  judge made the Browns guardians of one of the girls, a 3-year-old. That child  has been removed from the couple's home but the Browns are seeking to regain  guardianship.  </P> <P> The Browns' foster home was closed this spring based on medical evidence and  new statements by the 7-year-old sister, who is now 8.  </P> <P> The Browns agreed to give up their foster care license but state officials say  the agreement was never signed. At that point, the state asked an  administrative law judge to revoke the license and a hearing was held earlier  this month. The Browns did not attend or refute the evidence of molestation  that was presented.  </P> <P> Chaffee was not accepting news media calls Friday.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, his resignation -- although lauded by child advocates who have been  saying for weeks that a change of leadership was needed -- has left the  department under a cloud of uncertainty.  </P> <P> There are questions about whether other top officials may resign, whether an  interim director can be brought in quickly or if Chaffee will remain through  the fall, and what effect the shake-up will have on the state's attempt to take  over the county's $457-million child welfare services system. The supervisors  are expected to discuss these issues Tuesday.  </P> <P> At least one supervisor, Mike Antonovich, has called for a "top to bottom"  reorganization of the agency, including the removal of Chaffee's "top  lieutenants." On Friday, children's services workers said they were wondering  who will be next to leave.  </P> <P> "Things are very up in the air," said Patti Kamoto, a licensing worker in the  department. "Maybe people sensed it was coming for the last few months but I  think that people are wondering who else is going to be involved in this and  what's really going to happen from here on out."  </P> <P> "People are basically relieved," said Penny Steinberg, a supervising social  worker in the agency's West Los Angeles office. She said workers were  "demoralized" and had lost faith in their superiors.  </P> <P> While Chaffee has pledged to stay until Oct. 31, Supervisor Ed Edelman intends  to press for an immediate replacement. If Chaffee's deputies also resign, that  could leave the department without an experienced in-house manager to replace  him until a successor is found.  </P></p>

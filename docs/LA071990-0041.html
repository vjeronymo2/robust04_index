			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOU ASKED ABOUT: MORCILLA SAUSAGE IN SPANISH MARKETS  </P> <P> Question: I have an interest in a sausage called morcilla. It is listed as an  ingredient in several Spanish recipes. However, I have been unable to find any.  </P> <P> Answer: According to "The Von Welanetz Guide to Ethnic Ingredients" (Warner  Books, 1987) by Diana and Paul Von Welanetz, "This Spanish type of blood  sausage is called Murcela in Portugal. It can be found in Spanish and  Latin-American markets, and there are variations: the Andalusian contains  marjoram, rice and almonds; the Portuguese is flavored with cumin."  </P> <P> In response to the May 31 You Asked About . . . . column on pickled asparagus  tips, Loretto J. Hulse, a staff writer at the Tri-City Herald in Tri-Cities,  Wash., sent the following recipe, developed several years ago by the Washington  asparagus growers. It's very popular in her area.  </P> <P> PICKLED ASPARAGUS  </P> <P> 6 to 8 pounds fresh asparagus  </P> <P> 6 sprigs fresh dill weed  </P> <P> 6 small cloves garlic  </P> <P> 6 bay leaves  </P> <P> 1 1/2 teaspoons mustard seeds  </P> <P> 1 1/2 teaspoons red pepper flakes, optional  </P> <P> 3 cups vinegar  </P> <P> 3 cups water  </P> <P> 1/3 cup pickling salt  </P> <P> Wash asparagus in cold water. Trim length so that spears are no higher than 1/2  inch from top of pint canning jar.  </P> <P> In each of 6 clean pint-size canning jars that have been kept immersed in hot  water or 150-degree oven, place 1 dill sprig, 1 garlic clove, 1 bay leaf, 1/4  teaspoon mustard seeds and 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes. Pack asparagus  spears, tips down, into jars as tightly as possible, leaving 1/2 inch head  space.  </P> <P> Bring vinegar, water and salt to boil in saucepan, stirring until salt  dissolves. Ladle brine over asparagus, leaving 1/4 inch head space. Wipe jar  rims with clean cloth. Cover with lids, prepared according to manufacturer's  directions.  </P> <P> Process 10 minutes in boiling water bath. Remove and cool in draft-free place  12 hours. Check seals. Store in cool dark place. For best flavor, store 6 weeks  before opening. Makes 6 pints.  </P></p>

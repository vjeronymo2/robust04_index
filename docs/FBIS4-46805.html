			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Vagram Stepanyan report on briefing given by Babken </F> Ararktsyan, chairman of the Supreme Council of the Republic of  Armenia, on 30 May: "Difficult Summer: Six Weeks To Go Before  the Start of the Parliamentary Recess"]    [Text] The start of summer is expected to be quite tense  and strenuous for the Supreme Council of Armenia both in the  sphere of the establishment of interparliamentary relations and  in law-making activity itself, Babken Ararktsyan, chairman of  the Supreme Council of the Republic of Armenia, promised at the  start of his briefing on 30 May. Turning to the business of the  current, eighth, session of parliament, he noted that in the  upcoming six weeks of business the Supreme Council intended to  discuss two most important matters: the Constitution of Armenia  and the law on elections to the Supreme Council of the Republic  of Armenia. He expressed the hope here that parliament would  comprehensively consider and discuss all the drafts of the  future basic law that had been presented. The speaker observed  in this connection that such discussions afforded the  opportunity for compromise and that, were difficulties to arise,  a conciliation commission, which would study the versions of the  draft constitution, would, most likely, be formed. Even if these  discussions produce no results, they will at least have been of  the nature of a useful debate.    Then, having noted a number of serious tasks geared to  implementation of economic reforms in the republic that are to  be accomplished in the course of the current session, Babken  Ararktsyan familiarized the journalists in greater detail with  the Supreme Council's upcoming work on the development of  interparliamentary relations, detailing the planned visits and  meetings. Specifically, a session of the CIS Interparliamentary  Assembly Council will be held on 8 June in St. Petersburg. The  12 items on the forum's agenda include also the question of a  peaceful settlement of the Karabakh conflict, which will be  presented by M. Shirimkulov, leader of the assembly's  peacekeeping group and chairman of the parliament of Kyrgyzstan.  As Mr. Ararktsyan announced, there has been a positive solution  of the question of the participation of members of parliament of  the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic in the discussion of this  question, which is in keeping with the letter and spirit of the  Bishkek Protocol. He noted also that it is thanks to such forums  that the question of a settlement of the Karabakh conflict has  acquired a qualitatively new path of solution.    At the end of the assembly session the chairman of the  Supreme Council of Armenia will at the invitation of Ivan  Rybkin, chairman of the State Duma of Russia, leave for an  official visit to Moscow. In the course of the visit it is  planned to sign an agreement on interparliamentary cooperation  and also a number of other important documents. The next plenary  session of the parliamentary assembly of the participants in  Black Sea Economic Cooperation will take place 20-22 June in  Bucharest, and at the start of July a parliamentary delegation  of the Republic of Armenia will participate in a session of the  CSCE Interparliamentary Assembly in Vienna.</p>

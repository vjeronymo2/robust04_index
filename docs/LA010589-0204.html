			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> PROKOFIEV'S WIDOW DIES  </P> <P> Carolina Prokofiev, widow of the celebrated Russian composer Serge Prokofiev,  has died of cancer in London, her son said today. She was 91.  </P> <P> Carolina Prokofiev, who survived a Soviet prison camp, narrated her husband's  classic children's work "Peter and the Wolf" two years ago at Lincoln Center in  New York to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the work. She died Tuesday about  three months after falling ill, said her son, Oleg Prokofiev. In 1948,  Prokofiev was one of the composers denounced by the Stalin government for  writing "bourgeois" music. His wife was accused of having contact with  anti-Soviet elements and was sent to Ubez prison camp in the northern Urals.  Prokofiev died in 1953 and she was freed three years later.  </P></p>

			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Ulster TV interim boost to Pounds 1.8m A 17 per cent increase in advertising revenue boosted Ulster Television's pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.79m in the six months to June 30, compared with Pounds 134,000. Mr John McGuckian, chairman, said the advertising increase was the highest in independent television and had improved its share of the market. He added that despite continued uncertainty over the economy 'the full year should show a revenue increase ahead of the industry average'. Net advertising revenue was Pounds 12.6m (Pounds 10.8m) with total turnover of Pounds 13.5m (Pounds 11.4m). Profits were further boosted by a lower Exchequer Levy of Pounds 90,000 (Pounds 299,000) and higher investment income of Pounds 534,000 (Pounds 382,000). Earnings per share were 10.22p (0.76p) and the interim dividend has been increased from 3.25p to 4.25p. Ulster, which in April appointed Television Sales and Marketing Services to sell its airtime, bid Pounds 1.03m a year in 1993 prices to retain its licence against two rivals. Mr McGuckian said yesterday that preparations for the new 10-year licence period were well advanced including the building of a new studio for a daily one-hour news and information programme at 6pm.</p>

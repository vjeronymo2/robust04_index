			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEA ADVISERS NIX GRANTS AFTER MAPPLETHORPE;  </P> <P> ARTS: $80,000 FOR A UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE IS THREATENED DUE TO THE PHOTO  CONTROVERSY. AND THE NATIONAL COUNCIL ON THE ARTS DEFERS A DECISION ON THEATER  AID.  </P> <P> The advisory body to the National Endowment for the Arts has recommended denial  of two grants totaling $80,000 to the University of Pennsylvania's Institute  for Contemporary Art, which last year was swept up in the controversy over work  by photographer Robert Mapplethorpe.  </P> <P> In a separate action, the National Council on the Arts voted to defer a  decision -- perhaps until August -- on 18 theater grants characterized as  potentially controversial.  </P> <P> The votes were seen by NEA sources as a victory for endowment opponents and as  setting up an even more fractious debate over whether the NEA has caved in to  political pressure.  </P> <P> The decisions, contended one council member, opened divisions within the arts  council, apparently splitting it into two factions.  </P> <P> One includes members who favor clamping down on the content of NEA-funded art.  The second faction contends that the crackdown may destroy the NEA's  traditional strong support for cutting-edge artists.  </P> <P> Jacob Neusner, a conservative member of the national council, characterized the  vote to turn down the two grants to the Pennsylvania institute as "an enormous  victory."  </P> <P> Sources indicated that the recommendation to reject two of three grants to the  ICA may have been invalid because fewer than half of the national council  members were present. Apparently intent on avoiding parliamentary mistakes that  could invalidate council actions, NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer briefly  halted the council meeting on Friday because a quorum was not present.  </P> <P> The action of the National Council on the Arts took place in closed session  Sunday after a weekend open meeting at which council members heard that the  14-month-old political campaign against the NEA has apparently inflicted major  damage.  </P> <P> Details of the secret actions emerged Monday morning. Ironically, in its open  sessions, the council had voted to hold future grant deliberations in public.  </P> <P> The actions came as the NEA faces deterioration in its political support.  Endowment staff members warned the council Friday that opposition may be  insurmountable.  </P> <P> The council was told the NEA's political situation has deteriorated so  significantly -- at least in the House of Representatives -- that it may be  nearly impossible for the agency to undergo renewal of its legislative mandate  to exist this year without Draconian controls being placed on the content of  art it can fund. At the same time, the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies  circulated a proposal to strip the NEA of much of its ability to support  working artists and transfer 60% to 65% of its money to state arts councils.  </P> <P> The vote against ICA was reportedly 6-to-5. The council has a total membership  of 26 but there are three vacancies. The 11 people participating in the ICA  vote fell short of a majority even of the 23-person current membership.  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, sources said, the council voted 8-to-4, with three  abstentions, to defer action on 18 proposed recipients of solo performance  fellowships.  </P> <P> The vote to delay action on the theater fellowships until the next scheduled  meeting of the NEA advisory board in August came after conservative columnists  Rowland Evans and Robert Novak attacked New York performance artist Karen  Finley.  </P> <P> The Evans and Novak column characterized Finley as a "nude, chocolate-smeared  young woman" who would use her $12,000 fellowship to create an offensive and  possibly obscene performance. They contended that other troublesome grants were  about to be approved by the council.  </P> <P> The columnists objected in particular to a performance piece by Finley called  "We Keep Our Victims Ready," a feminist diatribe in which Finley ends up  partially naked, smeared with chocolate intended to simulate cow dung and  festooned with alfalfa sprouts playing the role of sperm.  </P> <P> "I'm prepared for this," she said in a telephone interview of her role in the  controversy. "What I'm doing and thinking about as an artist -- but really  first as an American citizen -- is (that this is) a problem of freedom of  expression. For me as a female it would be outrageous that I am not allowed to  talk about or make work deconstructing feminist imagery and trying to challenge  the fact that there has been oppression of women for generations."  </P> <P> In the closed session, it was learned, four solo performance fellowship  applicants were attacked.  </P> <P> The NEA declined on Monday to confirm details of the council votes on rejected  or deferred grants applications. However, Judith Tannenbaum, assistant director  of the ICA, provided details of all three, concluding that the council action  is "quite terrifying."  </P> <P> Tannenbaum said the rejections are a clear indication the NEA has buckled under  pressure to function as a guarantor that publicly funded artworks will  studiously avoid controversial content. "It's an enormous loss for the cultural  life of the country," Tannenbaum said.  </P> <P> ICA came to prominence in the arts endowment controversy last year as the  organizer of a show of work by Mapplethorpe, who died of AIDS in March, 1989.  ICA received a $15,000 national endowment grant to support the show's  catalogue. When the images emerged as a focal point of the congressional  firestorm over the NEA, the House and Senate voted to require the endowment to  notify Congress specifically whenever a grant for ICA or the Southeastern  Center for Contemporary Art was to be awarded.  </P> <P> SECCA -- ironically headquartered in Winston-Salem about 5 miles from where the  National Council on the Arts met -- was a role-player in the crisis over its  role in organizing a show including a photograph of a crucifix immersed in  urine.  </P> <P> NEA sources said the endowment's museum program recommended approval of three  grants to ICA -- for $40,000 each -- but decided to recommend funding for just  one, though it was not immediately clear which of the three was accepted. The  council's recommendations are not binding on Frohnmayer, who was reported in  Chapel Hill, N.C., on personal business Monday and unavailable.  </P></p>

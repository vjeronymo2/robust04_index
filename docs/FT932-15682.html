			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Japan may halt Cambodia operations over UN deaths THE KILLING of a Japanese volunteer working for the United Nations in Cambodia has brought a warning that Japan could withdraw from the country if attacks on UN personnel increase. Mr Toshio Nakayama, Japan's defence minister, said yesterday that 'if it becomes clear that a widespread armed disruption of the (UN-organised Cambodian) elections is in force, we must of course think of an emergency evacuation or a halt in operations'. About 600 Japanese military personnel are in Cambodia as part of the UN operation. Although the victim, Mr Atsuhito Nakata, 25, was a civilian, his death has prompted concern that Japanese forces could become entangled in an intensifying conflict. Nevertheless, Japan yesterday continued with its planned Cambodian involvement by despatching 250 army engineers to join an advance team of 350 in Bangkok. This force is due to relieve the 600 troops sent six months ago. Mr Nakata was the sixth worker to be killed in nine direct attacks on UN personnel in the past two weeks. His UN-marked car was stopped on Thursday by a group of armed men. His Cambodian interpreter, Mr Lay Sokphip, was also killed. The Khmer Rouge guerrilla group, which is boycotting the UN's peace process, has been blamed for some of the attacks and is suspected of most of the rest. The group denies responsibility. Japan's Social Democratic party, the largest opposition party, yesterday called for the immediate return of the 600 already in Cambodia, mostly transportation personnel, on the grounds that the Cambodian conflict does not fit the guidelines set for Japanese participation in a peacekeeping operation. Under those guidelines, Japanese personnel should not be despatched if a ceasefire agreement has collapsed. The SDP argues that the spate of killings shows the ceasefire is no longer effective. But a sudden pull-out of troops would damage the image of the Japanese government, which sees the participation as evidence that the country is playing a more active role in international affairs. A retreat would also hurt Tokyo's campaign for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Blood stains the peace, Page 4</p>

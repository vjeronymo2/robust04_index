			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Russian Elections: Folks back home tire of Yeltsin - President's vision for Russia's future fails to convince his home village, which has found a new leader President Boris Yeltsin can have found little comfort from his birthplace during yesterday's watershed in Russia's political development. Voters in the isolated village of Butka, 5,000 people nestled in the heart of the Russian Urals, are deeply disillusioned with their most famous native son. 'I was a student in Moscow when Yeltsin left the Communist party, and at that time I was so proud to be from his home town,' said Mr Oleg Sanochkin, the strapping 32-year-old agronomist who works at Butka's state farm. 'But now I am bitter about Yeltsin. I do not like his recent decisions. He has given the Russian village nothing.' Like many in the town, Mr Sanochkin cast his vote for the conservative Agrarian party, because he believes it is the only force that will speak up for the countryside. In the sub-zero weather, Butka's log cabins with sky-blue trimmings make a pretty picture against a landscape of frost-encased forests and snow-covered fields. But the villagers of Butka, who must endure a gruelling four-hour drive over bumpy roads to get to Ekaterinburg, the capital of the region, have no running water in their homes and have seen their purchasing power shrink as the prices of industrial goods have risen. For these reasons, the villagers say they are looking to a new leader, in the form of Mr Eduard Rossel, who yesterday stood as an independent candidate for the upper house of parliament. The popular former governor of the region, he was ousted by Mr Yeltsin in November. 'Our region has found a new hero - Rossel,' Mr Sanochkin says. That is bad news for Mr Yeltsin. The main source of contention between the two men is Mr Rossel's campaign for greater regional autonomy for the Urals, a political objective at loggerheads with Mr Yeltsin's draft constitution, also put to a vote yesterday. But the differences between the two local heroes run deeper. An ethnic German, descended from the Volga Germans, Mr Rossel was left to fend for himself when his mother and grandmother were imprisoned in a Siberian labour camp at the outset of the second world war. The homeless four-year-old boy survived by begging, but Mr Rossel says his memories of a stomach swollen by starvation make him wary of a radical approach to market reforms. Sympathising with these views and full of personal admiration for Mr Rossel, the disgruntled villagers of Butka, and like-minded voters in the region, are likely to elect him to parliament, where he could become a painful thorn in Mr Yeltsin's side. However, the president can take solace from the attitudes of the urban electorate. In heavily-industrialised Ekaterinburg, where Mr Yeltsin reigned as the regional communist boss, voters appeared inclined to support the democratic parties in parliament. According to an exit poll conducted by Interfax at one polling station - which may not be representative - Russia's Choice received 35 per cent of the vote, followed by the Yavlinsky group. Even at a polling station in one of the city's working class neighbourhoods, voters seemed willing to give the democrats a second chance. 'I voted for Russia's choice,' said Andrei, a blue-eyed, 26-year-old chauffeur. 'They have already begun to break things up. We should let them finish doing that and then maybe they will build something new and better.' Decked out in the tracksuit and leather jacket which are the uniform of Russia's nouveau riche, Andrei, who quit his job at a troubled state factory to work for a thriving private concern two years ago, says his life has become better since Russia began the difficult process of shedding its communist skin. Mr Yeltsin will be counting on urban voters like Andrei, who have begun to benefit from reforms, to drown out the discontented voice of the countryside and the pensioners. But, no matter how the parliament shapes up, Mr Yeltsin can take solace from the fact that, if his native Urals were representative of the country as a whole, the crucial referendum on the constitution would go through. On this issue, paradoxically, the impoverished villages are proving to be a trump card for Mr Yeltsin. While voting in some of the cities was sluggish, the more conservative rural areas, where the Soviet tradition of enforced voting has been slower to die, appears to be coming to the constitution's rescue. In Butka for example, election day was a high point in the slow provincial life of the village. A concert was held in the room adjacent to the polling station and, in typical Soviet fashion, foods unavailable on the bare shelves of Butka's only grocery store were on sale at a booth just a few feet from the ballot boxes. Moreover, displaying the contrary impulses of voters the world over, even though they are not too keen on Mr Yeltsin's policies, the people of Butka like the strong-man constitution he has drafted. 'Yeltsin is right. In these times of troubles, Russia needs a strong hand,' says Mr Sanochkin, one of the president's local critics. But, aware of the contradiction in his views, he adds: 'Of course, the only thing Mr Yeltsin's strong hand has done so far is to sack our leader, Rossel.'</p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Book Review: The Community's leap of faith EUROPE. THE STRANGE SUPERPOWER By David Buchan Dartmouth, Pounds 32.50 hb, Pounds 17.50 pb, 182 pages Brussels is a very religious town - less for the church-going zeal of its multinational populace than for the deep faith of those building European political integration. How other than by faith could the latter face the tedious hours dedicated to such arcana as veterinary regulations or the specifications of pressure vessels in industry? The alternative would be serious doubt about the purpose of life. Cecil Parkinson, now a lord but then a British trade minister, once explained the stress of the non-believer after a discussion in Brussels on an obscure trade issue. 'I came into politics enthused by high ideals of freedom, public service and the greater good,' he said. 'I cannot believe I have just spent three hours arguing about tiny import tonnages of Yugoslav baby beef.' The frustrations of a Eurocrat are not dissimilar. But they are lessened by the certainty that building Europe is a crab-like political process. In good times, usually periods of solid economic growth, great leaps can be made towards integration. But the intervening periods comprise daily wars of attrition against states' exercise of their flagging sovereignty. As these imperatives weaken, the ritual battles in Brussels are usually settled through a perpetual and often untidy compromise. Supranational bindings are continuously tightening and, before the century is out, efficiency and democracy will demand a new institutional framework. David Buchan's four years in Brussels as the FT's European Community correspondent, to 1992, were characterised more by leaps forward than crab-like movements. He saw the impressive assembly of the single market and the negotiations on monetary and political union which were crowned by the Maastricht treaty. In this book he has largely dedicated his sceptical eye and skilful pen to the EC's expanding international role, for which Maastricht promises much but may deliver far less. As Buchan reveals, the 12 could not find the political will to invent the institutional mechanisms for a common foreign and security policy. Maastricht commits them to 'joint actions' in some areas of foreign policy. This means, says Buchan, that they will 'deliberately fashion a straitjacket and then put themselves in it'. But a member state is free to refuse the straitjacket if it does not accept a line of action agreed by all. Moreover, it can block joint action altogether because, in principle, the joint action must be approved unanimously. While some majority voting is allowed on matters of implementation, a common foreign and security policy is to be decided essentially by intergovernmental, rather than community, procedures. Buchan captures Jacques Delors' tone of contempt for these formulae. 'First we would have to decide, unanimously, whether the meeting was to be in Warsaw, Budapest or Prague. Then we would have to agree whether we were going by plane. Lunch? We would need an opt-out for vegetarians. No doubt we could use majority voting to decide where the smoking and non-smoking sections should be.' Alongside this uncommon approach to making foreign policy, courtesy of Maastricht, is a promise of the development of a European 'defence identity'. It is to come via a reinvigorated Western European Union, whose tasks, Buchan points out, remain to be invented. He suggests one possible area for its operations might be eastern Europe 'to intervene to quell some ethnic dispute between, say, Czechs and Slovaks or Hungarians and Romanians, that threatened to send refugees flooding into the EC'. In view of its handling of the Yugoslav crisis - well reviewed by Buchan, who deems it 'a tragic failure' - the EC will need to discover more common purpose. Moreover, the Germans need to resolve their constitutional impediments to military action - before the WEU can be a credible instrument. External pressures are pushing Europe in that direction. A sense that moves towards greater integration are, in part, a dynamic response to external political and economic pressures is strangely missing from Buchan's analysis. His is much more a book on what Europe is doing than why Europe is doing it. Here Buchan shares a weakness of the Brussels perspective, which tends to assume wider public understanding of EC purposes and procedures than actually exists. Such presumption has been exposed by the less than ecstatic reaction to Maastricht. Buchan accepts the conventional wisdom that this response is the result of politicians pushing integration too fast for their electorates. But perhaps the political failure is of a different order. Maastricht's proposed economic and monetary union is a supranational leap which has had to be mediated through national political systems. Few leaders have found the courage to justify it as an appropriate response to the nation state's diminishing power to deal alone with global economic challenges. The value of this book is that it pulls together a great deal of information about the EC's relations with the world and presents it in a readable form. It is hard to disagree with Buchan's conclusion that Europe will become both wider through enlargement and deeper through a form of political federation. The latter may be unwelcome to many Britons. Yet the F-word could well promise the full expression of all that is best of national values in Europe  -humanism, tolerance, democracy - while steadily undermining the worst - such as ethnic rivalry, territorial aggrandisement and the struggle for power. As of now Europe is, indeed, a strange superpower. But it will become a more normal one. The pressure of world events will make it so.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: Chicago opens Euromark futures and options pits THE Chicago Mercantile Exchange yesterday opened three-month Euromark futures and options pits, aiming to compete with Liffe in London which so far this year has traded more than 6m Euromark futures and maintains open interest at 500,000 contracts. But CME traders believe they can take a slice of the market by capitalising on their options trading expertise and by offering the Chicago version of Euromark derivatives on the Globex electronic trading system through the Asian-Pacific business day. Using Globex, CME Euromark products will be open for either floor or electronic trading nearly 20 hours a day. First-day volume - at 1,279 futures and 1,279 options traded in the pit, and 100 contracts traded on Globex - was modest. The Euromarks are the latest weapon to be wielded in the battle for market share between Chicago and London. As the D-Mark increasingly dominates world foreign exchange trading, Euromark derivatives are growing in volume. Some traders feel Liffe's Euromark futures volume could surpass the CME's Eurodollar turnover, which has been averaging more than 5m contracts a month for a notional value of more than Dollars 5,000bn.</p>

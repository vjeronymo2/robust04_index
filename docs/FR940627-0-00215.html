			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (v)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Verification procedures. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (A) The entire system used to dilute and transport whole combustion emissions ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , from exhaust pipe to outlet in the biological testing chamber) shall be verified before any animal exposures begin, and verified at least weekly during testing. (See procedures at 40 CFR 86.119&hyph;90 for light-duty vehicles and &sect;86.1319&hyph;90 for heavy-duty engines.) Verification testing shall be accomplished by introducing a known sample at the end of the vehicle/engine exhaust pipe into the dilution system and measuring the amount exiting the system. For example, an injected hydrocarbon sample could be detected with a gas chromatograph (GC) and flame ionization detector (FID) to determine the recovery factor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Verification of the integrity of the mixing chamber (or alternative apparatus) shall be determined before animal exposures begin and at least weekly thereafter. Composite values for weight percent total hydrocarbons shall be determined for the test vehicle/engine's dilute exhaust stream entering and exiting the mixing chamber apparatus. These values must be within 10 percent of each other. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Emission exposure quality control. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (A) The tester shall incorporate the additional quality assurance and safety procedures outlined in &sect;79.61(d) to control variability of emissions during the generation of exposure emissions during health effect testing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) These procedures include requirements that the mean exposure concentration in the inhalation test chamber shall be within 10 percent of the target concentration (established in the developmental phase of testing) on 90 percent or more of exposure days and that daily monitoring of CO, CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and total hydrocarbons in the exposure chamber shall be required. Analysis of the particle size distribution shall also be performed to establish the stability and consistency of particle size distribution in the test exposure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) The testing facility shall allow an audit of its premises, the qualifications, e.g., curriculum vitae, of its staff assigned to testing, and the specimens and records of the testing for registration purposes (as specified in &sect;79.60). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vii) In order to allow for unforeseen problems with the emission generation or dilution equipment, emission generation may be interrupted for up to four hours on a maximum of two occasions in any four-week period of testing. The amount of time for which emission generation was interrupted shall subsequently be added after the equipment problem is corrected. If the equipment problem causes more than four consecutive hours of emission generation to be interrupted, or if more than two such occasions occurs in any four-week period during testing, the interrupted tests shall be void. Testers shall be aware of concerns for backup vehicles/engines cited in paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Generating particulate and semi-volatile emissions for biological testing. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (i) Salmonella mutagenicity testing, pursuant to &sect;79.68, shall be conducted on extracts of the particulate and semi-volatile emission phases separately. These emissions shall be generated by operating the test vehicle/engine over the appropriate FTP driving cycle (see paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section) and collected and analyzed according to methods described in 40 CFR 86.1301 through 1344 (further information on this subject may be found in Perez,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  CRC Report No. 551, 1987 listed in &sect;79.57(g)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Particulate emissions shall be collected on particulate filters and extracted from the collection equipment for use in biological tests. The particulate emissions from all segments of the FTP or from multiple FTP cycles may be collected on one or more filters, as necessary. The time spent collecting sufficient quantities of the test substances in emissions samples will vary, depending on the emission characteristics of the engine and fuel or additive/base fuel mixture and on the requirements of the biological test protocol. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Semi-volatile emissions shall be collected immediately downstream from the particulate collection filters using porous polymer resin beds, or their equivalent, designed for their capture. Semi-volatile phase emissions shall be collected on one apparatus. The time spent collecting sufficient quantities of the test substances in emissions samples will vary, depending on the emission characteristics of the engine and fuel or additive/base fuel mixture and on the requirements of the biological test protocol. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The extraction method shall be determined by the specifications of the biological test for which the emissions are used. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Particulate and semi-volatile emission storage requirements are as specified in &sect;79.57(e)(1)(iv). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Particulate and semi-volatile phase emission collection, handling and extraction methods shall not alter the composition of the collected material, to the extent possible. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The bomb was planted in a Vespa scooter  parked near the office of the Deputy Commissioner, South.    Eyewitnesses said the police activity and presence of the  mobile control room of the fire brigade in the court prior to  the explosion showed that the administration had information  about planting of the bomb.    "I was in the court stamp office around 12:15 pm when I  heard  a big explosion and felt as if the building was going to cave in  and my ears kept buzzing for a few minutes", Nastz Rizwan,  Advocate, told THE NEWS. He said after few seconds several other  explosions of mild intensity were heard compelling him to remain  in the office.    By the time three fire brigades reached the scene, most of  the motorcycles had already been gutted. The splinters of the  bomb as well as pieces of Vespa broke the window panes and went  high to the top of a multi-storey building across the road.    "SDM airport, Iqbal Scomro, had arrived minutes before the  explosion and was talking to chauffeur of the chief secretary  when the explosion took place and we were hit by heavy objects",  said guard of the SDM, Haider Abhas, at the Civil Hospital.    Ameer Abdullah, a policeman who was also injured, said he  was  going to the court after when the device exploded and an object  hit at his right shoulder, "I fell unconscious and know nothing  what happened later,", he said. Another injured Bahauddin, an  aged Baloch, was hit by an heavy object while sitting behind the  stamp office. He was sitting about half a furlong from the  parking lot. His condition was stated to be unstable.    Other injured were identified as (Mumtazur) Rehman, an army  personnel, Nasir Khan, Abdul Rehman, Taufeeq Moin, Mohammad  Aslam, Mohammad Musaddiq and Abdul Rehman who were treated and  discharged from the Civil Hospital.    The Incharge of the Bomb Disposal Service, Moinuddin, said:  "It was 400 grams of Russian made TNT explosive covered with  steel splinters and attached with a console timer of  approximately 30-minute."    The timer was also Russian-made, but the current detonator  could be home-made which was attached with a 9-volt battery, he  added.    When asked DSP [Deputy Inspector of Police] Eidgah, Chaudhri  Mohammad Ashraf, said: "The incident seems to be connected with  the recent incident of Larkana." SDM Arambagh, Raeesuddin  Piracha, who was also holding the charge of Eidgah Sub-Division,  said hands of AZO [Al-Zulfiqar Organization) and RAW [Research  and Analysis Wing] could not be ruled out.    The DIG [Deputy Inspector General] Karachi, Rahood Khan  Brohi, however, said: "We cannot say anything as the matter was  yet to be investigated. Special teams have been formed under  the supervision of the area DSP [Deputy Superintendent of  Police] which will be assisted by the CIA. [Crime Investigation  Agency]"    He denied any arrest in this connection so far and said  hopefully the investigators would reach a conclusion after the  microscopic examination of the splinters and pieces of the Vespa.</p>

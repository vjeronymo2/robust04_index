			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUGGING AN IMAGINARY COAST EAST COAST/WEST COAST BY PATRICK DOUGLAS (DONALD I.  FINE: $18.95; 418 PP.; 1-55611-098-7)  </P> <P> In "Eureka," his jubilant essay on living in Los Angeles, John Gregory Dunne  pointed out, not without a certain handsome relish, that people in Los Angeles  no longer cared all that much about what was going on back East. Not only had  their inferiority complex vanished entirely, but so, becomingly, had their  hostility. Whatever people in New York might choose to suppose, no one in Los  Angeles took seriously the idea, which, in any case, might as well have come  straight out of a B-Western, that America wasn't big enough for both cities to  coexist in, much less that California's own success required as its vindictive  corollary the economic or cultural collapse of the Boston-to-Washington  corridor. "There it was," Dunne wrote, "the canker, the painful sore of  reciprocity: Los Angeles was indifferent to New York."  </P> <P> Dunne was writing in 1978, when it already seemed safe to assume, in California  any way, that all that tired oppositional thinking would soon be put to rest.  The East Coast and the West Coast had never been two states of consciousness in  the first place, but rather, as if that weren't enough, two very different  areas of the country with all the distinctions as well, of course, as the  commonalities, that places 3,000 miles apart with different histories and  different economic interests can be expected to have. Unfortunately, it seems  that old cliches, like old resentments, die hard.  </P> <P> In "East Coast/West Coast," Patrick Douglas, a free-lance writer from South  Carolina, now transplanted to San Francisco, has given them their fullest and  most tendentious airing since Woody Allen indulged his New York prejudices on  the subject in all their venomous ignorance in his fim, "Annie Hall." Douglas,  of course, comes down firmly on the side of California in this pointless  contest, but in his vulgarity and simple-mindedness he very much resembles  Allen or any of the countless New York pseudo-wits who have had so much fun  trashing California.  </P> <P> In Douglas' recapitulation, the East Coast is home of rationality, elitism, and  old-fashioned Eurocentrism. "Being older," Douglas writes in his breathy,  portentious way, "the East Coast shares Europe's sense of history, of human  frailty and human folly." In contrast, Californians are -- predictably, since  the stereotype hasn't changed since at least the nineteen-twenties -- imbued  with a receptiveness to the new, a belief in the boundlessness of possibility  and the inherent benignity of change, and an affinity for the intuitive and for  the mystical. It is surely no accident that Douglas locates the center of this  new way of thinking in the northern rather than the southern part of the state,  for his is a view of California that might conceivably make sense at an Esalen  weekend but has little to do with a morning on the floor of the Pacific Stock  Exchange, let alone on any sweatshop floor along Los Angeles Street in the  garment center.  </P> <P> Even Douglas' description of life in California is peculiar in the extreme. At  one point, he contrasts life on the East and West Coasts and observes that West  Coast residents are "like a leisure class that, free from the business of  earning a living, is inclined to wonder what it all means." Elsewhere, Douglas  asserts that on the East Coast, "a person's life is often largely predetermined  -- by social class, education, custom and so on. On the West Coast, there are  few such constraints. How should a person spend his life? is a question that  inevitably arises." Tell that to a high school kid in Compton, or, for that  matter, a clerical worker in the Valley. Douglas is so infatuated with his  generalizations that he never pauses to ask himself whether they apply or not  to real Californians as well as to the idea of California that he entertains so  mechanically.  </P> <P> The problem with an essentially metaphoric description of reality of the type  that Douglas offers is that it so easily drives thinking into abstraction and  pointless speculation. Had Douglas been content to look at the degree to which  California's coming of age is changing American politics and American culture,  he might have written a useful if scarcely an original book. After all, that  theme has been treated well by a number of recent books, notably Joel Kotkin  and Yoriko Kishimoto's "The Third Century," as well as regularly in such  important magazines as the Los Angeles-based New Perspectives Quarterly.  </P> <P> Douglas is after bigger game. He genuinely believes that California represents  a new stage of human consciousness, and, imprisoned in his metaphor, he goes so  far as to argue that the difference between the East and West Coasts is  analogous to the right brain/left brain dichotomy in neurology. Here, "East  Coast/West Coast" goes off the rails entirely, but even before Douglas has run  his book aground on the shoals of parapsychology, it is clear that he is more  interested in what might be true, or what he would like to be true, than in  what he can describe.  </P> <P> California deserves better. There is a real transformation of American culture  going on all around us; and if Los Angeles has not necessarily supplanted New  York, it has become one of the great capital cities of our increasingly  polycentric world. Those are the questions that are worth pondering. That is  the California that needs to be confronted by writers and thinkers. What we do  not need is the kind of potted history and mystical gobbledygook so perfectly  exemplified by "East Coast/West Coast."  </P></p>

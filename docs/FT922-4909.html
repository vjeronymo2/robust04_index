			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / International Company News: Total chairman sets out benefits from sale of stake THE FRENCH government's decision to reduce its direct stake in Total, the oil company, will give the group valuable extra freedom, but its new relationship with the government has yet to be defined, Mr Serge Tchuruk, group chairman, said yesterday. The move, expected to raise up to FFr10bn (Dollars 1.85bn) to fund the government's employment policies, would make it easier for Total to raise fresh equity capital in the future, would improve its image among foreign investors, and reassure potential business partners, he said. In the past, Total's ability to issue new shares had suffered because the financially hard-pressed state wanted to keep its 34 per cent ownership level unchanged but could not always afford to subscribe to rights issues, Mr Tchuruk told a shareholders' meeting. 'In the US or the UK, the fact of being state-owned or state-controlled, in the eyes of analysts is a handicap,' he added. The state share sale 'will be appreciated on this point'. Potential business partners were sometimes worried about the state's control, he added. However, just how much control the state will exert at Total remains fully to be defined, he admitted. The government has indicated that it wants to retain the right to choose the chairman and the main administrators, as well as to vet international agreements. How Total's relations with the state would be 'clarified' was still under discussion, said Mr Tchuruk. The share sale is to take place as soon as the new relationship between Total and the government has been agreed and when market conditions permit.</p>

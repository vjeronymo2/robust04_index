			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange: Nafta vote helps the dollar PRESIDENT Clinton's narrow triumph over Nafta was the cause for some movement in the dollar yesterday, even though the markets had assumed a success for the administration on the trade deal ahead of the congress vote, writes Rachel Johnson. In early trading, the D-Mark continued its slide against other European currencies and the dollar, even though further falls were arrested by the decision of the Bundesbank not to reduce either of the key lending rates at its regular meeting. It held fire and announced that its next two-week tender would be set at 6 1/4 per cent, a cut of four basis points from the lowest rate of 6.29 per cent in this week's pact. The German discount rate remains at 5 3/4 per cent and the Lombard emergency financing rate at 6 3/4 per cent. The cut in the repo rate provided the cue for the dollar's high for the day of DM1.7146, after a previous close of DM1.7050. There was resistance to any rise above that level and it closed in London at DM1.7110. In New York it finished at DM1.7133. 'That should set the floor for the time being,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank, the US bank. 'Now the main speculation is about a cut in French rates.' The French had been using currency strength to rebuild their reserves, but it now appears that the franc was resilient enough to weather a cut in French interest rates. After a high of FFr3.4580 against the D-Mark, the French currency finished in London at FFr3.4610, up from FFr3.4720. The dollar drifted down after the Bundesbank's moves, reflecting the fact that the Nafta decision had been well anticipated in the market. The release of weekly US unemployment figures did not manage to boost the dollar any more than the trade deal, although expectations of a reduction in German interest rates next month and improving US economic data will keep expectations about the US currency rosy. The dollar's performance against the yen was not particularly affected by the Nafta outcome. Although the currency was helped by the news, dealers waited to see what Mr Clinton would say to the Japanese prime minister. Today, Mr Clinton meets Asia-Pacific economic forum leaders to discuss the lifting of trade barriers and reduction of surpluses with Japan and China. His success with Nafta could help to accelerate a trade agreement with Japan. As Japan holds a Dollars 50bn trade surplus with Washington, any success in these talks should help the dollar against the yen. In London, the release of a mixed bag of economic data in the form of a sharp fall in unemployment and weak credit figures left sterling generally firm. Against the D-Mark, the pound benefited from the Bundesbank's decision to cut the repurchase rate, closing at DM2.5275 after a previous DM2.5175. Sterling was unchanged against the dollar at Dollars 1.4770.</p>

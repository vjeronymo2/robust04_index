			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 7 Feb (MENA)--The Secretariat General of the  Arab Lawyers Union strongly denounced the barbaric massacre  committed by the Serb forces against Bosnia's Muslims in  Sarajevo. It stressed that the massacre was the logical result  of Europe's failure and U.S. reluctance to fulfill commitments  toward areas of conflict.    In a statement today, the union said the massacre is  consistent with undeclared intentions that are devoted to the  ethnic liquidation and cleansing about which some countries are  keeping silent. It also perpetuates several violations  perpetrated by the Serb forces against innocent citizens, which  were also ignored by the decisionmakers in the new world order.    The statement added that the massacre, which took place at  the same time as the meeting of the UN Human Rights Committee in  Geneva, highlights the Serbs' complete disregard for  international legitimacy and human rights.</p>

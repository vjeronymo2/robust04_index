			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Other commenters said that a greater distance on slopes should not be required when employees are working to the side of each other, pointing out that the Alaska logging standard allows this (Ex. 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). OSHA believes that the final standard is consistent with the Alaska logging standard. The final rule only requires that a greater distance is required on any slope where rolling or sliding of trees or logs is reasonably foreseeable. Nothing in the final rule requires a greater distance on slopes when there is no danger that an employee could be hit by a rolling or sliding log. For example, when employees work side by side on a slope, rather than uphill and downhill from each other, there is no danger that the employee will be injured by a rolling log.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At paragraph (d)(6)(iii), OSHA is requiring that each employee, without exception, be located within visual or audible contact of another worker. This provision must be read in conjunction with the requirements in paragraph (d)(7) specifying what methods of audible contact may be used (i.e., not chain-saw engine noise). This requirement parallels the proposed standard, however the proposed rule did not apply this requirement to motor vehicle operators, watchmen and other single employee assignment jobs. The pulpwood logging standard required that employees work within the vocal range of other loggers but also allowed employers to use an alternative procedure that provided for periodic checks of employee welfare.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Much of the comment on this requirement has already been discussed in the Major Issues section above. Some commenters opposed various aspects of this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;67, 5&hyph;70, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92; Tr. W1 65). One commenter recommended allowing manual fellers to be out of contact with other employees, such as skidder operators, for up to 20 minutes (Ex. 5&hyph;54). This commenter said that was the amount of time necessary to transport a load to the landing and return to the cutting area. However, the commenter has not provided any information or data to support why such an exception would still allow for adequate protection for fellers. OSHA does not believe that permitting periods of time in which contact is not maintained will provide adequate protection for employees. A chain-saw operator who severely cuts himself could bleed to death within 20 minutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commenters opposed this provision because it would be difficult to comply with this requirement and maintain the required two tree-length separation between adjacent work areas (Ex. 5&hyph;29, Tr. W1 pg 65). For several reasons, OSHA believes employers will be able to comply with both requirements. First, this paragraph requires each employee to be within visual or audible contact with ``another'' employee. It does not require that the person with whom contact is maintained be in an adjacent work area. Second, the provision requiring at least two tree-length spacing between adjacent occupied work areas is intended to prevent trees from falling from one work area into another. The purposes of a visual or audible contact is to provide a method for employees to remain in contact in case of an emergency (e.g., a chain-saw operator requesting first aid after being cut by the saw, an employee alerting others of severe weather approaching). Therefore, if employees are provided with radio communication, it would be possible for employees whose work areas are spaced far apart to maintain contact with each other.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, as discussed above in the issues section, the final rule does not require that visual contact be maintained. Instead, audible contact may be maintained by the use of horns, whistles or radio communication. As such, employees can be great distances from each other and still remain in contact satisfying the requirements of this provision. Fourth, OSHA is also aware that many logging establishments are currently using radio communication to maintain contact, that is the best evidence of its effectiveness. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

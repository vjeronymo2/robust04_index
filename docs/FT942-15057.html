			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Berlusconi moves on Fininvest Mr Silvio Berlusconi, who is most likely to be Italy's next prime minister, has made the first move to distance himself from his Fininvest business empire by altering plans for the flotation of his publishing interests and accepting the principle of a majority stake being in public hands. Mr Berlusconi described the move to sell up to 53 per cent of shares in his Mondadori publishing group, once combined with Silvio Berlusconi Editore (Sbe) his other publishing interests, as ' a considerable sacrifice'. Until now Mr Berlusconi has always insisted on having majority, if not absolute, control of his companies. Only two of the more than 300 Fininvest companies - Mondadori and Standa stores group - are quoted and both these were acquisitions. Publishing accounts for some 20 per cent of Finvest's business, Europe's second largest media empire. Mr Berlusconi would still be able to exercise control of Mondadori and it would be surprising if he did not seek a friendly shareholder to guarantee such control. But Mr Fidele Confalonieri, Fininvest chairman since Mr Berlusconi stepped down to take up politics, insisted this was an important symbolic step. Financial analysts saw the decision as a necessary move to reorganise Fininvest's publishing side with an annual turnover of L1,900bn (Pounds 790m) and reduce the empire's debt which topped L3,800bn in 1993. The new floatation plans, cleared with Consob, the Milan bourse watch-dog late on Friday, could raise close to L1,000bn for Fininvest - nearly one-third more than the original plan drawn up last year. The complex scheme involves the unscrambling of plans which began with a reverse take-over by the non-quoted Sbe of the bigger Mondadori. Although Mondadori's 1993 turnover of L1,787bn was six times greater than Sbe, the latter last year raised its stake to 98 per cent in Mondadori. This was to allow quotation of all Mr Berlusconi's publishing interests and have the Berlusconi name on the Milan stock exchange. With Mr Berlusconi likely to head the next government it was considered better to use only the Mondadori name.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh, May 12 (AFP) -- Cambodia's King Norodom  Sihanouk said Thursday that new blood tests by French doctors  here showed he had "very, very serious health problems"  indicating that he would die shortly.    "I have no future because I am going to die very soon," a  distressed King Sihanouk told reporters at the Royal Palace.    French doctors who took the blood samples sent the tests to  the king's doctors at Beijing Hospital.    "The results are not good," the king said. "The doctors in  China told me, 'You have a problem. The cancer is still  threatening your life.'"    King Sihanouk, 71, has been undergoing chemotherapy and  radiation therapy in Beijing since October following the  discovery and removal of a malignant tumor near his prostate  gland. The cancer has since spread to his bone marrow.    The king, a mild diabetic, also said the tests showed he has  an accumulation of fat around his liver and continuing problems  with arteriosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries.    King Sihanouk was originally scheduled to return to China on  June 2, but he said that he was moving up his departure two  weeks to May 18, in frustration at the bickering of politicians  here and his inability to solve the Cambodian conflict after  UN-sponsored elections last year.    "It is true that I have very, very serious health problems,  so .... I prefer to go now to Beijing because I am not happy  with politicians here," he said.</p>

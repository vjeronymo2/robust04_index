			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / World Trade News: C&amp;W may revise Irish offer Cable and Wireless(C&amp;W), the British telecoms company, says it will probably have to revise its offer for a minority stake in Ireland's state Telecom Eireann, following the government's decision earlier this year to invite other bids for a joint venture with Telecom. Mr James Ross, C&amp;W's chief executive, in Dublin to talk to institutional fund managers, said C&amp;W was keen to establish a tie-up with TE. But its proposal, made three months ago to the Irish government to take a minority stake in Telecom Eireann through a new joint venture, 'should probably be put aside' in favour of a revised offer, since the decision to invite other bids. The offer is thought to be worth up to IPounds 500m (Dollars 742.5m). C&amp;W's interest would be to develop TE's customer service.</p>

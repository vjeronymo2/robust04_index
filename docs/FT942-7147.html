			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of International Capital Markets (2): Search for yield over - Eurobonds, down to earth with a bump Nothing could have prepared eurobond syndicate managers for the rapid deterioration in market conditions in 1994. Riding high after a record year of new issue volume and happily thinking about how to spend their hefty profit-related bonuses, the sudden collapse in bond markets around the world in February had the same effect on them as a bucket of ice-cold water on sun-warmed skin. 'It is no longer a bull market for new issues,' says Simon Meadows, joint head of syndicate at CS First Boston. He notes that the opportunities which were available last year in so many currencies and structures are no longer there, mainly because evidence that US interest rates are rising again has wiped out the need among investors to take risks to enhance their returns. 'The search for yield is over, that extra pick-up is not needed any more,' says Mr Meadows. After soaring 45 per cent to Dollars 400bn last year, new issue volume from the start of 1994 to May 15 stood at Dollars 164bn, down from Dollars 171bn in the same period last year, according to IFR Securities Data. At the same time, the proportion of fixed-rate issuance has declined in favour of floating-rate note (FRN) issuance, reflecting the shift in investor demand to make the most of any rise in rates. From January 1 to May 15 this year, borrowers launched the equivalent of Dollars 43bn in FRNs, corresponding to 26 per cent of total new issues (and mainly denominated in US dollars), compared with a total of Dollars 24bn in the year-ago period (or 14 per cent of total new issues). Emerging market borrowers which tapped the eurobond market with such success last year have also suffered as a result of the more defensive stance being adopted by investors. Yield spreads on their paper have widened substantially in the secondary market, eroding the progress which they made last year with respect to pricing. Syndicate managers say while the market is still open to them, they will have to pay what investors want to raise funds. John McNiven, managing director at Merrill Lynch in London, says that the new issues market is still available to a whole range of issuers but that the process has become more focused. 'You have to manage the new issue process more pro-actively,' he says, 'Underwriters have to differentiate between the credits to get secondary market support.' Whereas last year the bull market conditions made it possible for syndicate managers to stick their necks out on pricing to win a mandate, this year they are under pressure to get their pricing right or risk being left with the entire deal on their books. The market volatility and a reluctance among banks to tie up their capital to support other people's deals has unmasked one of the less gentlemanly practices in the eurobond market when members of a syndicate sell their allocation of the new issue back to the lead manager rather then keep it on their books in the hope of selling it on to investors. Recent instances of 'bond-dumping' have prompted a debate in the eurobond market about the viability of the fixed-price re-offer mechanism which was devised in 1989 by Morgan Stanley to instal some discipline among underwriters during the offering process. CS First Boston recently called for a revision of eurobond new issue practice to stamp out bond-dumping. It proposed a modified fixed price re-offer mechanism whereby the lead manager would be able to retain control of its issue by inviting the underwriting group to request paper according to end-investor demand, but not guaranteeing to allot these firms any bonds. By only allocating bonds to underwriters whose demands are credible, the lead manager could limit the flowback of bonds and downward pressure on prices. However, other leading eurobond houses have stood by the existing re-offer system. In a letter to the International Financing Review, which has been the forum for the debate, Robert Gray, chairman of the market practices committee of the International Primary Market Association, notes that since its introduction the re-offer system has been used to raise the equivalent of more than Dollars 800bn in 15 different currencies in more than 3,300 issues, approximately two-thirds of total eurobond issuance during this period. On the topic of bond-dumping, he adds: 'Responsible lead managers should factor that possibility into their pricing and syndication strategy for any transaction.' Syndicate managers expect a slight improvement in trading conditions this year but they say that the main task will be to encourage investors back into the market. One positive development is that investors are now more comfortable with medium-term note (MTN) programmes which enable issuers to achieve cost-effective financing through relatively small transactions. Paul Abberley, head of fixed-income investment at the London arm of Lombard Odier, the privately-owned Swiss investment management company, says that the growing liquidity in the MTN market is helping to blur the distinctions with the eurobond market. 'In some ways MTNs are more attractive than eurobonds because MTNs are structured to suit you while a eurobond has a fixed maturity,' says Mr Abberley. He adds that when it comes to the secondary market, MTNs are sometimes easier to sell than euro-bonds because issuers are often willing to buy back their paper. By contrast it is rare to find an issuer of eurobonds who will buy them back. Bim Hundal, head of the MTN desk at Goldman Sachs, says that while issuers often use the programme's master documentation to streamline eurobond execution, the main use is for structured (derivative-linked) products sold directly to investors. Several leading names in the eurobond market have set up MTN programmes in the past year, most notably the World Bank whose programme is designed to increase secondary market liquidity and enhance price transparency. A more recent recruit is British Columbia in Canada which signed a Dollars 2bn Euro medium-term note programme (EMTN) in early May as part of an ongoing process of diversifying its borrowing sources and broadening its investor base.</p>

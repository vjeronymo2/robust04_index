Kokov, president of the Republic of  Kabardino-Balkaria, at Government House in Nalchik on 19 March:  "V.M. Kokov: 'The Situation Today Is Such that the Struggle for  Power and Questions of Politics Must Be Relegated to the  Background, and We Must All Concentrate on Constructive Labor  and the Economy'"]    [Text] The conference was opened and anchored by V.  Kudayev, leader of the Office of the Press of the President of  the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria.    V.M. Kokov, president of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria,  began the meeting with journalists with the traditional opening  remarks. He said, in part: "A political situation is shaping up  both in Russia and in Kabardino-Balkaria today which differs  fundamentally from that which prevailed prior to 12 December.  However anyone might care to characterize the present situation  from the viewpoint of politics, it is more definite and more  distinct than prior to 12 December. And the reason for this is  primarily the Russian people's adoption of the constitution of  our federative state. The constitution has enshrined  unequivocally the fact that human rights are the priority in our  state. It has also unequivocally enshrined the integrity of our  fatherland, and these are strong aspects of the constitution,  and this is why we voted for it. But what I would like to  emphasize is this: The constitution is now a dependable basis of  the separation of powers. Not of a struggle for power but of the  legal separation of the various branches of power. Today the  Russian state represents in terms of form of government a  republican, presidential state combined with parliamentary  activity. And it is this particular feature of the situation now  taking shape that should be recognized by all people who live in  our fatherland. Each branch of power is called on to concentrate  exclusively on its own powers determined by the constitution.  The period when the representative authority adopted and decided  under its own jurisdiction all questions without exception came  to an end on 12 December.    "And we must recognize this also. It must be recognized by  both the legislature and the executive. And they must cease the  wrangling over whose chair is the higher. Proceeding from this  situation, I say: The period of political blather must end both  in the Russian state and in Kabardino-Balkaria.    "Not questions of politics but questions of the economy are  moving onto the agenda today. And we shall not for this reason  get far with slogans: Let us live in unity, let us live in  friendship, let us live in harmony. For the economy has reached  the point beyond which lie destitution and a powerful social  explosion. And the organs of power and administration in  Kabardino-Balkaria, therefore, should concentrate all their  thoughts and efforts on the accomplishment of specific economic  and social tasks. We are for this reason entering into a period  when we must do everything possible to ensure that all  enterprises and all forms of ownership work for the good of the  people of Kabardino-Balkaria. We proceed from the simple  formula: Let all forms of management and enterprises of all  forms of ownership develop equally in Kabardino-Balkaria, hence  let there be many rich people in our republic, but let there be  no poor people in Kabardino-Balkaria. That is, our policy must  consist of ensuring freedom of development for enterprises of  any form of ownership and at the same time of ensuring a strong  program of social protection of the populace so that we have no  families or people living in poverty here.    "Can the Government of Kabardino-Balkaria cope with this, in  words, seemingly, simple and comprehensible task. We believe  that it can. A message of the president to the Parliament of  Kabardino-Balkaria will be ready in a few days, and if we obtain  its approval there, a specific government action program in 1994  will be confirmed on the basis of this document. Today we are  working intensively on making the present year a year of a  change in the dynamics of the economy of Kabardino-Balkaria. The  endless decline we have had in the past five years must be  stopped in 1994. Industry and agriculture and other sectors must  in the present year make a turn toward their ascent, toward  normal conditions and forms of development.    "A living standard of society is shaping up in  Kabardino-Balkaria today that may be regarded as the limit. The  consumer basket in Kabardino-Balkaria, say, costs approximately  R60,000, and we have today one-third of the population below  this R60,000 in terms of income, and this means a great many  people. We must do everything to ensure that the level of  personal income at least cover the subsistence minimum, which is  calculated by various methods, but which is close to reality. We  will in this connection adopt very serious measures in the very  near future, on questions connected with the organization of pay  included. Note that people employed in the nonproduction sphere  receive more than R90,000, those working in the production  sphere, only R60,000 approximately. It should, it would seem, be  the other way about, and those who do not produce material  benefits should at least be on the same footing as those who  manufacture commodities. But this is the paradox, the distortion  in the organization of pay. We intend to implement, as I have  repeated many times, a strong program of targeted subsidies  also. We will necessarily arrive at a level of the organization  of social protection of the populace where all additional  payments we make to the populace will be brought together in  single compensation payments, and they will be granted on the  basis of an application. That is, to those who come and apply to  the social protection authorities and declare their income, that  is, in targeted fashion. A situation is now shaping up,  therefore, in which struggle for power and questions of politics  must in Kabardino-Balkaria, as, equally, in the Russian  Federation also, be relegated to the background, and we must all  concentrate on constructive labor in the name of emergence from  the profound crisis in which the economy and policy have found  themselves."    After the opening remarks of V.M. Kokov, president of the  Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria, journalists put to him a number  of questions.    Iskhak Guzeyev (of the newspaper ZAMAN):    "The state of the economy at present for both Russia and  Kabardino-Balkaria is, truly, a most important issue. Leaders of  the republic's social and political organizations are saying  that they also are concerned by this and are declaring their  intentions and their desire to assist, contribute, and  participate in the development of the economy of the Republic of  Kabardino-Balkaria. How do you see their participation here?"    [Kokov] I am familiar with this gathering, which calls  itself  the Assembly of Political Parties and Movements of the Republic  of Kabardino-Balkaria. But the assembly's entire tone is not one  of help for the government but of the emphasis of manifest and  clearly expressed opposition to it. I reject, therefore, such  help and such cooperation in categorical form. If specialists of  the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria have specific proposals, this  is another matter, and the doors of both the President's Office  and of the government are open, and we will officially even  solicit their proposals pertaining to the government's future  program of activity. In addition, the text of the message of the  president of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria to the  republic's parliament has today already been distributed to  approximately 50 percent of senior officials and specialists.  And it is from the proposals that have been received, with their  maximum possible consideration, that the message will be  modified and presented to the Parliament of the Republic of  Kabardino-Balkaria. It is this form that could be a practicable  mode of the social and political movements' participation in the  elaboration of the government program for 1994. We are prepared  to make available to any political movement or party today all  the material at our disposal.    Tazal Mashukov (of the newspaper KABARDINO-BALKARSKAYA  PRAVDA):    "There have been especially many letters in the newspaper's  mail in recent days connected with your edict 'On Certain  Measures of Rehabilitation of the Balkar People in Connection  With the 50th Anniversary of Their Repression,' which was read  out at the mourning assembly on 8 March. It was not published in  the press, and for this reason everyone is interpreting it each  in his own way. What is the future of this important document?"    [Kokov] I will say that this edict was not born on 8 March  1994. In all recent years, which have been called restructuring,  the community of the republic and the authorities have been  involved in problems of the complete rehabilitation of the  repressed Balkar people. And not only the Balkar people.  Representatives of other nationalities suffered measures of  repression also.    A principal demand of the national movements, on the basis  of  which they emerged, essentially, was the restoration of the  rayons. A second point was the formation of a parliament which  would take account to a greater extent of the interests of the  peoples populating the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria. A third  desire, absurd, in my view, of a certain negligible part of the  Balkar people was separation from Kabardino-Balkaria and the  creation of their own state. Such things were the basis of all  these movements in recent years. And, if you recall, the Supreme  Soviet of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria approved the  decision of the first congress of the Balkar people in defiance  of my wishes and my protest. I said at that time literally the  following: "We have today turned not the best page in the  history of the relations of the Kabarda and the Balkars."    Then that same Supreme Soviet adopted a decision on the need  for the restoration of the rayons. You remember this also.    But on 8 March 1994 I signed an edict with regard to the  developing political situation. Some people believe that I  exceeded my authority. I, however, believe that I did not exceed  my authority by writing: "to rename Sovetskiy, Cherekskiy  Rayon." I would like to ask normal people: How is this bad for  anyone, to whatever nationality he may belong?    Another point. There is written there: "To consider it  essential to restore Elbrusskiy Rayon, incorporating the village  of Kendelen with the consent of its inhabitants." I ask you:  Whom does this formula not satisfy, what is unreasonable about  this?    Or another point--the formation of a commission and the  submittal to parliament of a proposal concerning the  territorial-administrative arrangement of Kabardino-Balkaria.  What is unreasonable or incomprehensible here? I would like to  say that the meeting hall, the thousand people present at the  assembly, accepted the edict with complete understanding and  approval. And I consider this a normal step in satisfaction of  the moral damage which was caused the Balkar people.    If the head of the Russian state finds it possible at this  time to make profuse apology on behalf of the Russian state to  the Balkar people, why can the head of the Republic of  Kabardino-Balkaria, accommodating long-standing desires, not  rename one rayon and not form another rayon following  consultation with the people who will be called upon to live in  this rayon? This today is merely a subject of speculation, and  it would seem time to stop this. This step is aimed at adjusting  the protracted, if not opposition, then at least strained  situation in the relations of the peoples inhabiting our  republic. I, as a citizen of Kabardino-Balkaria, not as an  official, am absolutely sick and tired of the period of  fruitless opposition. And I believe that each day of such  opposition works against each Kabarda, each Balkar, each  Cossack, and each individual residing on the territory of our  republic. Aspirations to have done with the opposition and to  secure peace and harmony in the republic were the motivation for  this edict. And I will insist before parliament that it approve  this edict, schedule a referendum in the village of Kendelen,  and form a commission to consider other questions of the  administrative-territorial arrangement of the Republic of  Kabardino-Balkaria. And not only of the Balkar rayons. Of both  the Cossack and Kabardin rayons also, perhaps, if this is  economically expedient and corresponds to the present times.    This is my attitude toward this edict. And its future is  this: We will uphold and defend it in parliament, and I hope for  the good sense of our corps of deputies and that they will  support the edict and I am absolutely convinced that this  document will serve as a good foundation for stable work in the  future.    As far as other parts of the edict are concerned, such a  part  as, for example, the instruction to the Constitutional  Commission to work on the formation of two chambers, in one of  which all the peoples of the republic are represented, I have  never seen nor do I now see anything wrong here. If we want to  live in peace and harmony. After all, we are all maintaining  that we are today for a united Kabardino-Balkaria. Then please  explain to me, a Kabarda, what is threatening about the fact  that there will in one chamber be, say, 11 Balkar deputies, 11  Russians, and 11 Kabarda? What is the threat to me? There is no  threat, especially since we live in the Russian Federation,  whose constitution has clearly determined that all changes of  the borders of components of the Federation are possible only by  mutual consent, that is, a power solution of territorial  questions is 100 percent excluded. And whoever summons us to  this, to power solutions, is a criminal, a criminal before the  constitution, and we will deal with him with the full severity  of the laws of the Russian Federation.    Marina Kardanova (of the newspaper SOVETSKAYA MOLODEZH):    "Last Saturday the NSBN [National Council of the Balkar  People] adopted a resolution demanding the restoration of all  the Balkar rayons and a solution of the bicameral parliament  question. It stipulates that unless these questions have been  settled by our government and president within a month's time,  the NSBN will go to the leadership of the Russian Federation and  the Federation Council with a request for consideration of the  question of the creation of a Republic of Balkaria within the  Russian Federation.    "How do the government and the president of the Republic of  Kabardino-Balkaria intend to react to this and what is the  possible response of the Federation Council to this request?    "And the second question. At what stage is our relationship  with the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation in  respect to the payments of the promised compensation to the  persons who suffered from political repression?"    [Kokov] To speak of questions of territorial rehabilitation  of the Balkar people, in Kabardino-Balkaria it has progressed  the best compared with any other repressed people. This is my  assessment. Some may agree with this, some may disagree. But  judge for yourselves. I will give you some approximate figures.  Thirty-five thousand persons of Balkar nationality were forcibly  deported. Today the Balkar population constitutes, in the  Russian Federation at least, 90,000. Thirty-five thousand are at  the present time living in the ravines, and these ravines could  not physically sustain a larger population. Everything is  distributed there down to the last scraps. Putting up an extra  house there is a problem. Where does the rest of the population  live? On different territory, most likely. And whoever is  campaigning for the separation of Balkaria is pushing his people  onto a disastrous path because the day this happens, a large  part of the population would be "squeezed" into the ravines. And  would be "squeezed" by various methods. Power methods,  necessarily. This would mean blood and a tragedy for the people.  So it is that all these years I have been trying to show that  the people that experienced such a tragedy in their history  should not once again take a path that would lead to blood and  to senseless loss of human life. This is the elementary content  of all our efforts geared to ensuring that the republic be  united. We are today so integrated that no one could disunite  us. And this is, therefore, an absurd preoccupation.    As far as the response to the decision of the NSBN is  concerned, this is an organization that is not even registered  as yet, I believe. Yet it was formed to create the Republic of  Balkaria, and the Constitution of Russia permits this only with  general consent. There has been no consent, that is, the subject  of the creation of this organization is played out. I am not,  therefore, thinking of any special response to any such  statements. I have already responded to these statements. And if  some people have nothing to do and want to take this matter  further, let them do so. But the prudent part of the Balkar  people reacted to this at the time of the ballot in the  elections for the Federation Council with unanimous support for  the candidacies of both the president and the prime minister for  the Federation Council. Not of Kokov, not of Cherkesov, but of  the president and the prime minister and their program. And our  program is unequivocal--the republic must live eternally, as  thus far, as a united family and must tackle the urgent tasks  that confront its inhabitants. There will, therefore, be no  reaction on the part of the government.    As far as the Federation Council is concerned, it will not,  I  assure you, respond to the territorial division of Russia. I do  not recognize any divisions or any movements that could lead to  a confrontation and to innocent victims and I will put a stop to  them with all the powers at my disposal. In short, the  Federation Council will, I am sure, not respond to such  requests. Because the corps of deputies there now is  sufficiently serious and balanced.    Concerning the second question. If you noticed, the edict of  the president of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria, which is  being criticized once again by certain figures of various  movements, contains the following point--rendering persons of  Balkar nationality who suffered repression in the period  1944-1957 lump-sum material support. Why did we write this in?  Because the question of the payment of sums of compensation to  all persons in the Russian Federation who suffered repression is  today economically onerous, and a consummate unified procedure  in Russia has not been worked out. Some people say: Pay on a  family basis, others, on an individual basis. Some say: The  minimum salary times 100, others, 40. This question is at the  discussion and modification stage. But we are participating  actively, and the question of compensation payments for people  who suffered repression will, most likely, on the whole, in the  very near future be settled on the scale of the Russian  Federation. But lest we plunge it into a common precedent of  such a kind, we sought to ensure that the edict of the president  record a clause not on compensation payments but on material  support for persons of the Balkar nationality who suffered  repression. And it is this question that we will have settled in  the very near future. In addition, we already have R1 billion  here, which many people are mentioning frequently. We will start  payments from this R1 billion to the most elderly people.  According to our, Kabardino-Balkar, procedure, if it is not a  part of the Russian procedure, we will adjust it. But holding on  to this money any longer without doing anything with it would be  simply criminal. The money must work either for man or for the  republic. And we will begin these payments to persons who  suffered repression in 1944.    Miloslav Bityukov (of the newspaper YUG):    "Your message to parliament. When will it be delivered? What  is its main idea? Is it a political or economic document?"    [Kokov] The main idea of my message will consist of the  righting of the economy of the republic in 1994 and making the  latter a year of change. But jettisoning policy from the message  absolutely would be wrong. And I would describe my document as  political and economic. But I am sure of one thing--it will  determine the main directions of our activity and will be a  sound basis for a specific program, bolstered by figures, of  government activity. All this is to take place in April, within  the framework of the present sitting. I will have it in finished  form next week, probably. I want to get more opinions and have  more support for the message in advance in order that the debate  in parliament might be more productive. This is my mission.    [Bityukov] Could you in this connection familiarize us at  least with the heads of the message?    [Kokov] I promise that the leading newspapers will receive  it  and that they will have an opportunity to discuss it. And I  would be sincerely grateful for any criticisms and suggestions  you express. We all ultimately have a single goal--the  well-being of our republic. Who conceives of the achievement of  this well-being in what way is another matter. This could be  disputed also, but if we were to adopt a program of activity in  1994 which is consummate and which has been approved by the vast  majority of the people of Kabardino-Balkaria, its successful  realization would be predetermined.    Oleg Guseynov (of the newspaper SEVERNYY KAVKAZ):    "What is your attitude toward the proposal of Kirsan  Ilyumzhinov, president of Kalmykia, concerning the abolition of  his constitution and the recognition in Kalmykia only of the  Constitution of the Russian Federation, which, incidentally, was  supported by NSBN Chairman S. Beppayev?"    [Kokov] I take a negative view of this. The richness of our  fatherland consists of the fact that more than 150 peoples and  nationalities live here. This multilingualism, this diversity,  is the might of the Russian fatherland. But at the same time we  have all been speaking for several years now about our  sovereignty, about the right to self-determination. This is why,  participating in the constitutional process and the work of the  final commission, I sought to ensure that the Federal Treaty be  an official appendix to the present constitution (even if it  might to some people appear formal). And, thank God, 2 million  copies of the constitution, to which the Federal Treaty is  officially appended, have been published. In addition, this  problem was once again discussed at my last meeting with the  president of the Russian Federation, and the following agreement  was reached--constitutionally structured or formally structured,  the Council of Heads of the Republics will function. If only so  that the president of Russia and the leaders of the republics  might exchange opinions on various matters.    Second, we agreed that Kabardino-Balkaria and the Russian  state would conclude an official treaty. And literally yesterday  we discussed who would take part on the side of the Russian  state, and who, on the side of Kabardino-Balkaria. And the task  is to ensure that the treaty satisfy our requirements and at the  same time strengthen the Russian state also. The proposition of  the president of Russia on this matter is that he and the center  do not need one gram of the authority which could be realized  locally, in the regions and components. He needs merely the  authority that guarantees and ensures the integrity of the  Russian state and its security. Therefore, the president of the  Russian Federation suggests, work out a treaty that satisfies  you in full, and we will sign it.    And this, in my view, is the correct solution of the  questions of relations with Russia. We will move along the path  of full federalism, along the path of the formation of a truly  federative state. And what is wrong with this? Abolishing the  constitution of a republic, in which there are particular  features characterizing this people or the other, for that  matter, and the wishes of this people or the other would be at  least abnormal, therefore. I am absolutely sure that national  distinctions persist today and I consider it premature,  therefore, to rush to abolish one's constitution. And it is  Kalmykia's business according to which constitution it should  live, according to the Russian Constitution or some other....    We are thinking of devising a constitution in the course of  this year and, as I said earlier, adopting it. A constitution  that accommodates in full the interests of all the peoples of  Kabardino-Balkaria.    Tatyana Mochalova (of the Kabardino-Balkaria Television and  Radio Company):    "You have said that this year will be pivotal in an economic  sense. What ways out of the economic crisis do you see if it is  considered that ours is a subsidized republic and that the  financial position of the industrial enterprises continues to  deteriorate?    "And, second, if the conflict at the Tyrnyauz  Tungsten-Molybdenum Works has been resolved, how?"    [Kokov] The government and also a parliamentary commission  and many specialists of the republic are today working on  specific ways out of the crisis. But the main thing I have to  say is this: The spring-field operations will begin in literally  a few days' time, and it is important that agriculture in 1994  work at full stretch. The wavering is over. We held a meeting of  activists of the agro-industrial complex and determined our  positions in respect to the main directions of our activity in  this sphere. Not one square meter of land in Kabardino-Balkaria  must be left uncultivated. Not one normal, fit Kabardino-Balkar  inhabitant will be left in 1994 without something to do in  agricultural production.    We intend to cater in full for the requirements in respect  to  truck gardens of everyone who desires this. We also intend to  satisfy all applications in rural localities for adjoining  personal plots of land before 15 April of this year. Do the  financial possibilities for this exist? I believe that we have  such possibilities, and our contacts with the federal government  afford me reason today to give the firm assurance that we will  cover agriculture's needs for financial resources, however  pessimistic some people might be. Specifically, since the start  of the year we have channeled R17 billion into agriculture. In  addition, there are documents in the Ministries of Finance,  Economics, and Agriculture of the Russian Federation, which have  been coordinated with higher authorities, for a sum total of  over R70 billion. Even if we do not manage to materialize  everything, these funds are sufficient for ensuring that the  agro-industrial complex operate to the full extent.    Another point. We in the Russian Federation have settled  questions connected with the development of a resort and tourism  in Kabardino-Balkaria. There is a special decree, which we will  obtain shortly, which determines the main paths of the  development of these traditional sectors of our republic.    The next direction. We have designated quite distinctly a  program of hydropower construction in Kabardino-Balkaria.  Whether there will be R38 billion, whether there will be R30  billion, it is a fact that this work in the Republic of  Kabardino-Balkaria will proceed apace, that is, this will be a  sizable chunk in capital construction. We have designated  perfectly distinctly the extent of highway construction.    A large amount of work is scheduled in housing construction.  And we will first and foremost display special concern for the  needy, large families, the handicapped, and those who have been  on the waiting list for many years. We will build for families  of the inhabitants of hostels and barracks in the city of  Nalchik approximately 1,400 apartments altogether. We will make  a start on houses whose foundations have not been laid and will  continue those whose foundations have been laid.    The main problem for us is to secure the stability of the  operation of the enterprises. It is this that we are all now  working on: the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Finance,  and individual directors of large enterprises. We will join the  conversion program and will obtain some amount of money. But  even if I am unable to get anything resolved within the  framework of federal conversion programs, we have a backup move  even here--we will have preferential credit for the industrial  enterprises amounting to no less than R50 billion. I intend  discussing this problem with the president of Russia in the next  few days, incidentally, if possible. If not, it will be settled,  most likely, 4-5 April, when the next sitting of the Federation  Council takes place. But the most important thing is the  intrinsic potential, which we have and are using far from fully.  Many directors are, if you will excuse the expression,  unfortunately, "totally ensconced" in office, not just present.  And are giving no thought to the future and are not concerned  for the fate of their work force. Today's criterion for the  evaluation of any director: If the outfit is working, has steady  wages, and makes the compulsory payments, thanks are due him. No  one requires of him either plans or a product list and so forth.  But if a person fails to cope with this task, does he have any  right to be a director? Undoubtedly not. And for this reason  many people are accusing us of saying that the skilled  operatives should not be broken up. They should be. Operatives  who have not blended in in five years will not do so in five  months. This is futile. We must make personnel changes and  entrust the work to those who are capable of operating under  market conditions.    Further, we must find a way out of the situation that has  taken shape in respect to banking in Kabardino-Balkaria. Either  we--the republic--have the right to dispose of our own financial  resources or we will demolish the state by default. This is what  I am talking about. Either an enterprise or myself are in debt  to someone or someone is in debt to me, in either case, who is  the winner? Only the bank. The multimillion-dollar fortunes of  the present bankers and their institutions are being racked up  on the nonpayments alone. Many enterprise leaders are  "stripping" their work force through this loophole alone. So it  is that I say that all state resources in Kabardino-Balkaria  should be in the hands of the state bank. If the National Bank  cannot handle this, we will establish a Bank of Reconstruction  and Development, which would be entirely responsible for state  funds. But all the billions we solicit and take from our  populace amass interest via these banks in three or four months  of mutual nonpayments, and the interest is pocketed. That is, we  will adjust this matter also. We will also tackle questions of  taxes, streamline and support some, stimulate others, and take  from whoever today has possibilities.    Now as far as the Tyrnyauz Works is concerned. We have long  been involved in a persevering study of this works. Only  understand that the works--the city--is a single whole. And we  have already "hung" the entire infrastructure of the city on  ourselves and have been financing it for more than a year. Is  this not assistance to the works, which earlier supported this  entire city?    Another point. We obtained for them privileges in the  electricity tariff, and the electricity tariff with them  constitutes more than half of their prime costs. We are  currently preparing a directive of the prime minister of the  Russian Federation especially on the Tyrnyauz Works. And of the  R700 million we had in reserve for the purchase of meat on the  special quota, that is, for kindergartens, hospitals, and so  forth, we recently gave them R600 million directly, I believe,  so that they might square accounts down to a single kopek in  respect to the miners' pay.    And for this reason a conflict, whoever wanted to fan one in  Tyrnyauz, did not eventuate. It was not, strictly speaking, the  work force that assembled there but a small part of it, those  who would like to have a separate state. There was for this  reason no conflict there. We warned the management: If some  people other than you can assemble your work force, they, the  other people, should be the directors of this works, not you.  This most likely had an effect. At least, they asked of us:  Don't come here, we will sort it out ourselves. And they did so  and reported that no decisions were adopted there.    It is a fact that the miners are today in a difficult  position, and may the entire population of Kabardino-Balkaria  understand us if sometimes we make another gesture and take  another step in support of them. Their working conditions are  difficult, and we will do everything within our power to ensure  that the Tyrnyauz Works function normally as a state enterprise.    Igor Terekhov (of INTERFAX):    "The structure of the Government of the Republic of  Kabardino-Balkaria was formerly brought into line with the  structure of the Government of the Russian Federation. There  have now been changes in it. Will there be similar changes in  your government? If so, of what kind? What is your attitude  toward the proposal of V. Ardzinba, chairman of the Supreme  Soviet of Abkhazia, concerning the integration of the economy of  the Republic of Abkhazia in the economy of the North Caucasus  region?"    [Kokov] The structure of the government is not something  frozen and given once for all. It should change. And the  Government of Kabardino-Balkaria should now be changed both in  terms of structure and in terms of numbers. If I am successful  in all that I have in mind, and I am working on the papers,  calculations, and feasibility at this time, the Government of  the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria and the entire system of the  executive in general will in terms of numbers shrink by a  minimum of 20 percent, optimally, 30 percent. Thirty percent is  what I would like. I would not argue about anything over 20.  This as regards the numbers.    As far as the structure is concerned, we have 31 members of  the government. This is the case, I believe. Estonia, a state,  has 13 members of the government. But even if we are conditioned  by Russian canons, 30 structural subdivisions is a lot, all the  same. There are offices that could perfectly well be part of a  single complex. And for this reason the number of ministries and  departments, if I am successful, having convinced people and not  having evoked serious opposition, in reducing them to 21-23 (I  have both versions), I would consider my goal to have been  achieved. But the system of the executive must under all  conditions be competent, highly efficient, and operational.    The executive should, I am convinced, encompass all  components of the state, from the smallest homestead and  settlement through the republic. And in this respect I am in  confrontation, in disagreement, with the provision of the  constitution which says that local government is separated from  the state. I do not understand such a state, a Russian state, at  least, in which people may at the bottom do what they want and  at the top squabble endlessly. We should not have this. The  smallest community should have, therefore, an authorized  representative of the executive. Whether he is elected or  appointed is another matter. This may be argued, but there  should be such a person. I am for such a format and for such  changes.    Concerning the second question. I have the proposal from  Abkhazia. I have the telegram. But when we discussed it, we  framed the question this way: Would this not be interference in  the affairs of another state? Would we not hereby be pushing  Ardzinba himself and his parliament into a new confrontation?  And it was for this reason simultaneously my suggestion that  this meeting be held in Nalchik. These same thoughts had in  parallel, apparently, taken possession also of the Krasnodar  leadership, which also announced its desire for these meeting to  take place in Krasnodar.    I believe that questions of Abkhazia's integration in the  economy of the North Caucasus are absolutely realistic and do  not conflict with any international laws. And we should do  everything possible to ensure that this integration take place  at a durable level.    As far as political problems are concerned, they should be  discussed at a meeting of leaders of the North Caucasus and  Abkhazia. These matters were the subject of a brief examination,  incidentally, at the present sitting of the Federation Council,  from which I have just returned. I noted in a brief speech that  the techniques of the conclusion of Russia's treaty with Georgia  contained a statement of the president of the Russian Federation  prior to its signing to the effect that the treaty would take  effect only after the all-embracing Abkhaz-Georgian question had  been regulated.    And the treaty, which has now been concluded, records in one  article that it will take effect, like any other treaty, only  after ratification. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the  Russian Federation will not be submitting this treaty for  ratification even within the first six months, consequently, the  agreements we reached at that time will hold up. As far as other  problems are concerned, they should be resolved only  politically. I repeat: Now is not the time when territorial  issues can be decided by force.    Zufar Kambiyev (of the newspaper ADYGE PSALE):    "Elections to local government authorities are being held in  many regions of Russia at this time. When is it planned to hold  such elections here?"    [Kokov] If you recall the edict on elections to the  parliament of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria and the changes  we made to our constitution, it follows from these documents  that we must form a durable constitutional commission to draw up  a constitution in the course of the first six months, and then  we would discuss it and adopt it before the end of November. I,  for example, do not consider it necessary to once again plunge  the population of the republic into some elections before the  constitution is adopted. Consequently, we need to work  intensively on the elaboration of the constitution and its  adoption. And to hold elections to the local authorities with  regard to the provisions of the new constitution. But there is  another opinion also: Let us adopt a law on local government as  soon as possible and hold elections in accordance with it. We  will discuss these problems. But I would consider it possible to  hold elections to the local authorities only in accordance with  a new constitution, consequently, some time around  October-November. There are boards under the auspices of the  administration chiefs, and I believe that the administration  chiefs could work without major errors and provide for control  of both the economy and other social processes until then.    Marina Kyasova (of the newspaper KABARDINO-BALKARSKAYA  PRAVDA):    "A memorandum on civil peace and harmony is being made ready  for signing at the Russian level. Could you, as a participant in  the meeting in the Kremlin at which this matter was discussed,  not express your attitude toward it?    "Should a similar memorandum be drawn up in our republic?"    [Kokov] I was invited to this consultative conference under  the aegis of the president of the Russian Federation. Of all the  republics, only Kabardino-Balkaria participated. I supported the  idea of the memorandum and said there that any step in a  direction providing for political stability should be supported.  But in doing so I said also that we should not put our hopes in  this document. There have been many agreements of all kinds, but  they are not producing tangible results. I say: Let us live  according to the constitution, and no memoranda will be  necessary. Give us, consequently, a package of laws and a  mechanism making it possible to realize all articles of the  constitution that has been adopted.    Were we to live and work according to the constitution, no  memoranda would be needed. Such a memorandum would do no harm in  the Russian state. It could do some good even. At least, those  who are in charge of political parties and movements would,  having signed this document, be compelled to abide by it, of  course. And another point: Those who occupied extreme positions  and who refused to sign it would be showing the whole people  their true colors, that is, their reluctance to live in peace.  This is important also. I support the memorandum, therefore.    I do not consider it necessary to prepare a similar  memorandum in Kabardino-Balkaria. Why? Because there are  legitimately elected authorities and there is the constitution.  And all parties and movements, whoever is in charge of them,  should live within this framework. We, the authorities, are  called on to ensure the functioning of all movements only within  the framework of the constitution. [end Kokov]    In conclusion V.M. Kokov, president of the Republic of  Kabardino-Balkaria, appealed to the journalists as follows: "I  have repeated this many times and repeat it now also--peace and  harmony in the republic depend to a decisive extent on what you  have to say. Let us bethink ourselves. Let us not bring to the  people, the masses, information that agitates the public mind.  Let us not support those who are endlessly pushing us toward the  abyss. We do not need this. I repeat: Neither the president nor  the parliament are forever. They are today allotted by the  constitution a particular length of time. Let us in the name of  the peace and prosperity of the republic support the activity of  the legitimate authorities. The time will come when we will  elect others. Prepare for new elections, consequently. This is  prudent, this is normal. And, strictly speaking, should we some  day live in a state based on the rule of law!? Yes. And we need,  therefore, to expunge from our consciousness completely the  possibility of the use of force to achieve our political ends.  It is on this that I would ask you to target and concentrate  your efforts."</p>

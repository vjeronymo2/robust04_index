			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Esteban Huertas G.] </F>   [Text] The Compania Panamena de Aviacion (COPA) airline  will suspend its two weekly flights to Haiti beginning on 26  June to comply with UN sanctions. Deputy Foreign Minister  Carlos G. Cordero announced the measure, stating that the  suspension of flights to Haiti complies with the commercial  blockade imposed by the United Nations and the OAS against the  Raoul Cedras military regime.    Cordero told the media that yesterday, "acting President  Guillermo Ford Boyd signed the decree establishing the  prohibition of flights to Port-au-Prince effective 26 June."    COPA was the only Latin American airline covering the route  to the Caribbean nation. Regarding this measure, a COPA source  said the company does not yet have the official notification  from the central government. The airline official said that  General Manager Pedro Heilbron will be returning from a trip to  Miami tomorrow and that Deputy Manager Moises Veliz is on  vacation.    When LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA previously interviewed Heilbron,  he said the company "will comply with the government's order as  long as the U.S. airlines suspend their commercial flights to  Haiti."    According to Heilbron, the U.S. companies "did not comply"  with the previous two sanctions established by the international  organizations against the Caribbean island.    The COPA flights to Haiti mainly carry Haitian businessmen  and merchants coming to Panama to make purchases in the Colon  Free Zone.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Organizational separation between different departments of a broker-dealer is one of several means of preventing the interdepartmental communication of material, non-public information. <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  The NYSE/Amex Order noted that, for example, in view of the diverse functions performed by a multi-service firm and the material, non-public information that may be obtained by any one department of the firm, the firm often may be required to restrict access to information to the department receiving it, in order to avoid potential liability under Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Act <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  and Rules 10b&hyph;5 and 14e&hyph;3 thereunder. Moreover, two years after approval of the Amex's and NYSE's Information Barrier procedures, Congress enacted the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988 (``ITSFEA''), designed primarily to prevent, deter, and prosecute insider trading. <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  Among other provisions, ITSFEA created a specific requirement for broker-dealers to maintain procedures designed to prevent the misuse of material, non-public information. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  In response to the promulgation thereof, many firms redrafted their internal Information Barrier procedures to ensure compliance. <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Securities and Exchange Act Release No. 23768, (November 3, 1986) 51 FR 41183 (November 13, 1986), citing SEC Institutional Investor Study, H.R. Doc. No. 9264, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. 2539 (1971).

Nevertheless, such procedures have not necessarily been adopted by all specialist affiliates, have not been adopted pursuant to any specific regional exchange requirements, and have not been subject to specific exchange surveillance and oversight. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NYSE/Amex Order, in addressing the need for regional exchanges to participate in the regulation of affiliations between specialist operations and diversified broker-dealer firms, took into account the fact that regional exchanges differ from the primary exchanges in terms of order flow and market information. While noting that overall regional exchange volume is small compared to primary market volume, and regional exchange pricing of orders is generally derived from primary market quotations, the Commission expressed its concern that the diversion by a large retail broker-dealer of all or a significant portion of order flow in specialty stocks to an affiliated regional specialist could raise certain regulatory concerns similar to those raised by such affiliations on the primary exchanges. Moreover, the Commission noted that even if regional exchange specialists continue to set their prices based on primary market quotations, a regional specialist affiliated with an integrated retail firm could obtain significant access to material, non-public information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission continues to believe that Information Barriers, with effective controls, may be useful in restricting information flow between the various departments of broker-dealers with affiliated specialists. The Commission has monitored the NYSE and Amex Information Barrier rules since their inception, and generally believes they have proven effective in the context of specialists and affiliated approved persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission believes that the PSE proposal effectively addresses the potential for market abuses resulting from the ongoing relationship between specialists and affiliated approved persons. The effectiveness of the procedures set forth in the PSE guidelines is reinforced by the Exchange's existing surveillance of specialists and the marketplace as well as the specialist's highly visible position in the marketplace. These factors, along with the specialist's existing statutory duty to maintain a fair and orderly market, should help to enhance the effectiveness of the proposed Information Barrier. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

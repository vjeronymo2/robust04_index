			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, June 24 (ATA) -- ATA correspondent in  Prishtina Behlul Jashari reports that on the fourth day of the  trial against 14 Albanians, the Serbian Court of the Prishtina  circle heard five other defendants, who did not accept the  charges brought against them. They said that the indictments  are full of slanders stressing that they had been maltreated  during investigation. The defendants described the grave  tortures they had suffered by inspectors of the Serbian State  Security, such as the use of electric shock or violent drinking  of chemical substances.    The head of the jury, Dragolub Zdravkovic, admitted  cynically  but unwillingly a truth: "According to declarations by the  defendants who described the tortures against them by the  security, it comes out that not they but those who have caused  this violence should be held responsible. It seems to me that  this process is not an ordinary one."    Defence attorneys of the defendants approved completely  Zdravkovic's statement, stressing that their clients are telling  the truth in the court.</p>

			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Markets: Tiny Rowland sends his regrets . . . - London Markets LONRHO'S announcement of its 1991 results, released after the market closed on Thursday, is a striking document. The stock market was certainly struck by it - as soon as the shares opened on Friday they started falling, and closed the day at 120p, a 30p drop on the week. The stock market's concerns centred on the announcement's contents: a cut in the final dividend, a withheld first interim dividend, and a 24 per cent drop in pre-tax profits. However, the style of the press release is almost as remarkable as its contents. The opening page consists of a string of bullet points, in the best American manner. The first of these is the unadorned assertion: 'The balance sheet is strong.' There is a useful rule of thumb for interpreting a company results announcement: if it begins with the balance sheet, there's bad news in the profit and loss statement. And so it proved in this case, for the third bullet point was the profits confession: 'Profits are reduced in a difficult year from Pounds 273m to Pounds 207m.' But let's just go back to the first bullet point: 'The balance sheet is strong.' A further bullet point elucidates this: 'Gearing 70 per cent, net borrowings virtually unchanged since March 31 1991, with an improvement firmly in view.' There are several interesting features about this sentence. The first is that gearing is actually 73 per cent - not a big difference, it's true, but one that's worth getting correct. The second is that 73 per cent gearing is not, on the face of it, a hallmark of a particularly strong balance sheet. A third aspect is that behind the statement 'net borrowings virtually unchanged since March 31 1991' lies an interesting point. Current bank loans and overdrafts have risen by Pounds 109m in the period, to Pounds 490m. This has been almost entirely offset by a drop in creditors, current tax and dividends, to leave net debt at Pounds 2,091m, compared with Pounds 2,105 a year before. So net debt is indeed unchanged; but short-term bank borrowing has risen by 29 per cent. It is perhaps just as well that an improvement is 'firmly in view'. There are two other striking facts about the announcement. One is the influence, beyond the grave, of Robert Maxwell. After what has been revealed of his pension fund manoeuvres, Lonrho went to the trouble of devoting a bullet point to the fact that its UK pension funds are managed by independent professional fund managers, and that only Pounds 0.8m of the Pounds 300m total is invested in Lonrho shares or Lonrho-related companies. The second is the concluding bullet point: 'The board and management regret having to present a disappointing year's results and have every confidence in the ability of the company to move forward again.' On Thursday this comment reduced hardened Lonrho watchers to awed silence. As one put it: 'In all the years I have followed Lonrho, I have never seen the company regret anything.' * Lonrho was one of the two main influences on the week. The other was political, as what could well be a ten-week countdown to an election began on Wednesday, when the government chose March 10 as Budget day. That left April 9 as the current favourite for the election, and ensured that UK equities will be bounced up and down in line with the latest opinion polls. For the early part of the week, the afterglow of the Conservative assault on Labour tax policies still lingered. As late as mid-afternoon on Thursday, the FT-SE index was trading a point or so up on the previous week's close of 2536.7. From then on, things looked bleaker: Wall Street fell, and Friday's trading was overshadowed by the Lonrho news. Other shares with potentially vulnerable dividends suffered worst, and FT-SE closed at 2,510.4, down 26.3 on the week. The economic background was unexciting: a lacklustre CBI survey of retailing prospects, and weak figures on demand for loans from the Bank of England. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, already one of the more pessimistic City teams of economists, produced a revised forecast: no growth this year, with non-oil gdp shrinking at a rate of - 1/2 per cent. They had previously forecast this figure at + 3/4 per cent. The UBS team drew political consequences from this economic gloom: a hung parliament, with no clear Labour or Conservative majority. Stocks to buy, under this assumption, would be overseas earners (less vulnerable to domestic developments) such as BTR or RTZ; and manufacturers which would benefit from Labour policy, such as GKN or British Steel. Stocks the UBS team reckons would be adversely affected by a Labour government include banks, builders, stores and property (all hurt by potentially higher interest rates); companies that employ lots of low-paid workers (hurt by a minimum wage); and some of the privatised utilities. Politics aside, the market as a whole is likely to take comfort from the chart, above, which shows the relationship between the yield on the FT-Actuaries All-Share index and the yield on long-term government bonds. The lower the bond yield is in relation to the yield on equities, the better value shares appear. Typically, a ratio of around two is regarded as fair value; and though the ratio has bounced off the bottom in recent weeks as the market has recovered from its pre-Christmas slide, it is still in safe territory. Of course, the calculation depends on the belief that dividends are going to stay at current levels. Which brings us back to Tiny Rowland: the market is just going to have to hope that in its dividend cut, as in so many other spects of the way it does business, Lonrho is a law unto itself.</p>

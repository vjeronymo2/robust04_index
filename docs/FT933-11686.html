			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions lift Menvier-Swain ACQUISITIONS helped Menvier-Swain Group, the emergency lighting and fire alarms company, increase pre-tax profits by 29 per cent to Pounds 7.62m in the year to April 30. Turnover increased by 34 per cent to Pounds 56.8m. The group said it had made five acquisitions during the period, which had boosted sales by Pounds 8m and contributed Pounds 1m towards operating profits of Pounds 8.19m (Pounds 6.59m). Nugalec, the French fire alarm company purchased for Pounds 10.5m in February - funded by a rights issue - was performing well ahead of expectations. Mr Roy McDowell, chairman, said UK operations so far in the current year were operating at levels ahead of the same period last year. This was the case with all of Menvier's other operations with the exception of its smaller operating companies in Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands and Portugal, which were beginning to see effects of recession. He added: 'All this, coupled with the ongoing impact of new safety legislation on the demand for our products, gives me every confidence that we have the potential to achieve another improved set of results in the current year.' Mr Roger Fletcher, chief executive, said he was unlikely to make another significant acquisition, or rights issue, for some time as the group concentrated on integrating its recent purchases. Line management was being strengthened below board level. Less than half group sales now come from the UK, and France accounts for 30 per cent of the total. Mr Fletcher said the group was interested in opportunities in the Pacific Rim. Menvier eliminated borrowings of Pounds 2.4m during the year and ended with net cash of Pounds 700,000, despite increasing spending on product development. Earnings per share increased by 21 per cent to 34.1p (28.1p). A proposed final dividend of 7.7p brings the total for the year to 11p (9p).</p>

			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Tajikistan torn apart by communal war: Weapons flow freely to criminal groups TAJIKISTAN, the former Soviet Union's poorest republic, is being torn apart by communal warfare and political and economic chaos. In Kurgan-Tyube, an agricultural region in the south, communal fighting rages, while in the capital Dushanbe, President Rakhmon Nabiyev has gone into hiding in an attempt to avert the latest effort to topple him. In the north and south, independent armies have formed as central authority has crumbled. Weapons flow freely over the Afghan border to Tajik political groups and crime syndicates. In the south-east, dairy farmers are reportedly dumping milk into rivers because a fuel shortage stops them getting it to market. 'Everybody comes here and nobody helps us,' says Mrs Tamara Ramkin, who lives 300 yards from the centre of fighting in Kurgan-Tyube, a region of 80,000 people. 'Take us with you. They have even closed the hospital. Today a woman had to give birth in the basement here.' Residents say they were without milk, bread or fuel for three days last week. Today, Tajikistan's parliament will try to end the latest crisis. Opposition leaders trying to dislodge Mr Nabiyev believe that while he is unlikely to resign, they will muster enough votes to transfer his powers to the parliament and council of ministers. Constitutionally Mr Nabiyev will be president until he quits. Even if the opposition succeeds, transfer of power is unlikely to end the chaos. For the second time this year, the opposition has tried to seize power. The first stand-off, which left scores dead, ended in May when Mr Nabiyev surrendered eight of the most powerful jobs in his 24-member cabinet to opponents. Trouble resumed immediately with the communal war in Kurgan-Tyube, in which 2,000 people have died since May. The opposition, a coalition of Democratic and Islamic parties, has succeeded only in running Mr Nabiyev out of his palace and pushing back his militia in Kurgan-Tyube. Since the Soviet Union collapsed last December, Tajikistan has struggled to recover its Persian, Islamic past. It is a struggle to defeat entrenched communism and to overcome fears among potential foreign investors and donors that its religious liberalisation presages an extremist government. There is a regional issue as well. Concerned about arms flowing from Afghanistan, Moscow and three central Asian republics last week vowed to take 'any necessary steps' to prevent Tajikistan from plunging into civil war. The fighting has begun to isolate the nation of 5m people who share a 1,100-mile border with China and Afghanistan. In July, the neighbouring republic of Uzbekistan halted flights to Tajikistan. Mr Nabiyev, Tajikistan's ex-communist party boss, is popularly blamed for his country's problems. His support has dropped steadily since he won election last November with 60 per cent of the vote. Today, he has broad support in only one of Tajikistan's five regions, Kulyab. The republic's economy shrank 13 per cent in the first quarter of this year and 20 per cent in the second. The fuel shortage has raised the price of what petrol can be found to five times the Moscow level. In the Pamir mountain region, hospitals have closed, according to reports from the area. Lorries carrying fresh produce, such as grain and milk, are finding it impossible to reach remote regions. Aside from troops from the Commonwealth of Independent States, there is no security force in Dushanbe. Robberies and kidnappings have surged. Two regions have formed their own security forces. Mr Nabiyev's native region, industrial Leninabad, has taken control of central government offices in the north and set up a 2,000-strong army. Mr Nabiyev has formed a militia in Kulyab. The force is now fighting in Kurgan-Tyube, led by Mr Safarov Sangak who, before his current job, spent 23 years in jail. In Kurgan-Tyube, the streets are deserted. Sniper fire whistles overhead. Tartar and Tajik women wail they have no part in the war. 'What did I do?' one asks. 'Why am I guilty?'</p>

The meeting decided to hold the Second  Plenary Session of the ACJA Fourth Council in the near future;  it also discussed the work report and the revised draft of the  "Norm of Professional Ethics for Chinese Journalists," which  will be submitted to the plenary council meeting for  deliberations.    ACJA Chairman Wu Lengxi presided over the meeting. Secretary  Wang Zheren briefed the council meeting on the drafting of the  work report. In discussing the work report, permanent members  of the council maintained: Since the fourth council held its  first plenary session in 1991, the ACJA, local journalists'  associations, and special journalists' associations have done a  great deal of work in helping, organizing, and pushing the press  to vigorously publicize Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics, reform, opening  up, the establishment of a socialist market economic structure,  and adherence to a correct orientation for public opinion, with  economic construction as the center. They have made  achievements in implementing the norm of professional ethics,  opposing "paid journalism," commending advanced journalists and  units, and cultivating and building up the force of journalists.  They have also made significant progress in selecting and  awarding good news articles, promoting professional exchanges,  holding academic symposiums, pushing journalistic reform, and  launching journalistic exchanges and cooperation with foreign  countries, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao.    Participants in the meeting noted: Last year, the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee adopted a  decision on several issues concerning the establishment of a  socialist market economic structure; at a national work  conference on propaganda and ideology held by the central  authorities, Comrade Jiang Zemin called for "arming the people  with scientific theories, guiding them with correct public  opinions, cultivating them with a lofty spirit, and inspiring  them with excellent works." These have further clarified the  orientation and set the missions for the press in propaganda and  building up its force. The upcoming second plenary session of  the council should make the implementation of the guidelines of  these two conferences its subject, unify and encourage the broad  masses of journalists to thoroughly study Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, and adhere to the correct orientation for pubic  opinion to create a good press environment for reform, opening  up, and stability; advertise the main theme of economic  construction, reform, and opening up; and, in the meantime, make  greater efforts to publicize the construction of socialist  spiritual civilization. In the course of journalistic reform,  we should avoid the practice of stressing economic returns only  and ignoring social benefits, as well as the tendency of  pandering to low tastes. We should continue to make building up  the force of journalists our central work, strive to improve  journalists' ideological and professional levels, strengthen  professional ethics, and keep honest practices and  self-discipline.    Permanent members of the council noted: Being important  social organizations of the press, journalists' associations  should fully use their clout as mass organizations to conduct  activities with their own characteristics, inspire the  enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of journalists, so  that the work of journalists' associations will be more animate  and lively.    To suit the development of situation, it is necessary to  make  appropriate supplements and revisions to the "Norm of  Professional Ethics for Chinese Journalists." Permanent members  of the council discussed the revised draft at the meeting.    The meeting agreed to recruit Yang Shangde, Liang Heng, Sun  Yongren, Zhang Enhua, Wang Yunxiang, and Zhang Biao as permanent  members to the council.    Also attending the council meeting were ACJA vice chairmen  Shao Huaze, Li Yan, Guo Chaoren, Ma Qingxiong, Ding Ximan, Zhang  Cong, Yang Zicai, and others.</p>

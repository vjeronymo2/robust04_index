			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Bo Jeppesen and Henrik Qvortrup: "Center </F> Democrats Make New Demands on Prime Minister"]    [Text] The Center Democratic Party (CD) flatly rejects a  Social Democratic (SDP) or SDP-Radical Liberal (SR) government  and if the CD participates in a government headed by the Social  Democrats again it will step up its demands. CD group chairman  Peter Duetoft has made that clear.    Like the Christian People's Party, the CD, which is a member  of the government, now refuse to give Prime Minister Poul Nyrup  Rasmussen (SDP) a free ticket to continue as head of the  government after the next Folketing election.    The CD have already decided two things:     -  The party will  not support a Rasmussen government without participating itself:  "We flatly reject both a minority Social Democratic government  and an SR government because that would give us no control over  the direction they take," said CD group chairman Duetoft, who  will continue to make every effort to keep the Socialist  People's Party (SF) from gaining influence.    -  And if the CD does  participate in a Rasmussen government again the price will be  higher than it was when the last government was formed.     Duetoft said that the CD ``will definitely make more  demands.    ``And we want cooperation toward the right side of the  Folketing and not the left,'' said Duetoft, pointing directly at  the Conservative Party as a desirable partner for a Rasmussen  government.    The new statements from the CD have further increased the  pressure on Prime Minister Rasmussen.    The other small government party, the Christian People's  Party, has long refused to guarantee continued loyalty.    Duetoft has announced that the CD will spend the summer  deciding who the party will support after the coming Folketing  election.</p>

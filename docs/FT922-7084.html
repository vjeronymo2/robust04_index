			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Sales of Halcion given go-ahead by FDA panel: Sleeping pill seen as safe when used as prescribed HALCION, the controversial sleeping pill made by Upjohn, has been found by an advisory panel to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be safe and effective when used as prescribed for short-term treatment of insomnia. The panel recommended that the world's best-selling sleeping pill remain on the market in the US, in spite of studies showing that it produces higher rates of anxiety and memory impairment in some patients than similar drugs. The panel recommended clearer labelling of the drug's possible side-effects. The FDA is not obliged to follow the panel's recommendations but is expected to abide by them and allow Halcion to remain on the market. Upjohn believes a final decision could be made within two to six weeks. The panel said data did not confirm more alarming side-effects. It was fears that Halcion induced a substantially higher number of these, particularly depression and memory loss, that led to the drug being banned in a number of countries, including the UK, Norway, Finland, Bermuda and Argentina. Restrictions have been imposed on dosing levels in France and Spain. A German Health Ministry panel has not yet reported. In the UK, a final decision on the ban is expected by the start of next week, according to Upjohn. Although the UK accounted for only a small part of Halcion's sales, the ensuing publicity hurt the drug's sales around the world. These declined by 39 per cent during the first quarter of this year. Last year Halcion accounted for Dollars 237m (Pounds 133.8m) of Upjohn's Dollars 3.4bn sales. Shares in the US company firmed Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 35 3/8 at the close on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. The stock was trading at about Dollars 47 3/4 before Halcion sales were suspended in the UK last September. At the FDA panel meeting, the company said it would conduct a study of 10,000 patients in a further attempt to allay fears about the drug's safety. The panel had recommended additional studies to determine the safest and most effective dosage.</p>

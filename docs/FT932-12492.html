			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Leading Article: Ciampi in charge MR CARLO Azeglio Ciampi, the Bank of Italy governor, appears to be proof that, in Italian politics, the reverse of Gresham's law holds true: good central bankers can drive out bad politicians. Mr Ciampi's move to the helm of an interim government in Rome supplies final evidence of the bankruptcy of the political establishment. The appointment of the first non-political head of an Italian government for more than 100 years reflects the Bank of Italy's stature as an institution unsullied by scandal. It also illustrates President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro's failure to find a politician of influence and standing capable of guiding the country to early elections. Mr Ciampi, who will remain governor for the time being, has achieved an increase in the Bank of Italy's independence. He has persuaded the government to end the central bank's role in deficit financing - presumably saving him from the embarrassment, in his new job, of providing his own government's overdraft. Mr Ciampi's nomination brings relief to financial markets. But, even in matters of shorter-term political and economic management, it leaves questions open. Mr Ciampi's persistent criticism of successive governments' free spending has won him esteem. Yet these governments' equally persistent refusal to heed his advice has not enhanced his reputation for getting results. Since 1980, when Mr Ciampi first warned of profligacy, Italy's public debt has grown from 62 to 112 per cent of GDP. To steer through electoral reforms, and to limit the deficits, Mr Ciampi will need a grip on parliament. A man chosen to be above politics will not be able to avoid descending into the political arena. Mr Ciampi possesses great moral authority; but even during the few months when il Governatore runs the government, this may not be enough.</p>

			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Whitehall clash on Post Office rules: DTI defies Treasury over commercial freedom The Department of Trade and Industry is backing the Post Office's call for more commercial freedom, in spite of Treasury opposition. DTI officials are working on a report contrasting the position of hospital trusts and grant-maintained schools with that of the Post Office. They feel that under the present rules some schools and hospital trusts have more opportunities than the Post Office to involve the private sector. The DTI wants to relax restrictions which prevent the Post Office from forming international joint ventures to compete with the Dutch post office, which is being privatised early next year. The Treasury opposes any change to the status quo while the Post Office remains in the public sector. According to Whitehall officials, the Treasury is adamant that unless the Post Office is privatised, the corporation should 'not be entitled to any commercial freedom whatsoever'. The two departments are so far apart on the issue that Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, has blocked a move by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to allow post offices to sell angling licences, currently available from angling shops. Treasury ministers do not believe post offices should have more scope to compete with shops while the corporation remains state-owned. The DTI has yet to announce the outcome of its long-awaited review of the Post Office. An early draft of the report, not expected to be published until the end of February, has come out against full privatisation but is known to be sympathetic to the Post Office's call for greater freedom. Mr Patrick McLoughlin, DTI minister responsible for the Post Office, is also understood to be strongly supportive of its demand to be allowed to sign international joint ventures with private companies. Mr Mike Heron, Post Office chairman, and Mr Bill Cockburn, its chief executive, fear that its investment plans and profitability are at risk because of the cash taken by the Treasury. The Post Office's external finance limit target - the amount it has to pay the government - has risen to Pounds 230m in 1994-95 and is set at Pounds 210m for the following year. It was announced yesterday that Post Office pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 135m to Pounds 59m in the six months to September, reflecting the impact of the two-year freeze on letter prices. Mr Cockburn has warned that in the long term, stamp prices may have to rise to meet the Treasury's demands for cash. He said yesterday the Post Office should be freed from the commercial constraint of helping to finance the public sector borrowing requirement.</p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Riviera beach pollution claim Excessively high levels of bacteria from human waste were found in the water off four of 11 French Riviera beaches tested, environmentalists said yesterday. The Greens party called for an investigation on whether bathing was safe at the four beaches after laboratory tests of water quality were conducted at the request of the Vai Nissa, an association led by Patrice Miran, a political leader in the region who is also a Greens member. The tests, conducted last week, found levels of bacteria well above guidelines set by the European Union. The areas found to be polluted were the Flots Bleus beach at Saint-Laurent-du-Var, the Palais and Midi beaches at Cannes, and an unidentified beach at Nice.</p>

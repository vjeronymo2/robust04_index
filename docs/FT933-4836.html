			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Prestige in the pipeline: A dispute between Turkey and Russia over oil export routes Turkey and Russia are locking horns over the future of a multimillion-dollar project to take central Asia's oil to western markets. The outcome of the struggle will help shape the future economic alliances of the region. The importance of the venture is underlined by tomorrow's scheduled visit to Moscow by Mrs Tansu Ciller, the Turkish prime minister, to meet President Boris Yeltsin. In her first foreign trip, she is expected to focus on Turkish concerns over conflict in the Caucasus, and to enlist Russian backing for Turkey's planned oil pipeline from Baku in eastern Azerbaijan to the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan (see map). Turkey, a newcomer to regional influence, is seeking to capitalise on its linguistic and ethnic ties with the Turkish-speaking republics; Russia, historically the colonial power, is trying to reaffirm its control over its former empire. The planned pipeline has thrown these tensions into relief. Negotiations are under way between Azerbaijan, Turkey and several western oil companies to construct the USDollars 1.4bn pipeline, financed mainly by British Petroleum, Amoco, Unocal, Pennzoil and McDermott of the US, and Statoil of Norway. The alternative oil route to the west is via the existing Soviet-built pipelines to the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, from where tankers take the oil through the Bosporus straits to Mediterranean refineries. The pipeline would need to be developed and extended as new oilfields come on stream. 'Every route has it difficulties,' said a western oil executive. The oil companies say the present Bosporus route is cheaper and would not require such large investment. For the cash-strapped central Asian republics, the Bosporus route is also attractive - it offers the prospect of virtually immediate oil revenues because much of the pipeline network is already in place. There are practical reasons for the misgivings: the Turkish pipeline would have to cross Georgia, Armenia or Iran, all of which would present considerable political risks for any lender to the project. In addition, a large section of the pipeline would have to be built through south-east Turkey, where Turkish Kurds are fighting for independence. Last week Turkey stepped up the diplomatic pressure by threatening to introduce new restrictions on tankers of more than 150 metres in length passing though the Bosporus. Turkish foreign minister Mr Hikmet Cetin warned that Turkey would seek a revision of the 1936 Montreux Convention under which merchant vessels in peacetime are ensured unhindered passage through the straits. The effect of any curbs on traffic would add costly delays to the tankers shipping oil from Novorossiysk and could force the oil companies to look more favourably on the Turkish pipeline proposal. Turkey is justifying its planned restrictions by citing environmental concerns over the increase in tanker traffic that would run through the middle of Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, if its pipeline does not get the go-ahead. 'We can't take that environmental risk,' said Mr Cetin. 'If the only solution is to change Montreux, we will seek to change it.' Turkish officials have repeatedly warned about congestion in the Bosporus because of growing freight use by the newly independent Black Sea states, all dependent on this route for access to western markets. The number of vessels passing through the Bosporus last year is estimated at 50,000, an increase of 10 per cent over 1991. According to observers, about 5m tonnes of crude oil is shipped annually through the straits, a figure that will rise to 45m-50m tonnes if oil from new finds in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan starts flowing through Novorossiysk. The Istanbul port authorities already have to close the Bosporus for safety reasons to other traffic every time a tanker is in transit. Despite Turkey's concerns, western diplomats say there would be little support among other signatories for a complete revision of Montreux, a broad agreement which achieves a delicate balance of interests, and which took 13 years to finalise. Minor amendments might be possible. 'We believe Turkey has a legitimate concern to alter Montreux slightly,' said one western observer. There is a great deal more at stake than regulating tanker traffic, however. The pipeline dispute comes at an awkward time, as Turkey seeks Russia's co-operation to bring peace to the war-ravaged Caucasus. The project is also seen as the economic lifeline of the region and the centrepiece of a more ambitious Turkish foreign policy. Until now the lack of a common land border with the central Asian republics, and no shared infrastructure, have placed physical limits on Turkish efforts at economic expansion eastwards. The pipeline itself would bring in an estimated USDollars 500m a year in tariff revenues. Of equal significance is the unprecedented commercial opportunity it offers for Turkish businessmen to forge trade links with the republics. For instance, Turkey might take Azeri oil in exchange for manufactured goods and construction contracts. At the moment, Turkish officials are concentrating on wooing Azerbaijan. If their efforts are successful, Kazakhstan may be persuaded to redirect its oil to the Turkish route. This could pave the way for a separate gas pipeline to take both Kazakh gas and the vast gas reserves of Turkmenistan to Europe. For Russia, the prospect of losing control over the natural resource exports of former satellites is worrying. The continued use of Russian ports and refineries makes the republics dependent on Moscow. The Kazakhs already have an agreement with Chevron, the US oil company, to develop the vast Tengiz field, and ship the oil via Novorossiysk. Bechtel of the US has a contract to build a pipeline from Tengiz to Novorossiysk, linking with the existing facility from Baku to Grozny. Any change by Turkey in the conditions applying to tankers transiting the Bosporus would be viewed as a provocation by Russia, which might pursue the issue with the International Maritime Organisation, the London-based UN body that handles maritime disputes. Amendments to Montreux would prejudice relations not just with Moscow, but with all the Black Sea states. This could jeopardise the careful groundwork already undertaken to set up the Black Sea Economic Co-operation forum, which aims to cement trade links throughout the area. Turkey may have been slow to understand the depth of Russia's determination to hang on to control of central Asia's oil exports. In pushing for the pipeline, the Turks have challenged Russian economic power at a time when Moscow, too, is desperate for the hard currency that accrues from such a project. Ultimately, however, Turkey may be the winner. It is commiting intense diplomatic efforts to persuading western governments to support its case for restricting access to the Bosporus, while continuing to negotiate for the pipeline with Azerbaijan. A decision on the project may be several months away - but on it rests Turkey's regional prestige.</p>

			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STEINBRENNER WOULD HAVE RAISED THE ANTE IF HE'D BEEN AT THE TABLE  </P> <P> Even at 4 p.m. Thursday, Darryl Strawberry's signing with the Dodgers was news  to George Steinbrenner. News apparently doesn't travel too quickly to Tampa  these days.  </P> <P> The revelation startled the Yankees' ex-Boss. It didn't thrill him, either.  </P> <P> Told that Strawberry went West for $20.25 million, Steinbrenner's response was  a classic:  </P> <P> "That's for four years, right?"  </P> <P> "No" he was told. "That was for five years, George."  </P> <P> "Five years for that? I must be out of touch."  </P> <P> If Steinbrenner were still around, might Strawberry still be in New York? At  the least, he might have received the first $5-million-a-year offer.  </P> <P> While saying he didn't wish to criticize the Yankees' new regime for its lack  of interest in Strawberry, Steinbrenner's comments left little doubt: he would  have pursued the cross-town super hero with a vengeance.  </P> <P> "All one would have to do is look at what I've done before and you can judge  for yourself as to what I might have done," said Steinbrenner, who is prevented  from involving himself in such matters by Commissioner Fay Vincent.  </P> <P> Steinbrenner's appraisal: The Dodgers rolled a seven. "I don't want to  second-guess my people but Darryl Strawberry is an impact player," Steinbrenner  said. "It's a fine move for the Dodgers."  </P> <P> Steinbrenner calls letting Reggie Jackson get away to California in 1980 his  biggest mistake. Of Strawberry, Steinbrenner said, "I wouldn't have let him get  away."  </P></p>

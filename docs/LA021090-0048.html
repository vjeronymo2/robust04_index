			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INDIAN, PAKISTANI SENTRIES IN TENSE, LONELY STANDOFF ON BORDER;  </P> <P> KASHMIR: FEARS PERSIST THAT WAR COULD ERUPT ON THE U.N.-MONITORED TRUCE LINE, A  LONG-TIME INVASION ROUTE.  </P> <P> As a cold drizzle soaks this mile-high mountain redoubt, Pakistan Army Maj.  Mohammed Najeeb peers far across the steep rocky gorge through high-power  binoculars.  </P> <P> There, perched high above raging rapids and a bombed-out bridge, an Indian  sentry can be seen peering back from his own blockhouse and bunker complex.  </P> <P> "This is the crucial point," said Najeeb. "This is the old invasion route for  Kashmir."  </P> <P> For now, despite fears that a new Indo-Pakistan war could erupt, a tense  military standoff continues on the U.N.-monitored cease-fire line that has  divided the region, officially known as Jammu and Kashmir, since 1949.  </P> <P> Two-thirds of the region were integrated into India, over Pakistani protests,  as the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. The other third is under Pakistani  control, administered as two dependencies: Azad Kashmir, which lies to the west  of the Indian state, and the Northern Areas.  </P> <P> Three times India and Pakistan have gone to war, and three times their armies  have clashed on the old British road that twists and climbs through rugged  snow-capped mountains and swirling clouds for 240 miles from Islamabad in  Pakistan to Srinagar in India.  </P> <P> The cease-fire cut the road in half here. Sometimes a U.N. observer with a  white flag crosses the swaying wooden footbridge. Sometimes, too, shots ring  out.  </P> <P> Today, all is tranquil on the so-called "line of control" except for the  whistling wind and the bitter emotions that have brought two enemies conceived  in crisis back to the brink.  </P> <P> "This line is like the Berlin Wall," said army Lt. Abdul Saleem, gazing at the  river that marks the line below. "It divides families, father from son, mother  from daughter."  </P> <P> The divisions are especially deep now. In recent weeks, thousands of Indian  army troops have flooded into Jammu and Kashmir to crush a popular uprising led  by separatists and Muslim fundamentalists. Dozens, perhaps hundreds, have died.  </P> <P> "They mishandled womenfolk," charged Sardar Abdul Qayyum Khan, president of  Azad Kashmir. "They shoot children. They shoot demonstrators. They search  houses and look at the belongings."  </P> <P> News of the uprising in India has fueled a war hysteria among fellow Muslims  and fellow Kashmiris in Pakistani villages along the border.  </P> <P> In Chikothi village, several miles back from the line, about 75 men gather in a  muddy street to chant anti-Indian slogans. Black flags of protest wave from  ramshackle storefronts. Graffiti extol the Kashmiri cause.  </P> <P> "We had three wars with India, but Kashmir was not decided," said Shazulla  Awan, a bearded businessman. "So now we want to force them to settle the  issue."  </P> <P> He nods as Makata Latif, a fellow shop owner, says he wants to lead his fellow  villagers across the border to help the militants that Pakistan calls freedom  fighters and India calls terrorists.  </P> <P> "Our brothers are being killed across the border," Latif said. "If they kill  me, it doesn't matter. I am happy to make the sacrifice."  </P> <P> "My children will fight as I fought in 1947 -- for Kashmir," agrees Mier Abdul  Latif, 60.  </P> <P> Indian guards killed at least one youth and wounded a dozen others when they  tried to cross the border south of here at Sialkot on Monday. Here, Pakistani  officials say, they will stop the protesters for their own safety.  </P> <P> "We won't let them cross," said district officer Sardar Mohammed Rahim Khan.  "We'll use force if we must. Because if they cross, they'll be killed."  </P> <P> Religious fear and prejudice also inflame the dispute. Islamic Pakistan feels a  special kinship with Indian Kashmir since about 65% of the Indian state's  population is Muslim. It is India's only state with a Muslim majority.  </P> <P> "Kashmir is our homeland," said Nazir Durrani, a government clerk in  Muzzafarabad, capital of Azad Kashmir. "In India, the Hindus occupy it. When  the Muslims try to free Kashmir, the Hindus fight us. But it is not a Hindu  state. It is a Muslim state."  </P> <P> "All of them want to join Pakistan," said Rahatullah Khan, chief secretary of  Azad Kashmir. "Ethnically, culturally, religiously, they are the same people."  </P> <P> It remains, however, an Indian state -- and it is likely to remain one.  </P> <P> "How long can we stay united if we allow one religion to secede?" asked J. N.  Dixit, the Indian ambassador in Islamabad. "We have Muslims, we have Hindus,  Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists and Christians."  </P> <P> Political and military leaders in both countries say they are trying to avoid  war. U.N. observers say no troop movements or special preparations have been  seen. Officers are taking scheduled holidays.  </P> <P> So for now, people like Durrani, 29, must wait. His family was divided during  the 1948 war. He has waited all his life to meet his own brother, who got left  on the Indian side.  </P> <P> "I've never even seen him," said Durrani.  </P> <P> Drogin, chief of The Times Manila Bureau, is on assignment in Pakistan.  </P></p>

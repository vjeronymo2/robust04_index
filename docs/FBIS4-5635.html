			<p>BFN     [Text] Aranyaprathet -- Khmer Rouge (KR)guerrillas last  night managed to retake Pailin from Phnom Penh troops after a  heavy battle with government forces.    Military sources at the border said the Khmer Rouge forces  had seized Highway Nos. 10 and 5 which were the main supply  lines for the government troops to Pailin from Battambang and  Banteay Meanchey before moving into Pailin yesterday evening.    Details of the fighting remained sketchy last night. But the  sources claimed the Phnom Penh force suffered heavy casualties  and damage from the assault by the guerrillas.    Several government tanks were seized by the guerrillas as  ground troops were sent in "disarray" by the attacks, the  sources claimed.    Thai military officers claimed last night at least 15 Phnom  Penh soldiers fled across the border into Ban Phakkat of  Chanthaburi's Pong Namron district last night.    [Bangkok THE NATION in English on 13 April carries a report  on page 1 that adds: "Sixteen Cambodian government soldiers  were among a group of Cambodian border residents driven into the  Thai soil after fighting in Pailin yesterday, prompting rumours  that the gem- rich town in western Cambodia might have been  recaptured by the Khmer Rouge.    ["The Thai military could not immediately confirm border  sources' reports that most of the soldiers, who crossed into  Thailand's Chanthaburi province, were senior officers.    ["The sources reported heavy fighting around Pailin over the  past week.    ["`The fact that senior Phnom Penh army officers fled to  Thailand indicates that the Khmer Rouge have made significant  advance or even have recaptured the town,' the communist  faction's biggest headquarters, one source said.    ["Army sources said they could not immediately confirm the  border reports, but noted that Phnom Penh forces in Pailin had  faced serious logistic problems because food supplies could be  sent only by airborne methods."]</p>

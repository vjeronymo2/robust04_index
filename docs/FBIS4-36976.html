			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] In its editorial today, AL-BA'TH talks about  Israel's attempts to harm the distinguished Syrian-Lebanese  relations with the aim of dealing separately with each country  within the framework of its attempts to impose its hegemony on  the region and its conditions that serve the Israeli greed and  interests.    AL-BA'TH says Israel is still wagering on the internal  Lebanese situation. The series of explosions--the latest of  which took place at Sayyidat al-Najat Church--, the daily  aggressions against southern Lebanon and al- Biqa', and the many  enticements offered to Lebanon are aimed to sever the bonds  between two twin states.    AL-BA'TH says Israel concentrates on Lebanon, which had been  viewed as the weakest part of the Arab body, as part of its  policy of secret deals and partial solutions.    AL-BA'TH emphasizes that Lebanon, which astonished the world  with its national resistance of the Zionist occupation, has  practiced its legitimate right to defend and liberate its land.  Hence, it is no longer the weakest part. Furthermore, Lebanon  plays an important role in the peace process in coordination  with Syria, and emphasizes that it will not relinquish any of  its rights.    Concluding its comment, AL-BA'TH says the continuous  Syrian-Lebanese consultations consolidate fraternal bonds  between the two sisterly states and the one people, and  strengthen the Syrian and Lebanese negotiators and enable them  to confront all Israeli methods. This was emphasized by  Presidents al-Asad and al-Hirawi during their summit uesterday  when they reiterated adherence to a just and comprehensive  solution.</p>

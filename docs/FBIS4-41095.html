			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Veronika Kutsyllo: "Operations Department </F> Created in the Apparatus"]    [Text] Under a series of edicts signed Monday by Boris  Yeltsin, Nikolay Medvedev has been replaced by Aleksandr Kazakov  as chief of the Presidential Staff Administration for Work With  Territories; Vladimir Zaytsev, first deputy chief of the Control  Administration, has been appointed acting chief of this  administration; Vladimir Varov has become Russia's chief labor  inspector; and finally an Operations [operativnyy] Department  has been created in the staff itself.    Apparently the presidential "reshuffle" edicts should not be  scrutinized for signs of just another apparatus overhaul. Some  of them were prepared long ago: For instance, Vladimir  Zaytsev's appointment as Russia's chief controller or Vladimir  Varov's nomination as the country's chief labor inspector. It  is not yet clear exactly what the Russian Federal Labor  Inspectorate will do: Whether Varov will be tasked with  verifying the correct maintenance of work record books or  whether he will conduct on-site checks at enterprises. But it  would be unreasonable to expect any serious changes in Russian  politics as a result of this appointment.    That Nikolay Medvedev's days as chief of the Administration  for Work With Territories were numbered has been known for a  long time. Having failed to establish proper contacts with the  regions, Medvedev, after the March reorganization of the staff,  was not confirmed as administration chief and has remained  acting head throughout this time. His departure was inevitable  and did not evoke any protest either from the administration's  staff or from deputies of parliament's upper chamber: heads of  the regions. Commenting at KOMMERSANT-DAILY's request on  Medvedev's fate, a member of the Federation Council leadership  observed "It is high time," while another crossed himself.    Therefore the only surprise was the appointment to this post  of Aleksandr Kazakov rather than any of the regional aspirants.  Before the edict Kazakov worked in the government as Anatoliy  Chubays' deputy. True, according to comments from his  colleagues, the new administration chief dealt with  privatization mainly "in the regional sphere" and therefore is  well acquainted with regional problems. Nonetheless, he will  clearly take a long time to restore the administration's  reputation in the eyes of the regional rulers.    Perhaps the most mysterious of these edicts was the decision  to create in the staff an Operations Department which, according  to the official version, will be responsible for processing  incoming and outgoing presidential documents. The name of the  candidate for the post of the president's chief operations  officer is not being disclosed yet. Until recently all  paperwork has been handled by the President's Chancellery,  headed by Valeriy Semenchenko. No one in the Presidential Staff  could explain yesterday what exactly will happen now: Whether  Semenchenko will have his hands freed to deal with other  presidential affairs or whether, quite the contrary, he has been  sidelined.  <H5>  From the Statute on the Administration for Work With </H5> Territories    The administration's tasks include ensuring interaction  between the president and the bodies of state power and  administration in the republics, krays, oblasts, autonomous  oblasts, autonomous districts, and the cities of Moscow and St.  Petersburg  <H5>  Commentary by Federation Council Deputy Chairman Ramazan </H5> Abdulatipov    "I do not understand what the administration does. It is not  clear whether it is supposed to brief the president about what  is going on in the regions, or coordinate the activity of  various departments, or convey federal government decisions to  the regions. The administration's status and powers have not  been defined."</p>

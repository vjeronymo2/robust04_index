			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: IBM heads list for US patents International Business Machines ranked first in the number of US patents awarded in 1993, the first time since 1985 that an American company has headed the list. It received 1,088 patents last year, followed by Toshiba, Canon and Eastman Kodak, according to IFI/Plenum Data, a market information service. In 1992, IBM received 842 patents and the top four companies in the US patent stakes were all Japanese. IBM began a concerted effort to increase the number of patents it receives in the early 1990s. These efforts are now beginning to bear fruits, the company said. 'This ranking demonstrates IBM's continued leadership and dedication to innovation and leading-edge technologies,' said Mr Marshall Phelps, IBM vice-president, intellectual property and licensing services. The IBM patents were almost exclusively in the field of information processing, with an increase in software-related inventions. Examples include several multi-media patents as well as patents for a folding computer keyboard, new types of data storage systems and an environmentally safe solvent. 'IBM continues to believe that it has the world's strongest portfolio of patents in the information processing field,' Mr Phelps said. IBM said IBM PC has formed a new unit to increase its commitment to the US federal marketplace. It said IBM PC Co Federal Channel will focus exclusively on federal products and requirements to meet the specialised needs of federal customers.</p>

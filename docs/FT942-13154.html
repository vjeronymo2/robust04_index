			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): DuPont leads surge in Dow industrials Wall Street US stocks surged yesterday afternoon as higher bond prices and strong corporate earnings brought a wave of optimism to the equity markets, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 57.10 higher to 3,705.78, after the NYSE's 'downtick rule', which restricts program-guided buying, was triggered for the second time in three sessions. It was the first day since March 29 that the bellwether blue-chip index closed above the 3,700 level. The more broadly based Standard &amp;Poor's 500 ended 5.08 ahead at 452.71 in moderate trading. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was 2.66 better at 435.97, and the Nasdaq composite gained 8.24 to 730.80. Stocks opened with moderate gains as continued stability in the bond market was sufficient to encourage a flurry of buying as the session got under way.( The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes last month had risen 5.7 per cent from the previous month. With sales declining 9.7 per cent amid February's deep freeze, investors attributed little significance to the data. Later, the longer-dated Treasuries surged as bond traders began to feel more confident that the economic growth was moderating, although there was no fresh news to back up the conviction. Stocks caught the updraft and closed just shy of their session highs. The improvement came after most of the US financial markets announced that they would close Wednesday in honour of former President Richard Nixon, who died at the weekend. The Commerce Department said it would postpone the release of March durable goods data in observance of the national day of mourning. Investors yesterday chose to accentuate the positive, responding enthusiastically to strong first-quarter results released by several companies whose performance is closely linked to the macro-economic cycle. The favourable reaction contrasted with that afforded Caterpillar and Chrysler earlier in the reporting season. Those stocks were hard hit after the companies revealed a solid first-quarter. Yesterday, DuPont led the Dow industrials, jumping Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 58 1/8 . The company posted a 39 per cent surge in net income, excluding a non-recurring gain a year ago. The stock inspired buying in a range of cyclical stocks. International Paper leapt Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 62 3/4 and Caterpillar advanced Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 111-1/8. Goodyear, which is riding high on a strong recovery by the US car industry, gained Dollars 1-1/8 to Dollars 40-1/8. The group said underlying net income climbed 33 per cent in the first quarter. In the automobile sector, Ford was Dollars 2 3/8 ahead at Dollars 57 7/8 and General Motors added Dollars 1-5/8 to Dollars 57 1/4 as investors awaited the companies' results, expected later this week. Chrysler was Dollars 1 1/8 higher at Dollars 49-7/8. Boeing, another Dow component, added Dollars 1 to Dollars 44 3/4 after the company said its 1994 results would come in at the top end of forecasts. The share price improved in spite of a decline in first quarter net earnings. Canada Based on preliminary data, the TSE-300 index added 69.57 points, or 1.67 per cent, to 4,236.73, with advances leading declines 433 to 306. Volume of 52.446m shares was just below Friday's 52.610m shares, and trading value increased to CDollars 675.3mfrom CDollars 609.3m.</p>

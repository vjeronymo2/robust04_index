Romanenko, Hydrobiology Institute at the </F> Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, Kiev; UDC 577.34(282.243.7)]    [Abstract] The keynote address to the 19th International  Congress of the International Danube Limnology Association (MAD)  held in Kiev on 15-21 Sep. 91 is reviewed. Ten reports submitted  to the ``Radiology'' section, seven of which are directly  related to studying the consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear  power plant accident and the other three are dealing with the  radionuclide migration between the aqueous medium and bottom  sediments, geological and hydrogeological structures of the  earth surface and its vegetation, the effect of radiation on  humans, etc., are summarized. In particular, the process of  radioactive cloud formation due to the release of short- and  long-lived radionuclides from the depressurized reactor is  tentatively divided into four phases. All reports by scientists  from four Danube nations presented to the section address the  water ecosystem conditions of the Danube basin; emphasis is  placed on the radioecological conditions which have formed in  the basin of the largest European river contaminated by the  Chernobyl catastrophe. The daily radioactive substance discharge  into the atmosphere in the first days after the accident, the  radionuclide composition of these discharges, the cesium and  strontium accumulation coefficients in some ecosystem  components, and the [.sup]90[/]Sr and [.sup]137[/]Cs  concentration in the Danube water are summarized, and the  radioactive fallout pattern during the early days after the  accident is plotted. It is noted that despite its scope, the  review is not intended to address all aspects of the problem of  radionuclide spread through the Danube and Dnepr ecosystem and  is merely aimed at presenting the principal findings and  conclusions.

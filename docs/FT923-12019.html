			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / International Company News: Strong advance by Blockbuster BLOCKBUSTER, the Florida-based video rental company which takes in the former Cityvision stores in the UK, has reported after-tax profits of Dollars 29.97m in the second quarter of 1992, on revenues of Dollars 264.6m. The profits figure represents a 40 per cent increase from the Dollars 21.4m seen in the same period last year on revenues of Dollars 210.1m, and lifts net profits in the first six months of 1992 to Dollars 55.6m, from Dollars 37.3m. Sales in the six months totalled Dollars 518.6m, against Dollars 386.9m. The strong advance, however, partly reflects Blockbuster's expansion moves. The company said yesterday same-store revenues from the outlets which are owned by the group, rose by 3.5 per cent in the quarter, and by 6.2 per cent in the first six months. Blockbuster shares eased by Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 12 yesterday. Mr Wayne Huisenga, Blockbuster's chairman, said the company was pleased with the figures 'considering the prevailing economic climate and the effect of weaker product availability on the home video industry during the second quarter of 1992, as compared to the similar period of 1991'. Philips Electronics, the Dutch company, holds about 7 per cent of Blockbuster's shares, having exercised an option to purchase an additional 5m shares on June 30, for an investment of Dollars 55m. Blockbuster now encompasses 2,888 stores, of which 1,055 are franchise-owned, and 1,833 are company-owned.</p>

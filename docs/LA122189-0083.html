			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: BALDWIN HILLS;  </P> <P> INCREASE IN CRIME REPORTED  </P> <P> The Baldwin Hills-Ladera Heights area experienced a 11.7% increase in crime  during the first 11 months of this year, with a sharp jump in armed robberies  and vehicle burglaries in the last month.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which patrols the unincorporated  area, said 840 serious crimes were reported through November, up from 752 in  the same period last year.  </P> <P> The largest increases occurred in cases of rape, up 66.6%; robbery, up 44.7%;  larceny and theft, up 32.4%, and vehicle theft, up 17.5%.  </P> <P> In November, the area, which also includes Windsor Hills and View Park, had a  40.8% increase in crime over October levels. The number of armed robberies  jumped from four in October to 13 in November, while vehicle burglaries nearly  quadrupled, from seven to 27.  </P> <P> Capt. Ray Sanchez, head of the marina sheriff's station, said there was "no  rhyme or reason" for the surge of crime in November, although he speculated  that a former prisoner may have been released and was hitting that particular  area. Most of the robberies occurred in Ladera Heights.  </P> <P> Sanchez said the person or people involved in the November incidents had either  been arrested or had moved on to other areas because "whatever happened in  November is not occurring in December."  </P> <P> The number of arrests in the area increased nearly 17% in the first 11 months  of this year.  </P></p>

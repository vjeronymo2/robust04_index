			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed Catherine Moulin, Pierre Cote, Michel </F> Mercier: "Nanofiltration: The Future of Water"]    [Text] Nanofiltration is a membrane technique complying  with a number of limitations, such as the erosion of resources,  increasing demand, the safety of supply networks, and drinking  water quality, while presenting more than one advantage. A  prototype station is supplying the inhabitants of  Auvers-sur-Oise. They are the first people to drink water  treated by nanofiltration which is softened and has no taste of  chlorine.    The development of membrane techniques, which made their  first appearance in water treatment some 10 years ago, is based  on various factors. These include increasingly severe  legislation governing the quality of drinking water, the need to  take into account any possible side effects of treatment due to  the addition of reagents, the erosion of resources, and the  technological progress made to make these processes competitive.    Nanofiltration, which bridges the gap between  ultrafiltration  and reverse osmosis, complies with the new standards for  drinking water. It gives precise control over the quality of the  water produced. Other points in its favor are its compactness  and the simplicity with which it can be used, checked, and  maintained.  <H5>  The Membrane Barrier </H5>   The term nanofiltration is used for membranes that have a  molecular weight removal threshold for organic compounds of  close to 250 daltons. This corresponds to the hypothetical  existence of pores 1 nm in diameter. These composite-type  membranes are formed of a hydrophobic support bearing positively  charged hydrophilic chemical groups. In this way, the  traditional properties of an ultrafiltration membrane are  strengthened by a repulsive force enabling the removal of  similarly charged ionic species and their counterions. It is  these groups that are responsible for the ionic action of the  nanofiltration membranes -- bivalent species are held back at a  rate varying from 70-90 percent, making it an excellent process  for water softening (the removal of Calcium, Ca 2+  [superscript], and magnesium, Mg 2+ [superscript], both  responsible for water hardness) and desulfurization (removal of  SO4 2- [superscript]), while the retention rate for monovalent  ions is lower (less than 60%).  <H5>  Less Chlorine in the Networks </H5>   These membranes are also an excellent physical barrier to  small dissolved molecules and micropollutants such as Atrazine.  They are particularly effective at removing trihalomethane  precursors and humic and fulvic acids.    Another aspect of nanofiltration membranes is their capacity  to retain organic matter. They remove the dissolved  biodegradable organic carbon which is the part of dissolved  organic carbon that feeds the bacteria in supply networks.  Removing it avoids the development of biofilms and therefore  reduces the final rate of chlorination normally used to  disinfect networks.    Lastly, these membranes operate at pressures of less than 10  bars. They therefore couple the ionic advantages of reverse  osmosis with the low operating pressures and consequently  reduced energy consumption of ultrafiltration.  <H5>  The Mery 400,000 Project </H5>   The Ile-de-France water syndicate [SEDIF] supplies drinking  water to 144 communes in the Paris region, representing four  million inhabitants. It is continuing in its efforts to counter  the erosion of resources and to conserve the same water quality  throughout the supply network in a region of growing demand.  This has already been achieved for the treatment processes in  its two largest production plants at Neuilly-sur-Marne and  Choisy-le-Roi (800,000 m3/day).    The Mery 400,000 project is the opportunity to research into  both water production and distribution. At the suggestion of  its administrator, the Compagnie Generale des Eaux [CGE], SEDIF  has set itself the goal of increasing the capacity of the  Mery-sur-Oise plant from 270,000 m3 to 400,000 m3 per day. Fed  by the river Oise, this plant now treats water for 600,000  inhabitants. The main stages in the treatment system are:  preozonation and storage; coagulation and settling; biological  sand filtration; ozonation and biological filtration on granular  activated carbon; postozonation; and finally postchlorination  before distribution.  <H5>  Nanofiltration At Work </H5>   After an initial study into the different processes that  could be used to achieve this aim, SEDIF and CGE wanted to test  nanofiltration by building a prototype plant with a capacity of  2,800 m3/day on the Mery-sur-Oise site.    The membranes in nanofiltration are packed in spiral  modules.  This kind of module has a small dead zone and a relatively low  investment cost. On the other hand, it is very sensitive to  clogging and requires quite exhaustive pretreatment. Two sheets  of membrane are placed on either side of a spacer material. The  three sheets are sealed along three sides to form an envelope.  The open side is attached to a perforated tube that collects  the treated water. The envelope is then wrapped around the tube  with a spacer generating turbulence on the concentrate side.  The rolls of membrane are placed inside a pressure tube with a  system of joints at either end ensuring its watertightness. In  normal operation, the water to be treated circulates in the  interstices formed by the spacer. Pressure forces some of the  water to penetrate the inside of the envelope and to collect in  the central tube.  <H5>  Portrait of a Treatment System </H5>   The use of membranes, the choice of operating conditions  (pressure, tangential velocity, temperature, conversion level,  etc.), and the correct match of pretreatment system to modules  are all of vital importance if system performance is to be  maintained for as long as possible. The stages in a  nanofiltration treatment system are: pretreatment of the raw  water (settling, sand filtration, and 5 5m safety prefilters);  acid conditioning of the raw water to prevent the precipitation  of carbonates and of calcium and magnesium hydroxides;  conditioning by chelating agent for sulfate salts (CaSO2, etc.);  pressurization using a pump; nanofiltration; post-treatment of  the treated water, consisting of restoring the carbonate balance  and, if necessary, remineralizing the raw water (often a simple  aeration is sufficient); and final chlorination.    With a degree of economic and technological progress, we can  envisage the chosen solution producing water with a very low  dissolved, biodegradable organic matter content, and that is  free from pathogens, and softened. This solution also makes it  possible to reduce the number of treatment stages, since water  polishing by nanofiltration replaces the stages of ozonation and  biological filtration on granular activated carbon.  <H5>  The Water at Auvers-sur-Oise </H5>   Started up in July 1992, the nanofiltration prototype has  been supplying the commune of Auvers-sur-Oise (6,000  inhabitants) since February 1993, with the agreement of the  health ministry and the French council for public hygiene.    The water entering the prototype still contains 3.6 mg/l of  dissolved organic carbon, approximately one third of which (1.1  mg/l) is biodegradable and could benefit the regrowth of  bacteria in the distribution network. Its chlorine demand, in  the region of three mg/l may lead to the formation of byproducts  such as chloroform (CHCL3), trihalomethanes (THM), and total  organohalogens (TOX). One half of the organic matter in the  water supplying the prototype is composed of humic substances.  The other major components are hydrophilic acids (30 percent),  carboxylic acids (five to eight percent), and carbohydrates  (five to ten percent). In addition, 75 percent of the dissolved  organic carbon has a molecular weight of less than 5,000  daltons, much of which (25 percent) has a molecular weight of  less than 500 daltons. This justifies the use of nanofiltration  membranes with a removal threshold in the order of 250 daltons.    The water produced after nanofiltration is of a very high  quality. Ninety percent of the dissolved organic carbon is  removed and the dissolved biodegradable organic carbon  concentration is less than the detection limit (0.1 mg/l). The  chlorine is no longer consumed by the organic matter and remains  at a more stable level in the network. The two effects are  complementary: the low concentration in biodegradable organic  matter and the chlorine stability make it easier to protect the  network against bacterial contamination.    It was possible to confirm this on the Auvers-sur-Oise  distribution network which is supplied with nanofiltered water.  A low residual chlorine level at the plant outlet (0.1 mg/l)  was sufficient to keep the water within the bacteriological  standards.    Nanofiltration is therefore considered a leading candidate  for doubling the Mery-sur-Oise plant's capacity. It presents a  number of advantages: the production of water free from  pathogenic micro-organisms, a reduced level of dissolved  biodegradable organic carbon, the notable possibility of  reducing the level of chlorination before distribution and thus  the production of water free from chlorination byproducts, the  removal of micropollutants such as pesticides, and the reduction  of bivalent ions (hardness and sulfates). The inhabitants of  Auvers are the first European consumers of water produced using  this innovative process. There is no doubt that it will find  its place in modern water treatment systems.</p>

It said Taba traded himself for the passengers and was among those freed in  Frankfurt.  </P> <P> The youths -- aged 15 and 16 -- surrendered less than three hours after seizing  the Soviet-made Tupolev-154 owned by Hungary's Malev Airlines.  </P> <P> The hijackers, who were armed with a sawed-off shotgun and a rifle and carried  a fake hand grenade, gave up at Frankfurt Airport when U.S. officials prevented  the plane from taxiing onto the adjoining U.S. military base.  </P> <P> A witness said the youths stormed into a Prague airport lounge located near  boarding gates and started shooting before commandeering the plane.  </P> <P> No one was hit by the gunfire but a policeman fell to the ground, the witness  said.  </P> <P> The two youths were being questioned by police.  </P></p>

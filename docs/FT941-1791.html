			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Inflation figures hit early rate cut hopes Disappointing inflation figures for February dashed hopes of an early cut in base rates and pushed UK share prices down sharply yesterday. Retailers raised prices during the month, particularly on clothing and footwear, following heavy discounting in the January sales. In London the FT-SE 100 index dropped 46.2 points yesterday to 3,155.3, a low for the year. Gilt prices also dropped, with the June long gilt future falling by three-quarters of a point. The retail prices index rose 0.6 per cent month-on-month, according to the Central Statistical Office, more rapidly than the 0.4 per cent analysts had been expecting. The headline rate of inflation, the annual rise in the RPI, fell to 2.4 per cent in February from 2.5 per cent in January, as a substantial increase in February 1993 dropped out of the annual comparison. Analysts had expected the RPI figure would fall to 2.2 per cent. Similarly, the underlying annual rate, which excludes mortgage payments, was unchanged at 2.8 per cent compared with the consensus forecast of a fall to 2.6 per cent. The government's present target range for underlying inflation is 1-4 per cent. Recent inflationary signals have been mixed with weak figures on producer prices in February offset by news of a small rise in the annual rate of growth of average earnings in December. Some traders had been hoping that good inflation figures yesterday might allow the government to reduce base rates from their current 5.25 per cent. However, Mr John Marsland, economist at the broker UBS, said the 'disappointing figure puts back the date of the next rate cut'. Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will hold their next monthly monetary meeting on Wednesday. Analysts think it unlikely that they will want to cut base rates without some evidence that February's inflation figures were a blip rather than a sign of an upsurge in price pressures. Mr Adrian Cooper, UK economist at broker James Capel, said the authorities would want to wait until April 15 when the March inflation figures are announced before making a cut.

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Rolls hit by broker revisions AERO ENGINE group Rolls-Royce had a volatile session and ended up as the worst performer in the FT-SE 100 after several brokers revised their stance on the stock. The shares fell to 121p early in the session after Panmure Gordon reduced its profits estimate for 1993 by Pounds 15m to Pounds 115m, citing cuts in aircraft manufacturers production levels and continued concerns about spares. Leaving his current year forecast at Pounds 72m, Mr Charles Donald at Panmure said next year's dividend will be maintained. Sentiment was further weakened by a BZW profits downgrading and Smith New Court advising investors to 'reduce weighting'. Bargain hunting and the strong market trend helped the shares recover from the earlier lows to end 3 1/2 p down at 126p, in hefty trade of 7.6m. Rank hotel hints A robust defence of its trading performance and disposal strategy was said to have been mounted by Rank Organisation, with hints also in the market that the leisure group may be close to selling some of its hotels to Greenalls, which yesterday announced a rights issue to fund acquisitions. Rank's move to shore up its defence comes in the wake of negative press comment and broker downgrades, with criticism focusing on Rank's high debt level and rumoured sales of some of its core assets. However, Rank was said to have told institutions at a private dinner that its cinema business was not up for sale, that its next set of results would show net debt in retreat and that the dividend would definitely be held. But it was hints in the market that some of the group's hotels, which have been up for sale for several months and are expected to raise around Pounds 300m, may be about to be sold which brought the most cheer. Rank shares jumped 22 to 530p in busy turnover of 2.6m. Some brewery analysts were sceptical that Greenalls would consider one of Rank's high-profile London hotels, arguing that the group would more likely use its Pounds 86m to pick up more smaller offerings. The shares slipped 15 to 344p. Lasmo active Oil group Lasmo caught the market's imagination yesterday as a number of investors decided that worries over the exploration and production group's dividend were beginning to recede. The shares lifted 9 to 176p on very high turnover of 9.3m. A press article on how second-line oil stocks have picked up on the back of a weaker pound sparked wide interest. Lasmo benefited partly because it is the most highly leveraged company in the sector and partly because of its bid attractions. Some analysts suggested there was also switching from Enterprise following the latter's less-than-successful share issue at the weekend. The problems with the issue of American Depositary Shares were highlighted by an announcement that following the offering, Lehman Brothers has been left with about 1.8 per cent of Enterprise's enlarged share capital. Enterprise firmed 9 to 419p. Coats move up The UK's largest textile group Coats Viyella was heavily traded as one house repeated a buy recommendation. The shares jumped a net 12 to 199p on heavier than usual turnover of 4.6m shares. Smith New Court's textile analyst Mr Mark Puleikis published an internal note offering reassurance following worries over the tax charge. The worries were highlighted by a recent ruling by the Financial Review Reporting Panel on Trafalgar House. Mr Puleikis also argues that the company is on a 1993 multiple of 12 times earnings Builders merchant Wolseley was the strongest performer in the market, as it turned in very good results sending the shares racing forward in busy trading of 1.5m. The group showed improvements across the range of its businesses, but in particular France and the US. The shares surged 64 to 408p. Mr Gavin Pomeroy at County NatWest said: 'The shares continue to look fair value and in the long-term the potential for both expansion in the US and recovery in the UK are good.' A strong property sector combined with relief over the scope of its proposed dividend cut lifted Hammerson, the ordinary shares climbing 11 to 201p. The group reported a 25 per cent fall in interim profits, well below City expectations, and promised a halved final dividend. However, a cut had been expected and the removal of uncertainty brought relief to the market, although the company's warning of tough times ahead held back the shares in early muted trading. They rose later on the back of hopes for interest rate cuts which lifted other property stocks. Mr Graham Stanley at County NatWest said: 'If the property market continues weak, then the outlook for Hammerson's office rental income when leases begin to expire is bleak. The dividend could then be under further pressure. We consider the shares too expensive at this level.' Other stocks responding to the improved sentiment yesterday included British Land, up 10 at 173p, Land Securities, 16 ahead at 415p, and MEPC, 9 firmer at 280p. Continuing worries over the coal crisis prompted some switching from the electricity generators into British Gas, up 8 1/2 to 256 1/2 p, and selected water stocks. Of the latter, Anglian rose 10 to 440p. Currency factors gave a boost to ICI, which also announced the sale of its aerospace and defence coatings arm to Courtaulds (up 6 at 460p). ICI bounced 24 to 1027p. SmithKline Beecham rose 15 to 527p in the 'A's and to 468p in the Units on news that the pharmaceuticals group had boosted profits for the third quarter by 8 per cent. Publishing and leisure conglomerate Pearson gained after encouraging messages from SG Warburg in its latest media survey. The shares lifted 21 to 364p. Asda was the top traded stock of the day, with 22m shares changing hands. Dealers said the good two-way business - the shares edging forward a half-penny to 40 1/2 p - was a result of investors taking profits on the rights issue price of 35p a year ago and the positive mood that has accompanied the share price's slow price in recent months. In a strong leisure sector, Forte's rise was hindered by news that US rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's had downgraded some of the group's debt. The shares closed 5 up at 157p. Thorn EMI rose 20 to 790p, County NatWest continuing its strong buy stance. New figures on UK compact disc sales also gave the group a boost. County NatWest was said to be positive on Tiphook and the shares gained 13 to 232p. BAA jumped 29 to 793p, with some switching from British Airways reported. BA crept ahead 2 to 296p, in trade of 3.3m shares. A sell recommendation in IMI from Smith New Court left the shares 9 lighter at 213p. More downgrades hit Glynwed International. The shares fell 3 to 205p after Kleinwort Benson and BZW were reported to have joined the list of brokers revising forecasts. Packaging company CMB fell 55 to 2050p following a forecast downgrade by US investment bank JP Morgan, which cuts its earnings estimates for the group. Financial services company Gerrard &amp; National rose 26 to 306p after announcing an unchanged first-half dividend of 6p and good half-year profits. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (125).

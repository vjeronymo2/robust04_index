SENDS AID FOR HUNGRY ORPHANS  </P> <P> A plane chartered by the United Nations left Switzerland with 20 metric tons of  food and medicine for Liberia, where aid workers said hungry orphans were  wandering through the ruins left by civil war. A team for the U.N. Disaster  Relief Organization said that the city of Monrovia, with a population of  350,000, had neither food nor health care. "Of particular concern are the  registered 90,000 children, of which 10,000 are orphans, many wandering  aimlessly through the city, reduced to skeletons because of malnutrition," the  U.N. team said in an statement issued in Geneva.  </P></p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Insurer fined Pounds 80,000 for breaches of rules LONDON AND Manchester Assurance has been fined Pounds 80,000 by the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation (Lautro) - the largest such fine levied on any insurance company to date - for breaches of sales rules. It has been ordered to pay the costs of the investigation. The breaches occurred among 18 of London and Manchester's 540 tied agency sales outlets, which are not employed by the company directly but which sell its products exclusively. The company has since reviewed its tied agency network and pared the number to 250. Tied agents have been targetted by Lautro for special supervision. All the 19 serious compliance faults uncovered by Lautro in the year to June 30 involved tied agents. London and Manchester is reviewing policies sold by the tied agents and expects to make refunds to customers who were sold policies that were clearly unsuitable. An official said compensation to clients might total 'hundreds of thousands of pounds'. Among the rule breaches were contraventions of the Code of Conduct by company representatives, and London and Manchester's failure to monitor adequately new business they sold. Also, sales agents were not screened properly before being hired and were allowed to sell policies before they were properly qualified. The character and suitability of agents was not properly monitored before or after they were hired, nor were adequate records kept. Lautro said London and Manchester had since strengthened its compliance procedures and improved training and supervision of sales agents.</p>

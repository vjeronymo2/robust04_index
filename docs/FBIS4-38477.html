			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Oksana Boyko: "Ukraine's Integrity and </F> Independence Must Not Be Questioned"]    [Text] The international community, alarmed by a  possibility of negative development of events in the Crimea,  voices its unequivocal support for the position expressed in a  letter by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko sent on 20  May to foreign ministers of other countries and leaders of  international organizations in connection with  anticonstitutional and illegal decisions by the Crimean Supreme  Soviet on the peninsula's status, Yriy Sergeyev, chief of the  Information Department at the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, told  journalists.    On 23 May, Anatoliy Zlenko received U.S. Ambassador to  Ukraine William Miller at his request. The American diplomat  handed the minister a personal message from U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher which, in particular, noted that the  United States recognizes and highly praises Ukraine's  responsible and peaceful position regarding events in the  Crimea. The United States, the message stressed, supports the  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine in its present  borders. The United States seeks to expand and deepen relations  with Ukraine, and would like to move forward rapidly in  assisting Ukraine through economic encouragement programs that  could be beneficial for the entire country, including the Crimea.    The Ukrainian Embassy in Germany said that the German  Foreign  Ministry circulated a declaration by the country's Foreign  Minister Klaus Kinkel that stated the following: "The Federal  Government has been anxiously watching the recent events in the  Crimea. Ukraine's territorial integrity and independence,  necessary for stability and peaceful relations in Europe, must  not be questioned. The Federal Government hopes that all  interested political forces are aware of the meaning of  fundamental obligations within the framework of the CSCE and the  unconditional need to comply with those obligations."    A declaration by Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas  noted that Lithuania would welcome the earliest possible  settlement of the situation that has taken shape in the Crimea  based on the principles of international law. He expressed his  hope that the Crimean peninsula will not become a source of  danger and instability, putting in jeopardy the security of the  region and the entire continent.    Iwo Byczewski, Polish deputy foreign minister, expressed his  understanding of the Ukrainian position and noted that the  situation in the Crimea should be solved only by peaceful means.    Martinsh Virsis, a parliamentary secretary at the Latvian  Foreign Ministry, said he understands Ukraine's anxiety over the  source of destabilization in the Crimea, and assured that Latvia  supports Kiev's position based on generally accepted principles  of international law.    Concern is heard in messages received from Slovakia and  Moldova. Moldova, which knows particularly well what separatism  is all about, understands Ukrainian efforts to create a coherent  state and will support those efforts, the Moldovan deputy  foreign minister stated. Moldova also offered to create some  kind of declaration on preventing separatism along with Ukraine  and Georgia.    Practically all states responded to the letter from official  Kiev. The Crimean issue has recently attracted much attention  from the foreign media. Many publications understand the  current situation and express their concerns. Some draw  parallels with the beginning of the Yugoslav conflict, others of  Karabakh, Sukhumi, the Dniester region (the command of the Black  Sea Fleet and the 14th Army), and so on. Some Russian media  claim that the Crimean situation is instigated by Kiev which  wants to use it as a tool to cancel presidential elections in  Ukraine. On the other hand, Polish media point to some of their  Russian colleagues, particularly from the Ostankino channel,  whose coverage of Crimean events provokes instability on the  peninsula.</p>

This will set up Mr  Kriel for a head-on clash in the election campaign against  African National Congress [ANC] Western Cape premiership nominee  Dr Allan Boesak.    It is understood that Mr Kriel's main "rival" for the post,  Cape administrator Cobus Meiring, fared less well than his  supporters expected.    The party's head council will meet on Monday to integrate  and  finalise the candidate lists but as one senior delegate said, it  would "look very strange" if Mr Kriel did not get the nomination  after the substantial support he received. Cape NP delegates met  at various centres in the province on Saturday to elect  candidates for the national and provincial election lists.    Mr Kriel gained the most support from altogether 1,300  delegates from the rural and metropolitan areas -- meeting in  Worcester and Stellenbosch respectively. There has been much  speculation over recent weeks about the party's top candidate  for the region.    Several months ago Mr Kriel announced he would be standing  for the Western Cape regional parliament and indicated he would  aiming for the top post. Cape administrator Cobus Meiring had  also indicated his willingness to stand for the post.    It is understood that MECs [member of Executive Council]  Peter Marais and Mrs Martha Olckers and MPs Gerald Morkel and  Patrick McKenzie are also placed in the top 10 nominations for  the provincial parliament. Cape NP leader Dr Dawie de Villiers  is believed to have topped the list for national assembly  candidates while finance spokesman Dr Francois Jacobsz, MEC Frik  van Deventer, Deputy Trade and Industry Minister David Graaff  and National Education Minister Piet Marais also are among the  top 10.    All NP candidates lists are expected to be released early  this week before the party's federal congress which starts on  Tuesday at the World Trade Centre in Kempton Park.</p>

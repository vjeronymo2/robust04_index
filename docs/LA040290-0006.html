			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> ASSOCIATION HONORS RANCHO SIMI DISTRICT  </P> <P> Jerry Gladden believes that when it comes to government, smaller is more  effective than larger.  </P> <P> "Some people think that bigger government is better government, but I don't  believe that's so," said Gladden, of the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park  District, who has been recognized for contributions to his group.  </P> <P> The Ventura County Special Districts Assn., representing a group of  independent, nonprofit, largely grass-roots and self-governing organizations,  honored Gladden and three others recently.  </P> <P> Gladden said he is proud that his district puts virtually all its resources  into its operations.  </P> <P> "Every dollar we get goes straight back into the park because there's no place  else we can put it," Gladden said. He said local districts that carry out a  single function are "more efficient."  </P> <P> Others honored were James Meredith, association president; Mark Jacobsen,  association board member, and state Sen. Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara).  </P> <P> Independent special districts are usually formed by area residents to provide  local services, such as resource conservation, mosquito abatement, drainage and  health care. The association's purpose is to improve the organization of and  communication among the 33 special districts of Ventura County.  </P> <P> Two other districts were also honored: the Channel Islands Beach Community  Services District for its curbside recycling program at Hollywood Beach, Silver  Strand and Hollywood-by-the-Sea, and the Oxnard Harbor District for its 50  years of public service to the county.

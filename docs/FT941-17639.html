			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Sport: Odyssey cleared for take-off - Financial Times Round the World Ski Expedition What a start] We only just made it to Jackson Hole for the start of our expedition: the weather 'socked in' so much that it seemed certain we would be forced to spend the night in Salt Lake City. But then the cloak of thick cloud that was blanketing the Rockies along the Utah, Idaho and Wyoming borders cleared and we were free to take off for the final leg of our 5,500-mile journey to the starting gate of our skiing odyssey. It was good to be back in the air. On the ground at Salt Lake we had only been allowed soft drinks. Now, we are arriving at this spectacular ski resort on a magical day, with champagne glasses at the ready. The vast valley floor is blindingly bright with fierce December sunshine glinting off fresh snow straight back into a cold, blue sky. At the airport we feel like thieves as we grab bag after bag from the carousel - 13 in all, including skis. The FT ski expedition does not travel light. One of the most fascinating aspects of our year on skis will be meeting characters such as Bill Briggs. He knows a thing or two about the spectacular jagged-tooth tidal wave that is the Teton mountain range. A bespectacled, slight individual, he walks towards us with a slight crouch: a sort of bow-legged gait as though he's riding an invisible horse. There is a reason for this. Briggs, who runs the ski school at Sotow King, the ski resort at Jackson, Wyoming, was born with a congenital hip problem. Doctors once warned him that he would need new hips and could say goodbye to his skiing career. 'They told me that once they had set my new hips, I would never be able to crouch in the skiing position again,' he said. 'I thought for a moment and said: 'Why can't you set my hips in a skiing crouch instead of standing straight?' So they did.' His decision was to help make local history. One summer's day in 1971, Briggs and two friends battled half way up the Grand Teton, 13,770 feet high. Between them they were carrying his skis. Then, leaving his companions to descend, Briggs continued the climb alone. It was an extremely tough undertaking, not made any easier by having to carry his skis. Eventually he staggered to the top and struggled to get his skis on: 'As fast as I managed to get one ski on, the other one would try to ski off on its own.' Once or twice during an awe-inspiring four-hour epic descent, Briggs thought he had skied his last: he cartwheeled into ravines and spun down couloirs. Finally, breathless and faint, he was safely down - the first man ever to ski the Tetons. For my epic round-the-world journey, I'm skiing with Lucy Dicker from Marseilles. Lucy has undertaken the bulk of the organisation - planning routes, arranging visas etc. And we have no intention of disrupting our trip by getting frostbite or taking unnecessary risks. So Lucy and I will not be following in Bill Briggs's footsteps and ski-tracks; nor will we be tempting fate on our first day by risking some of Jackson Hole's more intimidating runs. Besides, there's one I'm too scared to attempt for a second time: Corbet's haunted me for years before I finally fell (literally) into it four years ago. For five successive winters I had skied gingerly under the rope and edged on skis to the very lip of the abyss before looking down into it. Like some enormous wicked whale's mouth it threatens to drag you in and gobble you up. The problem is that unlike the lethal-looking S &amp; S Couloir round the corner, whose 30-foot leap renders it out of reach for all recreational skiers, Corbet's is just about skiable by any goodish skier. To know it is there, inviting you to test your mettle in its gaping jaws is to know that one day you are going to have to rise to the challenge. But today, the crowded tram has delivered us to the top of the first of the hundreds of ski runs we will encounter this year. We gaze in awe for a few seconds at the vast valley floor, eyes lingering for a moment on the figure of the Sleeping Indian (a mountain which resembles a huge Indian chief with full head-dress lying on his back) perched on top of the distant Gros Ventre range. It means Fat Stomach. Thank goodness Lucy is here to translate. It's January 1, 1994 and we're heading for Rendezvous Trail. Next stop Sun Valley, Idaho. Our skiing odyssey has begun.

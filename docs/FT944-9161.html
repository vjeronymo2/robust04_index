			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Santa Fe delays vote on takeover bids A shareholder vote on the bid battle for Sante Fe Pacific, one of the biggest US railway companies, has been postponed from Friday of this week to Friday December 2 because Santa Fe wants more time to consider competing offers from Burlington Northern, the friendly suitor, and its opponent, Union Pacific, writes Richard Tomkins. Last week Union Pacific produced a revised offer for Santa Fe worth Dollars 3.3bn, part of it in cash and all of it payable immediately. Burlington's latest offer is worth less at Dollars 3.1bn, is an all-share offer, and would not be payable until the deal had been approved by the federal rail regulators.</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> MEETING PLANNED ON HOLLY-SEACLIFF  </P> <P> The Planning Commission has scheduled a special meeting Monday to consider  adopting the development agreement for the sprawling Holly-Seacliff  development, a project being proposed by a subsidiary of the city's largest  landowner.  </P> <P> If approved, the agreement would lock in the developer's right to build the  project in return for the company making certain public improvements.  </P> <P> The hearing, however, is contingent on the agreement being completed by 5 p.m.  Monday. Officials said they plan to work overtime this week to complete it, but  if any unforeseen problems arise, it could push negotiations past the deadline.  </P> <P> Despite protests by Chairwoman Geri Ortega not to rush approval of the  agreement, four commissioners said they support holding the special hearing  Monday. They argued that the commission should bring the issue to the City  Council as soon as possible.  </P> <P> "We really have no say in this matter," said Commissioner Jan Shomaker. "The  City Council will be making the ultimate decision, so I'd like to see it  expedited."  </P> <P> After this week's commission meeting, Ortega said she believes that a majority  of her colleagues want to adopt the agreement as a favor to the developer, a  subsidiary of the Huntington Beach Co. That company is the city's largest and  most influential landholder.  </P> <P> If the commission does not approve the plan by next week, the agreement may not  go before the council until after the Nov. 6 election. And since three  incumbents, all considered pro-development councilmen, are stepping down, some  observers believe that the developer is hoping to sign an agreement before the  new council takes office.  </P> <P> In other action this week, the commission also rescheduled its consideration of  the environmental impact report on the controversial Pierside Village project.  </P> <P> That hearing, which was postponed while city planners try to resolve several  issues with the developer and respond to all public comments made in the  report, is now set for the commission's regular meeting on Oct. 2.

Residents living near the U.S. base held talks with the  government over the court's compromise proposal but the two  sides failed to reach agreement.    Presiding Judge Kiyoshi Uetani said he had decided to give  up  seeking a compromise and will deliver the court's judgment on  the case on March 30.    Some 600 residents are demanding the Japanese Government ban  flights from the base between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m., and pay  compensation for their suffering both in the past and in the  future.    In March 1989, the Tokyo District Court rejected the demand  for a ban on the night flights and compensation for future  annoyance but ordered the government to pay 330 million yen in  compensation for past victimization.    In November 1993, the high court presented a compromise to  the two sides including a proposal that flights not be permitted  between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m.    Although the residents expressed acceptance of the  compromise, the government put forward an alternative offer made  up of other reconciliatory conditions.    The residents were dissatisfied with the government's new  offer and called on the government to state clearly that it will  make an effort to reduce noise levels in future.    The two sides held a total of seven rounds of talks at the  court in order to try and reach a compromise before finally  breaking off the discussions.</p>

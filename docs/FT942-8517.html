			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / World Trade News: JM in Japanese joint venture Johnson Matthey, the UK-based precious metals technology group, has tackled two key elements of its corporate strategy in a deal with Mitsubishi Kasei, the Japanese chemical company, writes Kenneth Gooding, mining correspondent, in London. They are to set up a joint venture to supply sputtering targets to the Japanese semiconductor industry. Mr David Davies, JM's chairman, said yesterday the deal would enable JM immediately to have profitable operations in Japan while at the same time expanding its Electronic Materials business to become worldwide market leader in sputtering targets. Sputtering targets are made of very high purity metal - aluminium or titanium - and used to deposit a thin film on semiconductor chips and computer processors. The market is conservatively forecast by JM to grow from Dollars 170m in 1992 to Dollars 200m by 1995 because the semiconductors are used in the fast-growing personal computer and portable telephone markets. The partners will merge their existing Japanese operations into the new joint company, Ryoka Matthey, which will continue to manufacture at a plant in Noetsu. Ryoka Matthey is expected to employ 50, have sales of Dollars 18m and net assets of about Dollars 15m.</p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / World Trade News: EC and SADC unveil plans for closer links The European Union and the Southern African Development Community (SADC), which groups the region's 11 countries, will today unveil a programme aimed at increasing closer economic co-operation between the organisations. 'The time is ripe for the co-operation between both our regions to move on to a new stage,' said Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister. He was speaking on behalf of EU foreign ministers in Berlin at the opening of the first high-level ministerial meeting with SADC. EU and SADC officials said they would identify a number of projects, ranging from telecommunications and transport to infrastructure and energy, which would be supported by Brussels. However, SADC officials stressed they were not in Berlin to ask for assistance. 'This is not a donor's conference. It is not a pledging conference,' said Mr Kaire Mbuende, the SADC executive secretary. 'It is about SADC trying to base its relations with the EU on trade, genuine co-operation, and investment. We want to create institutional mechanisms for a partnership between the two regions.' SADC is the successor to the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference, which was set up in 1980 to reduce its members' trade with South Africa. It was renamed SADC in 1992 and the organisation shifted its policies from opposition to South Africa to economic development. The member states are Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Namibia and Zambia. Mr Mbuende said inter-regional trade amounts to no more than 6 per cent of total trade. To increase this volume, he hoped the SADC would agree to a trade promotional protocol by January 1995. This would facilitate greater mobility of capital and investments in the region. Most of the SADC economies maintain complex trade and tariff regulations which will take a long time to dismantle. In addition, the relative size of South Africa - it contributes over 75 per cent to a regional GDP of around Dollars 125bn (Pounds 80.6bn) - makes other countries nervous of being flooded with cheaper South African goods should all restrictions be removed. Mr Mbuende said SADC has to start thinking about harmonising its regional travel, visa, banking, currency and trading relations. EU officials yesterday said a more integrated and co-ordinated SADC economic structure would help improve trade and investment links with the EU. The EU already buys more than a quarter of SADC's exports. Over the past 20 years, Brussels has extended Ecu4.6bn (Dollars 5.61bn) in financial and technical aid. More than Ecu110m has already been earmarked this year for a special programme set up to dismantle the remaining vestiges of apartheid in South Africa.</p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY ROUNDUP: OREGON LURES COMPANY WITH LOTTERY MONEY  </P> <P> Interactive Machines is moving its headquarters from Calabasas to Beaverton,  Ore., after being lured by the Oregon Economic Development Department.  </P> <P> The department said $75,000 from Oregon's state lottery was loaned to  Interactive Machines, which makes high-performance computer-graphics machines  used by aerospace companies and in movie special effects and commercials.  </P> <P> Oregon officials said Interactive Machines used the money to underwrite the  cost of moving, to renovate a building for its new headquarters and to pay  moving expenses for some key employees. The loan will be forgiven if the  company employs at least 50 people there in 1992.  </P></p>

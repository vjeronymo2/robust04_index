			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Greater Atlanta (7): Fanfare for new airport facilities - Transportation On September 21, Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport opened its new Dollars 305m international facility - Concourse E - with as much fanfare as it could possibly muster. Hartsfield's managers had good reason to create as much hoopla as possible, for the facility's opening was the first positive news at the airport in a long time. From 1992 until just two months ago, when the name Hartsfield appeared in headlines it was more often than not accompanied by the words 'scandal' and 'corruption.' An investigation had uncovered corruption in the airport's concession business. Some of the leading figures in Atlanta's city council, including Mr Ira Jackson, the former aviation commissioner whose responsibility it was to run Hartsfield, were found to have accepted bribes from a company which had been awarded valuable contracts to run some of the airport's concessions business. Since that investigation, Mr Jackson and several other defendants, including the operator of the airport's Paradies chain of shops, have been convicted of various bribery, fraud and conspiracy charges. The concessions scandal did more than just sully the airport's and the city's reputation. The slow progress of the investigation and the court cases delayed the raising of new funds for the airport and the completion of important projects, including the construction of Concourse E and the building of a huge new atrium at the main terminal. Ms Angela Gittens, who was given the task of restoring Hartsfield's reputation when she was appointed Atlanta's aviation general manager in November 1993, admits that morale at the airport was very low when she arrived - 'we'd been wallowing for quite some time . . . decisions were not getting made. We couldn't go forward (with the new concourse) because the principal concessionaire was involved in the scandal. It held up lot of things.' The delays set back the international concourse project, and the cost of the facility ballooned from an originally projected Dollars 244m to more than Dollars 300m. Consequently, Ms Gittens made opening Concourse E on schedule her top priority last November. It was a struggle at first, she says - 'it was about dealing with all of the pieces. To finish the terminal we had to get the financing. To sell the bonds we had to get (certain) agreements with the airlines. To get the agreements with the airlines, several issues outstanding had to be settled . . . we moved forward, piece by piece.' The airport's managers, however, now believes the worst of the scandal is behind them, although there is still some controversy over the fact that the company at the heart of the corruption scandal - Paradies - continues to operate its Hartsfield concessions. Under Ms Gittens, however, the system for awarding concessions contracts has been changed  - 'we are now looking for business acumen (from bidders), not political influence,' she says. Ultimately, the hope is that the opening of Concourse E and the completion of the main terminal atrium will focus attention on Hartsfield's future, not its past. Concourse E is both an impressive sight - it is the largest international airport terminal in the US - and an important addition to Hartsfield, which had outgrown its previous international facilities. It has 24 gates with room for another ten, and it can handle up to 6,000 passengers an hour, compared to just 3,400 in the old concourse. Hartsfield needed a new international facility because its non-domestic traffic, currently five per cent of total passenger traffic, is expected to grow in coming years, especially to and from Latin America. This is primarily a reflection of the airport's reputation as an excellent connecting hub. Traditionally, Hartsfield has handled more passengers joining connecting flights than 'origin and destination' passengers, but that is changing. While origin and destination passengers accounted for just 26 per cent of total traffic four years ago, today they account for 40 per cent - 'we're no longer just an airport where people change planes,' says Ms Gittens. In some ways, Hartsfield is a microcosm of the US commerical aviation business. In 1991, the economic recession and the financial crisis among many domestic carriers led to a sharp drop in passenger traffic and revenues, especially after Eastern Airlines, which used Atlanta as a hub, went out of business. Yet, the industry - and with it Hartsfield - has been slowly recovering from the losses and turmoil of the early 1990s, aided by the growth of the local economy and the arrival of a number of new, predominantly low-cost airlines. The business which was lost when Eastern collapsed has been more than recouped with business from new start-up carriers such as ValuJet, Air South and National Airlines, all of which fly out of Hartsfield. Ms Gittens says that 'in some ways, Eastern's demise - while unfortunate in terms of the economy of the area and jobs - created some opportunities for other carriers, and for more origin and destination traffic. And it offered the Atlanta-area flying public some opportunities for lower fares.' Hatsfield has been fortunate in that it has not borne the brunt of the downsizing by Delta. The financially-strapped airline is headquartered in Atlanta, uses the airport as its main hub, and is the region's biggest private employer. Although Delta is in the middle of a huge cost-cutting programme, Ms Gittens says the carrier has been expanding its operations at Hartsfield recently. For now, Altanta's airport looks well set for the future. The Olympic games in 1996 will give it a chance to grab the spotlight, and see how well its new international concourse handles a sudden inflow of overseas passengers. They are likely to be impressed. Hartsfield is user-friendly, with well-designed terminals connected by an efficient underground rail system, and linked to Atlanta by a fast and cheap rapid-transit line, the Marta. These assets have not been overlooked by passengers. For the past four years, Hartsfield has been selected the best airport in North America by readers of Business Traveler magazine. With its new international concourse, and soon a handsome new atrium in the main terminal, Atlanta's airport is aiming for five in a row.  -----------------------------------------------------------                     OFFICE MARKET  -----------------------------------------------------------                                   Million    sq ft                                    1993      1992  ----------------------------------------------------------- Total market                       86.2      87.4 Vacancy space                      14.5      17.8 Under construction                  0.0       0.4 New space added                     0.3       3.0 Net absorption                      3.0       2.6 Vacancy rate                       16.8%     20.3%  -----------------------------------------------------------                 INDUSTRIAL MARKET  -----------------------------------------------------------                                   Million    sq ft                                    1993      1992  ----------------------------------------------------------- Total market                      261.0     255.1 Vacant space                       22.4      25.4 Under constrcn                      2.5       2.3 New space added                     5.9       3.9 Net absorption                      8.8       7.9 Vacancy rate                        8.6%     10.0%  -----------------------------------------------------------                    RETAIL MARKET  -----------------------------------------------------------                                   Million    sq ft                                    1993      1992  ----------------------------------------------------------- Total market                       82.1      78.2 Vacant space                        8.8       9.5 Under constrcn                      1.8       2.7 New space added                     3.9       0.8 Net absorption                      4.6       1.4 Vacancy rate                       10.7%     12.1%  ----------------------------------------------------------- Transactions in the the industrial property market involved 25.1m sq ft in 1993, compared with 22.9m sq ft in 1992.

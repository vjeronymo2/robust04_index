			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / International Company News: Setbacks for Belgian retailers The impact of the recession on Belgian retailing was highlighted last week after two of the country's largest retailers announced significant falls in annual profits. GIB, the international retailing group and Belgium's largest private-sector employer, reported a net loss of BFr3.5bn (Dollars 102m) last year, against a profit of BFr3.26bn in 1992. Delhaize 'le Lion' group, which has a strong presence in the US, reported 1993 net consolidated profits of BFr1bn, down from BFr6.3bn in 1992. Both groups insisted that the falls were partly due to restructuring and redundancy programmes implemented in Belgium and the US. In particular, GIB said the reorganisation of its Sarma unit had resulted in BFr5.5bn of extraordinary costs. Meanwhile, exceptional charges arising from the closure of 88 Food Lion supermarkets in the US in 1994 reduced Delhaize's profits by BFr1.6bn. Nevertheless, broadly flat sales and turnover also eroded profits. Sales in GIB's European hypermarket and supermarket sector, which represent 61 per cent of total group sales, fell by 0.8 per cent last year. Although this was partly offset by 9 per cent growth in the European DIY sector, total group sales rose by only 2.2 per cent in 1993. Delhaize's sales in Belgium rose by 2.5 per cent, to BFr93.4bn. In the US, sales in the Food Lion group rose by 5.8 per cent to Dollars 7.6bn.</p>

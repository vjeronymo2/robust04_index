			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE LEADERS HONOR ROSA PARKS  </P> <P> Rosa Parks, whose refusal to move to the back of the bus 35 years ago was a key  moment in the civil rights struggle, was honored Thursday by House Democratic  leaders, who said she had changed the nation.  </P> <P> "Rosa, let me thank you personally for sitting down so long ago so I could  stand here today," said Rep. William H. Gray III (D-Pa.), the House Democratic  whip, who credited Parks with triggering changes that have allowed blacks such  as himself to attain high office.  </P> <P> Parks' 77th birthday on Sunday will be marked by a black-tie national tribute  at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.  </P> <P> In anticipation of that event, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and  other House Democrats appeared with Parks at a news conference.  </P> <P> "Sometimes it takes one person to say no, and a whole series of events follow,"  Foley said. "There are few people that can say they changed the nation. Rosa  Parks changed the nation."  </P> <P> Her refusal to surrender her seat to a white passenger on a Montgomery, Ala.,  city bus on Dec. 1, 1955, led to a citywide bus boycott that lasted 381 days.  </P></p>

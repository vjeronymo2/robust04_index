			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Water shares unsettled Dealers in water company shares took defensive action at the start of trading after the poor showing by the Conservative Party in local elections. Waters are the only sector the opposition Labour Party has said it would take back into public ownership if it regained power at the next general election. Shares were marked down by around 5p but little selling ensued and prices mostly rallied to show small gains at one point. They slipped again towards the close. Several features emerged in the sector, which was hit late on Thursday by the unravelling of a number of Water Packages. The proceeds of the unravelling were reinvested in the water stocks represented in the Footsie index. North West was one rose well to close 2 1/2 higher at 307 1/2 p, having been cut to 300p at the outset. Turnover was 5.2m. The Water Package retreated to Pounds 2968 early in the session but picked up to close only 28 off at Pounds 3040. Mr Steve Doe at Smith New Court said the market had been disappointed at the outcome of the elections but said the sector was now a 'solid hold'. Other analysts said they expected the shares to at least track the market ahead of the flotation of the Scottish power generators. It was pointed out, however, that many more of the remaining water package units would be broken up ahead of July 12 when dealings in the unit cease; 'Big funds will continue to focus on the easily tradeable Footsie-type stocks,' said an analyst. Bid stories revived The dearth of new takeover speculation found traders seeking to revive old stories. They focused on the one that Smiths Industries would attempt either to effect a friendly merger or, if this failed, use its large cash resources to acquire Dowty, the aerospace components group. The two groups already have trading links through a joint venture. The basis for the story was supposed stakebuilding by one investment house. A week ago yesterday S G Warburg bid persistently for stock, but rival marketmakers doubted whether the quantities were sufficient to invoke the Companies Act requirement regarding the disclosure of a shareholding in excess of 3 per cent. Analysts dismissed the possibility of a bid, saying the speculation was bound to happen sometime with Smiths sitting on cash and Dowty struggling. Dowty shares rose 6 to 190p on light turnover of 1.1m while Smiths remained at 269p. Tomkins benefits Conglomerate Tomkins reached towards a year's high, benefiting from both overseas and domestic influences. The recent strength of the dollar was foremost, since 70 per cent of group profits are derived from the US following integration of the Philips Industries acquisition. Also, the US economy seems to be moving out of recession more quickly than the UK. Tomkins has held talks recently with institutional investors, and some traders feel these might have been soundings for a possible UK acquisition. Analysts believe such a purchase is necessary to redress the current high exposure to North American sales. Tomkins closed a penny better at 332p, just a few pence off the 1991 peak. The recent switching in the bank issues, out of Lloyds and into NatWest, was reversed. Lloyds picked up strongly to close 8 higher at 345p on 4m. NatWest ran back 10 to 330p after news of the US preference share issue. A seller of Standard Chartered depressed the stock 7 to 384p. Kleinwort Benson edged up 6 to 330p. A County NatWest sell note left Sedgwick 5 lower at 248p. CE Heath, hit recently by a bearish note from BZW, dropped 10 more to 498p. Confirmation of the boardroom reshuffle - the chairman and chief executive will retire in July, a year earlier than planned - deflated Allied-Lyons. At the close the stock was 9 down at 552p, but up 32 on the week owing to takeover speculation. Concern that Allied Colloids would not be able to match last year's profits of Pounds 41.3m left the shares down 19 at 140p. Analysts have lowered their sights and now expect the company to reveal annual profits, when its reports on June 7, of around Pounds 37.5m. Smith New Court has long been on the sell tack, believing that the premium rating of the stock was not justified. Burton was unchanged at 96p on 5.3m and was supported by reports that it is close to selling Harvey Nichols, the department store, for Pounds 60m. According to the report,Burton had been hoping for Pounds 100-120m. Analysts said Pounds 60m for Harvey Nichols would be earnings enhancing for Burton and should lift the shares. However, Burton denied that it had clinched the sale of the store. Ratners rose 3 1/2 to 169p on a recommendation from Hoare Govett, which said the shares were underrated. Mr Bill Currie of Hoare said: 'The worries about Mr Gerald Ratner's recent comments about the quality of his goods are overdone. Consumers will soon have forgotten about them.' Kwik Save rose 7 to 599p as Panmure Gordon recommended the stock on the basis of its strong earnings potential and the conservative treatment of its accounts. Investors were advised to switch out of Tesco, down a penny at 295p and Asda, off 1 1/2 at 121p. Talk of an equity issue by Cadbury Schweppes refused to die and the shares fell 7 to 376p. Speculation about a convertible bond issue to fund an overseas bid, possibly Dr Pepper/7-Up of the US, was once again mentioned. While not ruling out an equity issue at some stage, most analysts remained sceptical about the likelihood of an immediate issue. Torday &amp; Carlisle, the specialist engineering company, continued to give ground. It warned on Tuesday that interim profits would fall short of last year's. The order book at Oldham Signs has fallen off during the first quarter and there is little indication of an early improvement, said a researcher. The shares closed 3 easier for a loss on the week of 37 to 117p. Industrial materials group Morgan Crucible recovered further to 238p, up 9, on a buy recommendation combined with hints of the rights issue having been a success. Kalon, the Yorkshire paint maker, recorded exceptionally heavy turnover as Smith New Court placed 21m shares with a range of institutional investors. The shares, 17.6 per cent of the equity capital, were sold by interests of the Silver family, long-standing large shareholders, to lengthen the shareholders list. Double counting of the deal boosted turnover in the stock, slightly easier at 57p, to 44m shares. Ocean Group rose 3 to 356p as the 4.1m rump of the recent Pounds 88m rights issue was placed at 348p. Brent Walker, which has come under periodic bouts of selling pressure as the market has focused on the group's heavy debts, were hit hard first thing. The shares dropped to 48p at one point, before rallying to close a net 6 off at 53p; turnover totalled 1m. There were suggestions in the market that Brent Walker might be considering a a straightforward sale of its William Hill bookmaking chain, or a possible stock market flotation of the division, which it bought from Grant Metropolitan a couple of years ago for a bank-financed Pounds 560m. Norman Hay recovered more strongly, closing 5 higher at 36p on news that the shareholding held by T E Brown had risen to 5 per cent. Dauphin, the office equipment company, progressed to a 1991 high of 115p, up 7. According to County NatWest, the company is well managed and has a strong balance sheet.

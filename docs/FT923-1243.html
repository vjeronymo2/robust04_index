			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Arts: I Capuleti e i Montecchi - Opera The bomb-scare at the Theatre Museum late on Tuesday afternoon played havoc not only with Covent Garden traffic, but also with the schedules of the theatres in the vicinity. In the case of the Royal Opera House, it prevented the Pier Luigi Pizzi sets for Bellini's Capuleti from reaching the stage until impractically late in the evening, which in turn resulted in the first performance of its latest revival being given in limited form - in costume but without props or set-change. Generously, the house offered the show free, with money-back and re-booking facilities as part of the deal; those who decided to remain and wait out the 45-minute delay before curtain-up seemed not to mind the limitations. And indeed, anyone who recalls the static, tableaux-by-numbers quality of Pizzi's own production in its original (1984) estate is unlikely to have indulged in an excess of hand-wringing over its trimmed-down presentation. As sometimes happens in such circumstances, the audience spirit of mucking-in and the performers' determination to deliver their utmost came together to provide an enjoyable evening. The opera is, of course, indomitably enjoyable in its own right - early Bellini, peculiarly pithy and candid in its musical and dramatic qualities, a Romeo and Juliet pared down to essentials. In addition (and given that one should judge any such performance with proper caution), the evidence of careful, thoughtful musical preparation was everywhere apparent. For this we must obviously thank Daniele Gatti (who first came to the house earlier in the year, as conductor of another Bellini opera, I puritani). He allows not a moment of slackness or routine; he encourages the players to dig into the lines as though no critical disapproval of Bellini's scoring had ever seen the light of day. His ardour is winning, even though my own taste in Bellini interpretation is for a far less frenziedly assertive directorial personality, less pushing of the voices, less beating-out of every rubato, altogether greater lyrical spontaneity. In truth, the performance was also enjoyable in spite of the absence of a single cast-member who could honestly be reckoned a born Bellinian. The men matter, of course, less than the women (though the wooffy Italian enunciation of the basses was distressing, and Keith Lewis, a Tebaldo remembered from 1985 revival, sounded in poor vocal form). Amanda Roocroft (Juliet) made pretty, easily emitted sounds above the stave (and her familiar gummy ones lower down); she has worked touchingly hard on the role, without so far evincing the faintest glimmer of instinct for either the Bellinian line or the drama that should emerge out of it. More problematic was the immensely distinguished presence of Anne Sofie von Otter, undertaking here her first Romeo. She looks wonderful: tall, trimly adolescent and athletic. She sings words and phrases with her usual, admirable musicality; the tone, when not pinched by the highest reaches of the role, is beautiful. What she lacks is the essential Italianate attack, colour-variety, forwardness of personality. In my view she is unsuited to the bel canto repertory, and the disadvantages, even possibly the dangers of her further exploration thereof should not be underestimated. In repertory at Covent Garden until October 14</p>

			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Coats in talks over Youghal minorities COATS Viyella, the textile group, is in talks which could lead to it making an offer for the 28.2 per cent of Youghal Carpets it does not already own. However, any offer for the County Cork-based company would probably be 'at a substantial discount to the current market price' it said. Youghal's shares were quoted yesterday at 13p, unchanged on the day, but have risen from 2p recently, a rise which forced the announcement. Coats made an agreed bid for Youghal in 1987 at 1p a share but a minority of holders did not accept. At the time of the bid Jaykeel Investments, an independent investment company based in the Channel Islands, had started to build a stake in Youghal and now holds 18 per cent. Youghal has suffered worsening losses in recent years. In 1991 pre-tax losses were IPounds 3.7m (Pounds 3.88m) and in the first half of 1992 it lost a further IPounds 2.2m.</p>

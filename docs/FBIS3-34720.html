This was stated by a Foreign  Office spokesman in Islamabad today. He said the Indian  External Affairs Ministry's statement blaming Pakistan for the  deteriorating situation in held- Kashmir is totally baseless.  The Indian accusation came in the wake of the statement by the  head of the U.S. South Asia Bureau, Miss Robin Raphel, that the  two conflicts in Afghanistan and Kashmir were similar which are  exacting a terrible toll of civilians.    The spokesman said it is not only the United States, but  almost every member of the United Nations which understands that  the killings in occupied Kashmir are the consequence of the  repression of Kashmiri people's quest for the right to  self-determination. The Indian accusation about terrorism, the  spokesman said, has been disproved. He said if India believes  in its own propaganda, it should agree to Pakistan's proposal to  station UN observers group For India and Pakistan or any other  impartial monitors along the Line of Control in Kashmir.</p>

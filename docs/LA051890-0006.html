			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLEASURE IN THEIR COMPANY  </P> <P> Nothing tells us so much about ourselves as the things in which we take  pleasure. But, relentless categorizers that we are, we classify even these:  Some we call harmless; others, guilty pleasures.  </P> <P> A few are more special yet. Wednesday, two men died who have given us pleasures  of that latter sort -- the sort in which we can take pride.  </P> <P> Sammy Davis Jr., who was 64, described himself as "a saloon entertainer," who  had earned his audience's respect "because people say . . . 'he's always going  to give you your money's worth.' " But, quintessential song-and-dance man  though he was, he gave something more. He tirelessly brought his enormous gifts  to bear on the struggle to force the American conscience to come to grips with  the indignity and dishonor of racial discrimination. If that's the sort of  entertainment to be had in saloons, make ours a double.  </P> <P> Jim Henson, who was 53, took an ancient diversion, puppeteering, and turned it  into an expressive art made wholly new by its wit and warmth. Since their debut  in 1969, the characters he created for "Sesame Street" have fanned out across  the globe to instruct and delight children in 80 countries. Henson's  sensibility married a child's heart and an adult's conscience. His puppets'  appeal transcended generations because they reminded us of the children we once  were, and suggested to our children what they might hope to be.  </P></p>

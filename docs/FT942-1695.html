			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Pledge on Post Office sell-off The government is satisfied that privatisation of the Post Office would not lead to the imposition of value added tax on stamps, trade and industry minister Mr Patrick McLoughlin told MPs yesterday, David Owen writes. He said the changes being considered posed no threat to the universal nationwide tariff structure of the Post Office, nor to the commitment to maintain a nationwide delivery service. A green paper setting out options for Royal Mail and Parcelforce, the parcels arm of the Post Office, would be published shortly. Mr John Major recently asked Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to redraft the green paper, which was understood to have leaned heavily in favour of privatising 51 per cent of the Post Office, leaving the rest in government hands. Some Tory backbenchers would prefer to leave the Post Office entirely in the public domain. Ministers are considering whether to include a bill to change its status in next year's legislative timetable. While Mr McLoughlin's comments on VAT will reassure backbenchers, they may worry the private-sector competitors of the Post Office, some of whom are concerned that the organisation might secure an unfair competitive edge. Questioned by Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, on what the government's reaction would be if consultations revealed that most customers did not want to see the Post Office privatised, Mr McLoughlin said the government would 'take note' of what was said.</p>

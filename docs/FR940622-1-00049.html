This amendment was submitted in response to EPA's conclusion that although residues in poultry from existing and proposed uses are expected to be nondetectable, tolerances should be set at the limit of quantitation and that the residue to be regulated is bifenthrin per se and not the 4'hydroxy metabolite. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The scientific data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. The toxicological data considered in support of the proposed tolerances include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Metabolism studies in rats with single doses of 4 and 35 mg/kg demonstrate that about 90 percent of parent compound and its hydroxylated metabolites are excreted. With doses of 0.5 mg/kg/day, significant bioaccumulation of the parent compound can occur in tissues with high fat content, with half-lives in these tissues of about 50 days. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. A 12-month feeding study in dogs fed dose levels of 0, 0.75, 1.5, 3.0, or 5.0 milligrams(mg)/kilogram (kg)/day with a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of 1.5 mg/kg/day. The lowest-effect level (LEL) for this study is established at 3.0 mg/kg/day based on the occurrence of intermittent tremors in the test animals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. A developmental toxicity study in rats given gavage doses of 0, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg/kg/day with maternal and fetal NOELs at 1.0 mg/kg/day. The maternal NOEL is based on the occurrence of tremors, and the fetal NOEL is based on an increased incidence of hydroureter without hydronephrosis at the 2.0-mg/kg/day dosage level. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. A developmental toxicity study in rabbits given gavage doses of 0, 2.67, 4, or 8 mg/kg/day with no developmental toxicity observed under the conditions of the study. The maternal NOEL is established at 4 mg/kg/day based on the occurrence of twitching and tremors at the 8 mg/kg/day dosage level. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. A two-generation reproduction study in rats fed diets containing 0, 30, 60, or 100 ppm with no reproductive effects or developmental toxicity observed under the conditions of the study. The maternal NOEL for the study is established at 30 ppm (equivalent to 5 mg/kg/day) based on lower body weight in females. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Mutagenicity tests, including gene mutation in Salmonella, chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary and rat bone marrow cells, HGPRT locus mutation in mouse lymphoma cells, and unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes, were all negative. Bifenthrin was marginally active in a forward mutation test involving the thymidine kinase locus in mouse lymphoma cells. These test results indicate a low mutegenic potential for bifenthrin. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. A 24-month feeding/carcinogenicity study with rats fed diets containing 0, 12, 50, 100, or 200 ppm with a systemic NOEL of 50 ppm (equivalent to 2.5 mg/kg/day) based on tremors, elevated body weight, and higher liver and kidney organ-to-body weight ratios. There were no carcinogenic effects observed under the conditions of the study. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. A carcinogenicity study with mice fed diets containing 0, 50, 200, 500, or 600 ppm (equivalent to 7.5, 30, 75, or 90 mg/kg/day) for 87 weeks (males) and 92 weeks (females) with a statistically significant trend for hemangiopericytomas of the urinary bladder of male mice. In this study, male mice in the high-dose group (600 ppm) showed an increase in the number of hemangiopericytomas of the urinary bladder as compared to the control group. Although the number of hemangiopericytomas was twice as high in male mice at the high dose level compared to the control animals, the difference in rate of tumors between the control group and the high-dose group was not statistically significant by pair-wise comparison. There were also significant dose-related trends in hepatocellular carcinomas and in the combined hepatocellular adenomas and/or carcinomas in male mice. Female mice had significantly higher incidences of combined lung adenomas and carcinomas in the 50, 200, and 600 ppm groups, although there was no significant dose-related trend. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bifenthrin has been classified by the Office of Pesticide Programs' Health Effect's Division's Carcinogenicity Peer Review Committee (CPRC) as a Group C carcinogen, i.e., possible human carcinogen. The Agency has chosen to use the reference dose calculations to estimate human dietary risk from bifenthrin residues. The decision supporting classification of bifenthrin as a possible carcinogen (Group C) rather than a probable carcinogen (Group B) was primarily based on the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Evidence for carcinogenicity was only observed in mice; no compound- related increases in tumors were observed in the carcinogenicity study in rats. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. It is unlikely that the hemangiopericytomas observed in the mouse study were malignant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Mutagenicity studies do not support Group B classification for bifenthrin. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Feeding studies using structurally related pyrethroids, which were classified as Group C carcinogens by the CPRC, have resulted in increased incidences of lung tumors in female mice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A dietary exposure/risk assessment was performed for bifenthrin using a Reference Dose (RfD) of 0.015 mg/kg of body weight/day. The RfD is based on an NOEL of 1.5 mg/kg/day from the 1-year feeding study in dogs, which demonstrated intermittent tremors in test animals at the lowest effect level, and an uncertainty factor of 100. The current estimated dietary exposure for the overall U.S. population resulting from established tolerances is 0.000385 mg/kg bwt/day, which represents 2.6 percent of the RfD. The current action will increase exposure to 0.001935 mg/kg bwt/day or 12.9 percent of the RfD. In the subgroup population exposed to the highest risk, nonnursing infants less than 1 year old, the current action would increase exposure to 0.007404 mg/kg bwt/day or 49.4 percent of the RfD. Generally speaking, EPA has no cause for concern if total residue contribution for published and proposed tolerances is less than the RfD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA concludes that the chronic dietary risk of bifenthrin, as estimated by the dietary risk assessment, does not appear to be of concern. The cancer risk to humans is considered negligible, given the weight of evidence considerations, which only support the classification of bifenthrin as a possible carcinogen, and the low level of exposure to bifenthrin residues in the human diet. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The metabolism of the chemical in plants and animals for this use is adequately understood. Although a processing study shows some concentration of bifenthrin residues in corn oil, EPA has determined that a section 409 food additive regulation is unnecessary because it is unlikely that the bifenthrin residues in corn oil will exceed the limit of quantification tolerance that is being established for bifenthrin in corn grain. Analysis of the field trial data indicates that bifenthrin residue levels in corn grain will be lower than the grain tolerance by a factor greater than the concentration factor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An adequate analytical method, gas-liquid chromatography, is available for enforcement purposes. The enforcement methodology has been submitted to the Food and Drug Administration for publication in the Pesticide Analytical Manual, Vol. II (PAM II). Because of the long lead time for publication of the method in PAM II, the analytical methodology is being made available in the interim to anyone interested in pesticide enforcement when requested from: Calvin Furlow, Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Divisions (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 1132, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-305-5232. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On August 5, 1988, EPA issued a conditional registration and time-limited tolerance for bifenthrin for use on cottonseed with an expiration date of October 31, 1991 (see the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of August 15, 1988 (53 FR 30676)). On November 12, 1992, the conditional registration was amended and extended to November 15, 1993, and the tolerance on cottonseed extended to November 15, 1994 (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Registers <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of October 20, 1993 (58 FR 54094) and February 22, 1994 (59 FR 9411)). On November 15, 1993, EPA amended the registration on cottonseed by extending the expiration date to November 15, 1996. The registration was amended and extended to allow time for submission and evaluation of additional environmental effects data. In order to evaluate the effects of bifenthrin on fish and aquatic organisms and its fate in the environment, additional data were required to be collected and submitted during the period of conditional registration. Such requirements included a sediment bioavailability and toxicity study and a small-plot runoff study that must be submitted to the Agency by July 1, 1996. To be consistent with the extension issued for the conditional registration, the Agency is proposing to extend the tolerance on cottonseed and other commodities, and establish a time-limited tolerance on corn (field, seed, and pop) with an expiration date of November 15, 1997, to cover residues expected to result from use during the period of conditional registration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The pesticide is considered useful for the purposes for which it is sought. Based on the information and data considered, the Agency concludes that the proposed section 408 tolerances and extension will protect the public health. Therefore, it is proposed that the tolerances be established as set forth below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein may request within 30 days after publication of this document in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the FFDCA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation indicating the document control number, [PP 0E3921/P584]. All written comments filed in response to this petition will be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address given above from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental protection, Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticides and pests, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: June 2, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Stephen L.

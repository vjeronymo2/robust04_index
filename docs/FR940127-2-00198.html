This statement must include the reasons, with appropriate supporting documentation, as to why the proposed project falls within a particular exclusion or exclusions. If the proposed project falls within one or more of the categorical exclusions, the specific exclusion(s) must be identified. The information submitted in association with NEPA compliance should be identified in the Table of Contents as ``NEPA Considerations'' and the narrative statement with supporting documentation shall be placed at the back of the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Even though a project may fall within the categorical exclusions, CSRS may determine that an EA or an EIS is necessary for a proposed project should substantial controversy on environmental grounds exist or if other extraordinary conditions or circumstances are present that may cause a project to have a significant environmental effect. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Where and When to Submit Grant Applications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All copies of each proposal must be mailed in one package and each copy must be stapled securely in the upper left-hand corner.

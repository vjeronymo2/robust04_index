			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BIG EAST SCHOOLS PLANNING TO FORM FOOTBALL CONFERENCE  </P> <P> Big East schools with Division I football programs will invite West Virginia,  Temple, Rutgers, and Virginia Tech into a Big East football league, the  Philadelphia Daily News reported today.  </P> <P> The newspaper said athletic directors from Syracuse, Pitt, Boston College and  Miami will meet Wednesday in Washington, D.C., to vote in the new members.  </P> <P> Temple, Rutgers and West Virginia -- currently independents in football --  would remain in the Atlantic 10 for other sports, the newspaper said. Virginia  Tech is in the Metro Conference.  </P> <P> "I can't react to (the News report) because I think someone's got a hunch, but  it's not a fact yet," West Virginia Athletic Director Ed Pastilong said today.  </P> <P> "I hope before the week's out we are presented a proposal as such. . . . They  are meeting Wednesday and Thursday, I do know that, and they are meeting to  discuss expansion," he said.  </P> <P> "A conference like this should give our program more clout," Temple Athletic  Director Charles Theokas told the Daily News. "And it should do wonders for the  rest of Eastern football."  </P> <P> Temple's football team finished 7-4 this season.  </P> <P> "If something like this should work, right now, as we're speaking, we would  have been boarding planes to a bowl game because we would have been second or  third in Big East football rather than the second- or third-best independent in  the East," Theokas said.  </P> <P> Big East Commissioner Mike Tranghese said he was drawing up papers to force the  eight schools to make a 10-year commitment and prohibit them from forming an  all-sports conference.  </P></p>

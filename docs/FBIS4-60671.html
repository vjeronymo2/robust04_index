			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin and ITIM] </F>   [Excerpts] The defense establishment has decided to delay  the release of hundreds of Palestinian detainees and prisoners  who were slated to be released today in the framework of the  release of 5,000 Palestinian prisoners agreed upon with the PLO.  Security sources yesterday assessed the release process will  continue early next week.    So far some 1,600 detainees and prisoners who signed a  statement of support for the peace process have been released.  Some 700 other prisoners are refusing to sign such a statement.  [passage omitted]    PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat has appointed Fatimah Barnawi as  head of the Palestinian Police women's unit. Barnawi was the  first Palestinian woman prisoner following the Six-Day War,  according to a senior Palestinian source in Tunis.    Barnawi, 40, was a resident of East Jerusalem. In September  1967 she was the first one who attempted to carry out an attack  in Jerusalem, but the bomb she planted in a cinema was  discovered and safely detonated.    Barnawi was incarcerated in Israel until 1977, after which  she resided in Lebanon. Approximately 10 years ago she settled  in Tunis. Barnawi is a member of Fatah's Revolutionary Council.    Two Palestinian prisoners who were members of Fatah's first  terror squads, which were headed by Yasir 'Arafat, were released  yesterday after serving life sentences in the Nabulus prison.    The two, Tajj-al-din al-Husayni, 55, and 'Isa al-Qaysi, 60,  were imprisoned 27 years ago for terrorist activity.</p>

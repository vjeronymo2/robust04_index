			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / UK Company News: WPP board issues ultimatum over the company's future SHAREHOLDERS in WPP, the marketing services group, have been offered a choice between supporting a capital restructuring or being left with little or no value to their shares. The choice was put to them in a circular posted yesterday by the board. The proposals will be put to a shareholders' meeting on August 5. The circular also estimates profits of Pounds 14.2m for the six months to June 30 before tax and exceptional items, compared to Pounds 13m in the first half of 1991. Exceptional charges of Pounds 12.7m (profits Pounds 3m) cut profits to Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 16m). The charges include Pounds 13.5m of costs relating to the restructuring offset by asset sale profits of Pounds 800,000. Another Pounds 4.6m of restructuring costs are being charged to the balance sheet. Mr Martin Sorrell, chief executive, said the profit figures represented a slight improvement though there was no significant upturn in economic activity. The circular urges shareholders to approve the plan. If it is not passed it will constitute 'an event of default' leaving WPP dependent on the support of its bankers. If this is forthcoming it is likely to be at terms which leave little or nothing for shareholders. If bankers refuse their support WPP said that shareholders would be left with nothing. The plan involves the issue of 239.5m convertible shares at 60p each, raising Dollars 272m (Pounds 143m). These shares will be bought by 24 banks in WPP's banking syndicate. Proceeds will be used to repay about a quarter of the group's Dollars 1bn debt. Among banks subscribing to the issue are Bank of New York, which will buy Pounds 11.2m-worth of the new convertible shares and have a 4 per cent stake in WPP afterwards, Barclays, putting up Pounds 9.2m, and Midland, buying Pounds 8.8m worth. Existing WPP shareholders can subscribe for new ordinary shares also at 60p, at a rate of 1,060 new shares for every 1,000 ordinary held already. To the extent that shareholders subscribe, the issue to the banks will be reduced. Holders of WPP's existing convertible preference shares are being offered conversion into ordinary shares at a rate of 750 ordinary for every 1,000 convertible preference shares held and can also subscribe to the new issue. Their stake in the group would increase from 23.1 per cent to 31.8 per cent after the banks put in the new equity, without putting up any new money. The circular gives details of the banking arrangements. WPP had net debt at June 22 of Pounds 490.2m. An existing multi-currency term facility for Dollars 430m and a working capital facility of Dollars 217m would continue after the restructuring and a bridge facility of Dollars 150m has been set up, which WPP has already begun to use. The banks have agreed to delay debt repayments due from 1993 onwards, with little to pay until 1997. The new facility will have to be repaid by making disposals or issuing shares. Interest on the existing facilities will accrue at 2 per cent above London Inter-bank Offered Rate on the portion drawn, the rest paying a 1 per cent commitment fee. The bridge facility will accrue at Libor plus 2 per cent rising in steps after July 1 1992 to 4 per cent over Libor. The undrawn portion will also pay a 1 per cent fee. The banks will be paid a fee of 1 per cent of the existing facilities left after the convertible issue and a 2 per cent fee on the bridge facility. See People</p>

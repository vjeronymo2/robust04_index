			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> AUDUBON QUARTET AT BILTMORE IN HISTORIC SITES SERIES  </P> <P> The Audubon Quartet made a stunning impression at its local debut two years  ago, disclosing maturity of expression and smoothly functioning internal  dynamics that belied the Virginia- based group's brief history.  </P> <P> Sunday evening, on the occasion of its return -- presented, as before, by  Chamber Music in Historic Sites -- the four artists displayed equal technical  fluency and interpretive conviction.  </P> <P> The difference in locales did, however, produce altered results.  </P> <P> In 1987, under the enriching Tiffany dome of the Doheny Mansion, the Audubons  projected quasi-orchestral sonorities without sacrificing linear clarity. On  Sunday, when Bernard's restaurant in the Biltmore Hotel was converted into a  viable 200-seat concert hall, a decidedly leaner, but by no means unappealing  tone was discernible.  </P> <P> Another marked difference between then and now was the program. Previously, the  juxtaposition of attractively quirky, vastly dissimilar rarities by Haydn and  Peter Schickele and the familiar fireworks of Smetana's "From My Life" made for  a revelatory evening.  </P> <P> This time, the players -- violinists David Ehrlich and David Salness, violist  Doris Lederer, cellist Thomas Shaw -- were less enterprising, offering  everybody's favorite warm-up piece, the Mozart Quartet in G, K. 387, followed  by the ubiquitous Debussy Quartet, and Schumann's warts-and-all beauty in A  major, Opus 41, No. 3, less familiar to general audiences but no novelty for  the chamber music crowd.  </P> <P> The totality proved mildly disappointing for its lack of adventure and lack of  coherency, the immense worth of each component notwithstanding.  </P> <P> Still, amid these safe pleasures one could savor the unexaggeratedly Romantic  interpretations, immaculate ensemble balance and rhythmic vitality of the  Audubon Quartet.  </P> <P> We should always have it so bad.HERBERT GLASS  </P></p>

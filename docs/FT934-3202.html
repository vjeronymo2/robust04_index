			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Nato to plan for a wider role A new Nato command system enabling allies to send task forces for peacekeeping and other missions outside their own territory is due to be drawn up within six months, writes David White, Defence Correspondent, in Brussels. A US-inspired Combined Joint Task Forces scheme, which would involve setting up 'flexible' headquarters able to deploy ad hoc forces is set to be formally approved by allied leaders at their Brussels summit on January 10-11. Nato military authorities will be asked to present detailed plans to ministers by June. The scheme reflects growing emphasis on Nato's ability to act more effectively in crises such as the former Yugoslavia. Crucial to the scheme would be the participation of France and Spain, which belong to Nato but keep their forces outside the alliance's mainstream military structure.</p>

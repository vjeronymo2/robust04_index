			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 6 May (EFE) -- The Declaration of Santiago  on the exercise of the profession of journalism was approved  here today by all delegates except for those from Chile and  Venezuela.    After a heated debate, the declaration was approved. It  summarizes in 10 points the five days of work carried out during  the seminar on the Development of the Media and Democracy in  Latin America and the Caribbean, which began on 2 May and which  was organized by UNESCO, the United Nations, and the Chilean  Government.    The Santiago Declaration was approved by consensus, except  for article eight to which the Chilean and Venezuelan  journalists associations objected. They favor unconditional  exercise of journalism.    The confrontation was between the Chilean Journalists  Association and the Inter-American Press Association (IAPA),  which groups continental written media owners.    In its main points, the Santiago Declaration remarks that  freedom of expression "is the cornerstone" of democracy and that  it is essential for peace and development.    The 400 delegates to the seminar ask governments to  guarantee  freedom of expression and their professional work, and they  condemn the violence to which some journalists are subjected, as  well as all prohibitions and controls.</p>

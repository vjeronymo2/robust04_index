			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: Yanase set to unveil Opel distribution deal - The Japanese importer's switch from VW has wider implications Yanase, the dominant foreign car importer and distributor in Japan, is expected to announce an agreement with Opel, the main European subsidiary of General Motors of the US, to become the exclusive importer and distributor of Opel products in Japan. The deal follows Yanase's disclosure last week that it was abandoning its long-standing relationship with Volkswagen, the German carmaker, which it has built into the leading foreign car importer in Japan. Yanase's change of allegiance to Opel heralds a significant shake-up in the hard-fought imported car market in Japan, which is dominated by the German makes of VW/Audi, Mercedes-Benz and BMW. It offers GM the chance to make an important breakthrough for its European-built cars. Volkswagen, the leading western car exporter to Japan with its VW and Audi makes, expects a substantial setback to its Japanese sales in the short term, following Yanase's move to give up the VW/Audi franchise with effect from the end of 1992. Yanase's switch to sell Opel through its extensive Japanese dealer network has been prompted by an increasingly bitter conflict with the VW group, which it has represented in Japan for 38 years. It has been dismayed by VW's decision to replace it as the general importer/distributor, with the creation of its own wholly owned importer-distributor subsidiary, Volkswagen Audi Nippon (VAN). It is also upset at VW's decision to develop an additional sales channel through a co-operation deal with Toyota, the leading Japanese carmaker. In a attack on VW's sales and marketing plans, Yanase claimed the German carmaker had fixed a sales target of 100,000 cars a year in Japan 'regardless of the actual size of the imported car market'. It said that by making investments based on a target of 100,000 units, and by appointing too many dealers, VW may 'unnecessarily deprive dealers of both channels of their profitability due to disorderly marketing and excessive competition'. It claimed that under the VW strategy, the market would become 'chaotic'; VW/Audi owners would be 'inconvenienced'; and the operation of the Yanase network would become 'unviable'. Yanase has agreed to provide after-sales service for existing VW/Audi customers during the two years  - 1993 and 1994  - after it terminates its sales contract. Volkswagen must now accelerate its plans to develop its two other sales channels. One, called Fahren, will be developed under the direction of Volkswagen Audi Nippon (VAN). The second Duo, is being developed by Toyota. VW will become much more dependent on it. It will have to scale back the ambitious target announced last autumn by Mr Carl Hahn, VW management board chairman, to double its sales of VW and Audi cars in Japan to around 100,000 by 1995. Mr Hahn said last year the group would have a network of nearly 300 sales outlets operating in Japan by 1992, with a 45-strong Volkswagen Audi Nippon network and 50 sales outlets to be set up by Toyota as well as around 180 Yanase dealers. Under the co-operation deal with Toyota  - the first time Toyota dealers will handle imported cars  - the aim has been to sell 7,000 cars this year, with an increase to 30,000 a year through 100 sales outlets by 1996. In the wake of Yanase's withdrawal, Volkswagen said in Tokyo it expected its sales in Japan to fall to around 32,000 in 1993 from a planned level of 48,000 in 1992. This year's figure still includes 39,000 cars to be sold through Yanase's 178-strong dealer network. This could prove over-optimistic, however, and VW's leading position in Japan will be under threat, at least in the short term. VW said it planned to increase its Fahren sales channel from 25 dealers to 42 by end of the year, with a further 40 outlets being added in 1993. Its Toyota-controlled Duo sales channel will be increased from 5 outlets to 36 by the end of the year, with the addition of 15 more dealerships next year. VW/Audi sales in Japan last year totalled 44,562, with around 95 per cent of the volume sold through the Yanase dealer network. The VW/Audi makes accounted for 22.6 per cent of imported car sales in Japan, making it the leading foreign car group in Japan ahead of Mercedes-Benz, the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, with sales of 34,187 and an import share of 17.3 per cent, and BMW with sales of 33,798 and an import share of 17.1 per cent. Total car imports to Japan declined by 11.1 per cent last year to 197,184  - compared with a fall in the overall market of 4.6 per cent to 4.87m  - and accounted for only 4.1 per cent of the Japanese new car market. The decline was a significant setback to importers' long-term goal of gaining 10 per cent of Japanese new car sales during the 1990s. The main beneficiary of the Yanase/Volkswagen conflict will be Opel, ironically the number two make in VW's domestic German market, where it is also challenging. Opel cars have, in the past, been distributed in Japan by Isuzu, GM's Japanese affiliate, and the Toho Motors dealer group. Opel's performance has been disappointing, however, with sales of only 2,725 cars last year compared with a target of 10,000 a year set in the late 1980s. Under the terms of the deal to be announced shortly, Yanase is expected to become Opel's sole importer and distributor in Japan, although there may still be a small residual role for some selected Isuzu dealers. Although the immediate aim for Opel will be to reach the 10,000 cars a year target, its ambitions are higher, given the capacity of the Yanase network, which was capable of selling 53,461 VW/Audi cars in 1990.</p>

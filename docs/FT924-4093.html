			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Japanese warn on Russian ventures A LEADING Japanese regional banker yesterday said ventures in Russia had failed to materialise because foreign companies were uncertain of the status of property they need to acquire. Mr Ryutaro Ohmori, president of the Niigata Chuo Bank, which has formed a Russian investment association in north-western Japan, said foreign investment interest in Russia would remain weak until banking and property management regulations were overhauled. He said investors had lost confidence in the Russian banking system, and were confused by the regional and central governments' competing claims to authority over investment approval. In an attempt to improve banking ties, Niigata Chuo and several other banks in the area have trained Russian bank staff. Banks and trading companies in the Niigata region had hoped the Russian far east would be a prime site for resource and services investment, but after many trips to the region, including Mr Ohmori's nine visits in the past two years, enthusiasm for joint ventures has begun to wane. Trade between Japan and Russian will fall about 60 per cent this year, according to trading house officials who say they are reluctant to deal with Russian clients unless certain of receiving payment for goods exported. An official responsible for Russian trade at a Tokyo-based trading house said confidence had also been undermined by the introduction of a new tariff system in July. He said the system was applied unevenly.  --------------------------------- JAPANESE FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT  --------------------------------- Fiscal year             Dollars bn  --------------------------------- 1985                          12.2 1986                          22.3 1987                          33.3 1988                          47.0 1989                          67.5 1990                          56.9 1991                          41.6  --------------------------------- Source: Ministry of Finance.  ---------------------------------  ------------------------------ DIRECT MANUFACTURING INVESTMENT  ------------------------------ Fiscal year          Dollars bn  ------------------------------ 1985                        2.4 1986                        3.8 1987                        7.8 1988                       13.8 1989                       16.3 1990                       15.5 1991                       12.3  ------------------------------ Source: Ministry of Finance.  ------------------------------</p>

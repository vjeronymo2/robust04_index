			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEACHERS TO WEIGH 6.5% SALARY HIKE  </P> <P> Teachers will get a 6.5% salary increase for the coming school year and have  more say on faculty advisory councils at their schools under a tentative  agreement reached last week with the Santa Monica-Malibu School District.  </P> <P> The agreement for a two-year contract also boosts the minimum and maximum  salaries for teachers and increases the pay for substitutes and for service  outside of regular classroom hours.  </P> <P> "We think it is a fair proposal," said June Lucas, president of the Santa  Monica-Malibu Classroom Teachers Assn. "We hope the teachers will ratify it."  </P> <P> The agreement would raise the average teacher salary from $38,950 to $41,481.  The minimum pay for all unit members will be $27,000; currently a starting  teacher's salary is $22,470.  </P> <P> Beginning in 1990, teachers with 28 years experience in the district who have  taken professional advancement courses will earn $50,752. The current top  salary -- $46,427 -- is for 25 years experience.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Vote Sept. 18  </P> <P> The district's 500 teachers, counselors, nurses and librarians will vote on the  agreement the week of Sept. 18, Lucas said. The district board will then vote  on the pact.  </P> <P> Teachers who left stamped, self-addressed envelopes at district offices were  sent details of the agreement Friday. By the end of the month, all employees  will be mailed the superintendent's report and a welcome-back-to-school  message, which will include a summary of the terms.  </P> <P> Supt. Eugene Tucker said that with the salary increases, the district hopes to  better compete with the Los Angeles Unified School District, which, under its  contract ratified in May, offers a starting pay of $27,346 for the 1989-90  school year. Recently, two or three teachers chose Los Angeles over Santa  Monica, citing better pay as the reason, Tucker said. But he said he did not  know of any Santa Monica teachers who have left the district to work for Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> "Because of the increases in (LAUSD), and (because) they're giving a $5,000  bonus for bilingual teachers, that's pretty much dried up the market," Tucker  said. Santa Monica needs three or four bilingual teachers but does not offer  them bonuses, he said.  </P> <P> Lucas said the agreement, reached after five months of negotiation with  district officials and board members, reflected that the union did "the best as  we can for the unit members." Los Angeles teachers negotiated 8% increases a  year for the next two years, and "one always looks at what neighboring  districts are getting," she said, but "that we have to get 8% or go on strike .  . . was not one of our contemplations."  </P> <P> "We set our goals commensurate with our resources," she said. "L.A. is a  different situation both in terms of size and money. We are not driven by L.A."  </P> <P> Under the agreement the district will continue to pay for health and dental  benefits, which have increased in cost by about $500 to $3,550 for the 1989-90  year. Details of salary increases and benefits for 1990-91 will be negotiated  next year.  </P> <P> Teachers who supervise Saturday student disciplinary classes will be paid  $27.50 an hour, up from $23.10. Teachers will have more professional courses  available after school and on weekends and will be paid for attending some of  them, Lucas said.  </P> <P> Under the tentative agreement, substitutes will earn from $80 to $125 per day,  up from $70 to $100 a day.  </P> <P> Teachers will also have more powers. Faculty advisory councils at the schools,  which make recommendations on curricula and scheduling, will gain the right to  advise the district on school budget issues. The councils might also advise  principals on whether aides should be used for yard duty or other tasks.  </P> <P> The councils, Tucker said, "have dealt with complaints and concerns, but we'd  like them to move to a more proactive level . . . to offer guidance to the  principals on more substantive decisions."  </P> <P> Both he and Lucas said Santa Monica teachers have had more participation in  decision-making than their Los Angeles counterparts. Besides the advisory  councils, teachers sit on an education committee that advises the board and on  curricula committees at the schools.  </P> <P> Lucas said that teachers who were surveyed before negotiations began were most  concerned about salary and benefits and did not identify teacher power as a  priority.  </P> <P> The agreement also calls for a committee of teachers and administrators to  consider increasing elementary school teachers' preparation time. Currently,  they are allotted 20 paid minutes a day to call parents and prepare lesson  plans. The union wants that increased by a half-hour, Lucas said. Middle- and  high-school teachers get about 50 minutes a day, she said.  </P> <P> Although the agreement will not require any cuts in the district's propsed  $45-million budget, the district will be unable to pay for major program  improvements, Tucker said.  </P> <P> COMPARISON OF AGREEMENTS  </P> <P> Here are the terms of the tentative agreement on a two-year contract between  the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District and the Santa Monica-Malibu  Classroom Teachers Assn., and a comparison with the settlement reached earlier  this year with teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School District.  </P> <P> SALARIES  </P> <P> A 6.5% increase for the 1989-90 school year, with the 1990-91 adjustment to be  negotiated next year. The minimum salary for teachers, nurses, counselors and  librarians is to be $27,000.

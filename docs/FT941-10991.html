			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Something must be done Once again an atrocity, by crossing a new threshold of horror, has refocused the world's flagging attention on Bosnia, and in particular on Sarajevo. The Bosnian Serb militia has disclaimed responsibility, alleging that the Moslem-led Bosnian government deliberately staged a massacre of its own civilians to provoke outside military intervention against the Serbs. That strains credulity, and does not explain how the mortar-bomb apparently came to be fired from Serb-held territory. The UN is investigating, but the overwhelming presumption must be that this was a further escalation, whether deliberate or accidental, of the pressure the Serbs have been applying relentlessly to the city since the war started nearly two years ago. As such, it is a very direct provocation to the UN, which is supposed to be protecting Sarajevo along with other 'safe havens', and to Nato, which last August explicitly threatened air strikes 'in the event that the strangulation of Sarajevo and other areas continues'. Lord Owen, the European Union mediator, has argued that the latest outrage makes it imperative to bring the city under UN administration. The problem, however, is not the city's administration but its defence. There can be no justification for removing it from the administration of the internationally recognised government, while leaving the surrounding area under the control of the Serb militia, which has been pounding it to death. The issue is not solely or even primarily humanitarian. Indeed, the tendency to analyse the situation in the former Yugoslavia in purely humanitarian terms has perhaps been the biggest mistake that western governments have made throughout. Whereas in Kuwait and in the Falklands governments set aside narrowly humanitarian considerations, realising the disastrous consequences that would follow if aggression were allowed to succeed, in the former Yugoslavia they have responded to aggression with verbal condemnations and empty threats, while confining their action to a humanitarian effort which is at best a palliative, and at worst only prolongs the agony. What is at stake is the credibility of the principles which were supposed to form the basis of a lasting peace in Europe, following the end of the cold war, and - perhaps even more serious - the credibility of the international organisations in which the peoples of Europe had vested their hopes of peace and security: Nato, EU, UN and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. That being so, the worst thing to do now would be nothing, even if it can be plausibly argued that any given action (such as a punitive air strike against Serb positions) will in itself do little to improve the situation, and may in some respects make it worse. It is vital to restore some credibility, at least to Nato and the UN - the two organisations most concerned with military security - by demonstrating that their express orders cannot be defied with impunity. But clearly an action that achieves some strategic advantage would be preferable, if one can be found. The one that suggests itself is the use of force to reopen the airport at Tuzla, through which the main part of the country still in government hands could be far more easily resupplied than by road. The UN has been trying to achieve this by diplomacy since the autumn, and Nato at last month's summit explicitly linked its threat of air strikes to the opening of the airport, as well as relief of the UN garrison at Srebrenica. General Sir Michael Rose, the new UN commander in Bosnia, showed last week that he is prepared to risk confrontation with Serb forces if necessary. He should now be told to reopen Tuzla airport without further delay, and authorised to call on 'close air support' from Nato as soon as anyone tries to stop him.</p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SPEEDY WILL OPEN CENTERS IN JAPAN;  </P> <P> SERVICE: THE ANAHEIM-BASED FIRM IS TO ANNOUNCE A 50-YEAR JOINT VENTURE FOR  LIGHT PRINTING.  </P> <P> Speedy International Inc. is expected to announce Monday a 50-year joint  venture agreement with two major Japanese corporations to open American Speedy  Printing Centers in Japan.  </P> <P> Anaheim-based Speedy International has teamed up with Canon Sales Inc., the  marketing arm of the Japanese office equipment and electronics giant, and  Maruzen Co. Ltd., a large Japanese retailer, to form American Speedy of Japan  Inc. The companies plan to open the first of five pilot printing shops in Tokyo  in September.  </P> <P> Speedy International's parent, Kaiser International Inc. in Anaheim, owns the  licensing rights to American Speedy franchises in California, Hawaii, Nevada,  Japan and eight other Pacific Rim countries. American Speedy Centers Inc.,  based in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., operates 750 print shops in the United States  and Canada, 106 of which are licensed to Kaiser International in the United  States.  </P> <P> Previous efforts by U.S. quick-printing companies to establish operations in  Japan have failed because of stiff opposition from the Japanese printing  industry. Speedy is the first U.S. quick-printing firm to team up with large  Japanese partners to do business in that country.  </P> <P> "While previous American attempts failed, we feel sure that this venture will  be successful because we have adapted our product line to work with, and not  compete against, the Japanese light printing industry," said William Culp,  Speedy's president and chief financial officer.  </P> <P> "We're not taking the Japanese quick printers' business away from them.  Instead, we're helping them develop new markets for their products and  services."  </P> <P> American Speedy of Japan is 25% owned by Canon Sales Inc., the Japanese  marketing arm of Canon Inc., 25% by Tokyo-based Maruzen Co. and 50% by Speedy  International.  </P> <P> Culp said Kaiser International paid American Speedy less than $10 million for  franchise rights in Japan.  </P> <P> The U.S.-Japanese venture hopes to open hundreds of print shops throughout  Japan and hopes to achieve sales of more than $700 million by the year 2000. By  then, Culp said, Speedy International's earnings from the venture are expected  to be at least $4.2 million annually. This does not include sales of software,  printing equipment and other machines.  </P> <P> Each center will have a computer system that can translate material from  Japanese to English, but the number of languages will increase as the need  develops, he said.  </P></p>

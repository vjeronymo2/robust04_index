			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nilton Horita] </F>   [Text] Sao Paulo, 22 Jun (AE) -- This time the confusion  that has arisen on the international monetary market is helping  Brazil. According to the Termo brokerage firm, one of the main  agricultural operators in the Commodities and Futures Exchange,  Brazil could increase its revenues from exports of agricultural  commodities from $5 billion to $6 billion this year, with an  average 60 percent increase in its coffee, soybean, orange  juice, and cotton quotations, among others.    "With coffee alone, export revenues will increase by $1.2  billion," says Termo director Francisco Arantes. The annual  volume of agricultural exports amounts to $10 billion. "The  prices of commodities began to increase in March due to the  volatile nature of international interest rates, which has  benefited Brazil," he adds.    Arnim Lore, director for international affairs at the Fonte  Bank, says that American exports, as well as exports quoted in  dollars, have gained greater competitiveness. "Brazilian  exporters in general are gaining momentum," he said. Carlos  Langoni, director of the World Economy Center of the Getulio  Vargas Foundation, said that this is particularly true for those  who are exporting to Europe and Asia.    According to Angelim Curiel, the Citibank foreign trade  director, 80 percent of Brazilian exports are made in dollars.  He said: "We are therefore in a similar position to that of  U.S. exporters, whose prices will now become more competitive."  He added: "In sum, those who export to Europe and Asia will  benefit from the dollar decline, as will those who export to the  United States, as a result of the greater economic activity."    In the case of agricultural commodities, exporters will win  with the price increase. Other sectors will be able to sell  their products more cheaply in the local currencies (such as  Japanese yen or German mark) and increase their income by  selling higher volumes. Economist Adroaldo Mouda da Silva,  director of Silex Trading, notes that international developments  will help Brazilian exporters at this juncture, when the  implementation of the real will affect exports because it has  established a fixed exchange rate with the dollar. "A form of  compensation has taken place," he said. "Brazil will no doubt  win a few billion dollars," he added.</p>

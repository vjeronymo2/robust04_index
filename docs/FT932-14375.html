			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (3): Market expected to grow 6% - East Asia ASIA, as one of the most promising growth markets for the international airline industry, has attracted a host of airlines from east and west, all vying to claim their share of the pie. While other markets for air travel have been depressed amid slow economic activity in leading industrialised countries, the Asian market is expected to grow by about 6 per cent, according to some industry estimates. Air travel in the Asia Pacific region will grow to 40 per cent of international air traffic by the end of the century, compared with 31 per cent today, Singapore Airlines reportedly forecasts. Against this background, airlines are competing to expand their share of market demand while several countries are stepping up investment in airports to ensure that a proportion of the greater flow of air traffic comes their way. Japan Air Lines, for example, is increasing flights to China, a predominantly business market which it expects to be the largest growth area in the region. The Japanese airline is also looking to the resumption of air travel between Japan and Vietnam for the first time since the Vietnam War. The two countries are in negotiations to discuss specific routes, JAL says. The Japanese government also announced recently that it would hold civil aviation talks with Brunei with a view to starting a regular air route. At the same time, there is increasing traffic between regional cities in Japan and other parts of Asia. JAL expects to see more flights to south-east Asia from regional cities such as Kagoshima and Fukuoka on the southern island of Kyushu. Meanwhile, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea are busy building new airports to meet the challenge of what is expected to be growing competition for business and tourism air travel in the region. With a number of competing facilities coming on stream later in the decade, Japanese airlines are worried that unless timely progress is made in the extension of Narita Airport and the construction of the New Kansai International Airport, Japan's share of traffic in the region could be diverted to Korea. The competition is all the more intense because lower corporate profits have meant a decline in more profitable first-class and business travel. At JAL, the overall volume of traffic has increased but yields have fallen as a result of business travellers switching to economy class. Last year, the carrier saw business travel fall by 16 per cent while first-class travel fell by 18 per cent. However, while undue competition and excess capacity are real dangers, the most tangled issue facing the airline business in Asia today is that of 'beyond rights' claimed by the US. The issue of beyond rights stems from bilateral air agreements formed between the US and individual countries in Asia several decades ago. Under those accords, a certain number of US airlines are granted the right to fly to specific destinations in the countries concerned and from there to a third destination. A number of Asian countries, including Japan, contest that the US is abusing its beyond rights by taking traffic away from local carriers which should have first priority over routes connecting their home market to foreign destinations. Thailand, for example, abrogated its bilateral aviation accord with the US in 1990 while the US and Hong Kong have also been in disagreement over beyond rights. Japan has warned the US that it cannot accept the use of beyond rights in a way which threatens the business of the carriers of the countries concerned. Japan has refused to grant United Airlines permission to fly between Tokyo and Sydney on the grounds that United will be taking business away from Japanese and Australian airlines. Although the Japanese authorities have allowed Northwest Airlines to fly a New York-Osaka-Sydney route, they have done so on condition that the number of passengers boarding at Osaka be restricted to less than 50 per cent. The Australian government is also upset at US attempts to capture some of the market for travel between Japan and Australia, and has told Northwest that only two of its three Osaka-Sydney flights could carry passengers boarding at Osaka. The US side takes the position that since it has been granted the right in aviation accords signed by each side to extend a US-Japan route to a third destination, it should be able to exercise that right in full. Any attempt to restrict that right is a unilateral violation of the accord, the US believes and US aviation authorities have gone as far as to threaten immediate sanctions against Japanese airlines. However, in this particular case Japan refused to bow to US pressure. US claims to beyond rights are based on an outdated agreement which does not reflect the current reality, Japanese officials say. What is particularly annoying to Japanese carriers is the fact that the US is flexing its muscles over beyond rights in the region at a time when US passenger traffic to south-east Asia has declined dramatically. In 1990, for example, 5 per cent of visitors to Thailand were American compared with 41 per cent in 1965, according to the Teiki Koku Kyokai, an industry association. Japan has so far allowed Northwest to continue flying its New York-Osaka-Sydney route in spite of the fact that about 70 per cent of passengers on the Osaka-Sydney leg board the aircraft in Osaka, supporting Japanese claims that the US airline is taking away business from Japanese and Australian airlines. If the situation does not improve it is quite likely that Japan will withdraw Northwest's right to fly that route and tensions between the two sides could flare up. Whatever happens, one certainty is that competition for the Asian air travel market is bound to increase as new facilities come on stream. The opening of the Kansai International Airport in the summer of 1994 will give foreign airlines a greater number of landing slots than ever. Seoul's Kimpo Airport, which the Koreans would like to see becoming Asia's hub, is scheduled to open in 1998 with one runway and will eventually expand to four runways. As capacity increases, and competition sharpens, there is a danger that airlines could be drawn into a costly price war. Such a scenario may be of short-term benefit to travellers but will severely undermine the health of an industry which is already seeing a growing number of casualties in the economic downturn.</p>

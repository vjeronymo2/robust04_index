			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / More shops open on Sunday About one shop in seven is regularly opening on Sundays, which has become the third busiest day in the week for those that are, says a report from Healey &amp; Baker, the commercial property group. A survey for the company by Research Services in October - before the Christmas trading period - found that 380 out of 2,761 retail outlets contacted were taking advantage of August's change in the law permitting Sunday opening in England and Wales. Retailers opening on Sunday reported an average increase in weekly turnover of 9 per cent.</p>

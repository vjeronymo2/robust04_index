			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MAN, YOUTH HELD IN STABBINGS AT BEACH  </P> <P> Detectives have arrested a Saticoy man and a Ventura teen-ager in connection  with the beach stabbings of two Ojai teen-agers last Sunday.  </P> <P> Ramon Mendez Lopez, 26, is being held at the Ventura County Jail on suspicion  of violating his parole.  </P> <P> Police plan to charge him with attempted murder on Tuesday, said Detective  Douglas Auldridge of the Ventura Police Department. The 15-year-old is being  held at Juvenile Hall, he said.  </P> <P> Both were questioned on the night of the stabbing but were released because  police had inadequate evidence, Auldridge said. After an investigation, he and  Detective Pat Stevens arrested Lopez at his home about 11 a.m. Friday and the  teen-ager about 4 p.m., he said.  </P> <P> The teen-ager, who police believe associates with members of a Ventura gang  called the Avenue Gangsters, is the main suspect, Auldridge said. It is unclear  whether the attack was gang-related, he said.  </P> <P> One stabbing victim, 15-year-old David Foyle, remains in critical condition in  the Ventura County Medical Center with more than 20 stab wounds, Auldridge and  a hospital spokeswoman said. David and a companion, Brady Sabat, 19, were  beaten with sticks and stabbed repeatedly at the beach across from Ventura  Harbor about 12:10 a.m. last Sunday. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ  </P></p>

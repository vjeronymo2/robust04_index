			<p>BFN     [Text] Over to London now, where the taoiseach [Prime  Minister Albert Reynolds] is to meet the British prime minister,  John Major, later today. Our London correspondent, Brian  O'Connell, asked the taoiseach for his reaction to [Sinn Fein  President] Mr. Adams' remarks:    [Begin recording] [Reynolds] Well, I hope it turns out to be  a genuine and a positive response to the situation as it is in  the post-clarification era. At the end of the day, as far as  both governments are concerned, what we want to hear from both  sets of paramilitaries is a cessation of violence so that the  talks process can get under way.    [O'Connell] Should he not, though, make a decision now? Why  wait until after the European elections? What would be the  delay?    [Reynolds] Well, I don't mind the delay. I don't mind a  couple of weeks or a month, or whatever, as long as there is no  more loss of life in the meantime. And I think the message I  want to give to both sets of paramilitaries is that there is no  vestige of justification for the taking of one more, single  life. Can we stop the violence now and whatever period that  people want to discuss and debate between themselves, that's  fine. What we want from the paramilitaries is a cessation of  violence to respond to the will and the wishes of the vast  majority of the Irish and the British people, so that the talks  process can get under way. That is the only sensible way in  which these complex problems can be addressed and be settled in  the end of the day.    [O'Connell] On the three-stranded talks process, your  government and the British Government are in the process of  putting together a framework or a blueprint or a document to try  and get the parties around the table together. When can we  expect that to be finalized?    [Reynolds] Well, it's always difficult to judge those things  and they're always difficult documents to put together, but the  ground rules have been set by the Downing Street Declaration,  and it's a question of building on those ground rules to produce  a framework document. We will certainly be doing our best to  try and get it ready by the end of June or there abouts.    [O'Connell] There is still very little chance, though, of  the  unionists coming on board in any renewed three-stranded process.    [Reynolds] Well, I think they have a responsibility to their  own community -- and indeed to the community at large -- to take  a very responsible and a leadership line in this, and to point  out to the paramilitaries that it's futile to continue taking  loss of life, that this tit-for-tat vicious sectarian murder has  to stop. Why not stop it now? I would hope that the community  leaders and the political leaders in all the communities in the  north of Ireland take that same line and try and impress upon  the men of violence to stop now and let the people's problems be  solved around the table.

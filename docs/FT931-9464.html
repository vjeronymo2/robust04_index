			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Fiat leads the way with 8 per cent gain THE Continent was firmer ahead of the weekend, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN turned its back on politics after the excitement of the previous two sessions and it was corporate news and rumour, once again, that took the market forward. The Comit index rose 4.61 to 492.13, a 2.4 per cent decline on the week, as the market overcame the inhibiting effect of Monday's close of the February trading account and yesterday's expiry of options. The mood was encouraged by a government move to speed a package of measures to spur the bourse, including fiscal inventives for equity investments. Fiat was the star performer, adding L105 to fix at L4,696 before rising to L4,955 after hours, a daily rise of 7.9 per cent. The stock found support from the opening after news that the company had risen to second place in the European car sales rankings in January; but it spurted amid a host of vague market rumours that the company might be about to announce a commercial tie-up. Insurers were also firm: Fondiaria rose L739 to L28,562 and Toro put on L550 to fix at L24,550 before edging up to L24,650 after hours. FRANKFURT extended its climb, reaching its highest close in nearly seven months with the DAX index at 1,661.43, up 10.38 on the day and 1.2 per cent on the week. Turnover rose from DM6.5bn to DM7bn. The underlying argument continued between the underweight position of domestic and foreign institutions in German equities, their willingness to increase their commitment - bringing high liquidity into the market  - and the crisis position of the steel, engineering and automotive industries. However, pointed out Mr Eckhard Frahm of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, top performers in the DAX this year include Volkswagen, up another DM2.80 to DM297.70 yesterday, Daimler and Continental, the tyre company, which rose DM4.50 to DM229.50. Huge earnings gains have been forecast for VW - three years from now. Meanwhile, second liners gained on earlier improvements, or the prospect of them. AEG, which said it would return to profit for 1992, put on another DM3.80 to DM176.30 for a 10 per cent rise on the week. Suedzucker, the sugar company, ended DM19 higher at DM625 for a two-day gain of DM34, following a good 1992 beet harvest and this week's Hoare Govett buy recommendation. PARIS went into the weekend unenthusiastically with a 6.40 point rise in the CAC-40 to 1,911.47, barely changed on the week. Turnover weakened to FFr2.7bn after Thursday's FFr3.5bn. Peugeot was one of the day's better performers with a rise of FFr14 to FFr615 ahead of announcing 1992 results after the close. The group said that it expected a rise in 1993 turnover after a 3 per cent decline last year. Havas lost 2 per cent after reporting a 24 per cent fall in profits after Thursday's close, the shares closing down FFr9.80 at FFr428.90. Carnaud Metal Box gained FFr10.40 to FFr210.00 in good volume amid rumours that it might soon enter the CAC-40. AMSTERDAM moved higher with Fokker gaining Fl 1.00 to Fl 10.50 prior to unconfirmed reports, after the close, that the state had agreed to its takeover by Dasa of Germany. The CBS Tendency index rose 0.4 to 98.9, a week's gain of 1.2 per cent. Elsewhere Royal Dutch shed Fl 1.70 to Fl 155.10 and DSM lost Fl 2.50 to Fl 75.00. ZURICH continued the consolidation seen earlier in the week but the firmer dollar underpinned leading industrial issues and helped the market ahead. The SMI index ended 8.3 higher at 2,136.2, little changed on the week. Nestle rose SFr15 to SFr1,095 and Roche gained SFr20 to SFr4,170. STOCKHOLM featured Astra B, which put on SKr17 to SKr693 as investors began to take interest in the pharmaceutical group ahead of its 1992 results due later this the month. The Affarsvarlden index rose 12.7 to 981.2, a gain of 5.7 per cent on the week. Another strong performer was Sandvik, up SKr24 to SKr429 in the B shares, as investors looked to strong export stocks likely to benefit from the krona's devaluation. VIENNA was helped to a higher close by short covering as the ATX index gained 8.26 to 791.01, down 1.3 per cent on the week. The papermaker, Leykam, led the rise, gaining Sch9 to Sch267. ISTANBUL closed at its highest level in nearly two years as investors were encouraged by lower interest rates. The 75-share index finished 116.02, or 2.3 per cent higher at 5,244.84 in turnover of some TL600bn. The market had risen some 11 per cent on the week.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- February 12                                        THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes             Open       10.30      11.00      12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1124.23    1125.93    1127.44    1130.42 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1174.35    1172.59    1175.65    1179.75  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 Feb 11     Feb 10      Feb 9  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100            1126.71    1121.50     1124.14 FT-SE Eurotrack 200            1175.45    1171.08     1177.40  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1131.53    1132.07    1130.48    1129.97 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1184.15    1184.93    1182.25    1181.05  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  Feb 8      Feb 5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100             1131.12    1129.52 FT-SE Eurotrack 200             1190.15    1189.21  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1132.70 ; 200 -  1186.69 Low/day: 100 -  1124.23  200 -  1171.76  .  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

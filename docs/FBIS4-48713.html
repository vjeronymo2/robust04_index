			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban May 24 SAPA -- KwaZulu/Natal Premier Frank  Mdlalose and the African National Congress' Natal leader Jacob  Zuma were both confident the impasse over the allocation of  ministerial portfolios in the province would be broken at  Tuesday's bilateral meeting.    Speaking shortly before the meeting in Durban, Mr Zuma said:  "We are always confident. We have disputed issues which we  will try to resolve. We have no reason to fail, I'm ready for  anything."    Dr Mdlalose said he too hoped the differences would be  resolved, but "you never can predict what will happen".    The premier and Mr Zuma said the dispute had been raised  during Monday's talks between President Nelson Mandela and Home  Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi in Cape Town.    The conflict over the allocation of portfolios arose last  week when the three ANC ministers, Mr Zuma, S'bu Ndebele and  Zweli Mkhize, excused themselves from the swearing-in ceremony  in Pietermaritzburg.    The trio were dissatisfied with the portfolios allocated to  them, and charged Dr Mdlalose should have consulted with them  before a decision was taken.    Mr Zuma was initially awarded the social welfare portfolio,  Dr Mkhize the health portfolio and Mr Ndebele the roads and  traffic control portfolio.    But in his speech in Ulundi on Friday, Mr Buthelezi said a  new portfolio, auxiliary services, had been given to the ANC.    The meeting to break the deadlock was mooted by Dr Mdlalose  last week.</p>

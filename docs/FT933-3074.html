			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Insurance brokers shaken SHOCK results from Steel Burrill Jones sent the insurance broker's share price plummeting by a third, the biggest slide in the London market yesterday, and knocked the rest of the sector. The firm announced a first-half loss of Pounds 3.9m, against a profit of Pounds 6.23m last time, and an interim dividend reduced to 3p from 4.25p. It said in the company statement that it would expect to make around Pounds 3.5m in the second half, suggesting a full-year loss of Pounds 400,000. An insurance analyst at Hoare Govett said the market had been looking for a full-year figure of Pounds 11.5m and a dividend of 13.3p. 'There were some real bulls out there and they were caught out,' he added. Steel Burrill's share price was marked down heavily at the start of trading and closed 86 lower at 161p. The rest of the sector was also hit, although some analysts said Steel's problems were specific and no reason for the sector to suffer. Sedgwick and Willis Corroon, the leaders, held up well but CE Heath fell 14 to 396p, Lloyd Thompson 6 to 307p and Hogg Group 8 to 218p.</p>

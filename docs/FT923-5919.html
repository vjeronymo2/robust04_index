			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / International Company News: Hoechst slides 19.8% to DM1.1bn HOECHST, the German chemicals and drugs group, yesterday blamed price pressure, rising costs and the weak dollar for a 19.8 per cent slump in first-half profits. Plant closure costs and other structural measures had also depressed the result. Group sales, up 3 per cent by volume, rose only 1 per cent to DM23.4bn (Dollars 16.7bn) because of a 2 per cent overall reduction in prices. The fall in pre-tax profits to DM1.1bn followed a 20.3 per cent slump in 1991 earnings. The group said it hoped to avoid further reductions in the second half by implementing rationalisation measures. It also hoped improving market conditions would allow it to raise prices. Hoechst's results fell mid-way between analysts' expectations, while Monday's announcement from its Leverkusen-based competitor, Bayer, of a 9.8 per cent reduction in first-half profits was better than forecast. The companies' figures suggest that Bayer is pressing ahead faster with cost-cutting. The Hoechst workforce was 2 per cent lower than a year earlier at 179,000 people. So far this year it has unveiled plans to cut a further 600 staff. Bayer had trimmed numbers by 3.5 per cent compared with last year. Bayer's distribution costs rose 4.5 per cent compared with 5.5 per cent at Hoechst. According to Hoechst's shareholders' notice, published yesterday, there had been no fundamental change in the chemicals business. Although sales in North America had improved 10 per cent - 2 per cent of the rise coming from recently-acquired Great Lakes Carbon - German demand was slack and European Community sales had improved only slightly. Conditions continued to worsen in eastern Europe. The only bright spot was pharmaceuticals, where encouraging developments recorded in the first quarter continued with the help of the new market in eastern Germany and new product launches. Sales rose almost DM400m to DM5.4bn in spite of the effects of the weak dollar. The chemicals and pigments division was helped in the first half by brisk business in organic chemicals in the US, but not enough to prevent a fall in sales to DM5.46bn from DM5.6bn last time. Deliveries of plastics and foils, the third biggest division after chemicals and drugs, also rose, but results were hit by 'wholly unsatisfactory prices', the company said.</p>

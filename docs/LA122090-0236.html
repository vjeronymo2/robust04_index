			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> In this column (Legal View) two weeks ago, it was incorrectly reported that to  use the method of substituted service in small claims court, a plaintiff must  first use "due diligence" in trying to personally serve a defendant. In fact,  in small claims court, the substituted service method described in the column  may be used without first attempting personal service. See Code of Civil  Procedure section 116.3.  </P></p>

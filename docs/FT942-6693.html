			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / The Long View: Treasury plays with fire Surely the London stock market is in a jittery enough mood without being undermined by the vague anti-dividend threats which have been dribbling out from the government - this week, in the Competitiveness White Paper. The Treasury ministers are playing with fire at a time when British investment institutions are already faced with the likely need to make fundamental shifts in their strategy. Many pension funds, certainly, are plucking up courage to reduce their 85 per cent exposure to equities (60 per cent in the UK, 25 per cent overseas) for two reasons. They are becoming mature; fewer employees are paying contributions, more pensioners are receiving benefits, and shorter-term investment strategies with a higher fixed-income content are becoming appropriate. Second, a new minimum solvency standard for pension funds is likely to be trailed in a white paper this summer. Again, this will encourage a lower risk strategy, with less reliance on equities prone to the occasional solvency-busting crash. The Treasury has looked around the world and noticed that British companies pay bigger and steadier dividends than their counterparts almost anywhere else. Dividends soared at the rate of 15 per cent a year in the prosperous late-1980s; and although growth halted during the recession, they are now advancing again quite strongly, even though average dividend cover is historically low. This week, for instance, Marks and Spencer raised its dividend by 13.6 per cent and SG Warburg by 15.8 per cent. The All-Share index constituents are paying out almost 7 per cent more than a year ago, and some City analysts expect dividends will soon be climbing at 10 per cent on average. Certainly, the present tax system encourages high distributions, and it has happened largely by accident. When the corporation tax system was introduced 20 years ago, it was designed to be dividend-neutral - that is, the same tax would apply whether profits were retained or paid out to shareholders. When investors are liable to standard-rate income tax, this remains true: out of Pounds 100 of pre-tax profits, a company can retain Pounds 67 after tax, or pay out anything up to Pounds 67 in net dividends. Since the early 1970s, though, there has been a vast increase in the number of UK shareholders who are tax-exempt. Pension funds have grown enormously over that time and now own 35 per cent of the shares of British companies; charities also own equities to a much greater extent than they used to. Moreover, during the past 10 years the government has invented personal equity plans and personal pension plans. Altogether, tax-exempt domestic investors own more than 40 per cent of UK equities. If there really is a dividend problem, it has been created by the Treasury's own initiatives. Exempt investors can claw back most of the underlying corporation tax on a company's profits by reclaiming the imputed tax on dividends. Until the rules were changed slightly in the 1993 Budget, the effective tax rate on underlying profits, taking the company and the exempt shareholder together, was only 10 2/3 per cent rather than the 33 per cent on undistributed profits. Last year's measures raised this 'look through' tax rate to 16 1/4 per cent, to the fury of pension funds; but almost three-quarters of the previous incentive for distribution remains intact. The steady and growing stream of dividend income which this favourable tax structure has generated has encouraged the actuaries who value British pension and life assurance funds to calculate share values on the basis of capitalisation of income rather than day-to-day stock market prices. But further adverse tax changes would directly threaten the actuarial value of equity portfolios by reducing gross dividends. Moreover, if dividends become much more volatile and risky, as the Treasury has hinted would be desirable, share prices would suffer. The arguments for and against high dividend payouts are inconclusive. One line of reasoning is that companies should pay out most of their earnings, so long as it is tax-efficient to do so, because shareholders and the markets can decide better than company executives in particular industries where the best new investment opportunities lie. On the other hand, in countries such as Germany they do not pay much attention to the priorities of what they regard as short-term market speculators. And, in the UK, the Institute of Fiscal Studies has just published a study which suggests that companies will invest internally-generated funds in expansion projects more readily than funds raised externally, which they find more expensive. More dividends could mean less expansion. The most that can be said is that a system biased in favour of dividends could be slightly disadvantageous. But this discussion should be strictly reserved for a bull market. It is perverse and dangerous for ministers to be flying these kites at a time when share prices are under heavy pressure from rising bond yields. Look at the returns on index-linked gilts - which pension funds regard as a close alternative to equities. From only 2.9 per cent at the beginning of the year, the index-linked yield has been rising consistently throughout 1994; this week, it topped 3.7 per cent. Historically, it has been a danger signal for equities when the equity and index-linked yields have collided, and so it proved on Wednesday this week. After the FT-SE 100 index crashed by 68.4 points and the yield rose to 3.8 per cent, a chink of daylight re-appeared compared with the yield on linkers. Yield relationships in the UK securities markets are under strain. Careless talk is bad enough, but investors might gain the impression that the anti-dividend campaign is designed deliberately to steer institutions towards gilts. This is no way to achieve industrial competitiveness.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Lima EXPRESO in Spanish publishes in its  22 December 1993 edition on page A15 a 700-word article by  "special correspondent" Liz Mineo on her visit to poppy  plantations near Jaen, north of Cajamarca.    Mineo reports visiting poppy plantations in Chontali, Jaen  Province. According to a local peasant, she says, "Colombian  citizens came along with people from Juanjui" and "taught local  peasants how to extract opium from the poppy seeds, and they  promised to return to buy their production at $1,500 a kilo."    Mineo continues: "Many peasants from the northwestern  Maranon Region are willing to cultivate poppies." A Chontali  peasant told her that since "we live from what we plant, we will  not doubt in planting this."    She adds: "It is obvious that if the demand for poppy seeds  grows, poppy plantations, which are now a few, will expand."  Poppy cultivation is "in an incipient stage" in Jaen Province,  but according to experts, "soil and climate conditions" in some  places of Cajamarca are "ideal" for this kind of plantation.    According to the Peruvian Antidrug Division, Mineo states:  "Poppy plantations were detected in Yanacanchi Valley in  Cajamarca in 1991 and on the border between Piura and Cajamarca  in 1992."    She concludes by saying that she "learned through sources in  the 5th Jungle Infantry Division based in Bagua, Amazonas, of  poppy plantations in Tabaconas District in San Ignacio Province  in Cajamarca." From sources in the Huallaga Front political and  military command she learned that "trading of a brown substance  identified afterward as poppy latex has been detected in the  past few months in Chiclayo."</p>

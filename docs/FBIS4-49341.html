			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Feature" by Zhang Qi: "HK People Respond Warmly to New </F> Banknotes"]    [Text] Hong Kong, May 3 (XINHUA) -- The new banknotes,  issued by the Bank of China (BOC) for the first time in Hong  Kong [HK], together with the souvenirs to commemorate the  historic event, have caused a frenzy among local residents in  the territory.    On May 2, the first day when the new currency was put into  circulation in the territory, more than 40,000 local residents  had reportedly turned up in front of BOC's central headquarters  and its 31 branches and 44 automatic teller machines throughout  the territory in order to obtain the new banknotes.    "Some even stayed overnight outside our bank in order to get  the new banknotes," said a clerk of a BOC's branch in Wanchai  district.    A 63-old man, named Chan Cheung, had to dash back home to  get  more money as he did not bring enough with him.    He said, "I was late. But I was lucky and managed to join  the last few customers in the queue to get a set of the new  notes. I am fortunate that I live near the bank".    Not all people are as fortunate as Chan. Many felt  disappointed as they were not able to get the new banknotes  owing to the long queues.    At least 65.2 million Hong Kong dollars worth of new  banknotes issued by BOC was withdrawn on the first day, said an  official with BOC.    Besides, a total of 70,000 MTR [mass transit railway]  tickets  designed to commemorate the launch of the new banknotes, each at  a price of 30 H.K. [Hong Kong] dollars, were sold out within  just one hour at BOC's 31 branches yesterday.    Meanwhile, the 20,000 souvenir covers and postmarks were  snapped up as hundreds of people queued up outside the general  post office in central early yesterday and rushed in to buy the  covers each worth of five H.K. dollars [as received].    Another 130,000 commemorative MTR tickets with an encoded  value of 20 H.K. dollars (2.5 U.S. dollars) each, had reportedly  sold out at eight MTR counters on the first day of issue on  Sunday [1 May].    An official from the bank said that 100,000 H.K. dollars  (13,000 U.S. dollars) raised from the sale would be donated to  charity.    The banknotes initially issued by the Bank of China totalled  3 billion H.K. dollars (385 million U.S. dollars) in value,  which accounted for four percent of Hong Kong dollar banknotes  in circulation.    By issuing the banknotes in Hong Kong, the Bank of China has  become the third bank to issue currency in the territory. The  other two banks are the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp and  Standard Chartered Bank.    Analysts here said that the Bank of China's participation in  the issue of Hong Kong dollar notes indicated the bank's  commitment to the Hong Kong community for a smooth transition of  Hong Kong's monetary system and for maintaining its stability  and prosperity.</p>

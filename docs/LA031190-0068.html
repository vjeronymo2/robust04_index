			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TWO PERCEPTIONS OF ANTI-DRUG RALLY FEATURING BUSH AND GATES  </P> <P> I recently had the privilege of attending the anti-drug rally held in Santa Ana  where President Bush was a guest speaker. My 15-year-old son also attended. I  couldn't think of a better lesson he could learn than hearing firsthand the  President of the United States, as well as some of his other heroes, Chuck  Norris, Jim Everett and others, saying: "We support Sheriff (Brad) Gates'  programs on making Orange County drug-free." Chuck Norris had to be so proud of  his own son, Chris, for being able to speak publicly of his own past drug  problems. It really was an incredibly moving day to say the least.  </P> <P> As a parent of a teen-ager, I'd like to thank Sheriff Gates, his staff and  Assistant Sheriff Walt Fath for caring so much about my son and the sons and  daughters of other parents of this county. There is so much pressure on these  teens today, that we parents need all the help we can get, to help fight this  hideous war on drugs. And if Sheriff Gates feels so strongly about this issue,  that he is willing and able to bring the leader of our country to talk to our  children, then I, as a concerned parent, will do everything I can to support  his efforts.  </P> <P> When I see stories from his critics shouting their concerns about Sheriff  Gates' possibly using secretarial time for personal business, or use of  business phones to conduct personal business, I get really concerned. I believe  officials have to be made accountable, and cannot have a free rein. But for  each hour Sheriff Gates spends justifying his actions over these petty matters,  he is not free to concentrate on programs such as the anti-drug rally. And  frankly, I feel my son's future, and the future of the other teens of this  community, is a whole lot more important than worrying about whether Sheriff  Gates called a real estate agent on his business phone or went down the street  to a pay phone.  </P> <P> NAN LIEBSACK  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

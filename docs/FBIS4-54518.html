			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sokol Balla in Sofia] </F>   [Text] After the visit to the Bulgarian National  Historical Museum here in Sofia, an important topic on the third  day of the official visit of our President Sali Berisha was the  joint news conference with Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev.    In his statement Bulgarian President Zhelev pointed out the  quiet road without excesses of the performance of the reforms in  our country. He also stressed that Albania plays a key role in  peace, stability, and security in the Balkans. To defend his  idea, he brought up two arguments: first, the fact that ethnic  Albanians make up 90 percent of the population of Kosova, and  the presence of the Albanians who live in Macedonia [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. Nevertheless,  President Zhelev said, these two acute problems and sore points  are handled with a sound logic, prudence, and political maturity  by the Albanian state and its chairman, Mr. Berisha.    Zhelev said that while in 1991 Albanians came to take our  experience, now in 1994, on the contrary, we are the ones who  should go and see how the economic and political reforms are  carried out in Albania.    Concerning the refusal of the Bulgarian party to participate  in a trilateral meeting proposed by Greece, President Zhelev  stressed that peace and stability in the Balkans are reached and  preserved with the contribution of all Balkan countries.  However, Zhelev stressed, it is not good for two or three sides  to meet and talk behind others' backs. The time has gone when  discussions were held and decisions were made by isolating the  third parties. At present the dialogue is open to any country  interested in the stability of the region. The chairman of the  Albanian state later took the floor.    [Begin Berisha recording] First, I want to thank President  Zhelev from my heart for the warm and friendly reception and  express my greatest pleasure for the level of relations between  Albania and Bulgaria. Our two countries have old friendly and  historic ties. However, I wanted to say that their determination  to develop and strengthen their ties, cooperation, and  friendship at the present time is the most important.    In this respect, both countries, who suffered the communist  dictatorship together and which were engaged in the course of  the reform, are undoubtedly more sensitive to pain and  sufferings, due both to their past and the course of the  reforms; they have a broader meaning for each other. These are  the reasons that in two years, Albania and Bulgaria have signed  dozens of agreements and have established very good political  and economic cooperation. What is the most important is the fact  that the two countries are fighting and actively trying to  achieve peace and stability in the Balkans. I think that our  two countries have played an important role in reducing tension  and preserving peace in the south of the Balkans.    Once again, I avail myself of the opportunity in front of  you  to confirm the great importance of President Zhelev's refusal to  participate in the trilateral summit proposed by the Greek  former prime minister for the Balkans. The Greek prime minister  aimed at placing the Balkans before a religious dangerous  alliance.    I think that the friendly relations between Albania and  Bulgaria will show how states with various beliefs but with the  same principles can cooperate to the benefit of each other and  the region.    During these two days, in the course of my discussions with  President Zhelev, the chairman of the parliament, and Prime  Minister Berov, we discovered with pleasure that there exists a  great desire to develop economic cooperation. We are asking for  help from the European Union so that this cooperation becomes  more fruitful. Thus, our two countries -- and I hope other  countries in the Balkans -- are waiting to profit by the ideas  of the white paper of President Delors. The extension of these  principles of this white paper into the Balkans, which means an  implementation of the East-West corridor and other branches, not  only brings these countries closer to each other but brings our  whole peninsula closer to Europe.    We are very worried about the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. President Zhelev and I think that only  strong action by NATO and a coordination of the cooperation of  the United States, the European Union, and Russia will be able  to bring an end to the crisis.    We also consider very important the stability of the  Republic  of Macedonia. Both our countries have recognized and offered  with pleasure that modest resource they have in the cooperation.  However, we think that the Republic of Macedonia should expand  and guarantee the freedoms and human and national rights of  Albanians as a condition for its stability.    The situation in Kosova is very grave. Ladies and gentlemen,  today, when apartheid has disappeared from the world corners, it  is in power in the cradle of the present Western civilization.  I mean here the territories of the Balkans -- it is in Kosova.  I can say that without the solution of this problem, there does  not exist and cannot be a solution to the Balkan crisis. As  long as the Albanians do not demand the change of borders  through force, i.e., they respect one of the two most  fundamental principles of the Helsinki Charter, the other one  included as well, I think that this problem should be assessed  as soon as possible. On the contrary, Milosevic will implement  in Kosova the application of the memorandum of the Academy of  Sciences of Serbia which, as you know, implies the creation of  Greater Serbia through force by exterminating and cleansing 40  percent of the non-Serbian population that lives in these areas.    We discussed with President Zhelev a series of agreements in  the future. Albania and Bulgaria think that not separate  alliances, but bilateral and multilateral cooperation, is what  will be able to take our region out of the crisis and favor the  integration processes over those of confrontation.    At the same time, I want to clarify the presence of Turkish  troops in Bosnia. Turkey gave a real and concrete contribution  in the understanding between Croats and Muslims. I have  considered and still consider very important the agreement that  both sides who fought against each other signed to interrupt the  war. I am convinced that if the Serbs sign this agreement, this  will be the road of establishing peace and stability there.    Mr. President, in closing I want to convey to all Bulgarians  my best wishes on the Easter holiday. [end recording]    After the news conference, the ceremony for the departure of  President Berisha, his wife, and the delegation accompanying him  was held in front of the presidential seat, where the welcoming  ceremony was also held. President Zhelev, his wife, and the  Bulgarian delegation attended the ceremony. The Albanian  delegation then returned home.</p>

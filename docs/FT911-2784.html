			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / An evolving certainty that God cannot exist: Richard Dawkins, the controversial biologist SOMETHING IN the intensity, the high seriousness, of Richard Dawkins's gaze proclaims that in an earlier age he would have been a priest, or perhaps a philosopher. The impression is strengthened by the delicacy with which each word steps through the minefield of incorrect ideas. Instead, he became a biologist at Oxford University, a champion of Darwinian natural selection and later something of a hate figure among factions of the Left. His two best-known books, The Selfish Gene and The Blind Watchmaker, achieved huge popular success in explaining how Darwin's original ideas have been refined by later research and how the modern theory can explain apparent paradoxes such as self sacrifice and altruism in many species, the 'uselessness' of the peacock's tail or the amazing complexities of bats' 'radar'. Such marvels of nature, which captured Darwin's imagination and attracted generations of later biologists to the science, were for Dawkins, however, beside the main point. 'It was not an interest in bird watching or bug hunting, I am, in a way, sorry to say. It was a philosophical interest. I have always been intrigued by questions of existence: why we are here; what we are for; what is the ultimate purpose of everything? 'I suppose I was a deeply religious person in the sense of being interested in religious questions, but I became deeply anti-religious in the sense of the sort of answer one gave to those questions.' Dawkins was at the Royal Institution in London to discuss next year's Christmas Lectures for Young People, which he has agreed to deliver. He leaned forward - as if to be sure that he was understood - across the old desk that used to belong to Michael Faraday. The leather couch, the big brass microscope and the soft gloom of the great 19th century physicist's study all contributed to his passionate sincerity of purpose. So wherein lies the magic, the secret of life, which so compelled him and whose contemplation led Dawkins to conclude that God does not exist? 'The wonder that struck me and still strikes me is the wonder of complexity, the improbability of it all, the fact that it is there at all. The essential feature of life from my point of view is that it is statistically improbable; and that is by definition difficult to explain. If anyone said to you that the atoms of a watch or a telephone have come into the way they are by chance, you would laugh and say 'don't be so stupid.' 'So we are seeking an explanation of how you can get from something that is easy to explain - by definition something simple - to something that is difficult to explain - something complicated. 'That is precisely what Darwinian theory does. It starts off with simplicity and shows how you can move from the simple (the easy to explain) to the complex (the difficult to explain) by gradual degrees and stages, without demanding a leap of belief. Every step could come about by reasonable transformations, never violating the laws of physics. 'For anything complicated to spring into being spontaneously, this principle would have to violated. 'Now, the thing about a creator God is that he violates that principle. If you are going to say that in the beginning there was a creator who thought up the laws of physics and set everything in motion and created us, then he has to be the complex improbable being of exactly the same type as you are trying to explain, so you are defeating the whole exercise.' In The Blind Watchmaker, Dawkins says that if he had lived before 1859, when Darwin published The Origin of the Species, he would have believed in The Creator, as the best theory going. Does it follow that after 1859 any biologist is a fool to believe in God? 'I daren't say that because some of my best friends are Christians. But let me think . . . most of my colleagues would say there may be a God, but we can't possibly know, that this is a separate question on which science has nothing to say; that religion has its own world of discourse; that the two don't meet and have nothing to say to each other. 'I don't feel that. I think agnosticism is, as nearly as one can say, refutable.' But are there no counter argument which he respects? 'None that I think is good. People say, for example: God isn't complex, he is exceedingly simple. In which case I would say God is not doing the job he is supposed to do. More especially, if God is just one of the relationships of physics, he has absolutely nothing to do with forgiveness of sins or virgin birth. All the intricate complexity of theology, you're then admitting, is so much eye-wash, because you are reducing God to something as simple as a physical constant.' But perhaps Dawkins's high certainty results from his being expert in a branch of science whose central mystery has been solved. In physics, where recent discoveries appear repugnant to common sense, some scientists - Roger Penrose in The Emperor's New Mind, for example - seem imbued with a more primitive sense of wonder. 'Quantum theory (which describes the behaviour of elementary particles) is profoundly awe-inspiring because it is against common sense. The human brain doesn't seem to be able to get to grips with the idea of a particle being in two places at once. 'But a deity is a remarkably simple concept, a very naive childish concept. In physics there is a profound mystery which we still do not understand, unlike the case of biology, which we do understand; but what on earth makes you think that that mystery is going to be removed by a deity? If it is ever removed, it is going to be removed by something a lot more sophisticated.' Does he feel that the vigour of his views has made him a hate figure in certain quarters? . . . Well, seen as an extremist, perhaps? 'Let's stick with the phrase 'hate figure'. You raised it in the context of religion; I think I am not at all a hate figure in religious circles. 'However, among a minority of intellectuals on the Left, I have become associated with hate ideas - genetic determinism and reductionism - which to them are sinister because they carry all sorts of political baggage, leading in extreme cases to talk of Hitler, gas chambers and emotive stuff like that.' In The Selfish Gene, Dawkins argued that all living things are 'survival machines' built to designs passed through generations by self-replicating genes. Natural selection represents a no-holds-barred competition for survival between genes. The characteristics of plants and animals (but not human culture) are the result of this 'selfish' struggle between genes: only the fittest survive. 'Some organs of the extreme fascist Right, some racists, have mistakenly quoted my ideas. It all stems from a popular myth that if something - for example, aggression or homosexuality - is genetically controlled you are stuck with it and can't escape from it. No amount of education or social workers will help; people are going to want and need to fight in just the same way that they want and need to eat. That is a false myth, but you can see that if you were a fascist or a left wing intellectual who believed it you would seize upon what I write for different reasons.' But don't people also dislike the Dawkins message because it is bleak, uncompromising and destroys illusions? 'First, if the news is bad let's hear it. A lot of people don't understand that. There are some unpleasant truths we need to know. Second, the news is not that bleak: the selfish gene programs individuals to be altruistic in order to favour the selfish interest of the gene itself. Third, human behaviour does not have to be governed by genetic determinism. We can do all sorts of things like give money to Oxfam which have nothing to do with selfish genes, but a lot to do with culture. This is a completely different process which in the looser sense is evolutionary. That gets us right away from the message of the selfish gene as far as humans are concerned.' Yet, don't some find the tough-minded Dawkins style of delivering this message rather off putting - for example the way Hugh Montefiore, former Bishop of Birmingham, was ridiculed for not understanding why polar bears are white? Wasn't Darwin more gentle? 'I am gentle with individuals, but I am not the kind of liberal who thinks if there are two points of view, the truth must lie somewhere between them. We should not mince words nor give the time of day to a point of view that is clearly wrong . . . But I could be persuaded that tactically this is not the best way to do things . . . ' Still, wasn't it arrogant to come down so heavily on the university debater who argued the case for creation without believing it? 'I felt aggrieved at being brought along to advocate a case which I passionately believed in, only to discover other people were there exercising their advocacy muscle.' But why such passion? Surely, it is only the arguments that count. 'Passion is too strong a word . . . I suppose I do care about the really fundamental truths about the universe: we spent centuries fighting our way out of ignorance and superstition. I suppose I am passionate about that.'</p>

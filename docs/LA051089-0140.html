			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> LIBYA CHEMICAL PLANT SUPPLIER HELD  </P> <P> Authorities today arrested the former head of a West German company at the  center of a scandal involving a suspected chemical weapons plant in Libya.  </P> <P> West German and U.S. authorities alleged that the company, Imhausen-Chemie, was  the key supplier of material for the plant in the Libyan city of Rabta. Libya  claimed that the plant was for making pharmaceuticals, but U.S. and West German  officials claim that it was intended to manufacture chemical weapons.  </P> <P> Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen, who was chief of Imhausen-Chemie until March, was  arrested in the city of Bochum, said prosecutor Holger Preisendanz, who is  leading the probe into the case. Hippenstiel-Imhausen is "strongly suspected"  of violating West German export laws, Preisendanz said. Authorities were  concerned that Hippenstiel-Imhausen may have been preparing to flee West  Germany.  </P></p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Unilever shakes up head offices UNILEVER, the multinational consumer products group, yesterday announced a modest reduction in staff levels at its head office in London following a review of the way the group serves its 500 operating companies worldwide. The reorganisation, proposed last June, will involve physical transfer of some operating company managements away from the head offices where they have been located for historical reasons. Staff levels will rise by a 'small' amount in the Netherlands as a result of transfers from London. Unilever had restricted the reorganisation by ruling out an amalgamation of the dual head office structure, split between the Netherlands and the UK since the 1930s. Nevertheless, the relatively small reduction in the head count, involving less than 100 redundancies in the UK, is likely to lead to disappointment among observers hoping the cuts would have been been deeper. The new centre will have 1,075 staff - 675 in London and 400 in Rotterdam. In addition, 260 jobs that support operating companies will be dispersed from the two head offices to locations near the businesses they serve. National managements in the UK and the Netherlands, which are currently housed within the head office will also be separated, although they will remain physically within the head office complexes. In the UK this will involve 190 jobs and in Rotterdam 140 jobs. At the end of last year Unilever's head office staff count was just short of 1,800 people. Unilever said the new structure would 'clarify roles and responsibilities, simplify reporting lines and bring about closer relationships between support staff and those they serve'. Mr John Campbell, food manufacturing analyst at NatWest Markets, said the important decision was to separate the national and operational managements. 'There will be some who will be disappointed that the cuts were not more dramatic,' he said. 'I suspect that was unrealistic bearing in mind the nature of what these people do.' Unilever was the world's largest producer of fast-moving consumer goods so the head office was unlikely to be much smaller, unless the two headquarters were unified. Lex, Page 16</p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Ecuador expects IMF loan accord ECUADOR is expected to secure soon a Dollars 200m (Pounds 129.8m) stand-by loan from the International Monetary Fund, a letter of intent having been signed last week. The letter fixes the government's macro-economic objectives in a two-year adjustment plan and forecasts growth of 2.5-3 per cent this year. The government has also pledged to reduce its fiscal deficit and to cut inflation to an annual 30 per cent from last year's 50 per cent. The preliminary accord with the IMF comes after several failed attempts to renegotiate Dollars 6.5bn of commercial debt with creditor banks. It is hoped the IMF deal will instil confidence among creditors and foreign investors who have been hesitant to take advantage of Ecuador's liberalisation of foreign investment regulations. The government has pushed through Congress a law to regulate and revitalise the stock market. Tax incentives are offered to draw more companies to the market, while stricter regulations require companies to provide buyers with more financial information. The adjustment plan has been criticised for its lack of social provision for the 50 per cent of Ecuador's population living in extreme poverty. Fearing that modernisation will cost them their jobs, workers staged a two-day national general strike last week. Increases in electricity and telephone rates have also provoked widespread discontent.</p>

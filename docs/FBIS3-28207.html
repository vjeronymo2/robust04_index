			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 4 (YONHAP) -- A senior government  official, concerned over doubts about Korea-U.S. ties aroused  by Washington's reported pressure on Seoul to buy Patriot  missiles, said on Friday there is no change in their basic  relations. Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said no  decision has been made on deployment of the anti-missile  missiles in Korea, though negotiations are under way between the  two countries.    "I understand that the U.S. Government has not yet made a  final decision on whether the U.S. forces in Korea should be  equipped with Patriot missiles," he said. "I think the missiles  will be deployed after Seoul and Washington reach agreement on  the number of missiles and the date of deployment, considering  any possible developments in the situation related to North  Korea's nuclear weapons program."    Washington has not pressured Seoul to buy U.S. weapons, the  official said, commenting on local press reports that the  Pentagon has asked Korea to buy airborne self-protection jammers  for the Korean fighter program.    A letter reportedly sent by U.S. Defense Secretary-nominee  William J. Perry to Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae asking Korea  to buy jammers for the Korean Air Force's F-16 fighters was not  meant to apply pressure, but to advise that production of the  jammers has been suspended due to problems with the weapon, he  said.    Only some of the 120 F-16 fighters Korea is to import will  be  equipped with the existing model of jammers and the rest with a  modified new model, he said, adding that the United States has  not given up the airborne self-protection jammer project despite  suspending production.    "Nobody knows at the moment whether North Korea will allow  the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect its nuclear  facilities," the official said, "and the government does not  want the North Korean nuclear issue to go to the UN Security  Council and thus to heighten tensions on the Korean peninsula.  There is no discord between Seoul and Washington over the North  Korean nuclear issue and the two governments are maintaining  close cooperation."    The opposition Democratic Party is angry about the U.S.  Government's reported pressure on Korea to buy the jammers.    In a statement issued on Friday, party spokesman Pak Chi-won  said, "I feel indignation at U.S. Defense Secretary-nominee  William Perry's pressure for Korea to buy defective radar  jammers through channels outside the usual ones in weapons trade  between the two countries. The government should make public  this pressure and seek a new diplomatic approach toward the  United States, defying such pressure."    Perry's letter to Defense Minister Yi will damage the two  nations' traditional friendship, he said, urging the U.S.  Government to reflect on whether the letter is tantamount to  regarding Korea as a disposal site for defective weapons.    Washington should "apologize for the letter," he added.</p>

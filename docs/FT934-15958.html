			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: Corning issues earnings warning CORNING, the US glass and high technology group, warned that its third-quarter results were falling short of expectations and earnings before special charges could be 10 per cent lower than last year's 53 cents a share. The company intended to expand upon its previously announced restructuring charges to cover the cost of reducing assets and overhead expenses. The charge would total some Dollars 130m. Mr James Houghton, the chairman, also said: 'Earnings before unusual items for the full year are currently not expected to reach last year's level of Dollars 1.66 a share. 'The principal shortfall,' he added, 'has been in the consumer products business and other cyclically sensitive businesses, especially in Europe.' In addition, the group's MedPath healthcare related business had seen a slowdown in its rate of growth in recent months. However, the group was enjoying a continuing strong performance in the optical fibre business and improved operating earnings in information display, science products and pharmaceutical services. Earnings from equity interests were also expected to improve over last year. He added that the group was aggressively responding by getting its cost structure better aligned with current business conditions. Corning expects to release its results on October 19.</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Inflation in US slows to annual rate of 2.6%: Fall is likely to anger Fed's critics US inflation slowed again last month, the Labour Department reported yesterday, giving fresh ammunition to critics of the Federal Reserve's decision on Tuesday to raise interest rates by  3/4 of a percentage point in order to head off inflationary pressures. The consumer price index rose by 0.1 per cent in October, the department reported, the smallest monthly increase since April. Over the last 12 months the index has risen by just 2.6 per cent, much slower than September's year-on-year inflation rate of 3.0 per cent. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the inflation index rose by 0.2 per cent in October for a year-on-year increase of 2.9 per cent. Food and drink prices remained unchanged in October and have increased by 2.2 per cent over the last 12 months. Energy prices fell 0.9 per cent in October and have gained just 0.4 per cent over the last year. Apparel, upkeep and transportation prices fell in October, while medical care, entertainment and other goods and services increased in price. Although yesterday's figures showed that inflation remains restrained, the Labour Department announced yesterday that it planned to make significant changes to the way it calculates the index, which many economists, including the Federal Reserve, believe overstates the real rate of inflation. The changes will address the way prices are calculated for food eaten at home, rents and patented drugs. But critics of the index say that because the Labour Department still uses fixed weights for the basket of goods and services included in the index it will still exaggerate the rate of inflation. A recent study by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas estimated that several different biases cause the CPI to overstate inflation by just under 1 per cent a year. A downwards revision in the inflation index could help the federal government keep its budget deficit under better control, because the index is used to calculate cost of living adjustments for government wages and retirement pay as well as social benefits such as social security pensions. In a separate announcement, the Commerce Department said business inventories rose in September for the sixth successive month, increasing by 0.5 per cent to a seasonally adjusted total of Dollars 907.2bn (Pounds 553.1bn) Inventories have risen sharply in recent months, but they remain at historically low levels, and the ratio of inventories to sales climbed only 0.01 from the historic low it reached in August to 1.4 in September,</p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Bimec to restructure as part of rescue plan BANKERS to Bimec, which only two years ago was considered one of the purest of 'green' stock market investments, are to write off Pounds 5m of debt in a restructuring to keep the receivers at bay. Announcing the rescue, Mr Roy Barber, chairman, said Bimec would also be suing its auditors, Grant Thornton, for breach of contract and negligence. The perilous state of the company was apparent but undisclosed in the audit for the year ending March 1992, Bimec claims. The water, waste treatment and engineering company reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 16.4m (Pounds 6.04m profits) in the year to end-March, on sales down 22 per cent at Pounds 80.8m. This loss was almost double the sum of profits in the five previous years and leaves Bimec with negative shareholders' funds. Losses per share amounted to 13.9p (5.1p earnings) and there is no dividend. In 1992 the group announced and then cancelled its final dividend, causing the shares to lose two thirds of their value. Mr Barber, who was appointed last September, and Bimec's advisers, Schroders, said that without the restructuring, Lloyds, the company's bankers, would be invited to appoint receivers. As part of the restructuring, Bimec will sell a number of businesses, including assets in its aero and industrial division and two businesses in its water and waste treatment divisions to EIS, the engineering group. The total proceeds from the sale are expected to be Pounds 8m. EIS is paying Pounds 5m. In addition to writing off Pounds 5m of debt, Lloyds is converting Pounds 500,000 it is owed into ordinary shares and Pounds 3m into preference shares. The bank has also agreed to provide a five-year Pounds 4.9m interest free loan. Lloyds support is dependent on shareholders' approval and Bimec continuing its proposed disposal programme. Mr Barber said that after the restructuring the group would be focused in waste and water treatment with sales of about Pounds 30m. At its peak in 1991 Bimec had sales of more than Pounds 100m. Following the restructuring the company would have repaid, written off or converted all its Pounds 16m of net debt and would have the ability to draw down on the Lloyds bank facility, he said. The issue of shares to Lloyds Bank will dilute existing ordinary holdings by 8 per cent. The businesses being sold to EIS had combined losses of Pounds 3.2m on sales of Pounds 24m, after exceptional costs of Pounds 2.7m in the last financial year. Two of the businesses are suppliers of equipment to the process plant, water treat-ment and environmental industries. The others develop and supply parts and undertake overhauls and repairs for aircraft and jet engines.</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / UK Company News: City Site Estates back in black with Pounds 349,000 City Site Estates, the Glasgow-based property company, returned to the black in the year to September 1993, its first profit since 1989, as a result of profitable property sales and the absence of any further write-downs. Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 349,000, compared with losses of Pounds 18.1m restated in accordance with FRS 3. The 1992 figures were held back by Pounds 15.3m in property write-downs and a Pounds 3m write-off of goodwill from an acquisition. The company sold two properties during the year for Pounds 29m and reduced net debt by Pounds 20m to Pounds 71m. City Site recently put Hansard House, London, up for sale at Pounds 11.4m - which would result in a book profit of close to Pounds 1m - and is looking to reinvest the proceeds in other property deals. Mr Louis Goodman, managing director, said 'we will be taking the company forward in an aggressive manner'. Since September, City Site has signed purchase agreements on Pounds 6m of properties in Scotland. The company still has a deficit of Pounds 3.7m on its distributable reserves, and is unable to pay dividends. It has applied to the Court of Sessions to transfer Pounds 1.7m from its capital redemption reserve, and with the continued appreciation in property valuations it is confident it will start to repay deferred preference share dividends at the end of the current fiscal year. Rental income amounted to Pounds 9.93m (Pounds 11m) and operating profits were sufficient to cover net interest payable of Pounds 8.17m (Pounds 9.7m). Losses per share came through at 5p, against 120p.</p>

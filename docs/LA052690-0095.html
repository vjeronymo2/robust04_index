			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Smaller Personal Income Gains: Americans spent more during April despite a  slump in income gains, the Commerce Department said.  </P> <P> But personal income rose a mere 0.3% -- the smallest monthly increase in seven  months -- after solid gains of 0.8% in the two preceding months. The last time  there was a smaller increase was September of 1989, when incomes were up 0.2%.  But spending rose at a stronger-than-forecast 0.6% last month after gains of  0.5% in February and March.  </P></p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / US ousts Japan as world's most competitive economy After eight years as undisputed economic pace-setter, Japan has lost its ranking as the world's most competitive economy to the US. It has slipped to third place behindSingapore, according to the latest World Competitiveness Report published today. Three other East Asian nations - Hong Kong, Malaysia and Taiwan - make the top 20 while Italy, with the world's fifth largest economy, comes an ignominious 32nd out of 41 nations assessed - behind Turkey, Colombia and Indonesia. Germany, the highest rated European country, comes fifth. Britain ranks 14th in the global league but moves up two places in the European rankings (from 11th to 9th) on the back of deregulation moves and economic recovery. The rankings, which attempt to measure the ability of a country to outperform its competitors, are compiled annually by the Swiss-based International Institute for Management Development and the World Economic Forum. This is the first time industrialised and developing countries have been included in the same scoreboard, although China and Russia were excluded for lack of comparable information. Countries are ranked in eight areas, such as domestic economic strength, infrastructure and management, on the basis of 381 criteria which range from computers per capita to alcohol and drug abuse. The US resurgence is attributed principally to the strong and early economic recovery, coupled with high scores on entrepreneurship, internationalisation and 'financial vitality'. Japan's ranking has been hit by the worst economic recession in decades and increasing disaffection with the political system, although it continues to lead in management and technology. Second-placed Singapore is rated first for the extent to which government policies help competitiveness, and for the quality of its labour force. Lean and mean, Page 4</p>

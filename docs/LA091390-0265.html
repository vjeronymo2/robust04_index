			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> S.F. SYMPHONY OKS CONTRACT  </P> <P> The San Francisco Opera Orchestra ratified a new contract Wednesday, ending a  dispute that delayed the start of the 1990 season more than a week.  </P> <P> Liza Hirsch DuBrul, a lawyer representing the orchestra, would not disclose the  margin of approval but said "it was a very strong vote."  </P> <P> The orchestra's 69 musicians gave tentative approval to the pact Sunday, after  several days of intense negotiations, and rehearsals resumed Monday.  </P> <P> Opera spokesman Jon Finck said the opera's board of directors unanimously  approved the contract Tuesday.  </P> <P> The contract dispute prompted the opera to cancel opening night's performance  of Leoncavallo's "Pagliacci" and Puccini's "Suor Angelica" on Sept. 7.  Subsequent performances through Friday also were canceled.  </P> <P> But after the orchestra tentatively approved the opera's latest contract offer,  opening night was rescheduled for Saturday with a performance of Verdi's  "Rigoletto."  </P> <P> The traditional opening night gala, a glittering fund-raiser for the opera's  educational programs, also was canceled but has been reset for Nov. 5.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by political </F> correspondent Gil Litman; at the Allenby Bridge on 6  January--recorded, broadcast in progress]    [Text] [Rabin] ...I will not make prophecies about what  will happen in 10 days. We should wait 10 days, and find the  degree of similarity between the Syrian and our interpretation  of the term full peace, which they have been using. Naturally,  there will be the question of what it will demand as the price  for full peace according to our interpretation.    [Litman] You were quoted by the French media as saying that  Israel can sign a peace agreement with Jordan, as far as you are  concerned, in three weeks. What prevents signing a peace  contract soon?    [Rabin] Jordan prevents this.    [Litman] Why?    [Rabin] I do not believe that today it is ready to be the  first of the three Arab countries with which we are negotiating  to sign a peace agreement with us. We have no problems of  security nor problems linked to essential territorial aspects  with Jordan. Today, the issue of the Palestinians, the future of  the territories, is being discussed with the Palestinians, the  PLO, and not with Jordan. Therefore, when we speak of peace  with Jordan, we are referring to the border that existed between  mandatory Eretz Yisra'el and Jordan.    There is another country with which we have no territorial  problems, but have a security problem -- Lebanon. With it,  matters are more complex. Also, its freedom of political  maneuvering is more limited than that of Jordan. I am afraid  that, apparently, Jordan also feels that it does not have enough  freedom of political maneuvering to reach a peace accord with us.</p>

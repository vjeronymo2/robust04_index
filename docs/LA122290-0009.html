			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAHARA CLUB AND DESERT ENVIRONMENTALISTS  </P> <P> Rick Sieman says he wants his Sahara Club "to be the organization that people  can come to get the real facts." One wonders where he expects to get these  facts.  </P> <P> It's obvious he doesn't subscribe to any popular science or news magazines, or  even read the newspaper. Otherwise, he'd realize that "the same clowns who were  warning you about the planet freezing over 20 years ago (and) are now babbling  about global warming" are not "eco-freaks" but scientists. Scientific data  supported each of these predictions, and scientific principles are always  changing based on new evidence obtained from ongoing research.  </P> <P> Scientists, not "eco-freaks," also have data based on years of ongoing studies  that the annual Barstow to Vegas motorcycle race harms the desert ecosystem and  habitat for the threatened desert tortoise. Sieman's so-called "eco-freaks"  merely support well-founded scientific results; they do not create them.  </P> <P> KATHY KEANE  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

[A.J.] At this conference in Trieste, an impression has been  formed that you are much more optimistic about the chances of  Bosnian peace than you were before. On what do you base this?    [Ljubijankic] We have indeed become more optimistic, which  is mainly due to two developments. First, the deployment of the  NATO planes, and because the Atlantic Alliance has given an  ultimatum to the Serbs. The other factor giving hope to us is  the Washington agreement between the Croatians and Bosnians on  the structure of Bosnia and the division of responsibility, and  the agreement on the confederation between Croatia and the  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [A.J.] How can these agreements promote peace?    [Ljubijankic] This way, we will be in a better position on  the front against the Serbs; this way, we have gained a stronger  position against the Serbian expansion that we have seen over  the past three years.    [A.J.] Do you think that this way you will be able to drive  back the Bosnian Serbs from the areas that they have occupied  illegally?    [Ljubijankic] These areas are not theirs and have never been  theirs. We continue to emphasize that this is not a civil war  and it is a big mistake to see it as such. This has always been  an aggressive war in the course of which pseudo-states have been  set up in Croatia and Bosnia as a first step to annexing them to  Serbia. The international community has to recognize this  intent. Now, as a result of these developments, we can  negotiate from a better position than before. This is how I  mean our stronger position: As NATO has at long last begun to  talk language that the Serbs understand, it will be easier to  negotiate with them.    [A.J.] Does the Croatian-Bosnian confederation mean a tacit  acceptance of Bosnia's division and giving up the country's  unity?    [Ljubijankic] We will never give up Bosnia's unity.  However, this way, we establish a high-level example of local  governments and local autonomy, thus even creating a kind of  model that can be found in Switzerland or perhaps in other  European countries, for example Belgium.    [A.J.] Are you trying to "recapture" the Serbs through this  model so that they will join you in the future in a new Bosnia?    [Ljubijankic] I am not as optimistic as this regarding the  Serbs, but we have to continue the practice that convinces them  and the rest of the world that this viral infection of national  socialism has to be defeated. In my view, without proving this,  no one will be able to convince the Serbs to live in Bosnia.  The Serbs have never been in the Vojvodina, but they are there  now; they have never been on the left bank of the Drina River,  and now they are there, too. This expansion should be stopped.    [A.J.] Do you therefore believe that the peace that can now  be achieved is only temporary and not a final settlement?    [Ljubijankic] I would prefer to use the term creating an  example to temporary peace. However, real peace does not exist  if it is not just. Therefore, this is the first step toward  establishing a just peace.    [A.J.] Shall we just call this a cease-fire?    [Ljubijanic] Yes, this can be seen as a kind of cease-fire.</p>

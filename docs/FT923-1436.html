			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Royal mail launches new bike ROYAL MAIL yesterday launched a three-speed bicycle that will replace its 35,000-strong fleet of 'boneshakers' as they wear out. It is the first total redesign of Royal Mail bicycles in 60 years. Postmen and women cycle 3,000 miles on average each year. The new mount features a redesigned frame, all-weather hub brakes, mountain bike-style handlebars and 'virtually indestructible' plastic mudguards.</p>

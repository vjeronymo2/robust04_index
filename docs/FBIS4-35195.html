			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Furayh Abu-Middayn, member of the </F> Palestinian National Authority and head of the justice  portfolio, in Tunis, by 'Umar Zaydani in the studio; date not  given; from the "With the Midday Events" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Zaydani] Furayh Abu-Middayn, justice minister in  the Palestinian National Authority: Would you please explain  the significance of the appointments announced in Tunis  yesterday?    [Abu-Middayn] The appointments that have taken place over  the  past 48 hours were aimed at meeting the requirements of  establishing ministries capable of serving the people in the  West Bank in general and in Gaza in particular. There are many  outstanding issues, and there is also an administrative, legal,  and constitutional vacuum in the occupied territories.  Therefore, the government was formed quickly. Even the  oath-taking ceremony was postponed so that it can be held on  part of the Palestinian land. I believe it will take place in  Jericho next month. These appointments, as you know, occurred  before the arrival of financial aid. The European countries, as  well as other countries, should begin to pump money. Therefore,  there should be a ministerial apparatus capable of acting  immediately to run daily affairs. As you know, there are crises  in the areas of unemployment, financing, and supply. So, what  took place was an attempt to fill the vacuum that has resulted  from the withdrawal and then to keep the old administrative  apparatus. But there should be officials with political weight  who refer to the PLO in everything. In brief this is what took  place.    [Zaydani] When will the members of the Palestinian National  Authority arrive in Gaza and Jericho?    [Abu-Middayn] Most probably they will arrive within a week.  Their return was approved, and I believe they will arrive within  a week. There are many problems, and people are allowed to go  to the inside [self-rule area]. I believe there is a logistical  problem in Jericho, and offices are not ready. As for Gaza,  there are places and offices, and it can absorb all the brothers  coming from outside.    [Zaydani] Furayh Abu-Middayn, why has Yasir 'Arafat not so  far succeeded in appointing all the members of the Palestinian  National Authority?    [Abu-Middayn] Consultations with some political sides are  underway. Although the issue is not a geographical one, there  are three or four people from the Gaza Strip to be named.  Intensive consultations are underway, and I believe that the  most important ministries have been named. We will give  ourselves time to appoint the remaining five or six ministers  from the [occupied territories]. It is more of a technical than  political problem.    [Zaydani] Furayh Abu-Middayn, there is much criticism in  Israel. You are talking about ministries and the formation of a  government. There is an agreement on a self-rule in  Gaza-Jericho First, but you are adopting a political program or  a constitution indicating the establishment of almost an  independent Palestinian State with Jerusalem as its capital.    [Abu-Middayn] These are future ambitions. We are talking and  acting in accordance with the Cairo and Oslo accords. Every one  knows this reality. But the Palestinian people have ambitions  for which they have offered great sacrifices. These things that  annoy Israel are merely abstract and future things. However, we  are committed to every detail in these accords. The Palestinian  people's future thoughts, however, should not be confiscated.  There is an intention to establish a state, and there is an  intention to establish a confederation with Jordan. There are  many things we should think about from now on. We want to  straighten matters out. The State of Israel itself has no  constitution and does not recognize fixed borders. Why is  Israel not criticized? The absence of a constitution in Israel  is a source of fear for the Palestinian side because borders are  not defined. These matters should not upset Israel, and I do  not believe that Israel has fears more than necessary.    [Zaydani] Furayh Abu-Middayn, you are now in Tunis. Israel  has warned the PLO against establishing institutions for the  self-rule in East Jerusalem and conducting activities from  Orient House, the Economic Planning Council, and the Palestinian  Statistics Center. Is the PLO trying to create a fait accompli  in East Jerusalem?    [Abu-Middayn] It is Israel which is trying to impose a fait  accompli. If Israel had frozen settlement in East Jerusalem,  there would have been no problem with the Palestinian side.  Jerusalem is a very sensitive issue, and Israel is not  committed to accords on freezing settlements. There has been a  pledge since President Bush's era that settlement activity would  be frozen. At that time, Israel obtained a loan guarantee of  $10 billion as support for Israel's economy. It is Israel which  makes changes on the ground. There are 150,000 Palestinian  citizens in East Jerusalem. These people have rights and the  PLO has the right to think seriously about them and to keep them  in the political and geographical map. Meanwhile, Israel  expands. It extends Jerusalem northward, eastward, and  southward. Israel should commit itself. If Israel had  announced halting or freezing settlements, there would not have  been all this trouble. Rather, this is self-defense than  provoking the Israeli side.    [Zaydani] Furayh Abu-Middayn, justice minister in the  Palestinian National Authority. Thank you very much.    [Abu-Middayn] You are welcome.</p>

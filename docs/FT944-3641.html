			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Equity Markets: Johannesburg - Other Markets With the reporting season largely over in South Africa, the stock exchange is preoccupied with dividends - mining house Gold Fields of South Africa is due to release details this week - and trying to decide whether the current bull market has largely run its course, writes Mark Suzman. South African stocks have weathered the global downturn in equities better than most markets and both gold and industrial stocks have had a good year. However, with its p/e ratio edging up to 19 and only moderate growth of 3 per cent to 4 per cent expected over the next year, some analysts are predicting a limited correction before the JSE can resume its upward climb. Others, however, remain bullish, particularly on industrial stocks, in light of the market's expanding international profile. The optimists cite a recent report by Banque Paribas which predicts that Dollars 2bn - Dollars 3bn could flow in over the next 12 months because of South Africa's size relative to other emerging markets, while pessimists point to probable currency depreciation as a disincentive to foreigners. However, no major movements are expected until after the holiday season. Compiled by Michael Morgan</p>

			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIKING COACH LASHES OUT AT CRITICS OF HIS OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR  </P> <P> Coach Jerry Burns unleashed an apparently unprovoked, obscenity-riddled tirade  against Viking fans and reporters who have heavily criticized his offensive  coordinator, Bob Schnelker, after Minnesota's 23-21 victory Sunday.  </P> <P> Earlier in the week, local columnists began suggesting that Schnelker be  replaced after Herschel Walker had only 12 carries in the Vikings' 24-14 loss  to the New York Giants Monday night.  </P> <P> And Sunday afternoon, when the Metrodome's big-screen scoreboard showed  Schnelker on the sidelines, the crowd lashed out with boos.  </P> <P> After the game, Burns lashed back.  </P> <P> "As long as I've got this . . . job, Bob Schnelker will be the . . . offensive  coordinator," Burns screamed after stepping to the podium in an interview room.  "We can't be responsible for the . . . blocking, or the . . . tackling or the .  . . guys jumping offsides.  </P> <P> "We have one dumb . . . play by (Alfred) Anderson when his . . . shoe is coming  off. We're . . . hollering to call time out, but we run the . . . trap play and  his . . . shoe comes off. That ain't Bob Schnelker's fault."  </P> <P> Burns went on to list another three or four mistakes by his players before  concluding that the criticism of Schnelker should cease.  </P> <P> When he finally stopped yelling, someone asked him if his team had indeed just  won a game.  </P> <P> "I think we did, yeah," Burns said, softly.

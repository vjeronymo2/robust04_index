			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NEW COUNTY NETWORK TO BOOST PRENATAL CARE FOR THE LOW-INCOME  </P> <P> Acountywide plan to vastly improve prenatal care for low-income women was  approved Tuesday by the San Diego County Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> With local hospital emergency rooms handling an increasing number of cases in  which women have had no prenatal care, the new Perinatal Provider Network was  adopted to reduce infant mortality and the number of babies born prematurely,  according to supervisors and health and social service workers.  </P> <P> The existing public and private health care system is fragmented and  inefficient, the new network will coordinate services and improve access for  pregnant women who cannot afford prenatal care, said Paul Simms, deputy  director of physical health services for the county health department.  </P> <P> Also, Medi-Cal reimbursements will be increased for obstetricians, Simms said.  </P> <P> The network will require no county money; state funds and billing fees to  participating doctors will cover expenses.  </P> <P> "You cannot measure the human suffering (of premature babies), and the  financial impact is tremendous," Board of Supervisors chairman Leon Williams  said. "This project will prevent many of these problems. . . . It will be  humanitarian and cost-effective."  </P> <P> The average cost for prenatal care for a healthy woman is $600, while costs for  a premature baby needing intensive medical care are $2,500 a day. Last year,  there were 3,889 births to women who had had no prenatal care.  </P> <P> Children with low birth weights often have developmental disabilities and  require years of expensive care in the public health, social service and  education systems, and are at increased risk for being abused and neglected,  health experts say.  </P> <P> Although an estimated 72% of San Diego obstetricians refuse to treat Medi-Cal  patients because of billing problems and low reimbursement, county officials  hope to change that by increasing physician fees from $650 a patient to $1,000  and using electronic billing. Doctors will be eligible to participate in the  new network, which will guarantee reimbursement within 30 days, if they accept  one new Medi-Cal patient a month.  </P> <P> At first, 12 to 15 workers will be hired to recruit doctors to join the  program. The network's first-year costs will be paid for with $835,000 in state  funds. Future expenses will be covered by a 7% billing fee charged to doctors  for Medi-Cal payments. The time needed to complete Medi-Cal paper work will be  reduced from five to seven weeks to up to three weeks.  </P> <P> The network, which is expected to be running within 45 days, is the product of  five years of review and several months of study, Simms said.  </P> <P> Under the network, a variety of private physicians and community programs will  provide patients with medical care and support services from the time of  pregnancy to 60 days after the birth.  </P> <P> The network will also include an outreach program to educate women about the  dangers of tobacco, drugs, alcohol and ignoring prenatal care; case management  to better handle each patient's needs, and follow-up services to detect any  post-birth problems.  </P></p>

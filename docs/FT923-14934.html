			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Gardening: A welcome addition to the calendar - Arthur Hellyer looks forward to a bigger - and even better - Hampton Court flower show WHEN I tried to buy a scarce hardy geranium recently I was told that I could not have it until after the Hampton Court Palace Flower Show, a small example of the importance which nurserymen now attach to this international exhibition to be held next week from July 9-12. The show was an immediate success when it was launched by British Rail's Network South East in 1990. Last year it was joined by the Royal National Rose Society and the British Rose Growers Association which are again this year occupying a large marquee for the British Rose Festival. An entirely new exhibitor this year is the National Council for the Conservation of Plants and Gardens, which will have 31 of its collections on view, the first time that the NCCPG has exhibited on such a scale. Show gardens for Hampton Court are specially chosen and this year there are to be 34 of them, including five for Aquatics Village beside the Long Water, a canal-like lake that stretches almost to Kingston upon Thames. One of special interest to the elderly is a retired gardener's garden made by City Rural Landscape Services for the Gardeners' Royal Benevolent Society. It is full of good ideas that are neither costly to make nor difficult to maintain. A second garden with a similar theme is being made by Robin Templar Williams for Help the Aged. There is also to be a small garden by Cottage Garden Roses featuring a new variety, Gloria Hunniford, which reminds me of a favourite rose of half a century ago, Madam Butterfly, with shapely, well-scented, pink flowers. More fanciful in conception and execution is Paul Cooper's 'Crystal Palace', a garden which uses glass and mirrors. Elevated pools allow fish and aquatic plants to be viewed from below. There are two gardens with a Japanese theme. One is by Keith Gott for Tatton Park, the National Trust garden in Cheshire which has a very fine Japanese garden. The other is by Inner London Landscapes and features a carp pool. Look for the water garden with mature specimen plants and trees by Pantiles Nurseries which specialises in large trees in containers. Naila Green, of Green Gardens, south Devon, is making a garden entitled 'Paradise Lost, Paradise Regained' based on two circles, one planted with twisted, thorny, poisonous plants and the other an oasis of green and white around a bronze sculpture and a water basin. BR is again making a garden based on a railway theme but it will be completely different from those of the previous two years. Midland Group and Courtyard Design have combined to make a romantic garden called 'Then and Now' which includes a flamboyant example of the 1930s style of garden contrasted with a modern garden. Floral and other exhibits in the eight big marquees are bewildering in their variety. Two new varieties of Ballerina apple trees are to be shown. These are the varieties bred at East Mallon which restrict themselves to a single main stem with short flower and fruit bearing side growths, without need for any pruning. The search now is for better flavour and a wider range of ripening times and these two newcomers represent steps in that direction. Kelways of Langport has two new varieties of peony, the first really new ones raised by this famous Somerset nursery for 60 years. Burncoose and Southdown are coming from Cornwall with a big exhibit of exotic plants and are expected to include some new lilies. There are two national collections of hostas, one from Diana Grenfell and the other from Mr and Mrs R Bowden, and there is to be a hosta exhibit from Park Green Nurseries, which contains some strange names, such as Bright Lights, Pizzazz, Great Expectations and Gene's Joy. Squires Garden Centre promises Top Marks, the rose of the year, and is also showing Strawberry Fayre and Julie Andrews. Rougham Gardens is bringing four new delphiniums. New to me is the variegated apple blossom Promises by Westdale Nurseries. One wonders what any apple blossom, variegated or otherwise, is doing out in July. Stephen Bailey will be showing carnations, Three Countries Nurseries will have pinks and Hollygate Nurseries will have an extensive exhibit of cacti and other succulents. The theme of the British Rose Festival will be 'Roses through the Ages' and this will be reflected throughout the 36,000 square feet of the marquee which is being arranged to an overall plan by the international designer Keis van Driel. Several new roses will be launched including the Thomas Barton Rose from French breeder Alain Meilland. There will also be a competition to decide the best scented rose and the national competitions for both amateur rose growers and floral artists. The James Mason Memorial Gold Medal, for the rose that has given most pleasure to rose growers, will be presented during the show. Information: The show will be open to the public from Thursday July 9 to Sunday July 12, from 10am to 7.30pm, except on the 12th when it will close at 6.30pm. Admission is Pounds 12 for adults, Pounds 9 for senior citizens and Pounds 6 for children, with reductions of up to Pounds 2 on tickets purchased with a rail ticket. Tickets can be obtained in advance, Tel: 071-379-4444.</p>

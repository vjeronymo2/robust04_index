			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AL DAVIS A GREEDY MEANY? SOME STADIUM PERSPECTIVE  </P> <P> So you think Al Davis is one of the meanest guys in sports? Wrong.  </P> <P> Sure, it's hard to teach the uninitiated in the dalliances and wanderings of  Davis and his Raiders. The easy part is explaining why the Raiders left Oakland  and ended up in Los Angeles with a contract that put the Coliseum in the red  following the Rams move to Anaheim.  </P> <P> It's harder fathoming why Irwindale offered the Raiders a $115-million stadium  in a gravel pit and let Davis keep $10 million when the deal fell through. And  it's ironic that after all its litigation with Davis, the Los Angeles Coliseum  Authority is contemplating giving him more than $60 million and tearing down  the Coliseum to keep the Raiders from returning to Oakland or going to  Sacramento.  </P> <P> But you can always count on someone being worse off.  </P> <P> Take St. Petersburg, home of the new $85-million Florida Suncoast Dome, notable  mainly for its lack of a baseball team. St. Pete spent a year making passes at  the Chicago White Sox, residents of Comiskey Park. Florida even promised the  Sox a $30-million bonus to show up. That's why Chicago is spending $150 million  to build the baseball team a stadium that could require a taxpayer subsidy of  $657 million over the next 20 years. Even so, the owner of the Sox later  implied that staying in Chicago was an act of civic generosity.  </P> <P> Al Davis is almost starting to look like just another reasonable  free-enterpriser trying to make a buck. He is not asking for anything that  hasn't been done since AD 97, the year the publicly financed Coliseum opened  its gates in Rome (capacity 50,000, no skyboxes). That venue did a land-office  business in gladiator fights, chariot races and match-ups between lions and  Christians.  </P> <P> Don't laugh. Maryland officials cited Roman precedent in 1987 when they tried  to prevent citizens from voting on a new publicly financed $160-million  ballpark for the Orioles. Wrote state Atty. Gen. J. Joseph Curran Jr.: "Rome in  the zenith of her power not only constructed the Coliseum at Rome, but caused  similar structures to be erected and maintained in various large cities . . .  for the entertainment and edification of the public."  </P> <P> Around the country, about 20 cities are considering, planning or building new  stadiums or domes. In addition to the Raiders, four other football teams are  angling for new stadiums or renovations. Seven major-league baseball teams want  new ballparks or will soon move into them.  </P> <P> Most stadiums operate at a public loss. Pro football stadiums host eight home  games a year, one or two exhibition games and -- for the lucky few -- a couple  of playoff games. Baseball stadiums host 81 home games a year. The rest of the  time, stadiums depend on rock concerts, monster truck matches and religious  revivals to pay the bills. Mostly they don't.  </P> <P> When New Orleans built its Superdome in 1970s, costs ballooned from an  estimated $35 million to $163 million. A hoped-for baseball team never came and  the dome has required annual public subsidies of up to $12 million. New Orleans  became a fiscal basket case, laying off cops and dropping to a four-day work  week.  </P> <P> Still, New Orleans may be lucky. The dome has attracted Super Bowls and, in  1988, the Republican National Convention. A University of New Orleans economic  study estimated that the dome has been worth $2.5 billion to the local economy  since 1975, a return of $96 for every tax dollar invested.  </P> <P> Such estimates pivot on the "economic multiplier effect," written in quicksand.  When Jacksonville was trying to land a football team (it offered the Houston  Oilers $100 million), the city produced a study showing that eight home games  would bring in $60 million a year. Denver estimated a baseball team's 81 home  games would produce $70 million annually. The White Sox say they're worth $100  million a year.  </P> <P> No way, says Robert A. Baade, a Lake Forest College economist who studies  public stadiums. He concludes that, in general, stadiums make no difference to  a local economy. Stadiums are really built to satisfy "civic ego."  </P> <P> In 1977, when the stadium-building boom was in its infancy, a congressional  committee concluded that public financing of a stadium is "a subsidy for  wealthy owners and a select group of citizens." The congressional report  suggested that "a new approach to financing" stadiums was needed.  </P> <P> Sports fans may, in fact, be losing their zeal for the old-fashioned approach.  In 1984, Cleveland voters said no to a $200-million dome financed by property  taxes. Last fall, San Francisco voters gave a second ixnay to a new ballpark  for the Giants who, arguably, can make the best climatic case in pro sports for  a new home.  </P> <P> But cities will, can and do find ways around reluctant voters. Cleveland is  back with a baseball stadium that would cost $120 million, to be financed by a  quarter-cent county sales-tax increase, the largest tax hike that doesn't need  voter approval.  </P> <P> Many recent stadium proposals, however, do contain some private financing.  Toronto's Skydome cost the public $50 million, but the private sector kicked in  $310 million. San Francisco's defeated stadium would have raised $85 million  from private sources and $30 million from the city.  </P> <P> And then there's the late Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie, perhaps the patron  saint of private financing. After losing three public votes to replace the  Orange Bowl, Robbie did it himself and financed a $100-million stadium by  selling 180 luxury skyboxes and 10,500 VIP "club seats" in advance. The stadium  opened without a penny of direct subsidy.  </P> <P> Maybe someone will take Davis to Miami on a fact-finding mission. Should Davis  call movers, however, there's no need to worry. Odds are, Davis will come  knocking again or another team will auction itself off. They might even want to  play in a Roman Coliseum.  </P></p>

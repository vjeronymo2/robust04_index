			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 3 (KCNA) -- The national conference  of party cell secretaries which was held in Pyongyang from March  31 to April 2 was a historical conference which marked an  occasion of a new turn in further strengthening and developing  the Workers' Party of Korea and successfully accomplishing the  socialist cause of chuche by enhancing the function and role of  the party cells in compliance with the developing reality,  declares NODONG SINMUN today in an editorial.    The editorial says:    It was a proud conference which fully demonstrated the  wisdom  of the guidance of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the  dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who have strengthened the  cells and other basic organizations of the party and built up  the party to be an impregnable one by founding the  chuche-oriented idea of party building and energetically guiding  the struggle for its materialization. It also demonstrated the  revolutionary faith and unshakable will of all the party cell  secretaries and party members to complete the building of  Korean-style socialism with the might of singlehearted unity.    Today the party cell secretaries remain faithful to the  leadership to the party and the leader and are successfully  discharging their noble mission and duty in increasing the  party's might and carrying forward the revolutionary cause of  chuche.    The conference powerfully demonstrated that the WPK with  hundreds of thousands of militant cells unfailingly loyal to the  party and the leader is an ever-victorious, veteran and  experienced party, a great party that leads the cause of  independence in our age to victory, smashing any anti-socialist  moves.    The editorial calls on the whole party, the entire people  and  all the Army to turn out as one in the struggle for frustrating  all the provocative moves of the imperialists and defending and  developing Korean socialism like an impregnable fortress, united  in one mind around the great General Kim Chong-il.</p>

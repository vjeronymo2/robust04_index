			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FRESNO;  </P> <P> TANK LEAKS STUDIED TO DETERMINE THREAT  </P> <P> As many as 600 underground tanks in the Fresno area are leaking and city  workers are identifying the contents of 100 of those to determine if they pose  any threat to ground water, officials said. "Some of them could contain  chemicals that contaminate the ground water, and some could contaminate the  soil," said Martin McIntyre, the city's water quality supervisor. About 3,000  underground tanks are buried in the Fresno area, most of which are storage for  gas stations or processing tanks for dry-cleaners, McIntyre said. The area  around the tanks is monitored for any of 90 chemicals, including the pesticide  DBCP and a dry-cleaning solution. Chemicals believed to have leaked from the  tanks have been found in 108 of the city's 235 water wells in the last year,  McIntyre said.  </P></p>

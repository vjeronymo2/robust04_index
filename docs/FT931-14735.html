			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Borrie to join MGN board FURTHER evidence that Mirror Group Newspapers plans to stick to its traditional political stance came yesterday with the appointment of Sir Gordon Borrie as a non-executive director. Sir Gordon, until last year director general of fair trading, said that he was interested in the political aspect of the newspaper group. 'I would like to see the Mirror keep left of centre in the range of its political views,' said Sir Gordon, who was approached by Lord Hollick, the Labour peer, about the directorship. Sir Gordon Borrie, a former Labour Party parliamentary candidate, gave up membership of the party when he became director general at the Office of Fair Trading in 1976. He rejoined the Labour Party last June, soon after retiring from his OFT job and before Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, asked him to chair the Commission on Social Justice. The Commission is meant to update the work of the Beveridge report, which provided the blueprint for the welfare state. Sir Gordon said he looked forward to working with the MGN directors 'to ensure that the company's undoubted strengths and talents are fully utilised in meeting its obligations to its employees, readers and shareholders.' Sir Gordon is going to read the Daily Mirror regularly again after a lapse of some years.</p>

			<p>920825 FT  25 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Futures collapse PRICES IN the sterling cash and futures markets virtually discounted a 1 percentage-point rise in UK base rates yesterday, but the Bank of England did not sway under calls for a tightening of monetary policy. Pressure on both the US dollar and the pound triggered intense activity in both the futures and cash markets. The September contract lost 35 basis points from its previous close, finishing at 89.20. The December contract fell 26 basis points to close at 89.26. Theoretically, the September price suggests that three-month money will be at 10.8 per cent in one month's time. Total volume for the contracts was high, at nearly 73,000 lots combined. The rise in sterling cash rates was slowed in the morning by concerted central bank intervention on the foreign exchanges. However, the new expense of money was clear by the day's end. Everything from three-month money out to one-year was offered at 10 13/16 per cent, up from 10 1/2 per cent on Friday night. According to one clearing bank dealer, the rise in one-month money to 10 7/16 per cent on the offered side may prove to be the most imporant rate change of the day. He argued that if this stays at the same level, clearing banks will put the Bank of England under pressure to signal a base rate change. The Bank of England left its shorter dated dealing rates unchanged at 9 7/8 per cent, and took out most of the Pounds 2.1bn shortage using a repurchase agreement (repo) at the established rate of 9 15/16 per cent. However, there was a slight tightening of rates in Bands 3 and 4. These were moved up to spreads of 9 3/4 per cent to 9 7/8 per cent in Band 3, and 9 per cent to 9 7/8 per cent in Band 4. Dealers interpreted the change as a purely technical move. They believe that the Bank routinely matches changes in period rates. One dealer said it would be perfectly possible for a discount house to make a turn by borrowing money at the newly raised rates in Bands 3 and 4, and lending it out at the new costs for 3-month money. In the morning, the Bank purchased Pounds 2m in Band 1 Bank bills, Pounds 257m in Band 2, Pounds 3m in Band 3, Pounds 163m in Band 4 and Pounds 1.2bn in the 'repo'. The forecast was revised to Pounds 2bn and there was late assistance of Pounds 30m.</p>

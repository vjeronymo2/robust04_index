			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / International Company News: Kavner leaves AT&amp;T for CAA Mr Robert Kavner, head of multimedia products and services at AT&amp;T, has left the US telecommunications group to join Creative Artists Agency, Hollywood's top talent agency. The hiring of Mr Kavner is a significant coup for CAA and a big loss to AT&amp;T. A former chief financial officer of the telecommunications group, Mr Kavner was a key figure in the merger of AT&amp;T's computer operations with the computer group NCR in 1991-1992, and in the recent forging of several alliances between AT&amp;T and US multimedia companies. His knowledge of the computer and telecommunications industries is such that he was on the shortlist last year to replace Mr John Akers as chairman of IBM. After being appointed head of AT&amp;T's multimedia products and services division last summer, 51-year-old Mr Kavner became one of the group's top four executives. He had responsibility for employing AT&amp;T's telecommunications and computer expertise to spearhead a push into the interactive multimedia business. CAA said that Mr Kavner would 'lead in the identification and development of opportunities for the agency's clients in the merging digital, interactive and networked media'. Mr Kavner's move to CAA is the latest sign of how the efforts of US companies to exploit the development of the so-called 'information super-highway' is blurring the lines between the entertainment, communications and computer technology industries. It is also evidence of the growing power of CAA, which, under the leadership of chairman Mr Michael Ovitz, has been building a presence in other fields related to the entertainment business.</p>

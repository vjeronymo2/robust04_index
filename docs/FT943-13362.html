			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Rules on betting shops to be eased Customers will be able to see into betting shops following moves by Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, yesterday to loosen restrictions covering their front windows. Bookmakers, which now have to operate behind obscured frontages, will be able to have clear windows and display information on facilities in the shops and bets available. They will also be able to sell a wider range of pre-packaged snacks and sandwiches and to use larger television screens.</p>

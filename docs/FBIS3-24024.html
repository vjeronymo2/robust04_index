Commerce Is an Art, or How  Can Anyone at the External Economic Department Be Optimistic in  1994?"]    [Text] A package of documents that will regulate our  country's foreign economic activity in 1994 has been submitted  to Ukraine's Supreme Council for consideration. It will be a  continuation of work started at the end of last year, when the  Ministry of External Economic Ties asked Ukraine's Supreme  Council to introduce certain changes into those governmental  edicts that regulate export-import relations. We turned to  minister O. Slyepichev with a request to comment on the changes  that will take place in 1994 in this branch, which is important  for independent Ukraine.    [Slyepichev] Just two years have passed since Ukraine  achieved its independence, and it is perfectly understandable  that now, during the period of development of our young state,  we must create our own system of external economic relations  with the world community. This is a quite complex process --  the system will improve in the course of years, but one thing  may be said with certainty: Ukraine's external economic policy  must be nationwide, clear and legally balanced, and not narrow  and departmental.    [Kraslyanskyy] What proposals did the External Economic  Department submit to the Supreme Council and what does it  primarily want to achieve this year?    [Slyepichev] First is the encouragement of exports through  extensively liberalizing export policy. For this, it is  envisaged to abolish the double use of the nontariff (quota or  nonquota) and tariff (extra-quota or taxed) regulation of  exports of the same types of goods, to introduce preferred  issuing of quotas to producers of corresponding products, and to  improve the sale of quotas at auctions.    However, it is also necessary to know how to use quotas. On  last year's example, we know that our country produced more than  25 million tonnes of metal, but only about 8 million tonnes were  in fact sold. In my opinion, it is necessary to establish a  procedure to have quotas passed on to other exporters if they  are not used within three months.    Second, the provision of an effective structure of exports  and the formation of imports taking into account the interests  of national producers. It is extremely important to separate  exports from imports, to revise the rates of customs duty on  imports during barter operations, proceeding from the required  supply of critical imports, especially raw materials. The  purchase of those products, which are manufactured or may be  manufactured in Ukraine, must be limited.    I believe that it is necessary in 1994 to introduce import  quotas to use our currency resources rationally.    Third, it is necessary to intensify state control over  external trade operations and to ensure the timely and full  transfer of hard-currency earnings to the State Currency Fund.  In my opinion, to this end, we must adopt a system of  guaranteed settlements for highly-liquid types of products. I  do not only mean preliminary payments, but also, for example,  methods of closed accrediting in Ukrainian banks. When goods  cross the border, such a letter of credits is opened, and the  hard currency remains in our state. Besides, it is necessary  substantially to reduce hard-currency accounts opened by  national exporters abroad with the permission of Ukraine's  National Bank and radically to revise the procedure for granting  such rights.    Finally, to ensure that, during our integration into the  system of world trade, the state will not be answerable for the  carelessness and incompetence of its exporters, it is necessary  to set, on a monthly basis, indicative prices of main types of  export products on traditional international markets and their  minimal levels below which exports are forbidden.    It is only with the help of such a complex of measures that  we will be able to ensure the reduction of the trade deficit,  improve external solvency, and earn hard currency in amounts  sufficient for our important internal needs.    [Kraslyanskyy] There has recently been much talk on  establishing special conditions for exports. What is behind  this talk and will there be certain restrictions to the state's  advantage?    [Slyepichev] I think that, in our conditions, this is a  perfectly normal phenomenon. There are things that are  strategically important for us: Nonferrous metals, petroleum  products, precious metals, and so on, whose sale must only be in  the hands of special authorized exporters. However, they must  be appointed on the basis of competition.    Besides, the state must also control some types of export  products (weapons, metal products, or agricultural raw  materials) that may earn us particularly large amounts of hard  currency. In accordance with state contracts, manufacturing  enterprises or individual external trade organizations will sell  these goods on a tender basis with state guarantees for the  deliveries from storage of enterprises to ports. All money  obtained from such sales must be transferred to the state  budget. This approach will only do us good.    [Kraslyanskyy] Your strategy is clear, and it seems to be  instrumental at this stage of economic management. However, to  implement it, it may be necessary radically to change the  legislative basis. Will you be proposing a new bill on external  economic activity?    [Slyepichev] We have a rather good law on external economic  activity, and the Supreme Council did the right thing in  canceling additional decrees in this sphere. Ministry  specialists and scientists did their best just to introduce  certain amendments, reflecting today's realities, and the law  will work fine. Businessmen and business circles need, first and  foremost, stability in the economic policy, and this stability  may only be ensured by legislation.    [Kraslyanskyy] To conclude our conversation, are you in  favor of restoring the management of internal trade at a state  level? How, do you think, this problem may be resolved?    [Slyepichev] It is true that, today, we are criticized for  creating administrations for questions of trade, but there can  be no talk of returning to the old times. We are doing  everything to establish order in the provision of people with  basic commodities and are trying to renew everything good that  we had, for example, the holding of wholesale industrial fairs,  with the participation of several oblasts, where consumer goods  may be purchased. However, the main thing is that there must be  single norms and rules for accounting and controlling commodity  circulation for all those who are engaged in trade, irrespective  of the form of ownership.    Trade must be carried on properly, proceeding from the  knowledge of the conditions prevailing in the world, market  laws, and exchange rates.</p>

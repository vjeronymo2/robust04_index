			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS OFFER FREE AGENT GAETTI 4 YEARS AT ESTIMATED $10 MILLION  </P> <P> The Angels, who said last week that they were interested in new-look free agent  Gary Gaetti, took the next step Wednesday, making an initial contract proposal  of four years at an estimated $10 million.  </P> <P> Jim Bronner, Gaetti's Chicago-based agent, said the offer showed serious intent  and would lead to further conversation.  </P> <P> The Minnesota Twins' third baseman is one of 15 players who received free  agency in the collusion settlement and has until Jan. 29 to sign with another  team or return to the Twins with a new contract.  </P> <P> Bronner said several clubs, including the Twins, are pursuing Gaetti but  refused to speculate as to when he would make a decision. Angel General Manager  Mike Port leaves today for a vacation in Hawaii. Senior assistant Dan O'Brien  is also scheduled for time off over the holidays.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, free-agent infielder Donnie Hill, who had been offered arbitration  by the Angels, reached agreement with the club on a 1991 contract calling for  $500,000, plus incentives. The versatile Hill made $225,000 in salary and  incentives last season while batting .264. ROSS NEWHAN  </P></p>

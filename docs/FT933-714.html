			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Yard heads back to black: The Govan shipyard in Glasgow as it looks forward to its first profit for 30 years KVAERNER Govan, the Norwegian-owned shipyard in Glasgow, believes its five-year struggle to become profitable is nearing success. It expects to make a small profit this year, and believes this will be the yard's first operating profit for 30 years. 'It's been five years of doubts and disappointments, but finally, finally we have black figures,' says Mr Diderik Schnitler, head of shipbuilding at Kvaerner, the quoted Oslo-based engineering, shipbuilding and shipping group which owns Govan. The yard has lost about Pounds 30m since Kvaerner acquired it in 1988 from British Shipbuilders. In the preceding four years it lost Pounds 140m. Kvaerner Govan now has a strong though not completely full order book. It will deliver four chemical tankers worth about Pounds 200m between now and 1995. The first, a 35,000dwt vessel for J. O. Odfjell of Bergen, is to be named by the Queen at Govan next week. Govan broke new ground in May when it won a subcontract from VSEL to build the hull, engines and platform of a new helicopter carrier for the Royal Navy. Swan Hunter on Tyneside failed to win the helicopter carrier contract  -worth Pounds 170m to VSEL - and called in the receiver. Last week Kvaerner Govan won clearance from the Ministry of Defence to tender to build replacements for the Royal Navy's two assault ships. Kvaerner sees crossing the break-even mark as the fruit of its long struggle to reduce operating costs and raise productivity at Govan. It wanted Govan, which it bought for Pounds 6m, because the yard is entitled to EC shipbuilding subsidies not available in Norway. At the time they were 28 per cent but have since been reduced to 9 per cent. The first ship that Govan built under its new owners, a liquefied petroleum gas tanker, required twice as many man hours to complete as would have been necessary at Kvaerner's yards in Norway. Since then the number of man hours needed to build a ship has improved to 1.4 times Norwegian levels. The Kvaerner management has whittled away at restrictive practices and improved labour productivity by 30 per cent. The number of office staff has been cut by a third to under 300, while the overall number of permanent employees is 1,500. Kvaerner has invested Pounds 31m at Govan. The figure includes an Pounds 11m tank assembly shed which makes it possible for units weighing up to 1,500 tonnes to be built under cover. The cost of materials, which represents 60 per cent of a ship's cost, has been cut by 15 per cent by using the purchasing muscle of the group. 'We have combined two shipbuilding cultures, the Norwegian and the Scottish,' says Mr Kjell Mikalsen, who became managing director last year. 'But we still need to achieve a further 40 per cent reduction in man hours.' Plans for further cost-cutting are not likely to involve reducing the workforce - on the contrary, employment levels could rise if more orders are won and can be met economically. The yard has the capacity to build three ships a year; at present it builds two. A three-year productivity programme is seeking to make improvements by designing ships which are simpler to build and by giving more responsibility to teams of workers. 'We now want them to work smarter, not harder,' says Mr Tom Bateman, finance director. Last year the yard made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.5m on turnover of Pounds 74m. The small profit expected this year will still be a poor return on Kvaerner's investment at Govan. The Treasury takes about 50 per cent of profit on ships built with subsidy. Earlier this year the clawback on new contracts was reduced to 9 per cent and Kvaerner is pressing to have that rate applied to existing contracts. 'No other EC shipbuilding country operates a clawback,' Mr Shnitler says. So why is Kvaerner continuing to build ships at Govan? The move into naval work is a breakthrough because warships are not subject to subsidy or clawback. Govan has succeeded in convincing the MoD that its standards on gas and chemical carriers are as rigorous as those on war-ships. Govan should now make bigger profits, especially if productivity improves further. The group is expecting a worldwide upturn in orders for new ships - it believes that the rate of renewal in the world fleet, currently running at 4 per cent a year, is set to rise to 6 per cent. Few shipbuilders have the capacity to meet these orders profitably but the Kvaerner group, whose shipyards have an order book second only to that of Hyundai of South Korea, is one of them.</p>

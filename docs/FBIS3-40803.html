			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Abou Mehdi: "Unfair Competition in Computer </F> Industry"; first paragraph is REALITES introduction]    [Text] The National Commission on Competition and  Prices, which was established by Law No. 91/64 dated 29 July  1991 on that subject, has just been handed a complaint by a big  international computer manufacturer against five Tunisian  distributors. The charge: unfair competition.    This is a first, and the subject is important because it has  legal, economic, social, and cultural implications. Does a  commercial company have the right to market hardware and  software bearing the name of a big manufacturer if the latter  has not expressly agreed and authorized it to do so? What are  the duties of a computer service company? Is the approval  granted by the Ministry of National Economy not sufficient?    The debate is of special interest domestically at the  moment,  considering that the economy is being privatized, laws  regulating the distribution trade are being enacted, and  consumer protection is becoming an increasing reality. But also  internationally, considering that the GATT agreement has been  signed and that it guarantees the protection of industrial,  commercial, and cultural property. And using a manufacturer's  brand image constitutes encroachment if an agreement has not  been reached.    It is being noted more and more that the days of the  exclusive privileges provided by "protected markets" are past  and that there are coming to be fewer and fewer exclusive  dealers. IBM has about five authorized dealers, Apple has three,  and so on. But the multinationals impose their own distribution  policies, "suggested" prices, and marketing methods. How can  that be reconciled with the requirements of the Tunisian economy  and the interests of the Tunisian end user?    The Tunisian market is a small one, but since it is growing  rapidly and steadily and because it is liberal and open, it is  experiencing sharp competition. That competition is reflected in  a proliferation of computer companies, some of which stress the  reputation for seriousness and innovation of the big brands that  have built their enviable reputations by good performance, to be  sure, but also by expensive advertising. Other companies, on the  other hand, stress the quality of service and of their customer  relations. And last, there are those whose prices are  unbeatable--for example, five companies have distinguished  themselves in recent months by their "low, low prices" while  selling a major brand without authorization from the parent  company.    The investigation launched by the parent company and the  three authorized dealers has revealed the "how" of the  operation: the five "pirate" companies were paying low prices  for obsolete hardware with outdated technology from regional  distributors in Belgium and elsewhere and then selling it in  Tunisia at a low price and, especially, with no follow-up: no  after-sales service. Their unfair competition has several  aspects: use of the Apple-Macintosh logo, in some cases in  conjunction with the famous apple design, failure to obtain  proper authorization, failure to comply with the prices approved  by the manufacturer, and failure to conform to the standard  profile established by the manufacturer--that is, failure to  guarantee maintenance and to meet installation standards. Since  the complaint was filed, the companies in question have  disappeared only to reappear under new names.    With those findings to back it up, Apple MCI, which is based  in Paris and has the exclusive right to distribute hardware and  software, decided, in agreement with the three authorized  dealers and for the purpose of protecting the brand name and  their interests, to file a complaint charging unfair  competition. Major manufacturers select their dealers around the  world very carefully on the basis of objective criteria arising  from the nature of the sector of activity in question and  ranging from product design, manufacturing standards, and  marketing terms to the constraints inherent in the product's  maintenance. In the case of computers, for example, each  manufacturer--at least if it is one of the most reputable and  popular ones--requires that its local dealer provide a site for  displaying the hardware and a certain number of technicians and  engineers for handling sales and after-sales service, including  a repair facility with a minimum inventory of hardware,  software, and spare parts enabling it to honor the guarantee and  provide maintenance. To preserve its brand image among its  customers, the manufacturer is concerned to provide follow-up  service that will not harm its reputation.    "Help: prices are dropping" is a slogan that could very well  be adopted by computer dealers. The computer industry  experienced rapid growth in Tunisia and around the world in the  1980's, but it has spent the past four or five years in a deep  crisis that has affected not only the manufacturers (IBM has  laid off 50,000 employees) but also the service firms in Europe.  The industry is characterized by rapid technological  progress--and therefore by the rapid obsolescence of computers  already manufactured and poor sales--and by rapidly falling  prices, a situation that makes a quick inventory turnover  necessary precisely because of the progress being made, with the  result that computer dealers find their profit margins being  eroded.    The consumer's interests are twofold when it comes to  computers: he wants moderate prices with easy payment terms on  the one hand and, on the other, good-quality service, meaning  availability, training for the operating personnel,  installation, guarantee, maintenance, advice, and so on. For the  computer industry, lower prices are an advantage for the  consumer provided that there is no dumping or illicit increase.  The lack of service to the consumer remains to be proven. The  offense, on the other hand, resides in the absence of  after-sales service, which harms the interests of the users. At  a time when laws exist to protect the consumer and the ODC  [Consumer Protection Office] is preparing to launch a vast  awareness campaign in defense of consumer interests and rights,  a complaint of this kind is extremely important. It is likely to  set a legal precedent for other industries, for which reason the  verdict expected on 6 January will attract the attention of all  businessmen.</p>

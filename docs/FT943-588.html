			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Trans-World leads Russian aluminium rush A battle for ownership of Russia's biggest aluminium smelters is being waged now that they have been privatised, according to western traders. Trans-World Metals, a London-based company, is reputed to be leading the attack in order to protect its commercial position. Trans-World is now probably the biggest trader of Russian aluminium and also a substantial exporter of alumina, an intermediate material, to Russia, Mr David Reuben, chairman of the Trans-World group, said yesterday suggestions that his organisation had taken a controlling interest in two Russian smelters were wide of the mark. However, consortia organised and prompted by Trans-World had accrued substantial shareholdings, in the order of one third, in the four biggest Russian aluminium smelters. Between them these smelters account for about two-thirds of Russia's aluminium production capacity. They are Bratsk, the world's biggest aluminium smelter with an annual capacity of 850,000 tonnes; Krasnoyarsk (760,000 tonnes); Novokuznetsk (280,000 tonnes) and Sayansk (270,000 tonnes). Mr Reuben said: 'We are working with many companies and funds in Russia to assist our situation there. We have put a huge investment into Russia in the past three years'. He said shareholders' meetings might be called in order to promote changes at some smelters. He also stressed, however, that Trans-World's direct shareholdings in the smelters were small. 'We see this as a long-term investment,' he said. 'I believe in the future of Russia and would have no hesitation in investing more there.' Mr Reuben said Trans-World had been interested in acquiring shares in the Russian smelters since the privatisation process started two years ago. (All the smelters are now joint stock companies but the central government retains a 20 per cent interest). A consortium lead by Trans-World had built a 20 per cent shareholding in the Bogoslovsk smelter (160,000 tonnes a year) but sold this a few months ago. Another consortium, in which Trans-World was not involved, had built up a controlling interest in the Volvograd smelter (170,000 tonnes). Trans-World has been very active in the past few years establishing joint ventures, trading partnerships and co-operation with metal suppliers, refiners and smelters across what was once the Soviet Union. Its most important relationship is with Transis, in which it has no shareholding but has contractual arrangements for Transis to operate on Trans-World's behalf in Russia and for Trans-World to work for Transis outside the country. Trans-World takes credit for coming to the rescue of both Bratsk and Krasnoyarsk three years ago when they were in danger of running out of vital raw materials because of shortages of foreign currency. Trans-World put up cash to 'kick-start' production again. Consequently, Trans-World became the biggest supplier of raw materials to these smelters, which they mainly paid for with aluminium for export. Trans-World also helped Bratsk set up a joint venture company, Rosal, in London to raise capital and possibly get better terms for its aluminium. In May bulk alumina handling facilities costing 'several million dollars' were opened at the east coast port of Vanino by a company jointly owned by Trans-World and the port authority. This has opened up one of the bottlenecks that restricted alumina imports to Russia and has provided a logical link between Australia, the world's biggest alumina supplier, and Siberia's big aluminium smelters. Analysts point out that the position of trading houses like Trans-World is less secure following the recent international trade agreement between some of the big aluminium producing nations that promised funds to the Russian industry if it joined in a worldwide cut in production. For example, both Aluminium Company of America (Alcoa), the world's biggest aluminium group, and Pechiney, Europe's biggest, have recently confirmed that they are talking to Krasnoyarsk about upgrading the smelter, particularly with a view to reducing pollution. 'Having a big shareholding in the smelter would help protect Trans-World's toll smelting operations there if one of the big western producers moved in,' said one trader.</p>

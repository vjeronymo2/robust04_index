			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wu Yadong (0702 0068 2639): "Border </F> Representatives Speak on How To Promote Border Stability and  Prosperity"]    [Text] Since the opening of the second plenary session of  the eighth Xinjiang autonomous region people's congress, troop  border representatives spoke glowingly about the overall good  situation of social stability and quick economic development in  Xinjiang. Pooling the wisdom of the masses, everyone suggested  ways and means to defend and construct the border and promote  border stability and prosperity.    Representative Rosi Usul said border-stationed troops are  the  main strength protecting border stability. They undertake the  glorious mission of providing a guarantee of safety for economic  construction of the autonomous region. We must strive to  enhance troop independence, inceasingly improve fighting  strength, consolidate national defense, have a clear-cut stand  opposing separatism and disorder, and firmly uphold the unity of  the motherland and social stability. We must continue to do a  good job of supporting the government and cherishing the people,  and sustain and develop the overall good situation of Xinjiang's  unified army and government, soldiers and civilians, and  national minorities, "breathing together, having the same fate,  heart to heart."    Yibulayin Sulaiman [0122 0008 2139 7299 5685 0171 3341], Hu  Zongyao [5170 1350 1031] and other representatives who came from  stations in the poor southern border areas believe that  stationed troops have an unshirkable responsibility to promote  the economic and cultural development of poor areas. In recent  years, the southern border troops wholeheartedly worked for the  masses. They help villages strengthen grass-roots party and  government work, actively participate in public affairs, rush  to emergencies, provide disaster relief, prevent and cure  illnesses, plant trees and reforest, and contribute funds to  help studies. They have input a great amount of human and  material resources to train various technical personnel in  stationed areas.    Represenative Li Laitong [2621 0171 7906] introduced various  armed forces' successful methods of helping the poor in science  and technology support. He suggested that in military areas  troop support for the poor should be suited to the new  conditions of market economics. In opening up and widening  avenues to help the poor, we should gradually move towards a  large scale of one village or town from one family or household  and from purely supporting the poor with personnel or material  aid to doing so with integrated personnel, finances, material,  and science and technology. Improve the capacity of rural areas  to move away from poverty to wealth on their own.    Representative Li Peidong [2621 1014 2767] from the border  defense troops indicated that border defense troop PLA officers  and men, garrisoned in lofty and snowy mountain ranges,  struggling arduously and sacrificing unselfishly, resolutely  create a good and safe social environment for the stable  development of the autonomous region.</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Survey of Monaco (6): Mediterranean rendezvous - Driving in and around Monaco is a treat in itself One of the nicest things about Monaco is its location: clinging to a cliff on the picturesque Mediterranean with the Italian coast to the east and the French riviera to the west. The idea of being able to drive over the border for dinner in a foreign country is always appealing. Nice, Cannes and Genoa are all within easy reach. But if you tire of the glitz and gloss of Monte Carlo, there is also the option of visiting some of the smaller towns and villages along the Cote d'Azur and inland in rural Provence. Driving in and around Monaco is a treat in itself thanks to the spectacular views offered from the the corniches, or coastal roads, which run through the principality from Nice to Menton. There are three corniches - high, medium and low depending on the height at which they perch on the cliffsides. All three are familiar settings from car commercials and Cote d'Azur movie car chases. Roquebrune is the first place you come to when leaving Monaco on the western corniche. It is a 15th century village built around an 11th century castle complete with a mock medieval tower added by an eccentric English owner in the 1920s. The village has been colonised by souvenir shops and is now something of a tourist trap, although the charm of its narrow alleys and stairways is still apparent when the shops close down at night. The coastline to the west of Roquebrune is accessible only by foot and offers a stunning shoreline walk past the white rocks and pine trees of Cap Martin. The path is called Le Corbusier after the famous modernist architect who drowned there in the mid-1960s while staying at a house owned by the Anglo-Irish designer, Eileen Gray. The next stop after Cap Martin is Menton, the sunny seaside town nestling in mountains and lemon groves which is, in many ways, a more subdued version of Monaco. Menton and Roquebrune both belonged to Monaco until the mid-19th century when they declared their independence. The then Prince of Monaco was stoned on the streets when he came to reclaim them and later sold them off to France for FFr4m. Menton, like Monaco, has an Italianate vieille ville, or old town, with candy-coloured houses and pretty little chapels. It also sports one of the most sought-after Salle des Mariages, or register offices, in France (tel:9357 8787) decorated by Jean Cocteau, the surrealist artist. Cocteau not only filled the walls with friezes of love stories - from a Saracen wedding party, to Orpheus and Eurydice - but even carpeted the floor with a mock-panther skin. Cocteau also created his own museum for Menton, the Musee Jean Cocteau (tel:9357 7230), which lies between the vieille ville and the old port. It houses a fine collection of his drawings, paintings, writing, stage and film sets. The corniches to the east of Monaco are also well worth exploring. The hilltop village of Eze looks wonderful from a distance, with its medieval houses and churches winding around the natural fortress of its hill. But on closer inspection it is even kitscher than Roquebrune with a clutter of souvenir shops and overpriced antique dealers. Beaulieu, the next town along the coast, has the same sleepy air as Menton. Its main attractions are the recently renovated Art Deco casino and the idiosyncratic Villa Kerylos, a replica of a classical Greek villa built in the early years of this century for Theodore Reinach, an archaeologist who lived there for 20 years in the same style and dress as an ancient Athenian. The other coastline folly is Fondation Ephrussi de Rothschild (tel:9301 3399) which perches high above the nouveau riche holiday homes of Cap Ferrat to house the collections of art and furniture hoarded by the eponymous Baroness de Rothschild. The baroness, like Theodore Reinach, had a penchant for ancient Greece. Her pastel pink villa is cluttered with classical columns, as well as vestiges of almost every period from Tiepolo frescoes, to Louis XIV furniture and a tiny lover's room tucked away on the ground floor. Jean Cocteau crops up again in Villefranche-sur-Mer, yet another picturesque fishing village to have fallen victim to souvenir shops and tourist traps. But Villefranche does boast the Chapelle Saint-Pierre, a tiny 14th century seafront chapel where Cocteau covered the interior walls with abstract fantasies of Saint Peter frolicking with the Camargue gypsies. Nice itself is filled with museums and restaurants. The nearby town of Cagnes is now a jumble of modern villas but was once the home of the painter, Pierre-Auguste Renoir. His house has been turned into a museum, the Musee Renoir (tel:9320 6107), which contains his old studio as well as some of the paintings he did there and pieces by friends, such as Bonnard and Dufy. Then there is Saint-Paul-de-Vence, another pretty Provencal hill village transmogrified into a tourist trap, where the Fondation Maeght (tel:9332 8163) offers one of the best collections of modern art in southern France with works by Giacometti, Arp and Miro. The foundation, which was created by a family of Paris art dealers, also stages temporary shows the latest of which is a Georges Braque exhibition that runs until the autumn. The last port of call before a longish drive back to Monaco could be La Colombe d'Or (tel:9332 8002), the Saint-Paul restaurant run by the Roux family since the 1920s where local artists paid for their meals with their work. Luckily for the Roux the 'locals' included Picasso, Braque, Chagall and Miro not to mention Fernand Leger, whose frieze decks the restaurant terrace, and Alexander Calder, who made a mobile to bob above the swimming pool.</p>

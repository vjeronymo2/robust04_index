			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tougher charters pledged STRENGTHENING existing charters for public services rather than publishing a stream of new ones will soon become the theme of the Citizen's Charter programme, Mr William Waldegrave, minister for public service, said last night. Mr Waldegrave emphasised in a speech in London that the tight public spending settlement in the Autumn Statement made it even more important to improve efficiency through initiatives such as the planned increase in market-testing in central government services. The speech was the first in a series in which over the next few weeks Mr Waldegrave will seek to highlight the possibility of improvements in the delivery of public services in spite of the tough controls on spending in last week's Autumn Statement. His speeches will be focussed around publication next week of a white paper which will include a report on the first year of operation of the Citizen's Charter. Signalling a move to the second stage of the charter programme, Mr Waldegrave said that the emphasis would shift to reviewing the 26 charters already prepared, especially once charters had been published for the courts and for further and higher education. 'Setting, reviewing and strengthening charters would be of little use if we did not have the means to ensure that those standards were met,' he said.</p>

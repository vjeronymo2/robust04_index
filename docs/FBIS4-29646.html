			<p>BFN     [Text] Eight members of the underground National League for  Democracy [NLD] known as NLD-North group, comprising five  representatives-elect of Kachin State and three NLD organizers  who absconded to Pajao region in Kachin State returned to the  legal fold through the KIO [Kachin Independence Organization] of  Kachin Special Region 2 in Myitkyina on 5 June.    The eight of them, all representatives-elect are -- U N.  Nang  Gam of Machambaw Township, U Yau Si of Putao Township, U Marpan  Sin of Khawbude Township, U Kya Mya of Mohnyin Township  Constituency-2, U Kyaw Maung of Mohnyin Township Constituency-1,  and U Min Swe and U Ba Win, organizers of the NLD of Kyunhla  Township, Sagaing Division, and U Thein Aung, NLD organizer of  Pinbaw Village-Tract, Mogaung Township. Of them, U N. Nang Gam,  U Yau Si, U Marpan Sin, and U Kya Mya are said to have been  organized by NLD organizers in charge of Kachin State U Tin Aung  and U Yan Naung Myint, who are presently in Manerplaw, and went  underground from Myitkyina on 22 December 1991. They arrived in  Pajao region. U Kyaw Maung went underground on 6 January 1992  and followed them. U Min Swe, while serving as the township  organizer of the Kyunhla Township NLD, came into contact with  former teacher of Nyaungkaing Village, U Myint, and together  with U Ba Win went underground on 9 January 1993. U Thein Aung,  while serving as the organizer of the NLD at Bamagon Village,  Pinbaw Village-Tract in Mogaung Township, took along with him  Tha Din and Thaung Htwe who wanted to go underground and he also  went underground.    After arriving in the jungle, they formed the Northern NLD  group also known as Underground NLD-North group at Pajao Camp  during the last week of January 1992. The group was formed with  U Tin Aung as chairman, U Kya Mya as secretary, and the  remaining seven persons as organizing committee members. On  receipt of letter of intimation sent by Dr. Sein Win from  Manerplaw Camp of the expatriate group NCGUB [National Coalition  Government of the Union of Burma] about the second week of April  1992, NLD-North Chairman U Tin Aung and member U N. Nang Gam  left the Pajao Camp for the KNU [Karen National Union] Central  Manerplaw Camp. On arrival at the Manerplaw Camp the National  Council of the Union of Burma, NCUB, was formed and U Tin Aung  was assigned the duties as secretary. U N. Nang Gam was  attached to the NCGUB office for about one year and he became a  member of the education committee which was formed in July 1993.    In September 1993, Dr. Sein Win sent for the representatives  at Pajao Camp to come to the Manerplaw Camp in order to expand  the NCGUB group and U Kya Mya, U Kyaw Maung, U Marpan Sin, U Yau  Si, and organizers U Yan Naung Myint and U Thaung Htwe arrived  at Manerplaw Camp. As expatriate Sein Win and group had left  for the United States, they had to wait there for nothing.  Hearing that the KIO and the Government had made peace, their  group left Manerplaw Camp and arrived at Pajao Camp on 13 March  1994. After holding consultations and discussions among  themselves they completely dissolved the NLD-North group on 2  April and after submitting the matter to the KIO leaders they  returned to the legal fold.    When they arrived at the Manerplaw Camp, they learnt that  one  of the organizations of a foreign country provided assistance to  Sein Win's NCGUB group. For the 1993 budget, a monetary  assistance of 4.8 million Norwegian kroners [over US$ 600,000]  was provided for education sector alone. It was said that they  went to the jungles at the instigation of Kachin State organizer  of the NLD U Tin Aung. However, only when they arrived there did  they come to know that U Tin Aung had gone underground as he was  in debt for 500,000 kyats in Mogaung. They also learnt that an  annual fund of US$ 7,000 was provided by Sein Win's NCGUB to the  NLD-North group and the travelling allowance of 100,000 bahts  given for them to come from Pajao to Manerplaw were misused by U  Tin Aung and that he had contacts with the former BCP [Burma  Communist Party] group at the border with the other country.  Thus, they at last distrusted in their leader U Tin Aung and  they realized their mistake.    When they arrived at Manerplaw Camp they saw for themselves  that those who had absconded after the disturbances in 1988 and  went underground were disunited and were engaged in power  struggle, killed each other, misappropriated funds, were self  seekers, and earned income through illegal means and were of  loose character. Moreover, Sein Win's `parallel government' was  nothing but just a name-sake. They also learnt that soon the  NCGUB would merge with the armed groups in the jungles to form  the "Federal Government of Burma, FGB" and began to hate and  abhor them and they became frustrated.    Having learnt the present situation that there is now peace  and tranquillity in Kachin State and the KIO group is actively  engaged, hand in hand with the government, in implementing  regional development tasks, coming to have faith in the genuine  goodwill and true attitude of the State Law and Order  Restoration Council and experiencing the unscrupulous acts and  atrocities of the armed groups in the jungles, they began to  realize their mistakes and repent and returned to the legal fold.</p>

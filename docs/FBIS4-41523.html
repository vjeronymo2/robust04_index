			<p>BFN     [Text] Removal from state control and the privatization of  state farms is in full swing in the Republic. It concerns state  farms that process and service enterprises of the  agro-industrial complex. In order to channel this process, the  Cabinet of Ministers regularly listens to accounting reports  from the heads of the oblast administrations and enters the  necessary changes. On 24 June, the members of the government  met with Saparbek Kunanbayev, first deputy head of the Kokshetau  Oblast administration, and Viktor Chumakov, deputy head of the  Kostanay Oblast administration.    Summing up the results of the discussion, Prime Minister  Sergey Tereshchenko, Agriculture Minister Zhanibek Karibzhanov,  Kozy-Korpesh Yesenberlin, chairman of the State Property  Committee, and other members of the government noted the  unsatisfactory situation in the denationalization and  privatization of the agro-industrial complex in the republic and  entered a number of concrete proposals aimed at improving the  situation.    At the next meeting with a similar agenda, the heads of the  East Kazakhstan and Semey Oblast administrations will report on  the work being done to restructure the agro-industrial system.</p>

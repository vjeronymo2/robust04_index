			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / International Company News: PepsiCo to launch ready-to-drink coffee PepsiCo, the US soft drinks company, yesterday signalled its intention to launch an assault on one of the few untapped areas of potential growth in the US beverage industry: the market for ready-to-drink coffee in bottles and cans. Its Pepsi-Cola subsidiary said it had formed a partnership with Starbucks Coffee, the hottest name in the fast-growing US gourmet coffee bar sector, to develop a range of coffee-based drinks that will be sold through the same outlets as existing Pepsi-Cola drinks. Test marketing should begin next year. Pepsi-Cola said the drinks would be marketed under the Starbucks name because this had become the prem-ium coffee trademark in the US. Initially they will probably be sold in bottles from refrigerated units. However, the partnership is also considering selling hot coffee in cans. The formation of the partnership will be seen in the beverage industry as an attempt to emulate the striking success in the US of ready-to-drink iced tea, which in the last few years has become a Dollars 1.5bn-a-year market. PepsiCo has already entered the iced tea sector through a similar joint venture which it formed with the Thomas J. Lipton tea company in January 1992, under which it sells a number of flavoured tea drinks under the Lipton Original brand. Ready-to drink coffee is already available in the US, but it is still a small category. One company in the business is General Foods, part of the Philip Morris food and tobacco group, and Coca-Cola is believed to be poised to enter the market. The Seattle-based Starbucks has grown from 11 stores in 1987 to become the leading retailer of specialty coffees in North America, with more than 400 outlets. In the process it has helped cultivate a taste in the US for gourmet and specialty coffees.</p>

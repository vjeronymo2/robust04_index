			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Wednesday [20 April] in the  Bundestag Economic Committee in Bonn, Pakistani Prime Minister  Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto canvassed for more German economic aid.  Among other things, she asked for higher Hermes [export credit]  guarantees to secure private German investments, longer terms  for certain commodity credits, and more technical aid in  development cooperation.    Benazir Bhutto, who has been in Bonn on an official visit  since Monday [18 April], promised private investors as much  protection as possible. The World Bank and the IMF trust  Pakistan, she said. The reforms initiated by her government --  the reduction of debts, the state deficit, and the inflation  rate -- are showing first signs of success. In the  modernization of Pakistan, priority is given to agriculture, the  power supply, development of the infrastructure, and combating  poverty, she said.    According to Bhutto, because of bad harvests as a result of  disastrous storms and because of the armament efforts forced by  India, Pakistan is completely dependent on its friends in the  Western world. In the conflict with India over Kashmir, she  hopes for the "honest broker services" of friendly states like  Germany. She affirmed her intention to turn Pakistan into a  liberal, democratic state oriented to the market economy, one  that might become a model for the Islamic world -- also  regarding the situation of women.</p>

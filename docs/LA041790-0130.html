BRIEFING;  </P> <P> AVON WANTS INVESTMENT VOIDED  </P> <P> Avon Products Inc. has asked a federal court to void the purchases of Avon  shares made by Chartwell Associates, an unfriendly investor group that has  acquired a 16% stake in the door-to-door cosmetics company.  </P> <P> Chartwell, whose members include representatives of Avon rival Mary Kay  Cosmetics Inc. of Dallas, the Fisher real estate family of New York and oil  heir Gordon Getty, has purchased more than 9 million shares of Avon common  stock for about $312 million over the last six months.  </P> <P> In a suit filed with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan late Monday, Avon  alleges that Chartwell made "false, incomplete and misleading" public  disclosures in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding  the group's purchase of Avon shares.  </P> <P> The "true, undisclosed purpose for their investment in Avon is to acquire an  unfair competitive advantage for the benefit of Mary Kay . . . at the expense  of Avon, its employees and its public shareholders," the suit said.  </P></p>

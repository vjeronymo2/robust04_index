			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Survey of Technology in the Office (1): Paperless dream still tantalises - New hardware and software offer fresh opportunities Ever since the first personal computers began turning up on office desktops more than a decade ago, the prospect of a paperless, automated and super-productive office of the future has remained tantalisingly just out of reach. Despite the advent of office technology, about 95 per cent of information used in the office is still stored on paper rather than electronically. Indeed, far from dispensing with paper, office workers are handling increasingly larger volumes of it. At one organisation interviewed as part of a recent UK study* by management consultants Touche Ross, the 2,000 staff dealt with 45 tonnes of incoming mail last year, and 48 tonnes of outgoing mail - equivalent to generating 25kg of paper per person. The Touche Ross study of information management revealed that although 70 per cent of organisations believed they had too much paper (which they generated themselves), the same organisations listed their most significant problem as not having enough space to store their records. The report also showed that through poor management of records, companies are starved of information. Between 40 and 70 per cent of staff lack sufficient information to do their jobs properly. The remainder tend to have too little rather than too much. 'We conducted the survey to confirm our belief that businesses are suffering costs by not managing information successfully,' said Mr David Best, a partner at Touche Ross and a leading expert on information management. 'We know that there are significant benefits to be achieved and we wanted to see if we could identify them and any of the pitfalls encountered along the way.' 'Our findings show that a high percentage of information is paper-based and almost one quarter of organisations have no standards and procedures for dealing with it,' said Julia Parsons, co-author of the report. 'Management rarely sees paper-based information as a complementary buildingblock to information held in computer systems, and so it does not manage it in an integrated fashion.' Nevertheless, the study also revealed a dramatic growth in the use of electronic data, even though there is a long way to go before people give up the 'comfort' of paper. There is also a definite trend towards optical storage although 'there is no corresponding rapid decrease in the use of paper,' said Ms Parsons. It is perhaps the failure of organisations to view, plan and monitor the office process in its entirety which possibly explains some of the disappointment and disillusionment with office automation most often expressed by those who have funded it. In the past this has often led to the piecemeal purchase of a higher quality photocopier, faster printer or new PC, but a failure to automate the whole process. As a result, the basic flow of information through an organisation actually changes very little and predictably this unco-ordinated approach has frequently failed to deliver the hoped-for efficiency and productivity gains. But it is only relatively recently that all the building blocks for a truly integrated digital office have begun to fall into place. New hardware such as digital optical scanning, storage and retrieval devices and CD-ROM have appeared along with other new technologies such as digital cordless telephony, desktop video-conferencing and software applications such as electronic mail and voice mail systems for networked PCs. This new hardware and software is now beginning to open up new possibilities for integrating systems and streamlining procedures. In one area alone - that of wireless office telephone lines - the productivity gains and potential savings could be substantial. As a result, the Washington-based consultancy EMCI estimates that by 1996 France, Germany, Italy and the UK will have installed 6.4m wireless office telephone lines. There is also a growing awareness of the advantages of other wireless data communications systems such as wireless local area networks (Lans), and of electronic data interchange (EDI) which can remove the need to send and receive standard paper forms such as invoices, orders and bills. Similarly it is now possible to bring together previously unconnected pieces of electronic hardware. For example, multifunction digital devices which combine some or all of the features of a fax machine, scanner, photocopier and laser printer have begun to appear. High-volume electronic demand printers which link directly to computers are now available, as are digital copiers which scan a hard copy once before reproducing multiple copies. Fax and other communications functions are being built into PCs and office networks, removing the need for paper print-outs entirely. Desktop video-conferencing using a card plugged into a PC is also already possible and may in time reduce the need to travel to meetings. Meanwhile multimedia systems enable text, computer graphics, full-colour photographs, moving video and sound to be combined and have applications in sales, training and internal communications. As the digital office becomes a real technological possibility, equipment suppliers are increasingly focusing on their core expertise. But they are also forming loose partnerships and working in collaboration with each other to combine technologies and provide more effective 'solutions' for the marketplace. This trend is illustrated by Kodak's list of development partners. Kodak is applying its imaging technology expertise with Novell in networking software, IBM and Apple in computer hardware, Digital Equipment in open systems, Lotus for certain PC software and with Adobe which has incorporated Kodak's Photo YCC colour image standard in its latest Postscript Level 2 page description language. The availability of various digital technologies which need to be integrated is only one of the issues that management consultants believe needs to be addressed if office productivity is to be improved. Another is whether the management structures in organisations have developed to complement the available technology? In many companies, responsibility for different pieces of equipment will lie with separate departments. But it is generally accepted that in order to implement and operate an integrated strategy it is necessary to put someone in charge of office automation as a whole, rather than maintaining distinct roles for the data processing manager, the information technology manager and others. One reason for identifying someone as responsible for office automation is that he or she will also need to consider other factors, not least the office environment itself. The quality of the office environment is an increasingly 'hot' issue for equipment manufactures and employers. Legislative requirements are steadily being tightened, a process which is often being spearheaded by the European Commission. Over the past two years, the Commission has issued several directives aimed at providing a framework of minimum standards for ergonomics and office health and safety. These directives, which include provisions on computer hardware, software, furniture and the office environment, are due to become law in all member states this year. Manufactures such as ICL, the UK computer group which is owned by Japan's Fujitsu, have seized upon the growing awareness of ergonomics and environmental health issues as a marketing opportunity. Following its acquisition of Scandinavia's Nokia Data, ICL is now marketing a range of PCs which already meet or exceed all the EC requirements. 'Ergonomics is no longer a fad or a fashion,' said Mr Philip Vanhautte, vice-president for marketing and customer concerns at ICL Personal Systems. Instead, he says, it has moved into the mainstream. What ICL has identified is that automation of the office is about much more than just providing the equipment. Critically, it requires the co-operation of people and a structured plan for improving all aspects of the office environment, not just the volume of paper processed. Perhaps, therefore, the paperless office is a dream best forgotten, or at least put to one side for the moment. As Shirley Murray of Touche Ross conceded: 'The survey clearly shows that paper will be with us for at least the next decade. The majority of organisations do not yet appreciate the value of managing information as a resource, nor the benefits to be achieved by doing so.' There are indications, however, that the tough economic conditions of the past few years have prompted organisations to pay more attention to managing their businesses more effectively. 'The key to success,' says Ms Murray, 'is a deeper understanding of their business and the flow of information throughout the organisation, and effectively managing the information in an integrated fashion: computers, paper and people.' *Information Management Survey 1992: Touche Ross Management Consultants; Pounds 95 from Peterborough Court, 133 Fleet Street, London EC4A 2TR.</p>

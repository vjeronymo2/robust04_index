			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSM's proposed rule provides that its decision to suspend or rescind will remain in effect during the time a request for review is pending in OHA unless temporary relief is granted in accordance with 43 CFR 4.1376. 30 CFR 773.20(c)(2), 56 FR 45799 (Sept. 6, 1991). Proposed 43 CFR 4.1376 provides that with a request for review_or at any time before the administrative law judge issues the initial decision_any party may petition for temporary relief from OSM's notice of suspension or notice of proposed suspension and rescission. Under &sect;4.1376, the petition must show that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits and that the relief it seeks will not adversely affect public health or safety or cause significant, imminent environmental harm. Other parties have 5 days to file responses. The administrative law judge must hold a hearing within 10 days of the filing of the responses if a hearing has been requested and must issue a decision granting or denying temporary relief within 5 days of the date of the hearing, or the filing of the responses if no hearing is held. If all parties have been notified of the petition and given an opportunity to respond (and a hearing has been held if requested), the administrative law judge may grant temporary relief if the petitioner has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits and the relief will not adversely affect public health or safety or cause significant, imminent environmental harm. These standards are based on those contained in 30 U.S.C. 1275(c) (1988). As noted in the preamble to the proposed regulations, 56 FR at 45807 (Sept. 6, 1991), the focus of the adverse effect inquiry would be on the permitted operation rather than operation allegedly in violation. Any party may appeal the administrative law judge's decision granting or denying temporary relief to IBIA, which shall decide the appeal expeditiously, or may seek judicial review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OHA believes ``the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards''_in particular, an evidentiary hearing before a decision to suspend or rescind is effective_is minimal. As in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mathews <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> at 343&hyph;345, although the definition of ownership and control in 30 CFR 773.5 includes elements or judgment where witness credibility and veracity will sometimes play a role (e.g., &sect;&sect;773.5(a)(3), 773.5(b)(6)), the determination is usually made on the basis of documents, such as instruments of ownership or voting securities, or on the basis of readily and often publicly documentable circumstances such as a person's status as an officer or director of an entity, the permittee or operator of a surface coal mining operation, or a general partner in a parternship (e.g., &sect;&sect;773.5(a)(1)&hyph;(2), 773.5(b)(1)&hyph;(2), (4)&hyph;(5)). Further, a permittee receives sufficient notice of OSM's decision to suspend a permit (30 days under proposed &sect;773.20(c)(2)) or rescind a permit (up to 180 days under &sect;773.21) to enable it to request review by an administrative law judge before the decision becomes effective. The provisions in &sect;&sect;4.1370&hyph;4.1377 imposing short time frames for each step of review significantly reduce delay due to ``the torpidity of [the] administrative review process,''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mathews <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> at 342, especially if temporary relief is sought.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ``Government's interest'' is to effectively implement section 510(c), specifically, to ensure that no person in violation of SMCRA or the other specified environmental laws obtains or retains a permit to conduct surface mining operations until the violation is corrected or in the process of being corrected. The Department's goal of achieving compliance with these laws would be significantly burdened if it were required to provide an evidentiary hearing before OSM could decide to suspend or rescind a permit because the person should not have received the permit when it was issued. It was OSM's experience in 1992&hyph;93 that providing informal review by OSM of the proposed entry into the AVS of information concerning ownership or control links became very time-and-personnel-consuming. For 105 cases in 1993, for example, OSM spent more than 11,000 hours from after investigating an ownership or control link to issuing its final decision, a mean of 105 hours per case. It would be even more costly to require an evidentiary hearing before a permit was suspended or rescinded; meanwhile, mining would continue while alleged outstanding violations existed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In sum, as the Supreme Court stated in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mathews <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> at 343, ``there is less reason here than in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Goldberg  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> to depart from the ordinary principle, established by our decisions, that something less than an evidentiary hearing is sufficient prior to adverse administrative action.'' OHA believes the procedures for OSM decisionmaking and OHA administrative review on the proposed rules provide all the due process that is due before an improvidently issued permit is suspended or rescinded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Speaking at a  one-day seminar on future of oil and foreign policy of the  Islamic Republic of Iran, he said that the oil supply and demand  at the international markets have undergone strategic and  relatively wide-scale changes.    He said oil producing countries which were highly dependant  on the crude oil revenues in the last decade, suffered heavily  due to the oil prices fluctuations. OPEC production output rose  from 14 million BPD in 1985 to the current 23 million BPD  without tangible rise in the revenues of the member states,  Velayati said.    However, he added, the European Union countries had a total  revenue of dlrs. 200 billion from 11.8 million barrels of oil  they consumed in the last year alone. "This is three times as  much as the amount earned through the export of the similar  volume of oil by the oil exporting countries, i.e. dlrs. 74  billion."    Citing another example Velayati said Italian tax revenues  from the two million barrels of oil the country consumed last  year, were equal to the total revenues of Saudi Arabia of  selling daily 8 million barrels of crude oil.    He elsewhere noted that the prospect of the world energy  consumption concerning oil and other substitute energies does  not show a significant change at least in the next two decades,  and that oil will remain the only existing source of energy.    On the gas exports Velayati said Iran is aware of the  importance of establishing a gas pipeline to Europe, adding that  the Islamic Republic is willing to mount efforts in this regard  in a manner that joint interests of Iran, Russia and European  consumers are ensured.</p>

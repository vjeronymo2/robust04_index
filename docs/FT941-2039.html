			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Doubts voiced about union merger Signs of friction are emerging between the GMB and the TGWU, the two big general unions which are expected to start detailed merger negotiations in the next three months. A senior TGWU official said yesterday: 'There has been a definite cooling in relations, which could be just a blip but could blow up into something much bigger.' Five joint reports covering politics, structure, organisation, membership services and industrial services will be put to both executives by the end of this month. All have been positive about the proposed merger. But with conferences of the two unions expected to endorse formal talks in May and June, groups in both unions have been expressing reservations. In the TGWU the still-influential hard left has always had reservations about merging with a union seen as being on the right of the labour movement. It kept quiet about its concerns in the initial grass-root enthusiasm for the merger, but has become more outspoken. In the TGWU bodies comprising ordinary members have much more influence than full-time officials, which is not the case in the GMB. This difference is expected to cause difficulty in the negotiations. In the GMB there are anxieties about being swamped by the still slightly larger TGWU. One GMB official said: 'There has been a cooling inside the GMB but I think that both sides still recognise the logic of merger.' TGWU members voted by 82.1 per cent in favour of retaining a political fund on a turnout of 29 per cent. The TGWU's political fund is the second largest in the union movement, raising Pounds 3m a year. All unions have to vote every 10 years on retaining a fund.</p>

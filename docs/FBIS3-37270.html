			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, February 11, RIA -- The supposed  participation of the Russian Federation in NATO's Partnership  for Peace programme will have its own specific feature, that is,  it will reflect Russia's role as a military and nuclear power.  This was stated in a conversation with a RIA correspondent by a  high-ranking spokesman of the Russian foreign minister. He said  that the Russian side will announce this at the consultations  with NATO experts in Moscow on February 21 in discussing the  procedure of Russia's joining the Partnership for Peace  programme. According to the Russian diplomat, Russia's  participation in this programme should include not only military  components but also the issues of conversion. The Partnership  for Peace programme, adopted at the January session of the heads  of NATO member-states in Brussels, provides for gradual  inclusion of the former Warsaw Treaty Organisation's members in  NATO's political and military structures. The agreement on  joining this programme has already been signed by Poland,  Romania, Lithuania, Estonia, Hungary, Slovakia and Ukraine.  Latvia and Bulgaria are about to do it.    "Russia's participation in the Partnership for Peace  programme should markedly differ from the participation of the  countries which have already jointed it," said the spokesman of  the Russian Foreign Ministry.</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Waiting for the griffin to pull its weight: HSBC's results since acquiring Midland Bank last year A sculpture of two intertwined brass coils rising from a solid base sits in Midland Bank's head office in London. Called 'Union', it was given by Sir William Purves, chairman of HSBC Holdings, after it acquired Midland last July. 'They're obviously going to screw us into the ground,' said one Midland director on seeing it. As HSBC yesterday announced the first results for the new bank, the mood was less nervous. The first months of a merger that created the world's 15th largest bank have demonstrated some of its benefits. An example is the mixture of four styles of signs in Midland branches. The backing of capital from HSBC, parent of Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation, has allowed it to spend Pounds 18m this year unifying the style. Even such small amounts were hard to spare at Midland in the late 1980s. Still stricken by its 1981 purchase of Crocker National Bank in California, Midland incurred a Pounds 261m pre-tax loss in 1989 and only made Pounds 11m the next year. 'None of what we're doing now costs a lot a money, but we did not have any before,' says Mr Brian Pearse, Midland's chief executive. The prospect of HSBC dominating Midland has been lessened by the mixing of executives. Mr Richard Delbridge, Midland's finance director, has become HSBC group finance director. Mr Pearse professes to be content. 'I have found my masters very receptive. I'd be very surprised if they went against anything I thought was right.' Mr John Bond, HSBC's group chief executive, says Midland will maintain its style. 'We do not go around the world trying to export our culture. We have a few central principles, but each bank has its way of doing things,' he says. He lists the principles as strong capital and liquidity, a stress on information technology, and rigorous control of costs. Yet the continuation of such harmony depends on Midland performing a lot better than in the past. It now makes up 40 per cent of HSBC's assets, but contributed only Pounds 184m to the group's Pounds 1.2bn attributable profit. The Hong Kong shareholders who needed persuading last year that Midland was worth Pounds 4bn will watch for an improvement. The imbalance between HSBC's Asia Pacific operations and Midland is striking. Mr Robert Law, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, estimates that HSBC's Asian operations earned a 50 per cent pre-tax return on capital last year. Midland would need to make Pounds 800m even to achieve 20 per cent, which is well above its highest ever pre-tax profit of Pounds 693m in 1988. It has moved to remove overlap, spending Pounds 122m on restructuring in the second half of 1992. The London-based treasury and capital markets operations have been merged and moved to a new building. Cost savings and the increased size have produced benefits: the combined treasury operation costs 20 per cent less, and has raised turnover 17 per cent. Mr Pearse says corporate customers are now attracted to the merged Midland/HSBC because of its size, its greater capital strength and its resources in operations such as trade finance. Outside large corporate business, the merger remains unproven. HSBC's hardest task is to improve profits in the personal and small corporate business carried out through branches. Unlike Lloyds Bank, which made a counter-bid for Midland before withdrawing, HSBC cannot reap cost savings through eliminating overlap in branch networks. HSBC's most likely edge over other clearing banks is in technology. UK banks have allowed operations to develop incompatible systems: Midland's treasury operations alone had 22 systems. The bank has also used 'front office' technology for such things as credit scoring more extensively than British UK banks. Loans to small businesses are cleared by local managers within Midland; at Marine Midland such loans are assessed at a lending centre in New York state. How Midland will be affected by HSBC's preference for using technology to automate credit decisions while controlling staff costs is unknown. Midland cost-to-income ratio is 68.6 per cent compared with 56.6 per cent for HSBC as a whole. But Mr Pearse says the network of 1,800 branches is the right size, and the primary task is to pass more income through it. The suggestion that costs could be saved by automating small business lending gets a sceptical response from Mr Pearse. 'It may be a sign of my old age, but I would have to be convinced about that. I still believe that the capital structure of most small businesses in this country mean you have to be involved face-to-face with them,' he says. Mr Bond puts a different stress on the balance of cost and income, given sluggish loan demand in recession-hit OECD countries. 'The only thing you really have under your control at the moment is costs,' he says. He emphasises HSBC's preference for 'very short lines of communication', without thick layers of head office middle management. For the moment, the different traditions are a matter for debate rather than argument. Mr Bond is still assessing the acquisition after coming to London in January, and Mr Purves does not arrive until the autumn. But Mr Pearse's approach will soon have to bear fruit in transformed profits; HSBC's patience may otherwise wear uncomfortably thin.</p>

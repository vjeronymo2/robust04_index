			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["eli/ub"-signed report: "Europe Threatened by Missiles"] </F>   [Text] Bonn -- There is an increasing fear in the Federal  Government of fundamentalist movements in the Mediterranean and  of a threat to Europe by medium-range missiles. Reports say  that Chancellor Kohl will comment on this threat at the Military  Defense Meeting in Munich next weekend, drawing particular  attention to the worsening security situation in the  Mediterranean. The concern is due to developments in Algeria  and the growing influence of fundamentalist forces in the North  African states. The stability of the entire region is  threatened, reports said.    According to intelligence service information, the  government  thinks that in the event of the fundamentalists coming to power,  Western Europe could be threatened by missiles of a range up to  1,000 kilometers within a very short time. It is alleged that  Iraq might provide such missiles. The Federal Government is  also concerned about the situation in the Mediterranean because  of France's obligations in Algeria. French Government circles  are alleged to have asked Germany for support in an Algeria plan.    In his speech at the Military Defense Meeting, Kohl will  hint  at these threats, and he will also discuss the situation of the  Bundeswehr in detail. Kohl is guided by the idea that the  Bundeswehr needs clear perspectives and that the wave of savings  must come to an end. During last year's Military Defense  Meeting, the chancellor ordered a Bundeswehr reorganization. So  far, decreasing budgets have, however, prevented the Bundeswehr  reforms from being carried out.    At the Military Defense Meeting, Chancellor Kohl and his  challenger in the upcoming elections, Social Democratic Party  Chairman Rudolf Scharping, will meet; but there will probably  not be a direct confrontation. The organizers had planned that,  as a special attraction, Kohl and Scharping should each give a  20-minute talk consecutively, followed by discussion. Kohl said  he wants to talk in the morning and leave after the discussion  on his speech, because he has other commitments. He said  Scharping could speak in the afternoon.</p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais warns of further charges Credit Lyonnais, the troubled French banking group, may need to make additional provisions of up to FFr25bn (Dollars 4.73bn) against its heavy losses, government sources said yesterday. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, who was appointed by the government as chairman of the state-controlled group last year, told officials earlier this week that total provisions could be in the range of FFr15bn-FFr25bn, the sources claimed. The size of the provisions, which would be among the largest reported in French corporate history, emerged after Credit Lyonnais announced unexpectedly on Thursday that it would be delaying publication of its first-half results pending completion of 'certain analyses'. The bank confirmed yesterday that it was unlikely to issue new shares to help finance its restructuring before the end of the year - a possibility that had been floated by Mr Peyrelevade in March when he announced losses of FFr6.9bn for 1993. In a unusually public exchange, the French ministry of economy and finance responded late on Thursday night to Credit Lyonnais's decision with a statement that it had been alerted to certain 'substantial additional provisions' relating to risky assets to be accounted for in the results in the six months to the end of June this year. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister who was in New York when the story broke, said he had entrusted Mr Peyrelevade with carrying out the necessary work to research the provisions and present them in line with regulatory requirements. He stressed the bank had the state's full support and would do whatever was necessary. However, one official said yesterday: 'The state's support is obvious. It's like saying that we are opening an open door.' Credit Lyonnais would not be drawn on the timing and size of the provisions and the nature of its dialogue with the government. However, it said: 'We are delighted to have this public confirmation of the state's complete support.' Sources within the bank reiterated yesterday the discussions with the government triggering the delay in publication of its results related more to the way in which it would help with a rescue than concern over the provisions' size. However, government sources maintained the first they had known about the additional provisions and the need for state support was on Monday, and had until then relied on assurances provided by Mr Peyrelevade in early summer that provisions would total FFr5bn, which could be covered from internal sources. Officials are said to have been irritated by the divergence of the provisions from those agreed in the restructuring in April, and by the vague and broad range of possible additional amounts that the group says must be set aside. Credit Lyonnais said the state of the French equity market and details emerging about its financial position meant it was very unlikely it would proceed with a planned issue of FFr4bn-FFr5bn new shares before the end of the year. The group's certificats d'investissement, the non-voting shares and the only ones publicly traded, dropped nearly 6 per cent to close at FFr395 last night.</p>

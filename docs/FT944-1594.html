			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of Sweden (15): Firmly embarked on new strategy - Profile: Volvo 'Firing on all cylinders.' 'Up to speed again.' 'Back in top gear'. To the relief - and pride - of most Swedes, the motoring metaphors have been flowing thick and fast this year for Volvo, the country's biggest manufacturer. Thanks to a dramatic recovery in profits, memories of the ignominious collapse at the end of 1993 of Volvo's plans to merge with France's Renault have faded fast. Volvo returned a 12-fold growth in pre-tax profits in the first nine months of the year to record a surplus of SKr12.7bn, on turnover of SKr112.2bn. Under the energetic Mr Soren Gyll, the chief executive who has emerged as the new dominant figure in Volvo, the company is firmly embarked on a new strategy to focus on its core vehicle-making operations. By the end of 1996, it intends to have sold off all its non-core assets, raising a total of some SKr40bn to finance the future development of cars and trucks. Today, there is a widely-held view in the industry that Volvo Truck Corporation is already in strong shape. At the nine-month stage, worldwide unit truck sales were up 38 per cent at 49,400, delivering a jump in operating profits to SKr2.7bn that produced an operating margin of seven per cent. The big question mark, however, hangs over the future of Volvo Cars, the biggest division by sales value and the real heart of the company in the eyes of a nation which has always regarded Volvo as Sweden's industrial flagship. The car corporation also produced a big improvement in the first nine months: unit sales, at 269,600, were up 18 per cent; operating profits went from near break-even to SKr1.95bn. But Mr Gyll was quick to admit that the operating margin of 4 per cent, achieved as Volvo approaches the top of the business cyle, fell far short of the 7 per cent average he says the car division needs to achieve over a complete cycle. Uncomfortably for Volvo, it is setting out to achieve this as a niche player in the worldwide car industry at a time when the trend among its competitors has been towards building volume. Volvo is now one of the world's smallest producers of mainstream vehicles, with a basic range of just three cars in the 900, 800 and 400 series. Many in Sweden who argued against the merger with Renault said Volvo should set out to become a 'Swedish BMW'. Within months of Volvo choosing that path, however, the German carmaker itself opted to make a quantum leap in its volume output by buying Britain's Rover. Mr Gyll and Mr Per-Erik Mohlin, head of the car division, are well aware of this background. But they argue that there are still opportunities for a manufacturer of Volvo's size - Mr Mohlin says he is aiming for optimum output of 500,000 cars a year - given its powerful brand name and the vital ability of smaller manufacturers to use modern production techniques to be more responsive to customer demand. On the marketing front, Mr Mohlin intends to stretch Volvo's traditional appeal to family car buyers - primarily through its famously roomy estate cars - to what he calls 'pre-family' and 'post-family' buyers. The intention is to build on Volvo's reputation for safety, reliability and environmental friendliness to embrace at the same time greater 'driveability', with more emphasis on performance. The implication of this for production is for sportier models, with more attention to interior comforts. Volvo is not about to abandon estate cars, but it will concentrate harder on producing attractive saloons that get away from the 'boxy and boring' image of the past - and give greater added sales value. The trail has already been blazed to some extent by the successful 850 model; one in four 850s sold are the turbo-engined version. Volvo also has to decide whether to make a belated response to the inroads made into the estate car market by four-wheel-drive vehicles and 'people carriers'. Although no definite decision has been announced, all the indications are that Volvo will not attempt any significant extension of its basic production range. Rather, Mr Mohlin says, Volvo will probably cut down from three basic 'platforms' - or chassis - to two; the 800 and the medium-small sized 400 series. The 400 series is produced in the Netherlands in a joint venture with Japan's Mitsubishi. From these, Volvo will seek to produce a more varied range of models. 'We know it is possible to develop more cars from a single platform. The trick is to utilise common components, but to differentiate the products,' Mr Mohlin says. He says the aborted merger with Renault has cost Volvo more than a year in its vital programme to develop new models. This has increased the pressure to produce a successful formula that will carry Volvo over the next downturn in the cycle and prove that it can thrive as an independent carmaker. The headline writers will be no less ready with their cliches if it fails. 'Volvo stalls', 'Breakdown' and 'Running out of fuel' are the banners Mr Gyll and Mr Mohlin are determined to avoid.</p>

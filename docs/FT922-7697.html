			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Arts: Drawn from the age of Lorenzo the Magnificent / Visit the inaugural show in the Uffizi's new galleries WAS THERE ever a more spectacular display of 15th century drawings? In what is by far the most impressive exhibition of the year-long festivities in Florence marking the fifth centenary of the death of Lorenzo the Magnificent, the Uffizi inaugurates its six new galleries with a show of some 187 Florentine drawings from the age of Il Magnifico. The peerless Uffizi holding is supplemented by outstanding loans from the world's great print rooms and private collections. Despite the insensitive and all but information-free installation, the result is a rare treat - and a show that is as revealing of the nature of Renaissance drawing as it is ravishing to behold. A great number of the sheets are indeed of exceptional beauty, not least given the quattrocento Florentine's predeliction for delicate strokes of silverpoint with white heightening on prepared paper tinted with anything from amber to deep rose madder, mandarin or brilliant azure. As vivid witness to the creative process so admired in our own age, these confections make it hard for us to remember that they were never conceived as works of art in their own right. Old Master drawings have never been as prized as they are today. To the 15th century artist, with rare exceptions, they had no artistic value beyond their practical function, and certainly no commercial worth. They were stepping stones to the creation of a finished work, be it - as this exhibition amply reveals - a fresco, panel, canvas or print, a piece of sculpture, a church, a candelabrum or even a machine for transporting pyramids and obelisks. The show's thematic sections emphasise the working procedure that evolved into standard workshop practice during the 15th century, from the first, rapid and experimental compositional sketch to the full-size 'cartoon' pricked for transfer. It opens with copies made as an essential part of the artist's training. We find Michelangelo looking to the monumental figures of Masaccio in the Brancacci Chapel, and Ghirlandaio drawing friezes from the arch of Constantine. In view of the importance of Antiquity to the age of Lorenzo, what could be a more appropriate first exhibit than Benozzo Gozzoli's exquisite metalpoint on blue prepared paper after one of the ancient statues of horse-tamers on the Quirinal? An eloquent witness to the impact of the classical world on the perception of the modern is Botticelli's drawing of a youth posed to echo the famous 'Spinario' or pickthorn. This silverpoint is among the reams of nude and draped figure studies here executed at the dawn of the practice of life drawing. They represent the first attempts to reproduce accurately the appearance of man and the natural world. What is so extraordinary is that there is so little grappling towards formulating a means of expression. Drawing in Florence seems almost to have been born fully armed for its challenges - like Pallas Athene out of the head of Zeus. These sheets are attempts not only to explore the material universe but to place man convincingly within it. Hence the desire to observe the interaction of figures, telling gestures and emotions, drapery that clarifies rather than masks human form, and landscapes drawn from the Tuscan countryside that brought the sacred mysteries close to home. Perhaps the most breathtaking sequence in the show is of eight carefully wrought and boldly lit drapery studies, from Filippo Lippi to Piero di Cosimo. Lorenzo di Credi finds volume with fine sweeping lines of silverpoint and heightening. Leonardo's more painterly crisp, angular folds and deep shadows emerge out of tempera on linen. The presence of Vasari is keenly felt throughout, both as collector and as the historian who did so much to promote the notion of a Laurentian golden age of artistic patronage. One of the most extraordinary sheets here belonged to the artist: Ghirlandaio's compelling death portrait of a cabbage-nosed old man drawn in silverpoint and white heightening on rose pink paper. Have such misshapen features ever been accorded so much grace? By a peculiar irony, the artist's unflinching observation of the mask of death was to bear unlikely fruit. If we turn from the drawing to the artist's double portrait in the Louvre, we find the same old man - miraculously alive, and with even more warts - being contemplated by his grandson with the adoration the young accord only to the very old. To Florentine theorists, 'disegno' (design as much as drawing) was an instrument of the intellect and imagination. Its techniques and media evolved to meet new artistic challenges. We find Pollaiolo, for instance, embracing the obligingly quick and fluent medium of pen and ink to commit to paper his notion of an unusually vigorous and energetic Hercules wielding a blazing club to kill the Hydra. Filippino Lippi refuses to be constrained by the precision of silverpoint, using it with astonishing brio for his sketch of the litter-bearers for his fresco of John the Baptist raising Drusiana from the dead. Black chalk was found to possess infinitely subtle tonal range, the ideal medium for portrait heads. Red chalk, however, was an even greater pleasure yet to come. The show allows room for no less than 20 sheets by the fifth-rate goldsmith and niello artist Maso Finiguerra, explicable only as an indication of the rarity of drawings surviving from the 15th century. Understandably, it devotes its last two rooms to Sandro Botticelli and his contribution to Laurentian culture. Here are some of his remarkable illustrations to Dante's The Divine Comedy, as well as figure studies, tempera cartoons and panels. In the 'Adoration of the Magi' executed for Santa Maria Novella, we find the young Lorenzo along with the elder Medici paying homage to the Christ Child. What more perfect subject for bankers whose power rivalled that of kings.</p>

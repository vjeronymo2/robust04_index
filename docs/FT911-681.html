			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Yugoslavia gives army wide powers to avert civil war YUGOSLAVIA yesterday inched back from the brink of civil war and military rule when the eight-member federal presidency agreed to give the army sweeping powers to end ethnic clashes in the republic of Croatia. In a desperate effort to reach consensus after months of bitter disagreement, the collective presidency also agreed to form a commission to investigate the roots of the crisis. This is the first time the presidency has publicly acknowledged the ethnic nature of Yugoslavia's worst political crisis since the Second World War. The eleventh-hour compromise - made against the background of army threats to impose a state of emergency without the presidency's consent  - could buy the authorities a short period to restore stability after the clashes between Serbs and Croats which in the past week have led to the deaths of 18 people. A statement from the presidency orders Serbs and Croats in Croatia to hand over their weapons to the federal army authorities, prohibits the movement of any armed civilian units in unstable regions of the republic, and insists on the demobilisation of all citizens and police reservists in Croatia. It seems unlikely, however, given the deep distrust between Yugoslavia's two biggest ethnic groups, that either Serbs or Croats will comply with the order to hand over their weapons. Mr Franjo Tudjman, president of Croatia, said it was 'absolutely out of the question that Croatia's police reservists would demobilise'. In Belgrade, the federal capital and capital of the Republic of Serbia, thousands of demonstrators at what was originally a peace rally finished by calling for the establishment of a Serbian army. The presidential agreement gives the army and federal police control over the predominantly Serbian territory of Krajina, in eastern Croatia. Krajina comprises about a third of Croatia's territory. But in a concession to Croatia, the statement recognised the inviolability of its borders, as sought by Croatian leaders. Serbian leaders in Krajina have since August refused to allow Croatian police into the region, claiming that the police resemble the 'Ustashe', the Nazi-backed Croat government set up during the Second World War. Concern about the fate of Serbs in an independent Croatia has been manipulated by Serbia's communist authorities in order to gain support for their dispute with Croatia's pro-independence leaders. The commission being set up under the agreement will include 'legitimate' representatives from Croatia and the republic's Serbian minority. However, its composition has already been criticised by Mr Tudjman. He said negotiations with Serbs could only include 'the legitimately elected representatives to the Croatia parliament . . . (this) absolutely excludes Serbian leaders in rebel-held Knin (in the Krajina) who came to power through violence and terror'.</p>

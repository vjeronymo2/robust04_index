			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ALR PRODUCTS TO BE MARKETED IN W. GERMANY  </P> <P> Joining the ranks of other computer companies that are expanding overseas,  Advanced Logic Research Inc. said Wednesday that it has signed an agreement for  the distribution of its personal computers in West Germany.  </P> <P> In addition, ALR expects to land an agreement within two weeks for distribution  of its products in Mexico, Marketing Manager Genny Ortegon said.  </P> <P> That deal is made possible by the Mexican government's recent loosening of  restrictions on foreign computer imports.  </P> <P> Under the agreement announced Wednesday, a unit of Torrance-based Merisel,  formerly Softsel/Microamerica, will distribute ALR's line of personal computers  in West Germany, the largest consumer market in Western Europe. Merisel is also  one of ALR's distributors in North America.  </P> <P> "As ALR moves to open channels in other countries, Germany is especially  important to us, as we perceive it to be one of the more progressive countries  in Europe in the high-technology sector," Ortegon said.  </P> <P> As the growth of the domestic computer market slows, computer companies are  counting on overseas sales for growth. The deal with Merisel will position ALR  for the planned transformation of Western Europe into a single market in 1992.  </P> <P> Merisel will also distribute ALR products in East Germany if the two countries  eventually unite, Ortegon said. As ALR's distributor, Merisel's Softsel DNS  Germany subsidiary will provide products, service, technical support and  advertising in the German markets.  </P> <P> About 20% of ALR's current annual revenue comes from international sales. The  company has distribution agreements to sell its computers in the United  Kingdom, France, Austria and Sweden, Ortegon said. The company also sells its  products in the Far East, Canada and Latin America.  </P></p>

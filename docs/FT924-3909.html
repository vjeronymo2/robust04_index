			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Survey of Thailand (3): Regulators under fire - The Stock Market This was supposed to be the year when the regulators brought discipline and maturity to the lively casino known as the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET). The reality was somewhat messier. It all started cleanly enough. With the economy booming and new companies being listed on the exchange every week, Thailand enacted a law on the regulation of financial markets and installed the new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in one of the central bank's offices on Surawong Road in Bangkok. Perhaps it was unfortunate that the SEC's formation coincided with the market's nadir in May, when Thai soldiers were killing pro-democracy demonstrators on the streets of the capital. For as confidence revived following the political defeat of the armed forces, the return of law and order and the election of a civilian coalition government in September, investors and speculators piled into the stock market, often buying shares with money lent to them by their stockbrokers. The SET index rose inexorably and by November 5 it had reached 963.03, up 44 per cent from its low of 667.84 on May 19. Bangkok's trading volume soared as well, and at times was second only to Tokyo among Asian bourses. Meanwhile a controversy had erupted over a meteoric rise in the price of shares in Bangkok Bank of Commerce (BBC), the country's ninth-largest bank. Mr Song Watcharasriroj, a wealthy market player better known as Sia (Tycoon) Song, turned out to have bought a large stake in the bank, but nobody knew quite how much he owned. His personal declared stake was 10.66 per cent, but most people believed he had bought at least 25 per cent of the bank in collaboration with a group of relatives and associates, in which case he should have made an offer for the rest of the shares. Mr Song, who like most other market players was able to benefit from stockbrokers' credit lines, was accused of being a 'greenmailer' and of manipulating the shares without keeping the SET informed of his real holding or his intentions. At this point various officials started talking about the case to the press and hinting that they were about to do something. The SET, the SEC, the finance ministry, the central bank and the police were all involved. 'No-one has given a clear delineation of duties. It's a mess,' said one stockbroker. BBC shares fell. The SEC, under fire not just because of its inaction but also because some of its members evidently had conflicts of interest - one was advising the chairman of BBC in the battle against Mr Song and another, the head of a brokerage, had announced that Mr Song was innocent - pleaded for more time. 'It's not that simple,' Mr Ekamol Kiriwat, SEC secretary-general, told the FT in an interview. 'How long did it take for (Michael) Milken to be in trouble?' He complained that people were smearing his reputation with false allegations that he had met Mr Song, and said it was hard to prove that speculators were acting in concert with each other even when everyone knew it was true. 'Some people say we should not disclose anything and others say we are not doing anything,' he said. 'I did not even want this job.' Meanwhile the finance ministry and the central bank had moved to prick what they saw as a potentially dangerous stock market bubble inflated by easy credit. By September, brokers had outstanding loans of Bt62.66bn to their clients - three times as much as a year earlier - and there were signs that speculators were also using personal loans from the banks to buy shares. 'We are trying to allow some steam out of the bubble before it becomes a bubble,' said Mr Asavin Chintakananda, the SET executive vice-president. 'I think we have the matter well in hand.' The Bank of Thailand named 22 brokers with outstanding loans of more than Bt1bn - one had more than Bt10bn - and told them to restrict credit. The SET index started to fall. Then the SEC pounced on Mr Song, announcing on November 18 that they had filed a case with the police against him for manipulating shares. Investors feared further moves against market players - after all, the SET had passed on 11 cases of suspected malpractice to the SEC and only one of them appeared to involve BBC and Mr Song - and dumped their shares. The market plunged and angry small investors staged demonstrations outside the exchange. Mr Song, a dapper 35-year-old, emerged into the limelight to protest his innocence. 'I have never sold BBC shares since buying them,' he said at a Bangkok hotel. 'I have not made any gains from this bank's shares. So how could they charge me with manipulating the price?' He calmly produced Bt10m in cash for his bail money; it was twice as much as required. At the time of writing, the case of Mr Song has not been resolved but most stockbrokers assume that the SET index will start to rise again. At first, Thai small investors seemed unimpressed by the government's hasty decision to mobilise Bt15bn of funds to buy shares and stabilise the market: Bt5bn from the government-controlled Krung Thai Bank and a further Bt10bn from stockbrokers. But some foreign investors looked at the market's fall as a heaven-sent opportunity to buy. Corporate profits are strong and the Thai economy is growing at 7 or 8 per cent a year. The SET, now with more than 300 listed companies, recently upgraded its computer system to handle up to 200,000 orders an hour, compared with current peaks of less than 100,000. A group of brokers are planning to set up an over-the-counter market for smaller companies which would operate alongside the SET. 'We are going through this particular phase when the SEC is still very new,' said a quietly confident Mr Asavin. 'We are investigating who might be taking certain liberties, but I can assure you that the Thai stock market is not being manipulated more than any other market in the world.'</p>

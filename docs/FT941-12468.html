			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Number one is the first among numbers - But why is 59 so weak? What is the most frequently used number between one and 100? No prizes for guessing the answer. It is, of course, one. But what is the least used number? The answer is 97. I can say this with some certainty because I did a little research during my Christmas holiday idleness. Thanks to the miracle of electronic data search technology, I was able to find out how many times each number between one and 100 appeared in 17 UK newspapers during 1993. In case anyone thinks I'm dotty, the research took only a few minutes, and I hold no mystical belief in numbers. I was simply curious to see whether there were any interesting patterns or anomalies. As far as I knew, no one had ever looked into this before. Indeed, no one would have been able to until computerised databases became available quite recently. But like many pioneers, I encountered an early disappointment. The results were rather predictable: smaller numbers get used a lot more than bigger ones. The interesting thing, though, is that the pattern is quite smooth, as a glance at the chart shows. But the downward slope is a curve rather than a gradient. It descends sharply from its initial peak, starts leveling out in the 30s, and then tails off gradually towards 100. Even the 10s show a consistent pattern, except for 50 and 100. More interesting is that the curve has a marked logarithmic shape to it, in other words, the variation between the use of individual numbers diminishes progressively rather than at a steady rate. This is presumably evidence for the hypothesis that the higher the numbers, the less people care about the difference between them. If so, this slope could be quite useful in helping people deal with issues which depend on perceptions of the size of numbers. For example, you could use it to calculate the size of bonuses needed to provide required levels of incentive, or people's reaction to news of disasters involving large losses of life, or the political impact of decisions which affect large numbers of jobs. What other points emerged? The blips on the curve show clearly that we operate a decimal system, again predictable. But they also give an idea of the lingering strength of the duodecimal system. Blips are visible at 12, 24 etc up to 72. Only at 84 do they vanish, suggesting that six dozen is about the limit. Thirty-one sticks up a bit. This was the favourite number of Srinivasa Ramanujan, the Indian mathematical genius, because it begins a remarkable series of prime numbers (331,3331 etc). I got a bit excited about this but I suspect the reason here is more prosaic: 31 is the last day of many accounting months. There is also a hump at 92,93,94, which I took to reflect the year the numbers appeared. Number 13 is under-used, but apart from that I could find nothing to comfort or frighten the superstitious. If the underlying pattern is correct - that a number is less used the greater it is - this means that the natural place for each number is itself. In other words, 57 should rank 57th in use. But there are many exceptions. An interesting exercise is to find the numbers which are used more frequently, or less frequently, than they should be. I decided to call these 'strong' and 'weak'. The strongest number is 100, which ranks 16th in use and is therefore 84 places ahead of itself. Other strong numbers are the 10s and 5s, and those such as 93 and 72 which can be explained. The weakest number is 59 (which slips 22 places to 81st), followed by 61,58,41 and 39. I suspect they are the casualties of 'bunching' - the tendency to round up or down to strong numbers such as 60 and 40. Even numbers do better than odd numbers in the strength rankings, which is probably because they are more useful, being more easily divisible. For similar reasons, I suspect, prime numbers are also weak: only one (67) makes it to the strong category. I'm not sure how the concept of strong and weak numbers can be exploited. Do strong numbers influence the way people feel about them? Do you have more respect for 45 (which is five places up) than for 28 (five places down)? Might people who market brands which contain numbers find something here? Well, anyway, it helped pass the holiday. If anyone wants the raw data to experiment for themselves, just send me a stamped addressed envelope at the FT.</p>

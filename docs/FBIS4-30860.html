			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec by Milos </F> Sklenka; place and date not given: "Supporting Export Is Part of  Diplomacy, but the State Cannot Conduct Trade on Behalf of  Enterprises"]    [Text] [Sklenka] After the former Federal Ministry of  Foreign Trade had been abolished, jurisdiction over the control  of foreign trade was divided between several sectors, one of  which is the Foreign Ministry today. Setting aside the fact  that foreign partners very often do not know whom to address, do  you not think that the control over this vital sector of the  national economy has lost some of its operational effectiveness  and efficiency?    [Zieleniec] I resolutely reject the use of the term "control  of foreign trade," since the conditions for the functioning of  the entire economy, and foreign trade as a part thereof, have to  be created in cooperation among many ministries. Specifically,  foreign policy creates general prerequisites for the development  of trade, it opens political opportunities, and sees to it that  our entrepreneurs are not discriminated abroad, and so forth.    This, however, has nothing to do with the control of foreign  trade. The control of foreign trade is exactly what we had here  in Czechoslovakia under communism. The fact that we have got  rid of it shows how far we have progressed in economic and  institutional reforms. If we want our foreign trade to become  an organic part of our economic life -- which is based on  private initiative -- then we have to create equal conditions  for both foreign and domestic trade.    [Sklenka] I do not want to argue about little words, but a  number of post-communist countries, and also industrially  advanced countries, have, within the framework of their state  administration, certain bodies for controlling foreign trade at  their disposal, such as ministries of external economic  relations.    [Zieleniec] A ministry of external economic relations is  something other than the Ministry of Foreign Trade. In the  Czech Republic, too, it ensues from the law on power-sharing  that the Foreign Ministry has within its jurisdiction, among  other things, the coordination of external economic relations.  It is a question of how the state administration is organized,  whether it establishes an independent body for this purpose, or  not.    It is also true that many countries have a different opinion  on this matter, above all, other postcommunist countries that  had ministries of foreign trade in the past. In most cases,  they have kept them. If we look at them more carefully,  however, for instance, at Poland -- which even has the Central  Planning Commission -- we will see that the institutional  structure in these countries is directly connected, to a certain  extent, with the state of reforms there.    [Sklenka] Let us return to the direct connection between  trade and diplomacy. Without doubt, foreign trade is an  inseparable part of foreign service. How does the Foreign  Ministry want, in this connection, to support Czech exports and  open new markets to our exporters?    [Zieleniec] The role of diplomacy is immensely important in  that respect. First, it is necessary for the foreign service to  exactly monitor the political and macroeconomic situation in  other countries, and be able to point to the opportunities that  exist for the expansion of Czech trade on the markets there. At  the same time, it is necessary to secure an efficient  information channel so that required information might get, as  fast as possible, to the hands of not only the state  administration bodies, but, above all, to our entrepreneurial  public. Either directly, or through the Economic Chamber, the  Union of Industry and Transportation, stock market, or other  institutions.    I consider the propagation of the Czech Republic abroad to  be  no less important in the work of the foreign service. This not  only applies to general information, but also to specific  business opportunities, conditions for investors, legislative  regulations for conducting business on the Czech market, and  establishing joint firms.    [Sklenka] Much has been said about the fact that, apart from  the representative offices, this function will be secured by the  so-called Czech Centers in the future.    [Zieleniec] Yes, these organizations, founded by the Foreign  Ministry, will function on semi-commercial basis. It signifies  a certain transformation of our former cultural centers into  information and commercial centers. Their task will be to  provide not only general information about investment  opportunities in the Czech Republic and about the export and  import conditions, but, on the basis of demands by specific  entrepreneurial entities, also to organize industrial  expositions, secure public relations, and mediate marketing  studies for state institutions, as well as for private  entrepreneurs.    [Sklenka] The Czech Centers, if the entire project is  implemented as planned, are certainly an appropriate step on the  way to a more specific definition of the Czech proexport policy.  Up to now, we have had such centers, de facto, only in former  socialist countries, and not the capitals of industrially  advanced countries that are centers of world trade. In view of  the fact that our export is mostly oriented toward the West, we  need them precisely there.    [Zieleniec] Of course, under socialism we had centers in  Sofia, but not in New York, in Warsaw but not in Paris, we had  them in Budapest, but not in London. This is why we are trying  intensively to remedy this situation, without abolishing the  existing network. Due to the fact that the centers are being  established on the basis of intergovernmental treaties, they  enjoy certain advantages abroad, advantages that a regularly  registered firm does not enjoy there. The Czech Republic is a  small industrial country that is dependent on wide contacts with  the world. Our open foreign policy and liberal trade policy  correspond to this.    [Sklenka] Despite the fact that our trade policy is  liberal, many people believe that it is not proexport enough.  Czech exports may have grown by more than 18 percent last year,  nevertheless, their structure has only slightly improved and  still remains on the level of a developing country. In exports  to the OECD countries, machines and equipment represent only  some 22 percent of the overall volume. What does the government  want to do about this?    [Zieleniec] Within the framework of support to export, the  state furnishes the entrepreneurial sphere with very important  public goods [verejny statek], which is the koruna's proexport  exchange rate. This precisely was, and still is, the engine of  the enormous boom in Czech exports. It is a great advantage  that the state deliberately tries to maintain our foreign trade  as a dynamic element in the development of the Czech economy.    [Sklenka] However, the koruna's proexport exchange rate has  fallen by about one-third during past three years, and is still  falling, which is a proof that this comparative advantage is  only of short duration. Do you not think that the state should  do something more for restructuring exports [komoditni  reorientace] and making exports "healthier?"    [Zieleniec] Yes, proexport tools such as the insurance of  exports, long-term export loans at competitive interest rates,  etc., we mentioned very frequently, but, today, we have  institutions for this purpose. Apart from the functioning  insurance company EGAP, Ceska Exportni Banka [Czech Export Bank]  has been established recently. The state does for our  entrepreneurs everything possible that is in its power, since  proexport policy is an inseparable part of its economic policy  and foreign policy, but the state cannot directly conduct  business on behalf of enterprises. If it did, then it could  also draft plans for them, for example. We had this here  before, but it did not prove to be good.    Nevertheless, this does not mean that the state will not  engage in business in certain specific cases. For instance, if  the export of large investment units is involved, in which the  state is interested, the state may help not only politically,  but also directly -- financially, for example. This is the  genuine essence of the mechanism of support to foreign trade  that our government is pushing for. This is precisely the  proexport regime that we consider to be the most economic.</p>

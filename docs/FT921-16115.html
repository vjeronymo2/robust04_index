			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Lamont admits growth forecast 'over-optimistic' MR NORMAN Lamont, the chancellor, yesterday admitted that the government's most recent forecast of economic growth was over-optimistic and he went further than before in ruling out a realignment of currencies in the European Monetary System. The chancellor, in an interview on TV-am, appeared to rule out any move by European finance ministers to change parities in the EMS exchange rate mechanism. 'There won't be a realignment conference,' Mr Lamont said. Realignment was another word for devaluation and he had made 'crystal clear' that there would be no devaluation of the pound. Instead, companies should adjust their costs to sterling's exchange rate. Mr Lamont admitted that the forecast of 2 1/4 per cent growth for this year in November's Autumn Statement 'will prove to have been somewhat over-optimistic'. The strength of growth around the world had slowed since June. US forecasts on recovery had 'gone out the window' and Germany had moved into recession. He believed recovery in Britain would take place, however. Growth would be gradual at first, but accelerate towards the end of 1992. Last year's interest rate cuts, rising real incomes, and the repayment of debt would all encourage people to start spending again. 'What we need is confidence,' the chancellor said. He was encouraged by the recent strength of Wall Street and predicted that confidence would rise in Britain as the US economy improved. Mr Lamont said the UK would be in a strong position once recovery was under way. Britain's share of world trade was stable and the economy would benefit from the large investments made in the late 1980s. There were also more small companies  - making for a more dynamic economy  - while Britain's strike record was 'better than ever before'. The chancellor defended his policies, saying that he would not have done anything different over the past 12 months.</p>

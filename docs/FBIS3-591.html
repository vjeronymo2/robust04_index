He said the country was headed for a head-on  collision, and that a "volkstemming" [plebiscite] before April  27, to prove support for a volkstaat [homeland], was  non-negotiable.    At the same time, the April 27 election should be postponed  for at least two months to allow the Freedom Alliance enough  time to prepare for participation. But, interviewed on the  television programme Agenda, Gen Viljoen did not state whether  the Freedom Front he registered would be submitting a candidate  list.    Gen Viljoen said he met Mr de Klerk on Tuesday, but Mr de  Klerk again refused to allow a poll among whites.    The Afrikaner should be given a chance to enter the new  South  Africa peacefully and not violently, Gen Viljoen said. It was  very unwise of Mr de Klerk to have rejected the request for a  white plebiscite, and the country was being put at risk.    "Now we have the situation that in April we won't have a  volkstaat and there will be great dissatisfaction.    "The Afrikaner will be angry and if there is war people  should not blame me," Gen Viljoen said. He maintained that  securing a volkstaat peacefully was better than fighting, in  which many people would be killed.    In South Africa, however, pieces of paper did not mean much,  and in such an unsafe situation the Afrikaner should maintain  his military capabilities.    Gen Viljoen said the Freedom Front waited for the IFP  [Inkatha Freedom Party] delegation at the IEC's [Independent  Electoral Commission] offices on Wednesday in the interests of  maintaining solidarity within the Freedom Alliance.    He had not gone to the IEC's offices because he had been  engaged in other meetings.    He told Conservative Party leader Ferdi Hartzenberg on  Wednesday they should meet to manage the conflict. Gen Viljoen  said they got along famously on the principle of Boer consensus.    The ANC [African National Congress] should realize that  while  he was trying to accommodate the Afrikaner constitutionally and  peacefully, he was experiencing strong opposition from rightwing  quarters who wanted a volkstaat. He had tried to get his AVF  colleagues to go along with his initiatives but failed.    If the Freedom Alliance's constitutional demands were met,  however, they would participate in the election, which would  have to be postponed to allow the alliance time for prepapations.    Gen Viljoen said the fact that the police had warned him  about far rightwing plots against himself showed how serious the  situation was. There were 85 far right organisations while the  AVF was an umbrella body for only 17.    But Gen Viljoen said he had to accept this situation. He was  a soldier who had been in many battles.</p>

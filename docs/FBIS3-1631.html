(the same below) For instance, the  investment in Qingdao Danong textile corporation which is  engaged in the production of dyed cotton cloths and yarns totals  $19 million and that in Qingdao Sanhe fiber corporation which is  engaged in the production of chemical fiber cloths totals $17.4  million. The wholly funded enterprises tend to become the "main  forces" of the Korean-funded enterprises in Qingdao.    The number of large-sized enterprises continues to increase.  The enterprises with more than $10 million investment each  numbers three and those with more than $1 million investment  each numbers 23, accounting for 41 percent of the total  investment. The three enterprises each involving more than $10  million investment belong to the textile trade.    The enterprises are mainly engaged in the production of  textile products, clothes, and toys. The enterprises of textile  category account for the largest proportion. The total  investment in these enterprises is $52.74 million and the  foreign capital used by these enterprises total $23.14 million,  respecting accounting for 47 percent and 38 percent of the  total. The enterprises engaged in the production of clothes  account for the second largest proportion. The total investment  is $29 million and the foreign capital used by these enterprises  totals $18.72 million, respectively accounting for 26 percent  and 30 percent. The other categories of enterprises are listed  as toy, electrical appliance, and foodstuff industries when  arranged in the order of large proportions.    Some new-type enterprises are established in Qingdao. They  are enterprises engaged in the production of sports goods,  various kinds of wigs, and furniture and catering service. Some  investment spheres that Korean enterprises had never involved in  have become the popular investment items, and the investment in  these spheres tends to increase. Since the beginning of last  year, the investment in the enterprises of these types has  surpassed $10 million.    The cities and counties in the suburban areas of Qingdao  city  find favor in Korean cooperatives' eyes. The statistic figures  compiled by the Qingdao customhouse showed that following the  setup of Tuopudun electrical appliance corporation in  Jiaoliuting Town of Qingdao city at the end of 1989, more than  100 Korean-funded enterprises were successively set up in the  cities and counties of Qingdao city. Laoshan District's Liuting  "street of foreign-funded enterprises" and the "Korean-funded  enterprise group" of Zhonghan Town in Qingdao tend to develop  the export-oriented economy.</p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Cookery: In praise of perfect pasta and, since it frequently is, pasta tends to feature on many household menus at least once a week. Whether this is gastronomically depressing or good tidings may depend on the shopping. For there are some extraordinarily nasty confections sold in the name of pasta and pasta sauces, a few that are good, and one or two gems. To my mind, Cipriani is by far the best brand of pasta available to British home cooks. A great deal more appetising than the so-called fresh pasta generally on sale, it is better than the home-made pasta of all but the best home cooks. Cipriani's range of shapes is limited, but this dried pasta is exceptionally eggy and light, and it cooks quickly. Pasta this good does not need dressing up. Melted butter, a grinding of pepper and a smattering of freshly grated Parmesan is enough. Or fruity olive oil warmed and infused with crushed garlic. Those prepared to indulge in a little more culinary effort, however, may care to consider making the sauce recipes I give below. Easier still, in theory at least, is unzipping a can, jar or tub of ready made sauce - if you can find one that passes your tastebud test. Sauces made by Italians for the Italian market and imported here are probably the best bet. I like, rather than rave about, Cipriani's latest canned pasta sauce: Amatrice, the consistency and nuggets of smokey bacon are as they should be. Althea's tomato sauce is excellent, pure and barely cooked so it is remarkably light and fresh tasting. Equally suitable for cold pasta dishes and hot ones, this could be used also for dressing courgettes, leeks and other cooked vegetable salads. I also recommend La Truffata by L'Aquila, a smoothly pureed blend of porcini and white truffles, small spoonfuls of which make a rich treat simply stirred into thick hot cream. This is good for saucing escalopes of veal as well as pasta. Last but far from least, look out for pesto by Roi. Most ready-made versions of this lovely sauce bear little relationship to the real thing; none holds a candle to this. Made by a small Ligurian producer steadfast to tradition, it includes nothing but basil, extra virgin olive oil, garlic and pinenuts. No cheap substitutes. No extras. Not even salt - as the soil in which Ligurian basil grows seasons the herb with salt enough. What about Parmesan and Pecorino Sardo? Surely they are classic ingredients of pesto? Quite so, but they are absent from the jar for the simplest and best of reasons. In Liguria, I am told, cheeses are never incorporated into pesto until the day of serving. If added ahead, they say, the sauce may ferment in storage.

TAGLIARDI WITH LEMON AND HERBS (serves 2-3) The important thing here is to steep the herbs and lemon in olive oil for 12-24 hours before using so the oil becomes impregnated with their flavours. 8 oz green tagliardi; 1 lemon; 1-2 tablespoons chopped lemon thyme leaves; 2-3 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary; 3 tablespoons fruity olive oil. Grate all the lemon zest, mix it with the herbs and olive oil. Cut half the lemon into thin slices, discard the pith and cut the flesh into small triangular wedges. Add these to the oil mixture and leave to steep overnight. Just before serving, place the aromatic mixture in a flameproof casserole over low heat. When warm, add the juice of the remaining half lemon. Swirl to mix and remove from the heat. Quickly add the freshly boiled and drained pasta and toss to mix, adding sea salt and pepper to taste. Serve alone or hand round also a little bowl of freshly grated Parmesan - but be cautious: too much Parmesan is a mistake. Its savoury richness may detract from the sharp clean taste of citrus and herbs. PASTA WITH ORIENTAL LEEKS (serves 2-3) East meets West in this light and pretty dish. 6 oz penne or other small pasta shapes; 6 oz leeks (cleaned and trimmed weight); 1 teaspoon finely chopped ginger root; 1 slightly heaped tablespoon sesame seeds; a couple of spoonfuls each of olive oil and chopped coriander leaves. Slice the leeks across as finely as possible to make ribbony shreds. Chop the ginger and coriander, and toast the sesame seeds. Warm the oil in a flameproof casserole. Add the ginger and leeks and stir for half a minute or so until glistening. Cover and soften gently for 2-3 minutes. Then add the sesame, coriander, cooked and drained pasta and a seasoning of salt and pepper. Draw the dish away from the heat, toss to mix well and serve. POOR MAN'S FUSILLI (serves 2-3) Fried breadcrumbs, which add agreeable crunch to this recipe, are sometimes called poor man's Parmesan, hence the name of the dish. 6 oz fusilli or other pasta shapes; 2 oz breadcrumbs; 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped; 2-2 1/2 oz celery leaves and tender young celery stalks, finely chopped; a handful of chopped parsley; the grated zest of a lemon; 1 1/2 oz unsalted butter or 3 tablespoons olive oil. Heat half the butter or oil in a flameproof casserole. Stir in the crumbs and fry, stirring now and then, for several minutes until golden and crisp. Remove and keep hot. Melt the rest of the fat and fry the garlic and celery. Draw the casserole away from the heat. Add the cooked and drained pasta and the parsley and toss to mix. Add the lemon zest, a seasoning of salt and pepper, and the savoury fried crumbs. Toss again and serve without delay while the crumbs are still crunchy.</p>

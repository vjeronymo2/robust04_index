			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Communique" by the spokesman of the National Army of </F> Democratic Kampuchea; dated 12 January; place not given -- read  by announcer]    [Excertps] I. Of late, the Vietnamese puppets within the  two-headed government have again employed an obsolete,  despicable maneuver by misleadingly proclaiming that the  National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] has used Thai  territory.    II. The NADK spokesman has already rejected this kind of  unsubstantiated accusation with unscrupulous political motives  many times.    III. It is asked why the two-headed government painstakingly  proclaimed and systematically hurled this accusation at other  people?    A. The government made this tumultuous accusation to conceal  its shameful defeat in the so-called large-scale offensive  against Phnum Malai from 1 to 3 January. During the offensive,  they employed all-out efforts; they even infiltrated Thai  territory in the Nang Ean area for the purpose of attacking the  people and the NADK from behind. They made this clamorous and  false statement with the aim of camouflaging its own intrusion  into Thai territory. This is the communist Vietnamese's  obsolete trick of a thief shouting 'stop thief.'    B. They made this false statement to conceal activities  conducted by the warmongering communist Vietnamese and its  alliance -- they were hurriedly drawing up a plan and shipping  invading forces, ammunition, tanks, and cannons in an attempt to  attack the people and the DK [Democratic Kampuchea] resistance  forces in western and northern Cambodia for the purpose of  hindering national reconciliation.    C. Their blatant statement is aimed at pressuring Thailand  and the Royal Thai Government into giving up their support for  national reconciliation and peace in Cambodia. [passage omitted]    [Dated] 12 January 1994    [Signed] NADK spokesman</p>

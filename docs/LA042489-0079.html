			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ERROR HELPS NORTHRIDGE TO SOFTBALL SPLIT  </P> <P> A throwing error by shortstop Ellen Frank allowed two runs to score, giving Cal  State Northridge a crucial 3-2, 10-inning win over Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and  a split of a California Collegiate Athletic Assn. doubleheader at CSUN on  Sunday.  </P> <P> With the bases loaded and one out, freshman Heather MacTavish grounded to  Frank, who threw wildly to the plate in an effort to force Lesley Plank. The  ball skipped by catcher Kelly McInerney, allowing Lisa Erickson to score the  winning run.  </P> <P> "All I wanted to do was put the ball in play and let the defense make the  mistake. And that's exactly what happened," said MacTavish, who entered the  game after four innings when starting catcher Char Schmitt became ill.  </P> <P> With the doubleheader split, Northridge (49-15, 13-3 in conference play) needs  to win just two of its remaining four conference games to clinch its eighth  consecutive CCAA title.  </P> <P> Cal Poly SLO (24-10-1, 12-5-1) got a well-pitched game from sophomore Laura  Fawcett and took advantage of some shoddy CSUN fielding to win the opener, 3-1.  </P> <P> Fawcett (6-5), from Tujunga, gave up a first-inning run on two hits, but  settled down and gave up just four hits the rest of the way.  </P> <P> CSUN pitcher Heather Lindstrom scattered four hits, but a walk, an error, Lori  Peterson's double and a sacrifice fly from Missi Cole produced two runs for the  Lady Mustangs in the third.  </P> <P> Cal Poly SLO, needing a second-game win to take over the CCAA lead, struck  early against CSUN starter Debbie Dickmann. Frank was hit by a pitch to start  the second inning and, after an error by Michelle Blaha, came around to score  an unearned run on Alison Murray's ground out.  </P> <P> CSUN tied the game an inning later on two singles, an illegal pitch and Anna  Getherall's run-scoring ground out to second.  </P> <P> In baseball action:  </P> <P> CS Sacramento 4, CS Northridge 1: After stranding 10 runners in a nonconference  loss at Matador Field, Northridge hits the road today for an important CCAA  game at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.  </P> <P> The Matadors, third in conference at 10-10-1, will pitch Fili Martinez against  the first-place Mustangs (14-8) today at 4.  </P> <P> Sacramento State (30-13), ranked No. 3 in the last Division II baseball poll,  struck for three runs in the third off CSUN starter Vale Lopez (4-7) Sunday.  Brian Fichtner's two-run double just inside the third-base line was the big  blow.  </P> <P> CSUN (23-14-1 overall) scored against Mike Frame (4-1) in the sixth on a  single, a double, a walk and Randy Thompson's bases-loaded bouncer up the  middle.  </P></p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Prescott pledge on BR line to Glasgow MR JOHN PRESCOTT, shadow transport secretary, yesterday promised spending of Pounds 41m over the first two years of a Labour government to upgrade rail services on the west coast main line, Paul Cheeseright writes. The line runs between London Euston and Glasgow through the west Midlands and Lancashire. He said in Derby that two prototype trains would be ordered immediately after the election, and that their performance would be checked by independent design controllers. British Rail would be invited to renew the track and signalling and a training programme would be started to increase the pool of electrical engineers. Mr Prescott said the programme would 'lead to high-speed rail links for passengers and freight before the end of the century'. He added that Labour would modernise railways, not privatise them.</p>

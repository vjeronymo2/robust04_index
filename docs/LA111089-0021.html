			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FIREFIGHTER SAYS HE LOST JOB FOR REPORTS TO COUNCILWOMAN  </P> <P> A Hawthorne firefighter who claims that he was demoted in retaliation for  political activities told the city's Civil Service Commission a tale of  intrigue that involved his secretly passing Fire Department information to  Councilwoman Ginny M. Lambert.  </P> <P> The testimony came at a Civil Service hearing Wednesday. Dennis Patriquin, a  firefighter for 16 years, has charged that he was demoted from probationary  engineer to firefighter because he gave Lambert potentially embarrassing  information, including information from documents about overtime pay and  departmental expenditures.  </P> <P> Lambert wanted the information to help persuade the City Council to authorize a  study of whether the county could provide fire services more cheaply than the  city Fire Department, according to testimony from Patriquin and Lambert.  </P> <P> Last year Patriquin filed a suit in Torrance Superior Court against the city  and top Fire Department officials, including Chief Roger Milstead, alleging  that he was demoted for his political activities.  </P> <P> A court commissioner said the suit did not belong in court because Patriquin  had not exhausted efforts to resolve the matter through the Civil Service  Commission.  </P> <P> Patriquin's attorney, Robert H. Swensen, is asking that Patriquin be reinstated  as a fire engineer and awarded an unspecified amount of back pay. He said  Wednesday that the firefighter was demoted for exercising his First Amendment  right to freedom of speech.  </P> <P> The city says he failed a one-year probationary period as an engineer because  he was emotionally unsuited for the job and had a disruptive personality.  </P> <P> During questioning by Richard Terzian, an attorney representing the city,  Patriquin acknowledged that briefly in the fall of 1987 he was suicidal.  </P> <P> In an interview later, Swensen said Patriquin was upset because of overwhelming  pressure and harassment from his superiors, who didn't want the county taking  over the city's fire services.  </P> <P> Swenson said the city's demotion of Patriquin under those circumstances is  similar to "shoot(ing) someone and then claim(ing) that the person can't do the  job because he is injured."  </P> <P> During the proceedings, Lambert testified that she sought the information from  Patriquin because she thought the city would save money by having the county  provide fire services. She said she went to Patriquin because she felt that  then-Chief Ralph Hardin was reluctant to provide information that could have  been led to the dismantling of the Fire Department.  </P> <P> At the time, there was a citywide debate about the most cost-effective way to  provide fire and paramedic services. The council voted 3 to 2 in December,  1988, against conducting the study.  </P> <P> During questioning from Terzian on Wednesday, Patriquin said he gave Lambert  the information because he also felt that the city could save money by having  the county run fire services in Hawthorne. But he said his superior officers  opposed the idea, so he passed the information to Lambert secretly.  </P> <P> One of his clandestine transfers ended on an embarrassing note, according to  testimony from Tom Worldy, a longtime friend of Patriquin.  </P> <P> Worldy said he got his arm stuck in the mail slot at Lambert's house when he  tried to deliver a package of information from Patriquin, who was hiding in  Worldy's truck at the time.  </P> <P> "How far was your arm stuck?" asked Terzian.  </P> <P> "Up to here," Worldy said, pointing to his forearm.  </P> <P> "But you got it out, right?" asked Terzian.  </P> <P> "Yes, I was able to retrieve it," Worldy responded with a grin.  </P> <P> The hearing, which has gone through two sessions, is expected to end at the end  of this month. The next session is Thursday.  </P></p>

Consequently, substantive advances have been scored in some  major fields of reform and opening to the outside world.  <H5>  Early Results Seen From Implementation of "The Regulations" </H5>   As of the end of June, the "Implementation Methods" were  fully inaugurated in every province, municipality, and  autonomous region. Of the 28 associated regulations drawn up by  State Council agencies, six have been promulgated, four have  been countersigned, seven have been forwarded for examination,  and 11 are awaiting forwarding for examination. Eight of the 14  rights to manage their own affairs that "The Regulations" confer  on enterprises have been largely implemented, and four have been  partially implemented, including the right to form partnerships  and merge, the right to assign manpower to jobs, the right to  make investment decisions, and the right to dispose of assets.  Rights that have not been implemented are two: the right to  import and export, and the right to refuse the levying of  assessments. In this process, which has as its goal the  transformation of state-owned enterprises operating mechanisms,  many different methods have been newly tried out. One is the  active and steadfast running of share system trials, the  emphasis of share system transformation being on changing  enterprises' operating mechanisms. Second is enterprises'  further introduction of the competition mechanism, enhancement  of internal management, and intensification of internal reform.  Third is the attraction of foreign investment, practicing  "grafting," bringing a number of enterprises -- particularly a  number of old enterprises -- into the marketplace, and getting a  number of enterprises to emulate the operating mechanism used in  three kinds of partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises,  managing in accordance with customary international practice.  <H3>  New Actions Taken and New Advances Made in Equity Rights  System Reform </H3>   Following the 14th Party Congress, all jurisdictions paid  close attention to the systematization of equity rights  relationships and reform of the equity rights system, their  understanding of the importance of equity rights system reform  becoming increasingly clear, and new actions being taken in the  following regards. 1) Expansion of the scope of share system  pilot projects, selecting nine enterprises for the listing of  shares in Hong Kong, and permitting two enterprises (the  Shanghai Petrochemicals Main Plant and the Qingdao Brewery) to  list shares formally on the Hong Kong Stock Market. 2) Equity  rights trading markets have become livelier with each passing  day. Today, 25 cities in more than 10 provinces throughout the  country have set up or are in process of preparing to set up  equity rights trading markets. 3) Pilot projects have begun to  be run on "state-owned, civilian-operated," and "publicly owned,  privately operated" management systems in small enterprises.  Results have been pretty good, and the outlook appears good. 4)  Equity rights transfers, enterprise mergers, enterprise  bankruptcies, and the individually and privately operated  economy developed further. Enterprises' organizational  structure was further readjusted.  <H3>  Important Advances in Government Agency Reform and Changes  of Functions </H3>   In order to meet requirements for development of a market  economy, the State Council made some neeeded adjustments of the  functions of some government agencies this year. State Council  government agency reforms are moving ahead across-the board, and  will likely be completed before the end of the year. Encouraged  by the spirit of the 14th Party Congress, great strides were  made, and good results obtained in pilot projects for the reform  of local government agencies, which focused primarily on  government agencies at the county and township level. Now the  scope of these pilot projects has gradually been expanded to  include about one-fifth of the counties in the country. Pilot  projects for reform of government, prefecture, and municipal  agencies have also begun. Inner Mongolia, which is a pilot  project province or region for the reform of local government  agencies throughout the nation, is running agency reform  projects in 86 banners and counties. This is 86 percent of all  banners and counties in the autonomous region. So far, it has  disbanded or merged 1,559 party, government, and mass  organizations in the streamlining of more than 41 percent of  agencies. It has also sent more than 100,000 personnel from  various official agencies and institutions elsewhere, and it has  set up more than 16,200 economic entities of various kinds.  <H3>  Further Increase in Intensity of Price Reform; Greater Speed  in Building Markets </H3>   1) A new situation has occurred in price reform. More than  90  percent of the nation's provinces, directly administered  municipalities, and autonomous regions, more than 280 of its  prefectures and cities, and more than 1,900 of its counties have  deregulated grain and edible oil sale prices. They have also  deregulated, in turn, steel and iron products, and some  government-allocated coal. Means of production on which the  state sets prices number only 25, or approximately 20 percent of  total means of production sales. Only six agricultural products,  or 15 percent of agricultural product sales, remain on which the  state sets prices. The state sets prices on only two industrial  consumer goods, or less than 10 percent of them, and the state  sets prices on fewer than 10 percent of total retail commodity  sales. 2) With the change from the old to the new system, fine  prospects for the building of markets have appeared. A look at  commodity markets shows the development of nearly 80,000 country  fair markets nationwide doing 353 billion yuan worth of business  annually. This is one-fourth of all social commodity sales.  There are more than 3,000 wholesale markets of various kinds.  They include the preliminary formation of crisscrossing  commodity market networks for agricultural and sideline  products, industrial wares used in daily life, and the means of  production. Markets for key elements have also developed to a  certain extent. Some long-term investment markets, short-term  financing markets, and foreign exchange regulation markets have  been established in some large- and medium-sized cities.  Throughout the country, manpower markets, technology markets,  real estate markets, securities markets, and information markets  have been set up that are developing and operating very well.  <H3>  Further Advances in Moving Ahead With the Establishment of  New System Fully Integrated Municipal Reform Pilot Projects </H3>   Following approval by the State Commission for System  Reform,  eight cities including Chongqing, Anshan, Changzhou, Wenzhou,  Yantai, Yanji, Tangshan, and Tongling have become pilot project  cities for completely integrated reforms. These cities are in  process of drawing up fully integrated reform plans as a first  step in taking the lead in the establishment of a socialist  market economy system.  <H3>  Further Appearance of City, Town, and Rural Village Joint  Stock System Enterprises </H3>   1) City and town joint share system enterprises have  developed rapidly. According to incomplete statistics from six  provinces including Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Liaoning, and the  city of Shanghai, as of the end of June 1993, there were more  than 5,000 city and town joint stock system enterprises. 2) The  large scale appearance of rural joint stock share enterprises  has become a major ingredient in rural economic reform that is  indicative of the direction of township and town enterprise  reform, and that marks another important milestone of major  significance in rural reform.  <H3>  Steady Intensification of Foreign Trade System Reform,  Further Widening of the Opening to the Outside World, and  Improvement of the Investment Climate </H3>   First is positive advances in import-export system reform  and  the continued development of foreign trade. Customs statistics  show a 4.4 percent increase over the same period in 1992 in  total exports and a 23.3 percent increase in total imports for  the first half of the year. Second is further development of the  externally oriented economy, notably border trade and foreign  economic and technical cooperation. The Huang He Economic  Cooperation Zone comprised of nine provinces and autonomous  regions along the Huang He, namely Shandong, Henan, Shanxi,  Ningxia, Gansu, Shaanxi, Qinghai Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia  uses to the full the advantages of the seacoast, the river, and  the frontier. This zone has jointly opened 34 land, sea, and air  ports of entry and exit, and it has developed broader  international trade with more than 80 countries and territories  including the Commonwealth of Independent States, the United  States, Japan, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Third is fine prospects  for the development everywhere of three kinds of partially or  wholly foreign-owned enterprises. Statistics from Jiangsu,  Zhejiang, and Shanghai show more than 7,600 new enterprises  built with foreign investment in the Chang Jiang Delta between  January and May 1993, and a contractual foreign investment of $8  billion, which is between three and four times the amount for  the same period in 1992. Fourth is continued expansion of the  area opened to the outside world. The State Council has recently  approved the operation of foreign owned commercial retail  businesses in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Dalian,  Qingdao and the five special economic zones, and it has issued  companion policy regulations. In addition, it has approved 23  cities and counties in Inner Mongolia and Henan as areas open to  foreigners, thereby bringing to 919 the number of cities and  counties in China that are opening to the outside world. State  Council approved economic and technical development zones now  number 30. Fifth is the active movement into internal and  domestic markets of cities along the Chang Jiang.  <H5>  In-depth Advances in Social Security System Reform </H5>   1) New advances have been made in reform of the old age  insurance system. Currently, more than 500,000 enterprises of  all kinds nationwide, more than 85 million staff members and  workers, and more than 17 million retired or separated personnel  are enrolled in retirement plans. More than 60 million staff  members in twenty-two provinces and cities make individual  contributions to basic old age insurance. More than 500,000  staff members and workers in more than 600 enterprises are  enrolled in enterprise supplementary old age insurance pilot  projects. Sixty-five cities and counties are reforming their  basic old age fund calculation methods. 2) Industrial accident  insurance system reform pilot projects are expanding steadily.  In addition to provincewide reforms in Guangdong and Hainan  provinces, more than 390 cities and counties, and more than 6.5  million people in Liaoning, Jilin, Jiangxi, Fujian, Sichuan,  Hubei, Henan, and Shandong provinces are participating in  industrial accident insurance reform pilot projects. 3) Medical  insurance system reforms are being carried out everywhere. More  than 80 percent of all enterprises in the country have  instituted reforms of various kinds.  <H5>  Further Improvement of Economic Laws and Regulations </H5>   China has accelerated the economic legislation pace during  the year, a number of laws, regulations and documents of a  regulatory nature appearing one after another. As of the end of  June, the NPC Standing Committee had passed several important  regulations such as "Amendment of the People's Republic of China  Constitution," the "People's Republic of China Product Quality  Law," and "Supplementary Provisions Pertaining to the Punishment  of Falsification of Registered Trademark." A number of laws and  regulations such as the "Corporation Law," the "Securities Law,"  and the "Law Against Unfair Competition" will shortly be sent to  the NPC Standing Committee for deliberation. During the first  half of the year nearly 20 State Council administrative  regulations and documents of a regulatory nature were published,  including "Interim Regulations on the Issuance of Stocks and  Exchange Control," "Unemployment Insurance Regulations for Staff  Members and Workers in State-Owned Enterprises," "Regulations on  the Placement of Redundant Staff Members and Workers of  State-Owned Enterprises," "Peoples Republic of China National  Currency Export and Import Control Methods," "State Council  Circular Notice on Resolutely Halting Indiscriminate Fund  Raising and Greater Control Over Bond Issues," and "State  Council Circular Notice on Hastening Grain Circulation System  Reform." Some of the circular notices that the State Commission  on System Reform drafted titled, "Regulations Controlling  Shareholdings by Staff Members and Workers in Directional  Capital Raising Shareholding Companies Ltd.," "Checking  Irregular Methods Whereby Staff Members of Fixed Collection  Ltd., Liability Corporations Hold Shares," "Futures Markets  Trial Measures," and "Interim Regulations for City and Town  Joint Stock Enterprises," will be issued in the near future. The  views of agencies concerned are being urgently solicited on some  of these. The pace and rhythm of Eighth NPC Standing Committee  legislation will quicken greatly. Plans call for the shaping of  an overall framework for a socialist market economy legal system  during the five-year plan period.  <H3>  Work on Designing an "Overall Program for the Building of a  Socialist Market Economy System" Moving Along Smoothly </H3>   The State Commission on System Reform is currently working  on  further revisions and improvement of the "Program."    In addition to the aforementioned progress, particularly  arresting is the CPC Central Committee and State Council  decisions of the past several months on the intensification of  reform, and the strengthening and improvement of macroeconomic  regulation and control of the national economy, using mostly  economic means to solve difficulties and problems that have  risen in economic development, which have achieved initial  results. They have systematically and completely studied  problems in accelerating the building of a socialist market  economy system, focusing on the study of coordinated reform  measures in the fields of finance and banking, government  finance, taxation, state-owned assets control, the investment  system, and the foreign trade system. Major reforms have been  made in these regards recently.    In summary, during 1993, the reform situation throughout the  country has been good. It has developed in a healthy way. Some  problems do exist, however, principal of which are the  following: 1) Unevenness in implementation of "the Regulations."  2) Continuation of the problem of a hiatus between reform and  development, some places still failing to concentrate their main  attention on the intensification of reform. 3) Mindlessness in  the building of markets. Some places care only about the number  of markets they build without caring about their quality.  Second, market regulation and policy measures lag. The building  of markets is not very regularized. It is disorderly and  authority is monopolized. Regions and departments act in  isolation, and failure to act according to market laws,  competition laws, and the laws of value is widespread. 4)  Macroeconomic system reform lacks intensity, and the  macroeconomic operating environment is becoming increasingly  tight. More serious attention must be given to these  difficulties and problems. Reform must be further intensified, a  socialist market economy system and an economic legal system  consistent with a market economy must be built to produce a  solution.</p>

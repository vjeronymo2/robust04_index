			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Syndicated Loans: Turkish borrowers regain confidence TURKISH borrowers have returned to the syndicated loans market now that the Gulf war is over and Turkey is no longer considered an unacceptable risk. Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri - known as Tupras - is close to completing arrangements for a Dollars 100m one-year import financing facility to cover oil imports from Saudi Arabia, China, the Soviet Union, Abu Dhabi and Algeria. Sumitomo Bank, the agent, claims that participating banks have subscribed Dollars 160m and will consequently have to be scaled back. The fact that pricings are much higher now than they were before the Gulf war has not deterred Turkish borrowers, most of whom were unable to tap the syndicated loans market during the Middle East conflict. For the Tupras deal, the margin over the London interbank offered rate is 65 basis points, and the participation fees range from 20 basis points for Dollars 10m to 10 basis points for Dollars 1m. Sumitomo arranged a similar Dollars 100m financing for Tupras last year but  -as an indication of how prices have soared in the intervening period - the margin over Libor then was 37.5 basis points and the top participation fee was 10 basis points. The credit facility has been underwritten by Sumitomo Bank, Banque Indosuez and Girozentrale Vienna. Interestingly, about a quarter of the financing has come from Japanese banks (regional banks and smaller city banks). Many Japanese banks have stayed away from the syndicated loans market in recent months as they are concerned about their ability to meet the Basle international capital adequacy requirements. However, the fact that the Tupras deal is guaranteed by the Turkish government means that it carries a zero weighting for capital adequacy under BIS proposals and hence is more attractive. The Tupras deal comes hot on the heels of a one-year Dollars 100m facility for Turkiye Is Bankasi, Turkey's largest privately-owned commercial bank, through Chase Investment Bank. Ram dis Ticaret, Turkey's leading trading house, is also borrowing in the syndicated loans market through Manufacturers Hanover, although terms have not been disclosed. Bankers expect other Turkish corporations to return to the syndicated loan market soon and to extend the length of their loans. Those Turkish borrowers that have returned to the market so far have tapped the short end of the market and arranged one-year loans. At the moment, many banks are pulling back from the long end of the syndicated loan market in general, preferring five-year loans to seven-year loans for example. However, bankers expect Turkish corporations to gradually start borrowing medium-term again as they did in the days before Iraq invaded Kuwait. The Minerals Marketing Corporation of Zimbabwe has arranged a Dollars 75m trade facility through ANZ Merchant Bank, Standard Chartered, Barclays, Credit Suisse and Union Bank of Switzerland. The interest margin over Libor is 87.5 basis points while the maximum front-end fee is 60 basis points and the commitment fee on the undrawn balance is 50 basis points. The facility is intended to cover the import of machinery and spare parts. Zimbabwe's mining sector has been hampered by a shortage of foreign exchange.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              EUROMARKET TURNOVER (DOLLARS M)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Primary Market                 Straights     Conv        FRN       Other US Dollars          812.1    249.0       85.0    15,159.3 Prev              2,265.1      0.0       66.0    13,618.7 Other             2,614.2    284.7        8.9     8,120.6 Prev              3,026.5    123.9      264.9     5,976.3 Secondary Market US Dollars       23,033.3   1,151.4   6,714.9     9,920.8 Prev             20,405.3     814.1   5,765.6     8,241.9 Other            39,089.6   1,603.9   5,219.0    45,111.6 Prev             32,351.2   1,283.6   4,549.7    53,297.5                       Cedel      Euroclear        Total US Dollars         19,937.5       37,188.3     57,125.8 Prev               16,791.7       34,385.0     51,176.7 Other              43,290.9       58,761.6    102,052.5 Prev               38,765.5       62,108.1    100,873.6 Week to   May 2,1991  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: AIBD  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

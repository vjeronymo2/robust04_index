			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: GEC at peak Recent buying of GEC, the UK's flagship electronics group, gathered momentum yesterday, driving the share price up to a record 338p. Just before the close of trading they came off the top to end a net 4 1/2 up at 337 1/2 p. Turnover was a good 6.9m shares. A hefty buying order, reportedly from a single large US institution, was driving the stock higher yesterday. Electronics specialists said GEC was one of only a handful of top quality UK stocks, mostly among the utilities, offering above-average dividend growth and a strong balance sheet. GEC is scheduled to announce preliminary results on June 30, and analysts expect profits in the region of Pounds 870m, up more than 5 per cent and a 7 per cent increase in the dividend total.</p>

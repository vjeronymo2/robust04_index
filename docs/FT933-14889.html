			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / In search of the urban idyll: There is a new spirit of civic entrepreneurship in Europe's cities Just before the International Olympic Committee meets in Monte Carlo in September to choose where to stage the 2000 games, a trade mission from north-west England plans to fly to Paris. The idea is to take advantage of the publicity surrounding Manchester's Olympic bid. Members of the mission, put together by Manchester Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the accountants, lawyers, bankers and business advisers who make up the city's Financial and Professional Forum, will be talking to their opposite numbers in the Paris chamber about doing more business together. Such marketing is part of a new age of civic entrepreneurship in Europe, according to Professor Michael Parkinson, director of the European Institute for Urban Affairs at Liverpool John Moores University. He says it started less than 10 years ago, with several of Europe's old cities fighting back against what was widely seen as terminal decline. Public and private sectors have banded together, sometimes informally, sometimes through organisations formed to promote the cities they depend on for a living. All have pushed cities rather than regions, and broad economic development rather than solutions to specific urban social problems. Parkinson's institute - which used to be the Centre for Urban Studies at Liverpool University, but negotiated a transfer to the more entrepreneurial 'Liverpool John' last year - has recently completed a three-year study of 24 cities for the European Commission*. One of the most telling examples is Hamburg. In 1985 its chamber of commerce and 10 leading banks set up the Hamburg Business Development Corporation to attract new companies and improve support for existing ones. Target sectors were the media, information technology, electronics, aviation, medicine, biotechnology, harbour services and environmental technologies. Urda Martens-Jeebe, the corporation's director, says its first five years brought in 387 new companies: 81 from Germany, the rest from Scandinavia, Taiwan, China, the UK, Japan, Korea and the US. The corporation acted as consultant to 769 businesses. She says an estimated 16,000 jobs were created and capital investment of DM3.7bn (Pounds 1.45bn) boosted construction. Other cities have used particular events as a focus for team-building. Manchester's Olympic bid is an example. According to KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountant, Manchester's bid will be worth Pounds 200m to the city even if the bid fails. Last week, Ogden, a leading US entertainment management group, signed a 20-year contract to run the Manchester arena from its opening in 1995. The group will create more than 700 jobs in the city. Other cities behaving in an entrepreneurial manner include: Rotterdam's development board, Rotor, a joint venture of the municipality and the chamber of commerce. It works as a think-tank, helping to balance social concerns such as poor housing with economic solutions. The city's publicly owned port authority modernised the docks and improved the local transport infrastructure. Parallel investment in office space by the private sector during the 1980s has been justified by annual growth of up to 10 per cent in the numbers employed in professional services. A 'brainpark' for small, high-technology companies was set up near a university. Dortmund's civic leaders developed closer ties with the private sector after a large factory closure in 1981. As a result, the emphasis switched from social to economic priorities. Research and development centres for transport technology and robotics were attracted, and a technology transfer system set up between university, polytechnic and the chamber of commerce. Montpellier evolved what it called a 'technopole' strategy in 1985 - a development agency supported by all sectors of the community to focus growth on medicine, computer technology, agronomics, communications and leisure. 'Cities are back on the agenda, not as basket cases but as economic leaders,' Parkinson says. 'Cities have to be re-evaluated. They need to be recognised again as the wealth of nations. They are great sources of added value. In Europe, there is an emerging network of cities with similar entrepreneurial outlooks.' He suggests the most successful entrepreneurial cities are those which have defined themselves as European, rather than by their regional or national role. Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham, Rotterdam, Hamburg, Barcelona, Lyons, Lille, Dortmund, Stuttgart, Frankfurt and Milan are all examples. Many have started forming trans-European networks. For example, Rotterdam Port Promotions Council, backed by most Netherlands businesses dependent on trade through the Maas estuary, has been touring Europe this year to build contacts and seek out business. It stresses Rotterdam's 'gateway' role to Europe's road, rail and inland waterway freight networks. Another example is Manchester, which has joined an association of similar regional capitals that have developed as financial centres in their own right, shaking off the domination of their countries' capital cities. Manchester boasts more than 50 banks from around the world and a 50-strong venture capital community. There is also a group of 100 corporate finance advisers that offers 'mini merchant banking' for medium-sized companies, acting in mergers, acquisitions and disposals. Their fee income is running at more than Pounds 20m a year. Other cities in the group include Barcelona, Bilbao, Turin, Stuttgart, Lyons and Edinburgh. A network of successful cities, therefore, seems to be emerging across Europe, with each a focus for growth and regional economic hegemony. Even the urban population decline of the 1970s and 1980s is slowing as old cities bounce back. Parkinson says: 'After 15 years of decline, at some point in the mid-1980s, big cities started to grow again, or at the very least, they started stabilising. The trend is solid and is reversing the former outward drift of population. We are developing a Europe of the cities, not a Europe of the regions.' One problem of such patchwork economic development is that benefits are not evenly distributed between cities, within them, or between cities and the regions around them. In some cases, inequalities are emerging between neighbours. Marseilles, for example, has not developed a coherent strategy like Montpellier and, Parkinson says, lags in economic development. Liverpool similarly lags behind Manchester, only 35 miles away. This is partly because it is smaller, with a less diverse economic base. One in six men traditionally earns a living through manual work. Male unemployment rates of about 25 per cent have fuelled internal divisions in the city and - for 10 years to 1991 - caused image-damaging political strife. Only this year have public and private sectors set up an office to work together - seven or eight years behind comparable cities. Even within successful cities, individual beneficiaries are mainly educated, qualified or trained people. Parkinson warns: 'You have a polarised labour market, overlaid with the problems of ethnic minorities and immigrants. Some people are being excluded. We found that Hamburg has more millionaires than anywhere else in Europe, but more people on welfare. One of the key challenges of the next couple of decades will be how to include the excluded. Another will be how to improve a city's competitiveness without increasing the social cost.' One problem for the European Community is that it allocates funds for economic development on the basis of reducing regional imbalances. But this means two cities with similar problems are treated differently because of their geographical location. If the Europe of the cities thesis proves correct, it may require some shift in the way the EC targets its regional aid. But the bigger implication is that, as cities compete in the way that corporations do, the case for better urban government, capable of taking a long view about investment in infrastructure and human resources, will become ever more irresistible. *Urbanisation and the Functions of Cities in the European Community, EC, Luxembourg, Ecu13.</p>

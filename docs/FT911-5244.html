			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Observer: Still going One of the more remarkable things about US money managers is how many of the go-go investors of the swinging Sixties are still hanging around. Last week's seizure of Los Angeles-based Executive Life, which has shaken the US insurance world, has focused attention on one of the great survivors: 60-year-old Fred Carr. A veteran of the Ira Haupt-salad oil fiasco of the early 1960s, he used to run the Enterprise Fund which for a while was one of the hottest mutual funds around. He then moved into the more conservative world of insurance in the early 1970s. His recent problems stemmed from the fact that he bought too many junk bonds from the late Drexel Burnham Lambert. Although no one has heard of Bernie Cornfeld for a long time, several of Carr's con- temporaries are still around. Admittedly, Gerry Tsai's star has never shone as brightly again as it did in the 1960s, but Fred Alger has an above-average record and Howard Stein, of Dreyfus fund managers, is a pillar of respectability.</p>

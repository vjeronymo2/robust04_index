The two countries have experienced tensions in the past  created by the civil war on the PNG island of Bougainville, on  the Solomon's border. PNG military forces on several occasions  crossed into Solomon's territory and opened fire on Solomon's  villages.    Saemala returned here Friday from a United Nations  Development Programme [UNDP] funded study tour of Torres Strait  Islands, an Australian territory near PNG.    Saemala said the UNDP told him it was willing to fund  technical aspects of an initiative taken by the government here  to seek a lasting peace on the border with PNG.    Negotiations on the treaty will start after the technical  aspects here are finalised.</p>

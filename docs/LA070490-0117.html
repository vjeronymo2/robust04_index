			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HOLIDAY HAIR-RAISING EXPERIENCE FOR PETS  </P> <P> The loud bangs and bright lights of the Fourth of July might be fun for people,  but they can be petrifying for cats and dogs.  </P> <P> "This is the busiest time of year for us because of fireworks," said Kevin  Whelan, acting chief of field services for the Orange County Animal Control  Department.  </P> <P> "The noise causes a lot of emotional distress for the animals."  </P> <P> On the Fourth, the department is traditionally overwhelmed with calls about  missing pets and others being hit by cars, Whelan said. "The following day  we're still swamped because the animals are still at large," he said.  </P> <P> To make the Fourth a safe and sane holiday for pets, animal experts advise  owners to keep cats and dogs inside and make sure their identification tags are  current.  </P> <P> "If you put them in the back yard, they're liable to go over the fence or under  the fence and run away," said Debi Hall, assistant director at the Humane  Society of Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> If owners know that their pets are frightened by fireworks, they can get mild  tranquilizers from their veterinarian, Hall said. Placing the animals in  transfer cages, crates or dog runs will also help calm them, Whelan said.  </P> <P> Carl Pagano, Irvine Animal Services superintendent, suggests that owners leave  their pets with friends or relatives if they will be gone during the evening.  </P> <P> "It's tough if the animals are home alone after dark, when the fireworks  typically start," Pagano said.

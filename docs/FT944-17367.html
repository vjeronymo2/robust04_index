			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / International Company News: ITT expected to take majority stake in Ciga ITT, the US conglomerate which owns the Sheraton hotel chain, is expected to announce early next week it has a majority stake in Ciga, the Italian luxury hotels group, following an agreed bid, writes Andrew Hill in Milan. Sources said yesterday the US group could end up with as much as 55 per cent of Ciga, ending a year-long struggle for full control of the troubled hotels group. The ITT offer closed on Friday night and details of the outcome should be disclosed after the weekend. ITT already owns 35.25 per cent of Ciga.</p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / How To Spend It: Make your own necklace Making my own necklaces has not been the kind of occupational therapy that I have ever aspired to. But Janet Coles sells beads of such beauty and diversity that she could tempt me. Her mail order brochure is beautifully produced - the beads presented in an ordered fashion with plenty of ideas for creating necklaces, jewellery and bracelets, writes Lucia van der Post. You do not need to be a Flintstones fan to appreciate the latest collection  -all ancient stones, prehistoric-style pendants and neolithic-style necklaces. Necklaces shown here can all be made with materials bought from Janet Coles - either by mail order (Perdiswell Cottage, Bilford Road, Worcester, WR3 8QA, 0905- 755888) or from her shop, Janet Coles Bead Emporium, 128 Notting Hill Gate, London W11. Pendants in kit form are Pounds 5, made-up about Pounds 7. Chunky necklaces cost between Pounds 9.95 and Pounds 21 in kits, and Pounds 13.50-Pounds 25 made-up.</p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (4): Crucial role in the local economy - At the latest count, 76 institutions held funds on deposit totalling Pounds 27bn, / Banking FROM a distance, St Julian's Avenue in St Peter Port, Guernsey, looks like a main road near the centre of any British town. Close up, there is one vital difference which highlights the crucial role of banking to the local economy. It is the names above the entrances of the modern offices gleaming with brass nameplates. Almost without interruption, there are signs for Baring Brothers, Bermuda House, NM Rothschild, Hambro House, Hamilton House and Lazard House. In between are scattered a few accountants and law firms. Five minutes' walk away, on the other side of the town, is an even more recent and potent symbol of the astonishing concentration of banks on the island. On the harbour front are the newly-completed, low-rise, granite-faced offices of Credit Suisse, rumoured to have cost Pounds 10m. Mr Roland Hurni-Gosman, the bank's managing director, has great confidence in future business from Guernsey. Privately, he has said he intends to take 25 per cent of market share. Publicly, he says he plans to increase his 170 staff by a further 40 in the next five years, while computerisation will increase productivity still further in the same period. The growth of banking on Guernsey is staggering. Aside from the high street clearers, the first banks arrived in the early 1960s, with Kleinworts, then Rothschild and Hambros. At the latest count, there were 76 institutions holding funds on deposit totalling some Pounds 27bn. The largest number from a single country was the UK, but that is now just half of the total, with many from the rest of Europe and others from across the world. There are nine from Switzerland alone. The recession has certainly had an impact. Several banks have left in the past two years. 'The finance sector has not had the greatest time,' says Mr Hurni-Gosman. 'People have become more cost conscious. But we have gone one way, and that's up.' The same message comes from Mr Tim Betley, managing director of the Royal Bank of Canada. 'Business is flowing in,' he says. 'One of the beauties of this business is that the offshore game survives on uncertainties.' The Guernsey authorities have been keen to avoid permitting the creation of pure 'brassplate' or 'cubicle' banks which have no meaningful presence in Guernsey. But in the past two years they have actively encouraged the formation of 'managed' or 'administered' banks. Bank of Bermuda, Canadian Bank of Commerce and Credit Suisse are among those which manage a presence of other banks on their behalf. Staff will answer one set of phones in the name of their own bank and a second set in the name of the managed bank. Some do all the work on behalf of the managed bank. Others have a skeleton staff, while leaving the main Guernsey bank to carry out backroom operations. That provides a base allowing new banks a chance to sample the prospect of operating on the islands with low overheads and less risk while they experiment. More important from the perspective of the authorities, managed banks provide Guernsey with extra business and additional tax revenues without putting additional strain on the local workforce. Regulation in Guernsey is very much in the tradition of the Bank of England, with an emphasis on flexibility and frequent contact. The island has been able to focus on the top end of the market and exclude other banks which it does not like. 'We are careful who we let in,' says Mr Peter Crook, the banking supervisor. 'New banks have got to improve our reputation.' He says he only accepts those which are well capitalised, highly profitable and with an international parent in the top 500 banks worldwide. He is looking for banks which are safe, produce revenues for the island and do not place strains on the workforce. 'We expect them to make a profit of at least Pounds 500,000 within three years,' says Mr Crook. 'We want the maximum profits with the minimum number of people.' Others - which Mr Crook estimates at about six to eight a year - are politely told that it would not be worth their while making a formal application to operate on the island. Fear of negative publicity has so far prevented any from pursuing their claims for admission through the courts. Regulators are particularly proud of one bank that failed to gain entry  - the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, which applied to open a branch in the late 1970s. Officials turned it away as a result of knowledge of its reputation, and lack of information on both its ownership and its control through holding companies in the Caymans and Luxembourg. Regulation has tightened over the years. Since the closure of Barnett Christie in the late 1970s, the Commission has not permitted any indigenous banks to operate in Guernsey. The only one which does not have a separate parent is Hanson bank, backed by Lord Hanson's business empire. Tougher capital adequacy requirements were introduced in the mid 1980s. As a result, Mr John Roper, head of the Commission, says fresh rules - such as a new banking law currently being discussed - are more a response to the need to appear well-regulated than any inherent need for improvements.</p>

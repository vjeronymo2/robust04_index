Ministers firmly believe that  other members of the United Nations should first be asked to  contribute if extra forces are required to enforce a peace  accord in Sarajevo.    Britain, the second largest contributor of forces in the  former Yugoslavia after France, is already concerned at the  open-ended nature of the humanitarian operation. Although a  wide range of Army units has been "earmarked" to reinforce the  2,300-strong British contingent, none has been placed on short  notice to move. Despite the soaring tension following NATO's  10-day ultimatum to the Serbs to pull back artillery units from  Sarajevo, Britain does not believe reinforcements are necessary  at this stage.    Units which could be deployed in an emergency if the Serbs  launched large-scale retaliatory attacks for air strikes include  an infantry battalion with Saxon armoured personnel carriers and  an artillery regiment. The battery of six 105mm light guns,  which was returned to Britain last June after five months  sitting off the Croatian coast, remains on notice and could be  flown out to the region.    "There are a wide range of capabilities which have been  earmarked to reinforce British troops if required depending on  the situation but we are not prepared to discuss numbers, units  or specific capabilities," said the Ministry of Defence.</p>

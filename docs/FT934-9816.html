			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Better way of managing than cults Sir, Christopher Lorenz still cannot make up his mind whether the religion of business re-engineering and the arrival of the 'horizontal' organisation are good things. (Management, November 5). It is undoubtedly of consummate interest to those 'high priests' to whom Mr Lorenz refers, who occupy themselves by writing or talking about how other people's businesses should change. However, is it really of interest to the stakeholders in a 'staid' building society? Our customers (as consumers) care about decently priced products backed by professional and friendly service. As members, they expect cost-effectiveness and financial strength. Employees want challenging and rewarding jobs and like to be kept informed about the business. Our regulators insist on prudent management and clear controls. The government enjoys the tax derived from our increasing profits, and that 'bottom line' is important to credit rating agencies too. So does it matter what adjective is used to describe organisational structure? I suspect big businesses end up with a 'mixed bag' which adapts over time, but that is uninspiring phraseology for anybody trying to justify a new religion. However, quietly managing that 'mixed bag' to deliver improved business results will perhaps attract more believers in the long run than some of the new management cults which are strong on hype but patently unproven in performance terms.

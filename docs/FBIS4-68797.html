			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "New Party, New Public Committee..."] </F>   [Text] The Russian opposition is striving for solidarity  and unity of action. That is how one might describe the main  idea of the three significant assemblies of political leaders  and the public that took place in Moscow on 16, 17, and 18 April.    The strengthening of the position of the Union of Officers  explains not only its congress but also the direct participation  in the congress of the Russian Great Power Party and the  constituent conference of the Public Committee for Legality and  Popular Rule of many representatives from regional divisions of  this organization.    The documents and resolutions of the congresses earmark  actively influencing the political life of Russia, and the  Declaration of the Public Committee discusses the need to  protect the rights of citizens of Russia from any forms of  violence and discrimination.    The leader of the Union of Officers, Stanislav Terekhov, was  elected chairman of the Russian Great Power Party.    The Public Committee for Legality and Popular Rule was  headed  by State Duma Deputy Yuriy Vlasov.    Participating in the work of the congresses and conferences  were S. Baburin, V. Ilyukhin, V. Isakov, E. Volodin, and a  number of key politicians of the Russian opposition movement.</p>

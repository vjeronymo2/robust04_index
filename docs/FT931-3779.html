			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 2,900 resists the profit-takers WHAT should have been no more than the widely-predicted pre-Budget shakeout in the UK equity market was intensified yesterday by nervousness over political developments in Russia and in Hong Kong. A market already generally depressed took a turn for the worse in mid-afternoon when the Dow Average opened 50 points down, and the FT-SE Index dipped to within five points of the 2,900 mark. However, there was little sign of significant selling pressure and London staged a comfortable rally in late dealings as the equity market moved into the new trading account. The final loss of 37.5 left the FT-SE Index at 2,915.9, but dealers showed little concern at the day's setback. 'Not a bad performance, for the last day of the account ahead of the Budget,' commented a senior dealer at a US securities house. Monday morning will bring a heavy batch of ex dividend adjustments to share prices, and dealers are already under orders to keep trading positions in restraint until Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, has ended his Budget speech on Tuesday afternoon. Nevertheless, yesterday saw a heavy setback as profits were taken. Banks, insurances, electricals suffered significant selling pressure and Hong Kong-orientated shares fell on the adverse political developments there. This week has featured a heavy list of trading statements from leading UK companies as well as unexpected developments among blue chip pharmaceuticals and a decline in global oil prices. Yesterday's setback eliminated gains achieved over the week, leaving the FT-SE Index 6.2 down on the week. But over the two-week equity account, the Footsie has gained about 1.7 per cent as increasing confidence in a recovery in the UK economy has taken the stock market to successive new peaks. Seaq volume slipped to 769.3m shares yesterday from the 821.9m recorded in the previous session. Around 66 per cent of yesterday's Seaq business was in non-Footsie stocks, slightly higher than recent daily averages as profits were taken across the market range. Retail business has remained high this week, returning values of Pounds 1.65bn on Thursday and Pounds 1.61bn on Wednesday. UK government bonds opened higher and made further progress in the second half of the session in spite of a dull tone in US bonds. But London dealers said that gilts had been influenced chiefly by internal market pressures and that prices had risen yesterday in response to the disappearance of a recent big seller.</p>

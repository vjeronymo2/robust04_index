			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Usinor forges stronger case for sell-off - State-owned French steel group is showing benefit of restructuring Mr Francis Mer, chairman of Usinor Sacilor, has twice wrested Europe's biggest steel maker back from daunting losses - after 1986, when he took the helm of France's sprawling steel concern, and over the past six months. This time he is determined that recovery will be permanent. Yesterday's first-half results showed a remarkable rebound to a net profit of FFr471m (USDollars 92m) after losses of a staggering FFr5.7bn for all of 1993. The state-owned group's chairman is optimistic, if not yet satisfied. 'We must be in a position to stay in the black through the next downturn in the industry cycle.' There is much at stake. Evidence of a sustainable recovery will prepare the way for privatisation of the steel concern, which is one of 21 public sector companies already sold or scheduled for sale by the centre-right government of prime minister Mr Edouard Balladur. Privatisation would give the company access to the financial resources needed for expansion. 'The state can no more be a good shareholder,' says Mr Mer. 'It does not have the money for industry.' The first-half transformation is an important step towards Mr Mer's objective. It partly reflects the impact of exceptional gains, in particular the FFr900m received as a result of the flotation of a 40 per cent stake in Ugine, the stainless steel division. However, the recovery is also the result of the revival in the international steel industry following two years of deep recession, and of the benefits of the company's restructuring and cost-cutting measures. Since 1986, when Mr Mer faced the task of merging the loss-making Usinor and Sacilor steel makers, the headcount has fallen steadily. The workforce has dropped from 95,750 in 1989 to about 68,000 at the end of last year. Productivity has risen from 5.1 man hours a ton in 1986 to less than three hours a ton today. For Mr Mer, the productivity and cost-cutting measures are set to continue. So is the recovery in profits. 'We have experienced further progress in the second half, and I think that 1995 will be a good year.' Sustained recovery beyond the current upswing in the steel market, however, requires further reshaping. 'Some parts of the business are really problematic,' says Mr Martin Doble, director of Beddows &amp; Co, a consultancy for the steel industry. He, and many others, believe the problems centre on Usinor's long products business, comprising wires and steel for engineered products. It is a fiercely competitive activity. A bigger burden lies in the group's indebtedness. A series of acquisitions in the late 1980s, including that of Jones &amp; Laughlin, the second-biggest stainless steel maker in the US, saddled Usinor Sacilor with debts of FFr24bn at the end of 1993. The threat is compounded by the recent rise in interest rates. These weak points are not lost on Mr Mer. While he defends his acquisition spree in the 1980s, which he says gave the group the necessary presence in production and marketing, he has been curbing debt. The flotation of Ugine, and asset sales, have reduced debts to about FFr20bn. For the first time in four years, debt stands below the value of the company's equity. The Usinor chairman is also making progress at the company's problem businesses. The long products division has undergone a substantial restructuring and is now entering the final phase. A more efficient plant has been constructed, including a mini mill at Gandrange in eastern France which started production in July. Last week, Usinor Sacilor announced it was negotiating the sale of SAM, its steel reinforcements business, to ASW of the UK. The sale of SAM would mark an important step in reorganising the group's activities, a process Mr Mer believes is nearing completion. 'By mid-1995 we should be in the shape that we are seeking,' he says. The shape of the international steel industry as a whole, however, is less certain. Just as Usinor was blighted by overcapacity and recession in 1992 and 1993, so are its fortunes still hostage to the broader environment. Mr Mer believes progress has been achieved in the European Commission's restructuring plan, even though he has been a fierce critic of subsidies to Spanish, German and Italian producers. 'To a non-European it must seem like a crazy way of managing an industry, allowing subsidies to obstruct necessary capacity reduction.' He is irked by subsidies because his company has reduced its own net capacity of laminates by 1.2m tons since 1987 without the help of state subsidies. 'I could have asked for subsidies of FFr8bn last year,' he says. But, he argues, that would have undermined his philosophy at Usinor and sent the wrong signal to managers and workers. 'Besides,' he says with a grin, 'the French government would have said 'no'.' In spite of his chagrin at state aid to rivals, Mr Mer believes Europe's restructuring efforts have yielded results. 'We will probably see a reduction of about 15m tons of capacity, rather than the 19m targeted. But that is still significant.' It is also, he believes, enough for now. 'Capacity utilisation is very high. All of Europe's big steel producers will report profits next year. So I don't think it necessary to have further capacity cuts at the moment.' Whether more restructuring will be needed, he argues, will depend partly on the policy of the European Union towards imports from eastern Europe, Russia and Ukraine. 'At the moment, western Europe has net steel exports of more than 10m tons a year. If this were to change, because of increased imports or reduced shipments, then capacity would be too high.' It is Ukraine and Russia which are of particular concern. The scale of their capacity dwarfs the potential threat from eastern European countries. In the latter case, he believes western Europe can cope with a gradual opening of the market, presently restricted by quotas, over the next few years. By then, Usinor Sacilor may be on the way to the private sector. Mr Mer is reluctant to suggest the timing for such an operation. But once the redressment is established he does not see obstacles to a sale. For the Usinor chairman, such a move would have little impact on the management of the group. 'We are run like a private sector company. There is no interference from the state,' he says. Nor should the trade unions, which have sought to block other privatisations, pose a threat. 'I think it would not be too hard to convince them, despite their basic instinct that they would like to remain under the umbrella of the state.' The complexities and size of such an operation suggest that privatisation remains some way down the road. Of the routes already being mooted one involves selling stakes in various parts of the company, as was done with Ugine, or the possible flotation of separate activities. It is not an option which finds favour with Mr Mer. The flotation of Ugine, he says, was a one-off. Privatisation, when it comes, should be for the whole group. Having spent the past eight years forging a coherent whole from the rag-bag of assets he inherited, such a reaction is understandable.</p>

			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> Sculptor Max DeMoss finally hits his stride with fragmented classical figures  and equestrian statues that leap and gambol through space. The forms are  beautiful, yet eerily incomplete. Cast in bronze, the forms are piecemeal  constructions rife with mold lines and missing chunks of mass. This  cut-and-paste treatment gives them the spontaneous appearance of quick gesture  drawings done in three dimensions.  </P> <P> As bodies break apart with the objectivity of a window dresser's mannequin, De  Moss plays with the mystique of the bronze-casting process. He deconstructs  some of its physical properties by flaying open the human and animal forms so  that light and space can unravel the solid core. Mass is debunked as a hollow  shell, and form is just a skin of shape jerked hastily over emptiness. With all  that openness, light increasingly becomes an animating force solidifying within  the dark interior. (Wenger Gallery, 828 N. La Brea Ave., to Oct. 24.).  </P></p>

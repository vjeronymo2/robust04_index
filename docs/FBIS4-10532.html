			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jaime Guerrero; from the "Early Morning" </F> newscast; passages within quotation marks are recorded]    [Text] President Salinas said that reforms to Article 27 of  the Constitution do not mean the privatization of the Mexican  countryside. Issuing property titles for the peasants' land is  an act of justice, not an act of alienation. He also said that  ejidos will not be privatized.    [Salinas] "These titles mean justice, not alienation."    He pointed out that two years after Article 27 was amended,  only 38 of the 30,000 Mexican ejidos have requested the full  issuance of property titles to become part of the real estate  market.    [Salinas] "Urban areas are already surrounding those 38  ejidos. Without property titles, their prospects, as Agrarian  Prosecutor Arturo Warman already said, would include only  expropriation or, even worse, invasion and loss of their own  legacy."    Salinas pointed out there currently is a sound possibility  of  overcoming poverty and neglect in the countryside. In short,  the validity of Article 27 was discussed.    [Warman] "We did not find any reason to revise Article 27 of  the Constitution."    Prosecutor Warman said that a reform to Article 27 would  constitute a setback; in addition, the reform lacks the support  of the majority of peasants. He added that only minority groups  are requesting modifications to the article. He also talked  about Chiapas and rejected that legal large estates are  predominantly in the hands of a few individuals.    [Warman] "We will continue to search for legal large  estates,  but I believe that we will find very few."    Warman submitted to the president his second report on the  works of the Agrarian Prosecutor's Office.</p>

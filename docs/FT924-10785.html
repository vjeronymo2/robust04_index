			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Survey of Hungary (4): Down on the farm MULTINATIONALS are not alone in spotting the wider potential for developing Hungary's agricultural assets. Earlier this year Danube Farms, a consortium of UK food processors, retailers, farmers and leisure industry interests acquired a 90-year lease on a former loss-making state farm south of Budapest. It spreads across 22,000 acres of irrigated cropland and traditional Hungarian puszta prairie. Mr Mark Cherrington, the farm's managing director, is a 'hands-on' former UK farmer and Mr Ian Chesterman, in charge of boosting vegetable production, came from growing export vegetables in Zambia. The six-man expatriate management team has the skill and experience to develop the farm as a producer of high quality vegetables and dairy products and as an industrial park for food processors. For potential investors in these areas, says Mr Cherrington, the farm offers a 'hassle-free' entry into the Hungarian market, with plenty of land for industrial development available with less bureaucracy than through conventional channels such as the State Property Agency. The consortium also has property development and leisure industry experience relevant to developing parts of the farm, especially around the protected national park area of the puszta, as a rural resort. The farm already attracts around 15,000 visitors annually for its daily horse show and the new owners plan to expand from the existing small hotel and traditional Hungarian horse riding centre. The consortium's plans to develop clay pigeon shooting, golf driving facilities and a swimming pool are expected to appeal to the growing expatriate community as well as Hungarians. Already, annualised output from the 1,000-strong herd of Holstein milking cows has risen from 5,000 to around 6,500 litres per head and the cost of winter feed has been lowered by early cropping and silaging of 24,000 tons of maize which would have been worth much less if sold in grain form. But the biggest changes are planned for the 10,000 arable acres where high value niche market crops such as peas, sugar, fresh vegetables and soft fruits will largely replace low value bulk crops such as wheat, maize and barley. Only 200 of the original 360 workers are employed on the farm at present but the vegetable farm alone will need about 300 workers in full operation. 'Our main difficulty in three years' time will be finding enough workers', Mr Cherrington says.</p>

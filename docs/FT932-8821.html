			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / O&amp;Y's US lenders become assertive LENDERS to Olympia &amp; York's US properties are becoming increasingly assertive in backing efforts by the developer's US subsidiary to distance itself from its crippled Canadian parent. Citibank applied to a New York court late on Friday for an order giving special powers to Mr John Zuccotti, president of the US subsidiary. The extra powers would enable Mr Zuccotti, a former deputy mayor of New York, to complete transactions relating to O&amp;Y's US buildings without the assent of the administrator of Toronto-based Olympia &amp; York Developments (OYDL). The application reflects tensions which have been building since O&amp;Y filed for bankruptcy protection for its Canadian and UK operations a year ago. The 80 per cent-owned US unit, whose properties include the World Financial Centre in lower Manhattan, has remained afloat while Mr Zuccotti attempts to stitch together a restructuring. Citibank and Sanwa Bank, which are among the largest US creditors, dropped legal action against O&amp;Y last March after the Canadian creditors agreed to name a board with a majority of directors who have no financial stake in the outcome of debt-restructuring negotiations. Among the transactions Mr Zuccotti is anxious to complete are an agreement to defer payment of New York taxes and a plan to transfer control of a building at 60 Broad Street to Mr Li Ka Shing, the Hong Kong magnate.</p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Aluminium (7): As value rises, so does theft / A look at other recent developments The downside to aluminium's high value and recyclability is that it is all too frequently the target for thieves. When prices rise, aluminium beer barrels, road signs and bridge rails - often cut through by power saws - disappear at a growing rate. This represents a real loss for the industry, because these products are usually made from high-quality alloys which would normally be recycled as such. But, after thieves have melted down these products, the alloy is not immediately recognisable, and the metal is sold as the lowest-priced scrap. More important, customers - particularly local authorities - are forced to consider giving up using aluminium and changing to less-tempting materials, even if those materials do not perform as well as aluminium. WAYS TO RECYCLE FOIL Already as much as 70 per cent of the aluminium used in electrical engineering, building and transport is re-used. Aluminium automotive castings are almost entirely made from scrap metal. The industry is now turning its attention to recycling aluminium foil - a tricky business, because a great deal of bulk has to be collected to get any reasonable weight, and 90 per cent of foil is meant to be in contact with food which creates hygiene problems. In the US, Reynolds Metals, the second-largest aluminium group, began testing foil recycling in 1991. Mr Jeremiah Sheehan, Reynolds' president, admits that it is not as commercially necessary for the industry to recycle foil as beverage cans - in the US only 200m lbs (90,700 tonnes) of aluminium is used annually for consumer foil, plus a similar quantity for food and other containers, compared with 4bn lbs (1.8m tonnes) used for cans. 'But recycling helps to identify foil as a green product,' he points out. 'It gives foil an edge over plastics.' In the UK, nearly 40 per cent of aluminium used in packaging (including beverage cans) goes into foil and about 50,000 tonnes of aluminium foil packaging, worth roughly Pounds 15m, is thrown away every year. To recapture at least some of this, an Aluminium Foil Recycling Campaign (AFRC) was started by foil converters Alcan Ekco Packaging, Bowater Foil and Paper Products, and William Garfield, all members of the Aluminium Foil Container Manufacturers Association, with British Alcan Consumer Products. AFRC spent Pounds 200,000 over two years on five pilot schemes, from which it became obvious that foil would not be collected successfully by local authorities working alone, without help from the industry. So the industry has drawn up a 10-year plan which will establish national infrastructure and work towards a 30 per cent recycling target. Typically, schemes provide local authority 'foil bank' systems serviced by a single local charity or group of charities. Banks are located on supermarket or other prime sites. AFRC says the involvement of a local charity provides motivation for the public to give for their own community - clean foil can fetch Pounds 350 a tonne. Schools are also be involved in the collection schemes. The scheme is funded by a voluntary levy of Pounds 10 a tonne from the rolling mills. EDUCATING INDUSTRY Aluminium is a relative newcomer compared with other metals, and manufacturing industry in general remains woefully ignorant about its uses. The European aluminium industry is intends to rectify this with a Dollars 1.5m (Pounds 1m) project aimed at educational institutions and industries that use the metal. Under a European Commission programme known as Comett II, aluminium industries in nine EC and European Free Trade Association countries and 25 universities are setting out to put aluminium on the educational map. The EC is providing about one third of the Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) cost, while the universities are contributing their time. The industry is footing the rest of the bill, mainly through the UK's Aluminium Federation, Germany's Aluminium-Zentrale and SkanAluminium in the Nordic countries. The Aluminium Training Partnership (ATP) provides the link between the industry and the universities. The second, and most important project, is known as Talat, an acronym for Training for Aluminium Application Technologies. Its objective is to produce 150 hours of teaching material covering a broad range of engineering disciplines: material property information on engineering alloys and products; design and calculation of aluminium alloy structures; manufacturing of products; joining techniques and surface technology. For each subject, one or more groups of university partners have been formed, each with specialist contacts in the industry. They aim to produce lectures suitable for courses in nearly all the relevant areas of technical education. In the UK, the Department of Trade and Industry has promised Pounds 132,000 over three years, if the industry will match that pound for pound, for teaching material such as lecture notes and formatted computer disks. GENCOR'S ACT OF FAITH No company has more faith in the future of aluminium than Gencor, the South African resources group, which in July paid Dollars 1.1bn for most of the Royal Dutch/Shell group's mining and minerals assets. These operate mainly under the Billiton banner. About 60 per cent of Billiton's revenues come from its interests in bauxite and alumina, the raw material and intermediate product needed for aluminium production. These interests are located in Australia, where Billiton has 30 per cent of the big Worsley deposit, Brazil and Ireland. Gencor also has a 41 per cent interest in Alusaf, the South African aluminium producer that is completing a Dollars 2bn expansion to increase its annual capacity to 646,000 tonnes, a size not seen outside Russia before. Mr Brian Gilbertson, Gencor's chairman, points out that a combination of Alusaf and the Billiton upstream bauxite and alumina operations would produce the fifth-largest integrated aluminium business in the world. Gencor has in mind floating Billiton or part of the aluminium assets on a stock exchange at some stage. Mr Gilbertson admits that when aluminium prices are low the Billiton deal has little appeal. However, 'at high prices the returns are huge. If our estimate of the medium-term (aluminium) price trends are anywhere near correct, then this parcel of assets will prove to be very valuable and the price we have paid to have been cheap.'</p>

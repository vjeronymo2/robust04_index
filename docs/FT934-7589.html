			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Apec Meets in Seattle: Cool response to proposal for closer ties MINISTERS from Pacific countries appeared last night to be giving a lukewarm response to a set of recommendations for much closer economic co-operation presented by an eminent persons' group. The group, headed by Mr Fred Bergsten, a US economist, submitted its report for consideration at the opening session of the annual ministerial conference of the 15-member Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation grouping. It called for creation over time of a 'true Asia Pacific Economic Community', and asked members to declare immediately 'an ultimate goal of free trade in the Asia Pacific region'. They should agree now that in 1996 they would set a target date and timetable for achieving this goal, it said. The group suggested specific measures to facilitate regional trade including an Apec investment code, a new mechanism for settling trade disputes, regular meetings of officials responsible for macroeconomic policies and co-operation on competition policy including anti-dumping. The report stressed that 'we are not proposing creation of another European Community, with full economic integration and a single internal market, let alone a common currency. We are not even advocating a customs union.' It also said that any regional trade liberalisation had to be consistent with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Nevertheless, the recommendations seemed too far-reaching for many Apec members to swallow. Most prefer a gradual evolution of Apec - now a loose, informal grouping - into something more formal as a consensus for greater co-operation develops. All feel the groups's energies should be concentrated on concluding the Uruguay Round of Gatt. Mr Paul Keating, prime minister of Australia, Apec's keenest advocate, said it 'heartily subscribes' to free trade in the region. 'But just how to get there and by what time is a subject which in my view is too early to determine.' Japan's reaction was similarly mixed. Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister, told ministers the report should be 'put to good use' to strengthen Apec. However, members should 'give due consideration to the diverse stages of development among the region's economies. Co-operation should be promoted incrementally.' Mr TH Chau, Hong Kong's secretary for trade and industry, said the concept of an Asia Pacific Community was 'as a very long-term vision probably not an objectionable idea'. But he said Hong Kong was not able to endorse all the group's recommendations. Mr Victor Fung, chairman of Hong Kong's Trade Development Council and a member of the eminent persons group, defended its recommendations as seeking a discussion forum with a minimum of bureaucracy. 'What we are really talking about is a family of like-minded economies that are oriented and dedicated towards free trade,' he said. Apec ministers reached a compromise yesterday on the sensitive question of Chile's application for membership. As expected, they allowed Mexico and Papua New Guinea to join this year. But Chile, which applied later than they did, is being asked to wait until next year. There will then be a moratorium on new membership for three years so that Apec, still only four years old, can be allowed to develop without becoming too unwieldy. It began with 12 members and admitted China, Hong Kong and Taiwan in 1991. Russia, India, Pakistan and Peru are among other countries which have expressed interest.</p>

			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME ENTERTAINMENT: AUDIO SYSTEM: IS IT WORTH $12,000?  </P> <P> The most-talked about subject in the press room at June's Consumer Electronics  Show (CES) in Chicago was the Home THX Audio System. THX is the designation  given to enhancements to the Dolby Stereo (surround) system used in motion  picture houses around the world.  </P> <P> The THX enhancements were masterminded by a team headed by Tomlinson Holman of  Lucasfilms (as in George Lucas of "StarWars" fame). The Lucasfilm people found  that their films sounded different in different theaters. They wanted their  wonderful movies to sound the way the directors and other production people  originally intended them to sound, no matter in which theater they were  playing.  </P> <P> So, they set out to discover how to make one theater sound just right. Once  they had made one theater sound right, they drew up a set of specifications  that would allow all theaters to follow suit.  </P> <P> The letters THX, depending upon who you ask, are either a tribute to Mr. Lucas'  film, "THX 1138," or stand for Tom Holman, with an X for "experiment" thrown  in.  </P> <P> The THX theater system is made up of a variety of elements: acoustical  treatments, amplifier specifications and loudspeaker designs. The end result is  that if you're lucky enough to have a THX-spec theater near you, the films you  see (and hear) there will sound exactly as the Lucasfilm people intended. And  it will sound that way in every other THX theater in the world as well.  </P> <P> Now, what about at home? When you play your copy of "Indiana Jones and the Last  Crusade," does it sound the way it does in a THX theater? No? Well, that is  what the Home THX Audio System is supposed to deliver. Lucasfilm's THX division  is licensing its technology for use in audio components designed for home  entertainment systems. The first of these products made their debut at this  summer's CES.  </P> <P> I heard two demonstrations of THX systems at CES. The first was by Technics.  The THX-licensed products exhibited by Technics included speaker systems,  amplifiers and a surround-sound decoder/control unit. The second demonstration  was a cooperative arrangement between two manufacturers: Lexicon  (surround-sound decoder) and Snell Acoustics (speaker systems).  </P> <P> Lexicon showed their THX-equipped surround-sound decoder and a prototype  multi-channel amplifier. Snell exhibited their THX-licensed speaker systems.  I'm sorry to say that neither demo knocked my socks off, but of the two, the  Technics was more impressive.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, neither demo was glitch-free. All the components on hand from  the three manufacturers were prototypes, and they were displayed in typical,  temporary "convention" spaces. The special laser disc used to demonstrate the  equipment offered exciting, high-volume glimpses of various Lucasfilm  productions, but lacked the "sparkle" I expected. All in all, neither demo was  an exemplary example of a "Home THX Audio System."  </P> <P> A short time after I arrived back home in San Francisco, I was offered the  opportunity to hear another demonstration of the THX home system, this time at  Lucasfilm headquarters on the Skywalker Ranch. I excitedly made the 20-minute  drive, but unfortunately, have little to report. The same Lucasfilm demo disc  was used again in this presentation, as well as some audio (CD) program  material with which I was not familiar. The Lucasfilm laser disc seems to have  a problem with the audio mix or equalization (it lacks high frequencies). Plus,  the positioning of the speakers and arrangement of the room's furniture was  less than ideal. I've been promised a rain check, and will eventually get the  opportunity to hear a full demo with no excuses.  </P> <P> In the meantime, I've been listening to my own surround-sound system very  critically, and you know what? I really like it. I wonder about spending  $12,000 (the price quoted for the Technics THX set up) for a system that isn't  dramatically better than what I already own -- and my surround-sound system  cost substantially less than $12,000.  </P> <P> Granted there are a few THX-type characteristics that I would like my system to  have. I like the side-firing (dipole) surround speakers that the THX systems  employ; they don't "speak" directly into your ears in a small room.  </P> <P> I also like the way the THX system deals with the timbre of sounds that move  from front to rear, or rear to front. In my system, because of the differences  in front and rear speakers, when sounds move from front to rear (or the  opposite direction) there is a noticeable change in sound characteristics  (timbre). This is controlled well in a THX system.  </P> <P> Until I can hear a THX system in a home-like environment, with hardware and  software that are compromise-free, I can't really give it my thumbs-up or  thumbs-down. While I feel that a Home THX Audio System can play back a film  soundtrack with theater-like results, I also want to hear how well one of these  systems reproduces music that I am familiar with. After all, few people can  afford to have two sound systems -- one for music and another just for movies.  </P> <P> What I can report, for now, is that these first, THX-approved products are  quite expensive. The Lexicon THX-equipped surround-sound decoder is priced at  $2,500, more than double the price of their best non-THX decoder. The Technics  system is $12,000. Included in that price are three front speakers, two  surround speakers, two sub-woofers, the amplifiers to drive all those speakers  and a THX/surround-sound decoder/controller. Without the amplifiers the cost is  $7,000. If you choose the seven speakers from Snell Acoustics, their price is  $4,993.  </P></p>

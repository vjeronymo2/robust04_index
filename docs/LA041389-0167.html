			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / BARBIE LUDOVISE;  </P> <P> SHE KNOWS WHERE SHE'S GOING, BUT SOMETIMES NOT WHERE SHE'S BEEN  </P> <P> There's a standing joke among members of the UC Irvine women's tennis team. If  team captain Kathy Rose has something of value one day, she'll probably lose it  the next.  </P> <P> Rose, a senior and the team's No. 2 singles player, has had, from time to time,  some trouble keeping track of her belongings.  </P> <P> First it was her tennis rackets. Rose said they mysteriously disappeared en  route to a tennis tournament at Houston.  </P> <P> "I know I had them when I left the house for the tournament," Rose said. "But  when we got to Texas, they weren't with me."  </P> <P> No matter. Rose borrowed a spare from a teammate and proceeded to win all of  her matches.  </P> <P> Then it was her tennis shoes.  </P> <P> "When we left this tournament in Northern California, Kathy had two shoes on  her feet," Anteater Coach Doreen Irish said. "When we got home, she had just  one shoe. The other was never found."  </P> <P> Then it was her car.  </P> <P> "We drove through four lots on campus looking for it," Irish said. "It just  wasn't anywhere. But then we found it in the parking lot of the hotel her  parents were staying at.  </P> <P> "There was an explanation for that one, though."  </P> <P> Rose had forgotten that her parents had arranged to borrow the car.  </P> <P> Absent-minded? Rose admits, at times, it's true.  </P> <P> "Funny things happen like that all the time," she said. "Everyone gives me a  hard time about it."  </P> <P> But it's all in fun.  </P> <P> On the tennis court or in the classroom, Rose, a 21-year-old social ecology  major, rarely loses her way. Although her overall singles record of 9-9 is not  spectacular, Rose has been a stabilizing force for Irvine as team captain for  the past three years.  </P> <P> Especially this year, because Irvine (10-13 overall) has not had the most  stable of seasons. Injury and illness have haunted the Anteaters.  </P> <P> "This year it's been so up and down," Rose said. "It's different from last year  (when the team finished 18-6 -- its best record since it was 23-4 in 1977).  </P> <P> "When your team does well, it's like everything keeps rolling, the wins seem to  just come. But when there's sickness and injuries . . . well, everyone's really  got to concentrate on their own game really hard."  </P> <P> Rose said her concentration on the court has been a greater challenge this year  because she is scheduled to graduate in June and then plans to go into  corporate health management.  </P> <P> After finishing her weightlifting Wednesday morning, Rose ordered a bowl of  granola and skim milk at a Newport Beach coffee shop and listed her present  priorities.  </P> <P> "I like helping people, especially helping them get fit," she said. "Like I  just heard about this machine that measures people's body fat and cholesterol  and lean body mass. . . . I heard they cost about $5,000, but I'd love to have  one."  </P> <P> Rose is a part-time intern at the Irvine Medical Center, where, among other  duties, she writes exercise therapy programs. She is also an on-campus peer  health adviser, which means she organizes health, fitness and nutrition  workshops for students in the dormitories and high school students.  </P> <P> "Right now we're starting to do drug and alcohol prevention workshops," said  Rose, whose mother, Sharon Rose, is the national chairperson of the Red Ribbon  Campaign, a national drug prevention group.  </P> <P> Kathy Rose, who was a nationally ranked junior tennis player while growing up  in Davis, Calif., said she has little desire to play professionally after she  graduates.  </P> <P> "I don't see pro tennis as my life," Rose said. "It's just not for me. With all  the travel and the life style, it's too mentally draining and there's so many  good players."  </P> <P> Rose got a taste of the hard-core tennis life style when, as a junior in high  school, she attended Nick Bollettieri's Tennis Academy in Bradenton, Fla., for  six months.  </P> <P> "It had its ups and downs, but mostly it was like boot camp," she said. "Lights  at out 10. Get up and play by 8 a.m. No girls by the boys' dorms. No food  allowed in the rooms. . . . "My boyfriend there had given me a huge Hershey's  Kiss, but during a room search they found it and took it away.  </P> <P> "Life's a little different in college."  </P> <P> With just three weeks remaining in her collegiate career -- without a chance of  a berth into the NCAA Championships in May, the Anteaters will finish their  season at the Big West Conference Championships at Ojai, April 27-29 -- Rose  said she'll be happy to retire into the world of career and recreational  pursuits.  </P> <P> Said Rose: "Most of my friends say, 'No way. You're not going to play (on the  pro circuit) this summer?' But I just want to work and have some fun now. It's  time to do other things."  </P> <P> In men's tennis, senior Mark Kaplan, 26-5 and on a 20-match winning streak, was  named the Volvo tennis player of the month for March by the Intercollegiate  Tennis Coaches Assn. Kaplan, ranked 14th in the nation, went 15-0 during the  month.  </P> <P> Junior Trevor Kronemann, ranked 20th, is 22-14; sophomore Mike Briggs from  Corona del Mar High is ranked 58th and is 19-9, and junior Richard Lubner is  21-15.  </P> <P> The Anteaters (18-6) are ranked fifth in the nation.  </P> <P> Victory No. 1: The men's volleyball team won its first Western Intercollegiate  Volleyball Assn. match Tuesday night by defeating 14th-ranked Loyola Marymount,  15-12, 12-15, 15-13, 15-10, at Loyola Marymount.  </P> <P> The victory was the Anteaters' first after 18 conference losses. Sophomores  David Pettker, an outside hitter, had 25 kills and Steve Florentine, a middle  blocker, had 24 kills.  </P> <P> Irvine (7-24 overall, 1-18 in the WIVA) is ranked 17th in the nation.  </P> <P> After beginning its program as a club sport in 1987, Irvine is in its second  season of intercollegiate competition. All Irvine players will return next  season.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Nicaraguan Presidency Minister Antonio </F> Lacayo, National Police Director Fernando Caldera, National  Transportation Commission spokesman Gustavo Aguiluz,  Parrales-Vallejos Cooperative President Carlos Palma, and  National Workers' Front Leader Roberto Gonzalez, who is also a  member of the Parrales- Vallejos Cooperative, with unidentified  reporters at the Presidential Palace in Managua -- live]    [Excerpts] [Lacayo] Nicaraguans: In the pre-dawn hours of  this morning I received a letter from (Don Jose Sara),  coordinator for the National Transportation Commission [CNT],  requesting a meeting to try and find a definitive and long-term  solution to the transportation sector's problems. Despite the  fact that I have not participated in the government commission  that has been meeting with the various transportation sectors  since 13 January, I accepted with pleasure because I was aware  of their willingness to solve the strike today.    The meeting with CNT representatives was held in the  afternoon and lasted about an hour and one-half. I must say  that the talks were very frank and constructive. They explained  their view of the transportation sector's main problems; that  is, problems involving fuel price hikes and mechanisms dealing  with the effective tax exemptions to which cooperatives are  entitled in accordance with the country's laws and problems with  coupons that were agreed upon back in September and which in  some cases have not been distributed. All this, I would say,  was communicated by those who work in this important sector with  a desire to survive.    I also took the opportunity to tell them of the government's  wish to consolidate this sector. The transportation sector is  vital to Nicaragua's production, passenger and cargo  transportation, and collective transportation. The government  would like the sector to consolidate with other transportation  federations and chambers and for the tax exemption mechanisms to  be fine tuned. The government wants the sector to understand  the fuel situation, that they must have greater trust in what  the government does once the price freeze period expires and  when pending coupons are brought up to date, and all other  aspects that hinder the smooth operation of this sector. The  government also wishes to discuss the in-depth problems  involving the new organization throughout this sector and the  preparation of a general transportation law, which must be  drafted with all sectors involved in transportation. Then the  executive branch, President Chamorro, can send this draft bill  initiative to the National Assembly for discussion and approval.    Following these frank talks, which lasted an hour and  one-half, I asked them to end the strike, because we all know of  the inherent danger of these situations when people take  advantage of circumstances to complicate things even more. In  fact, the transportation sector itself is interested in resuming  work because they are harming their economic situation. They  have entrusted me personally with overseeing and ensuring that  the various government commissions working with the  transportation sector work smoothly toward the goal we seek,  which is that this sector become organized and an in-depth  solution to their problems be found.    At the end of the meeting they asked to talk with their  affiliate members and return later tonight to tell the  Nicaraguan people what has been done. I agreed with pleasure,  and in light of radio reports that were being broadcast at the  time that bore little resemblance to the talks we had held, I  also decided to speak to the other transportation sectors,  federations, and chambers to explain that we were meeting with a  constructive spirit full of goodwill, which will allow the whole  sector to work in greater harmony. I also found them to be very  receptive toward the idea of working together. I think this is  a great step.    While in the meeting I received information that the CNT had  accepted my request to end the strike. I think this is a very  positive step in favor of the transportation sector. The  attitude of the commission and other chambers and federations  forecasts a very positive working meeting tomorrow or the day  after at the latest. This definitely commits the government to  working with greater interest in support of the definitive and  long-term solutions requested by the CNT in their letter.    By beginning February with this strike resolved without  regrettable deaths or injuries, the country is taking a very  important step on the path to reaffirming dialogue as the  fundamental instrument for resolving differences among  Nicaraguans and in favor of the reconciliation of Nicaraguans by  achieving their unity in a concerted agreement. I am very  happy, and now it is the commission members' turn to comment.    [Gonzalez] We wish to inform the local and international  public, the Nicaraguan people, and the members of our  organization throughout the country who are following this news  conference of the National Transportation Commission's [CNT]  responsible decision to contribute to a solution. We also wish  to emphasize this chance to restore confidence between the  government and the drivers, a confidence that had clearly  deteriorated in relation to the fulfillment of previous  agreements. It was decided today, as the result of Minister  Lacayo's pledge to the CNT and in response to our proposals,  that the agenda items the CNT had been proposing will be  revised, adjusted, and discussed at 1500 at the CNT office  tomorrow and in a bilateral meeting to be held at 0900 on  Thursday as agreed with Minister Lacayo.    This decision to suspend the transport strike is our  contribution to and a demonstration of our interest in the  country's stability. We expect the government to reciprocate by  meeting the cooperatives' long-standing expectations. Today we  can see the possibility of the drivers' hopes being fulfilled  and of our dreams coming true. We have stated our position  regarding the government. We are for national stability,  agreement, dialogue, and the discussion of problems. We are  willing to use every necessary administrative procedure that  lends itself to achieving an understanding. We also wish to  reiterate firmly, however, that the drivers' contribution to the  recovery of trust between themselves and the government will be  conditional upon the fulfillment of the government's pledge  through Minister Lacayo. As a result, we hereby announce that  the general transportation strike has been suspended today and  that all delegations in Managua can return to their places of  origin, a return that must be guaranteed by the National Police.  We also wish to make it clear that a fundamental aspect of  these negotiations as part of the climate of understanding is  the release of all detainees and no reprisals against the  strikers. Minister Lacayo, today we have pledged our word in  responsibility. This is a historic chance to aid Nicaragua and  to set an example for all sectors. We urge the government to  keep its word. Let's not betray this word. We believe this is  a chance to create conditions for a greater openness and to  increase trust. Thanks.    [Reporter] Minister Lacayo, why was your participation  necessary in this transportation sector conflict? Can't the  other ministers make decisions? My next question is for Roberto  Gonzalez of the CNT. What was the subject of your meeting this  afternoon with Minister Lacayo? What arrangement did you make?  And why this last-minute decision to end a strike that was going  strong?    [Gonzalez] This morning the CNT presented its position to  Minister Lacayo. We found that Minister Lacayo is in favor of  discussing this position and of seriously analyzing it to give  us a positive answer. That is why the commission believes that  this time we will not be left vulnerable. That is why we have  informed our people on strike at the national level that the  strike is over.    [Unidentified speaker] I will expand on that so there is no  misinterpretation of your question about what was discussed. We  discussed what Minister Lacayo and Roberto have explained. Our  position to end the strike came in response to the first sign of  goodwill and interest, which in this case came from Minister  Lacayo. In the face of this situation, we had an obligation to  the people and our sector, which we represent, to find a  negotiated solution based on Minister Lacayo's receptive  position in favor of a commitment.    [Lacayo] [passage omitted] We must admit that during the  first years of this government, some transportation permits and  operating licenses were granted in response to political  pressures brought to bear by the end of the war. We gave taxi  operation licenses to demobilized people from the Nicaraguan  Resistance as well as to retired Army people, who thus found  jobs immediately. We must end that practice so we can move to a  higher phase to benefit the entire sector.    I think that the ministers have acted in accordance with  their responsibilities. [passage omitted]    There has been a great deal of distrust in both the  transportation sector and -- the ministers have told me this --  among the ministers. Please remember what happened in  September. These meetings have taken place in the midst of a  strike. This makes negotiations difficult. When this is the  framework, the people don't perform as well as they could. I  had an edge: I had not participated in the negotiations and I  had not met the transportation people. I met them today.  Perhaps this made it easier for us to realize that we are  closer to an agreement than we had thought and that if the two  sides have the will, we will be able to reach an agreement that  favors this sector.    [Reporter] What will happen to the transportation people  still in prison now that the strike is being dismantled? What  will happen to the cases that have been initiated against  approximately 200 transportation people who were arrested during  the strike? What will happen to them? Will the trial  proceedings continue?    [Lacayo] The people arrested as suspects by the police will  be released. No one has been placed at the disposal of a court,  so there is no problem in this regard. We think, as we have  discussed with the commission, that in the future, if we work in  a more harmonious way, we will not find ourselves in this kind  of situation. In this regard it is important to state that  everyone is interested in making the transportation sector  function better. This will get us off to a good start tomorrow.  [passage omitted]    [Reporter] The strike began with a protest over increased  fuel prices. Nicaragua has the highest gasoline prices in  Central America. There was also a failure to fulfill the  agreements signed in September 1993 and the issue of  reorganizing the transportation sector. What did the government  promise the transportation sector in response to their requests?    [Lacayo] We explained that a reorganization is in the best  interest of the government and the transportation sector as  well. The reorganization must be established in a general  transportation law previously agreed upon by all sectors  involved in transportation. We would send the law to the  National Assembly, which would reach a final consensus, polish  the document, and approve it. Nevertheless, it must be clearly  understood that this concerted effort to create a new general  transportation law must be a joint effort, and it is very  difficult for the government to hold bilateral meetings with one  sector and then with another sector, because in the end we get  caught up in suspicions on all sides that are only dispelled  when all sectors come together at a meeting. I believe the  commission members have decided to take a positive step. It is  also a positive step on the part of the other federations and  chambers, which said this afternoon that they have never closed  their doors to anyone for this sort of meeting.    All the sectors agree on one issue that could be the  starting  point for dealing with all these issues, including the fuel  issue. As you said, fuel in Nicaragua is definitely the most  expensive in Central America, but we must also clearly  understand that our economy is the worst in Central America.  This is the result of what we all know happened in our country  over the past 10, 15, 20, or 100 years, to be more specific.  While the other countries can pay their teachers, build medical  centers, and construct better highways with taxes generated by  their greater economic activity, we in Nicaragua have not had  that luck. I hope that someday in the future the taxes we  collect will allow us to lower fuel prices, but for the time  being there is no other solution, and all Nicaraguans must  understand that.    We must make an effort to raise our economy's level of  production and productivity. I think we will take an important  step in that direction this year, and eventually more  Nicaraguans will be able to pay their taxes. We will also  collect more from the business sector and from the sale of  products that contribute to the generation of taxes, such as  beer, rum, and cigarettes. Thus we will be able to gradually  lower the tax which simply must be imposed on fuel. All  countries collect taxes this way. Even in Europe, where there  are strong economies, gasoline is sold for up to 25 or 26  cordobas per gallon. The European countries are donors, in  Nicaragua's case, and they have often pointed out that although  gasoline is cheaper in other countries, it is still relatively  cheap in Nicaragua when compared to prices in Europe. We must  listen to the donors' points of view and seriously consider  them, because they would like to see their aid channeled to more  important matters and to the most dispossessed sectors of our  society. Thus, in the agreements reached at dawn on Saturday,  which the government is committed to maintain, we lowered the  price of diesel as much as possible to prices that are quite  competitive within Central America. Diesel is used for cargo  and passenger transportation and for farm production in general.    An effort has also been made to subsidize gasoline for  taxis.  Taxi drivers will receive coupons per gallon of gasoline for a  maximum of six gallons daily, thereby receiving some support  from the government. However, gasoline in general and  especially super gasoline must be more expensive to discourage  the use of taxis and foster the use of mass transportation so  the latter will have a greater volume of work.    [Reporter] I have questions for both sectors. The first is  for the transportation sector. One thing that delayed the  possibility of your ending the strike or reaching an agreement  was a lack of trust. What makes you believe that you can now  reach a satisfactory agreement? Also, have you considered  proposing to the government other possible sources of income  that would lower government taxes? I would also like the  presidency minister to respond to this.    In addition, President Chamorro, and specifically [former]  Transportation Minister Jaime Icabalceta, said that members of  the Parrales-Vallejo Cooperative must decide whether they will  use the buses. If not, they should return them, because those  buses must be paid for and operated. I would like to know if  the government is still concerned about this. I would also like  to know, Mr. Minister, what effect this strike will have on your  forthcoming meeting with the multilateral financial  organizations.    [Lacayo] In response to the final part of your question, I  would like to say that many things have been said by both sides  over the past seven, eight, or nine days. Some news media have  even reported things that were never said by either side. But  all of that is behind us. What matters now is our current  resolve to end the transportation sector problems.    Concerning alternative sources of income taxes, I think one  source identified not only by a broad segment of the trade  sector but by the general public is contraband. We all know  that there are people in Nicaragua who bring merchandise into  the country in a fraudulent manner. They do not pay the taxes  they should pay; they compete unfairly against formally  established businesses; and they do not make the required  payments to bring their products into the country. We also know  there are establishments that ask clients whether or not they  want receipts. All merchants who do not provide receipts also  harm the transportation sector and the economy in general. The  burden must be shared by all. I think it is important for  everyone who has the legal obligation to pay taxes to do so we  can gradually reduce taxes on certain products, which would be  to our advantage. That is what I have to say about alternative  sources.    As for the international community, I must speak openly. To  the extent that the international community sees the Nicaraguan  people resolving problems, especially the way in which we have  resolved a protest that did not become violent as it did in  September and on other occasions, to the extent that we  Nicaraguans can show the world that despite our country's  infinite problems we are capable of reaching agreements and  resolving our problems, to that extent, we will make a favorable  impression on the international community.    The broad consensus achieved at the National Assembly at the  beginning of the year and the fact that the Assembly is  functioning with almost all of its 92 deputies has definitely  had a very positive impact on the international community. U.S.  Assistant Secretary of State Watson emphasized that point in  spite of criticisms by certain Nicaraguan news media. I believe  it makes an impression on the international community when they  see that we are approaching the path to democracy. I have no  doubt whatsoever that the way in which we resolved the strike  and transportation stoppage today will also have a very positive  impact, which is good for all Nicaraguans and, why not, for the  transportation sector.    [Unidentified labor leader] It must be clearly established  that we demanded of the government that both sides agree to a  truce. This truce, which has been requested and demanded by the  transportation sector and various cooperatives for over three  years, is precisely the result of the economic difficulties  faced by the cooperative movement. Therefore, we believe it is  to our advantage to discuss our problems, and we have found the  government to be receptive. I believe the fact that the  presidency minister has listened to our observations and  thoughts about the agenda we presented and discussed this  afternoon proves that an understanding may be possible.  Therefore, the pledge made by the government through Engineer  Lacayo is precisely the offer we discussed today with our entire  national directorate. We decided to discuss the work agenda we  presented, which includes such issues as fuel, taxes, matters  pertaining to Decree 62-93, and matters pertaining to the  reorganization of transportation and other important issues. We  decided to discuss these points at multilateral meetings, but  above all they must be discussed at a bilateral meeting, which  in our opinion is also a viable mechanism through which an  agreement can be reached.</p>

Alan Cranston and Pete Wilson.  </P> <P> In a report, Councilman Mike Eggers said the counting of undocumented  immigrants would have far-reaching effects on cities.  </P> <P> "There is a very real and direct impact on not only Orange County, but local  cities as well," he said.  </P> <P> If Dana Point requests federal money for such public services as road  improvements or capital projects, "the census counts could prove critical," he  said.  </P></p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Technology - Steel Takes on Aluminium: Promoting a can-do approach / Beverage cans Aluminium is a relatively young metal that has established itself by taking over from traditional materials. It has replaced wood and steel in windows and cladding, copper in electrical cable and, above all, substitutes for steel in beverage cans. In the US, 95bn cans of beer or soft drinks are consumed every year, a can a day for every man, woman and child. And 99 per cent of the cans are made of aluminium where once they were made of steel. This has left the aluminium industry with a problem: about 10 per cent of global demand for its metal comes from one product in one country. So it is spending heavily to spread the gospel of the aluminium beverage can around the world. To promote the use of aluminium cans outside the US, the industry leans heavily on its green credentials, claiming that the cans may be recycled on a closed loop system (from cans to scrap and back to cans again). The relatively high value of aluminium as scrap - the cans are worth six to 20 times more than any other used packaging material and are the most valuable used package found in household waste - enables the industry to spread the word that can-recycling gives collectors a decent income. Last year, for example, the US aluminium industry is estimated to have paid Dollars 900m for used cans, money that benefited individuals, schools, church scout troops and so on. This is not simply altruism - the industry needs this recycled metal because it is a cheap raw material for new cans. As much as 95 per cent of the energy needed to produce new aluminium is saved by recycling old metal because aluminium 'stores' energy. The average smelter uses as much power as a town of 500,000 people to produce new aluminium. On top of that, there are capital savings because a re-melting plant costs only one-tenth as much as a smelter. Steel producers argue that the high cost of new aluminium means it makes economic sense to use aluminium cans only if more than 60 per cent of them are recycled. Few markets achieve this level. In the US the recycling rate is about 66 per cent which means that last year roughly 600,000 tonnes of aluminium worth about Dollars 900m escaped, possibly to be thrown away. In Europe the estimated minimum recycling rate last year was about 30 per cent. In Europe aluminium has won only half the available beverage can market and it is there that the steel industry, perhaps a little late, is fighting back hardest. Steel beverage cans are as green as aluminium, the industry's message goes, mainly because they can be attracted by magnets and are therefore easily rescued from waste. Cans are selling at roughly the same price - about Dollars 58 (Pounds 37) per 1,000 - although steel prices could come down more quickly as it has greater potential for light weighting. Innovative packages such as British Steel Tinplate's recently-launched Ecotop can, with a push-button, all-steel, easy-open end could give steel beverage cans more appeal in consumers' eyes. John May, marketing manager at British Steel Tinplate, points out that the US steel industry, when it gave way to aluminium, did not have available the continuous casting technology the European industry is using to produce high-quality tinplate today. Recent technological developments in steel-can making have led to significant energy and materials savings. Steel beverage cans now have wall thicknesses of less than 0.1mm and are 30 per cent thinner than those made of aluminium. Steel soft drinks cans are 25 per cent lighter than four years ago, yet the industry is developing a steel can 30 per cent lighter than now , and lighter than aluminium cans on the market. Steel suffered a setback recently when Coca-Cola Schweppes, the UK's biggest soft drinks group, switched its canning lines to aluminium, because of the metal's lighter weight. Nick Mason at the CRU International consultancy group says that, as steel is much denser and heavier than aluminium it is possible to use longer or wider aluminium coils. A typical aluminium coil will yield 12 cans per width compared with seven from a steel coil. So nearly twice as many tin plate coils are needed to make the same number of cans. That means more storage space and more handling, if steel is used. Nevertheless, May insists his industry does not suffer from a 'siege mentality' about the beverage can battle which is only one part of the packaging sector. Steel has about 15 per cent of the UK packaging market and aluminium 5 per cent. In beverage cans, in the Netherlands 100 per cent are steel, in France it is 95 per cent and in Belgium 90 per cent. Germany's market is 85 per cent steel.</p>

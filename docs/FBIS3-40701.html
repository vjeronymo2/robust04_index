			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Arye Qizal] </F>   [Text] "There is a veiled underemployment in some of the  Israel Defense Force's (IDF) commands," Prime Minister and  Defense Minister Yitzhaq Rabin told members of the Foreign and  Defense Committee of the Knesset yesterday, meaning, by his  words, the "army" of clerks at the Qiriya [government offices]  in Tel Aviv. They have been on his mind for some time now. Not  all of them--but many of them.    Who does not know the endless swarm of clerks that plods  along every morning in exhaustion at the entrance to the Qiriya,  trampling outside at noon to scramble for something at the  eateries of Even-Gvirol Street, walking slowly back to the  offices, and, exactly at 1700--but exactly--flowing outside the  gates of the Qiriya, directly into the long cork on Kaplan  Street. [sentence as published]    Many among us, especially those of us with combat history,  call them "jobniks," or even "parasites." When we say, in the  Friday salon talks, that we can cut back on offices,  electricity, office equipment, and, primarily, cadres and  salaries--we are referring to them.    Both Yitzhaq Rabin and Ehud Baraq think so, but they are  trapped. It is not possible to lay off hundreds of these clerks,  and even the Israel Defense Force's (IDF) earnest attempts at  reducing and cutting are not resulting in the longed for change.  In the Qiriya's hallways, it turns out, marches a different army  from the one along the borders and in the territories, and it  has its own rules.    Every few years, a new program of cuts emerges, which is  "thrown" at one command or another: They cut a branch here, a  section there, lip service from the aspect of many, but the  primary mass still remains, and there is a veiled  underemployment. Even an open one.    Major General (Res.) 'Amos Yaron, former head of the IDF  manpower branch, does not take issue with Rabin, but he is  cautious. "In every large organization, the slogan `there is a  veiled underemployment' is correct. There are many people in  this bureaucratic organization known as the army, which does not  always operate according to economic considerations. Every few  years they say this in order to put pressure on the system, to  signal to the commands that the command is on the ball and they  must become efficient. And, therefore, they make cuts--but, they  expand again."    Yaron says that saying must be repeated over and over,  because the commands each have an independent character. When  you do not "sit" on them, they start to expand. For example: A  lieutenant colonel who wants to promoted to colonel and begins  to "rush" work papers to his boss creates new assignments for  himself, all of which is under the strange heading  "specialization." He demands a cadre, authorizations, officers,  offices, and, of course, clerks. And commanders, as is known,  love clerks around them. The staff work of that same lieutenant  colonel can bear fruit one fine day, and then, suddenly, a new  section pops out of nowhere, with it the cadre, and, of course,  the underemployment.    Yaron: "In my time, there was a daily war with veiled  underemployment in some of the commands. You have to be on the  ball all of the time. The current chief of general staff could  cut more and does not need to be urged to do so, because there  are budget problems, and he wants to cut cadres in any case. It  is very good that the commands know that they are being  examined, for if this does not happen, another month will pass  and everything will swell up again."    Sheqem director-general, Brig. Gen. (Res.) Gabi Nave, who  was  responsible for manpower in the navy, says that the wasteful  image that has been pinned to the commands is not correct.  "People get an impression from the hundreds of cars in the big  cities, which are there from the command locations, and they  have a sense of underemployment. In the navy, for example, there  are cuts all of the time, and there is a small command there  that is purposeful and very competitive. They are always making  cuts in it, but the reservist who arrives and sees clerks who  are sitting and not doing anything goes home and tells his  friends. That same underemployed clerk does the same thing.    Nave says that the veiled underemployment cannot be reduced  to a minimum, because the level of activity in the army changes  and is not constant. "The army will never become an economical  plant with a manufacturing premium and norms. The IDF is does a  lot to become efficient, and, indeed, changed to a five-day work  week. If I had asked someone 10 years ago whether this was  possible, they would have answered in the negative."    Maj. Gen. (Res.) Yaron sharpens the point. "We must reach a  state of no underemployment, and it is possible to reduce and  cut a lot, but the result will be that many will not be  mobilized into the IDF or will be released. This, apparently, is  impossible, as long as the IDF is defined as a national army. We  are in a trap. If we mobilize everyone, then the commands swell,  there is underemployment. and there are male and female soldiers  who do not do a thing."    Col. (Res.) Nava Fels, former commander of Training Center  12, says that it is possible to cut back, and calls for starting  with the Women's Corps system. According to her, the obligatory  mobilization of women to the IDF should be canceled in  preference to a professional army to which only those who want  to and are wanted are mobilized.    "I sometimes do not understand how this system works," Fels  says. "Today, when I am in the simple civilian class, it is  difficult for me to absorb what terrible norms of  underemployment exist in the army, especially in the Women's  Corps system, and no one is getting up and making a peep. This  matter should be stopped immediately. The problem of the people  in the army is that they are in it too much and they do not see  what is happening around it. As in every plant where they  examine the level of performance and effectiveness of the  workers--this must also be done in the army, and the sooner the  better."</p>

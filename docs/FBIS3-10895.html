He arrived this morning at the Ezeiza international airport.  He will ask Argentine President Carlos Menem to send more  troops to former Yugoslavia during a meeting tomorrow.    In remarks to a Buenos Aires newspaper, Butrus-Ghali noted  that the United Nations wants the Argentine Government to send  an additional battalion of blue helmets to join those already in  Croatia.    Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella welcomed the Egyptian  diplomat, emphasized the "esteemed value" of the visit, and  confirmed Argentina's desire to continue participating in the UN  peace-keeping missions.    Issues like the UN debt following the various deployments of  Argentine blue helmets will also be discussed during the visit.    The formation of an international force to struggle against  hunger -- the White Helmets -- will also be reviewed.    During the meeting with Menem tomorrow, an agreement to  assist the Mothers, Infants, and Nutrition Program [Programa  Materno Infantil y Nutricion] (PROMIN), financed by the World  Bank, will also be signed.</p>

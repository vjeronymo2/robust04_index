			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of President Juan Carlos Wasmosy's speech to the </F> nation broadcast on 24 April]    [Text] "Fellow-countrymen: When I acceded to the  presidency, I set out to improve the economic situation of the  country, to increase levels of employment and wages, and to  implement a more equitable distribution of wealth. These were,  and continue to be, my objectives and I will continue to battle  for them throughout my tenure.    ``I was aware that I was the first civilian president in  many  decades. I therefore sought to govern with the deepest respect  for all individual and political liberties and to enhance the  freedom of the press as an essential channel for democracy.  Likewise, I was conscious of the great responsibility I assumed  before my fellow-countrymen, especially those who did not vote  for me but who also contributed toward the democracy that we at  present enjoy. We must consolidate our democratic system if we  are to derive the benefits we admire in countries that embarked  on this path before us.    ``In compliance with this line of action, I have favored  dialogue and negotiation as a way to definitely overcome  conflicts and problems. This is why I hold daily talks with all  social, economic, and political sectors in our country. This is  why I frequently travel the length and breath of our country --  to be in direct contact with my fellow-countrymen, to understand  their needs, and to explain the restrictions imposed by our  reality.    ``I believe the great majority of our government officials  and the people at large share this spirit with us. Sometimes  our temperament, our grievances, our culture, and our anxiety  play nasty tricks on us and we go against those purposes. It is  then that we lose our patience and engage in verbal battles in  which we try to discredit each other. This contributes to bring  things to a head. It encourages drastic solutions, unilateral  positions, and a pessimistic outlook on the future which is not  in keeping with our reality and which, to a certain extent,  takes us back to the past; a past that we want to overcome but  which binds us to an authoritarian culture in which we believe  -- either individually or as a group -- that we are absolutely  right and are entitled to every single right. Therefore, we need  not heed those who think differently.    ``Under a dictatorial regime, disagreements like this do not  prosper for the simple reason that nobody can voice his/her  opinion. Everyone can speak in democracy, but if we do so in an  authoritarian way we cause unending disputes and irreconcilable  stances which lead to impasse and frustration. Handled  incorrectly we could end up in a state of anarchy, against which  we must fight with the same vigor we exhibited when we overthrew  the dictatorship.    ``Within this framework of learning how to move from tyranny  to republican participation, I would like to make some  reflections on the planned 2 May strike. The right to strike is  enshrined in our Constitution and will be scrupulously respected  and zealously protected. The right to strike is one thing but  it is quite another thing to analyze whether or not it is timely.    ``To obtain higher wages and create more jobs in our country  -- which was isolated from the rest of the world and whose  best-known industry was, sad to say, corruption -- we must build  a level of credibility that will help us obtain the investments  required to support the better pay and employment levels I have  just mentioned. We must reduce inflation and thus avoid the  painful learning process experienced by our neighbors, who were  forced to coexist for decades with rampant inflation, which like  any addiction, undermines social efforts and generates the worst  injustices to the humblest strata of society, eating into their  salaries every month as it reduces their purchasing power.    ``Inflation leaves no room to build a truly better future. I  want to be very clear on this point, as long as I am president  of all Paraguayans, I will never propound demagogic measures  that will compromise and mortgage the future of our country.  For these reasons I believe the announced strike will not help  us, Paraguayans, to better our situation. We also believe the  direct action methodology of this struggle is incorrect, seeking  to oil the wheels of a sometimes difficult social coexistence  because direct action damages bonds that exist between those who  will have to negotiate at a future date. This happens simply  because there is no other way of reaching agreement.    ``In my capacity as president and as a Paraguayan, I want to  sit at the negotiating table to discuss things, to rationally  meet our priority needs, and to reach consensus on some of our  expectations and on our outlook on reality. If we do not do  this, we will continue with this tug of war from our respective  positions and will not attain our objectives, less still in the  short term. Errors bring about damage, but they usually are a  most precious source of learning.    ``I am convinced this strike is a mistake. I am sure it is a  grave mistake. Yet if it helps Paraguay to learn, it is worth a  try. I am sure it will be more beneficial for all concerned if  we continue our talks before the strike.    ``If we cannot do that, as far as I am concerned, the  negotiating table and the offer to talk continue open after the  strike. I will do my best and I promise the best effort by the  government to continue to build, with anyone who wants to  participate, the best Paraguay possible. I wish you the best.''</p>

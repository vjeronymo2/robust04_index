			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Major General Uri Sagi, head of the IDF </F> Intelligence Branch, by Smadar Peri; place and date not given]    [Text] [Peri] This week, 'Arafat complained that his  standing had been weakened as a result of the Hebron massacre.  Do you believe that he really represents the Palestinian people?    [Sagi] I believe 'Arafat is not the only one who has been  weakened. The Hebron massacre has undermined the ability of  Palestinians and Israelis in general to conduct a dialogue.  This despicable incident has exposed the raw nerves of the  Arab-Israeli conflict -- and especially of the struggle between  Palestinians and Israelis -- with all its religious, national,  traditional, and cultural aspects.    'Arafat's standing has been greatly weakened in the  territories. His pictures are no longer proudly displayed in the  homes of the relatives of the Hebron massacre victims. 'Arafat,  however, is the symbol of the PLO, which is the largest and most  dominant organization. True, 'Arafat is facing a lot of  opposition in the territories, even without the massacre, with  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] being the most prominent  example. Public opinion in the territories, however, is less  sensitive to political nuances and cares far more about  security, standard of living, and being able to run their own  affairs. Clearly, the more difficulty 'Arafat encounters in  implementing his agreements with us, the weaker he will become.  Time plays a critical role in his success in achieving what he  regards as a favorable political settlement. If 'Arafat fails,  his position will be undermined even further.    [Peri] Let me quote 'Ali Jad, a representative of the  Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in Jerusalem, who  said: "Beware, 'Arafat, you are not going to live for long."    [Sagi] These kind of statements are made by the rejectionist  organizations which have political representatives as well as  militant activists in the territories.    [Peri] Do you believe that 'Arafat's life is in danger?    [Sagi] The fact is that the lives of all political leaders  who represent only part of their constituents are in danger. I  think that 'Arafat's life -- just like the lives of other  leaders who represent undemocratic societies -- is in danger.  Especially if they take politically daring steps.    'Arafat's life expectancy depends, of course, on his ability  to achieve a political arrangement. If and when he fails, we  can assume that he will disappear. Paradoxically, if the  political arrangement is a success, new and younger leaders from  inside the territories will emerge. They are familiar with the  conditions, the standard of living, and the security needs.  They are much more knowledgeable about daily life than those  who live in Tunis.    [Peri] Despite the differences between the Palestinians  there appears to be one common denominator: they all want a  Palestinian state.    [Sagi] There is no doubt about that. Their attitude has not  changed. Although there is a higher degree of political realism  in the territories now, they do not conceal their aspiration to  establish a Palestinian state. 'Arafat, like the others, openly  speaks about it. We expect them to demand the establishment of  a Palestinian state.    Moreover, in the Gaza-Jericho First concept, 'Arafat was at  great pains to try very hard to include elements with clear  links to the permanent arrangement; or in other words, the  Palestinian state.    [Peri] Do you believe that 'Arafat will be able to deliver  the goods when he arrives in Jericho?    [Sagi] There is no doubt that the ideological dream may  shatter when he assumes control and is confronted by the harsh  and mundane reality. I do not think that 'Arafat was ever very  good at handling daily affairs, nor do I believe that they  particularly interest him. At any rate, he makes no secret of  his ambitions, which are greater than running things in the Gaza  Strip and Jericho. In his opinion, he is the president of some  sort of political entity.    I therefore believe that he will engage in political  activities that will necessitate his being abroad most of the  time. According to his viewpoint, he would prefer not being  mayor of Jericho at this stage. If and when the situation  changes, he will set up permanent residence.    [Peri] When you talk about 'Arafat's trips abroad, are you  referring to fund collection drives?    [Sagi] I mean taking care of the Palestinian economy,  especially the budget. It is no secret that 'Arafat and very  few of his closest associates have total control over the PLO  budget.    [Peri] The PLO's economic situation is bad.    [Sagi] I cannot, understandably, present the PLO budget to  the readers. Since the Gulf War the condition of the  organization has deteriorated and external budget sources have  quite closed up. They have certain reserves indeed, and I  understand that the Sumud [as published] which is a senior  economic organization controls the budget reservoirs, but in  general, in my opinion, the PLO's financial condition is quite  dire.    [Peri] This is a pessimistic picture of the situation to  those who believe it is possible to disintegrate Hamas through  financial temptations.    [Sagi] The PLO by itself, without outside aid and  contributions, cannot for long guarantee control over events in  the territories or the development and promotion of projects  which will improve the quality of life there. Still, we have  more than initial signs which indicate that if and when the  Palestinian entity is set up, Hamas people will try to work  their way into the system, as individuals if not as an  organization, and the PLO leadership will agree.    [Peri] You are talking about the PLO leadership, but 'Arafat  is a sole ruler, after all. He complains about opposition, but  in the end he does as he pleases.    [Sagi] In theory, and perhaps also in practice, 'Arafat is a  sole decision maker, perhaps also because he is capable of doing  so.    [Peri] Do the Palestinians in the territories adapt  themselves to the idea that they will have to live alongside the  settlers?    [Sagi] The Palestinian aspiration is for the settlers to  disappear naturally, but I believe that both sides, Israelis and  Palestinians alike, understand it is better to put disagreements  off for a later date, not because the problem will become  smaller but with the hope that life will take its course and  political maturity will enable the sides to solve this problem.    Theoretically, the Palestinians would prefer that the  settlements be dismantled and moved to another site, within the  Green Line boundaries. I have no doubt that this is a very  serious matter which will feature very prominently during  deliberations at the next stages.    As with the settlers, there is another, problematic and  loaded issue: Jerusalem. Both sides agreed to postpone  discussion of this issue to later stages.    [Peri] To what extent is talk in Israel about the evacuation  of settlers from Hebron construed by the Palestinian side as a  precedent for the continuation of the negotiations?    [Sagi] I would not like to comment on talk in Israel, but it  is clear that the more diversified the Israeli positions are,  the better the Palestinians' bargaining power becomes.    [Peri] You have been following 'Arafat since the beginning  of the negotiations. Has he indeed changed?    [Sagi] I think you can say 'Arafat fully recognizes and  controls his political actions. I am not going to comment on  mental states attributed to 'Arafat that I have not observed.    [Peri] We have heard about tantrums, shouting, and  feet-stomping. Are these tactics?    [Sagi] As human beings, we all get angry, and as political  or military leaders, we all use different styles to attain goals  or make things happen. 'Arafat requires no marks from me, but I  would not say he has lost his way or control of himself.    [Peri] May we have your assessment on an issue which  troubles us all: Will there be Palestinian retribution for the  Hebron massacre?    [Sagi] Regardless of the various indications, the potential  and desire for revenge requires no intelligence verification  after such an incident.    One cannot lie back and think that since some time has  passed  the fury will blow over and the incident will be forgotten.  Paradoxically, I believe that the more time passes without any  dramatic act of revenge, the more we can expect a serious act of  revenge.    [Peri] You have not calmed me.    [Sagi] It is not my duty to calm. My duty is to try and  objectively describe what I know and estimate the results.  Subjectively, I believe the more time passes, the closer we are  to such an incident.    [Peri] It seems that you are not only preoccupied with the  Syrian issue but it also interests you. Do you see any change  with al-Asad's conception of the nature of peace?    [Sagi] I have not changed my position about the Syrians'  concept and their drive toward a political arrangement, nor  about what al-Asad will employ to obtain his goals. Still,  noting changes in Syria does not mean that al-Asad, in whom I  have taken interest lately, has become friendly to the Zionist  idea or more amiable to the State of Israel.    I believe that al-Asad understood that Israel is stronger  than Syria militarily, and he finds it difficult to reach  strategic parity by himself in the face of what he defines as  the Israeli threat. He surely feels isolated with his political  concept within the Arab world. Despite his cooperation and  close ties with Iran, he is very much aware of the danger of the  fundamentalist Islamic wave. He understands he is totally  isolated, and not only because the Soviet Union vanished but  also because there is no super power other than the United  States which is prepared to invest in our region.    [Peri] Al-Asad wants the entire Golan Heights from Israel.  What exactly does he offer us in return?    [Sagi] I think that now more than ever, Syria understands  that in return for sovereignty over the entire Golan Heights it  will be required -- and I believe it will also agree -- to offer  peace with its attendant components, including diplomatic  relations. Still, I do not think that al-Asad defined publicly  or to himself all components of normalization.    [Peri] Why?    [Sagi] At least for the tactical reason of conducting  negotiations. In my opinion, he will refrain from unveiling the  components of peace as long as he can help it.    [Peri] From al-Asad's viewpoint, is there any room to talk  about full peace without a full withdrawal? Is there room to  bargain on the extent of the withdrawal on the Golan?    [Sagi] I have not detected any readiness for compromise on  al-Asad's part. From his viewpoint, he needs to believe he will  receive the entire Golan Heights. Yet al-Asad also understands  the other side of the coin, namely, that normalization with  Israel is required.    There is a very deep psychological gap between the parties,  a  credibility gap. Each side demands of the other, as a  precondition, that thing which he psychologically finds  difficult to grant. As long as the gap is not bridged, it is  very hard to progress, especially since the Israeli-Syrian  negotiations are indeed the key to achieve a comprehensive  settlement in the Middle East.    [Peri] In the meantime, Syria continues to purchase weapons,  to build up militarily, and to acquire missiles.    [Sagi] Its military buildup is very impressive. The Syrians  naturally claim that Israel is doing the same. It is clear the  reference is not to two countries that are weakening militarily.  It should be noted that as far as al-Asad is concerned, Israel  has yet to clearly say "full withdrawal from the Golan Heights."    [Peri] From Israel's viewpoint, al-Asad is perceived as a  cunning, stubborn political fox that is prepared to patiently  lie in ambush for its prey. Can you read him?    [Sagi] I hope so. This is how I earn my living at least.    Unfortunately, I have not met him yet. I read almost  everything written about him that is available to me. I also  take an interest in him in terms of intelligence, which has many  aspects to it. It would be pretentious of me to say that I know  him as I would a family member, but I think I know him well  enough to form an opinion.    Al-Asad is a very experienced person who knows the Middle  East inside out. If I could wish for anything, I would prefer  that he knew much more about the Israeli reality.    [Peri] He is said to be a man of honor who honors his  commitments.    [Sagi] He is a man of reason, he is cautious and suspicious,  and he has his reasons for this. To a very large degree it is  possible to say that he is reliable as long as his interests are  served. Proof of this is the disengagement agreement between  Israel and Syria on the Golan, in effect since 1974. The  stability of this agreement is almost unparalleled on any other  border we share with the Arabs.    Suffice it to say that if and when he signs an agreement, he  will keep his word, but I do not want to engage in a millenial  vision here as this would not be a realistic depiction of the  situation. There are still deep conflicts between Syria and  Israel, and Syria is a very strong military country, a country  which builds itself up militarily and which views Israel as its  number one enemy.    [Peri] I would guess that as the sole leader at the top,  al-Asad relies heavily on reports he receives from his  intelligence services.    [Sagi] I can only hope that this enhances his understanding  of Israel and perhaps also of world-wide political reality. To  the best of my knowledge, he is under exposed to visits and  foreign elements.    [Peri] Are we still defined in Damascus as "the Zionist  enemy?"    [Sagi] We are now the "Israeli enemy." I have no doubt that  al-Asad too, not just others, needs to overcome a deep  psychological barrier.    [Peri] Since the regime in Syria is dictatorial in nature,  does he at all need to prepare public opinion for peace with  Israel? Will he have opposition?    [Sagi] I think he will. This is not, indeed, public opinion  in the open, democratic style with which we are familiar, but to  change the views of a nation which has been educated and  accustomed to a very certain outlook requires time and  preparation. Al-Asad mentioned this point in public interviews.  He expressed his opinion that it is not only Israel which must  prepare public opinion.    There is no opposition in Syria preventing al-Asad from  pursuing the road he has chosen embarked, but I surely  understand what he means when he mentions the need to prepare  the masses.    [Peri] Did the death of his eldest son, Basil, have an  influence on al-Asad's political considerations?    [Sagi] I do not know a well-balanced person who would not be  affected by the death of his son, but this carries no political  influence in my opinion. After all, we are talking about a man  with a strong personality.    [Peri] But he is not young anymore. Al-Asad is 64 and his  health is not so good. What will happen when he dies?    [Sagi] I do not know. Naturally, the question is when. I  can detect enough stability among today's ruling group -- I am  referring to four to five people -- to continue in al-Asad's  direction, for a short period of time at least.    [Peri] The Egyptians, the go-between between ourselves and  Damascus, persist in their claim that an Israeli-Syrian peace  accord will be signed within a year. Do you share this  assessment?    [Sagi] I prefer to be cautious, unless the Egyptians possess  information they do not share. I cannot identify anything that  would elicit such an unequivocal assumption. This may be a  combination of wishful thinking and an assessment, although it  is not totally unreasonable.    I would be wary of setting such a binding timetable, but I  agree that the chance of achieving a political settlement is  better than before. Circumstances, as well as each sides'  positions, might have reached a level of maturity necessary for  such a settlement to become a reality.    [Peri] How big a danger is posed to Mubarak's life, in your  opinion?    [Sagi] Islamic resistance in Egypt is not new, and to the  best of my knowledge, President Mubarak and the security forces  in Egypt are stable enough to overcome this resistance, not  without problems, but Egypt still seems able to manage as far as  security and the stability of the regime are concerned.    At the same time, it is impossible to dismiss this danger  completely. The Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamic terror  organizations in Egypt believe there is an alternative and that  the regime had better be replaced. There is increasing evidence  that the numbers are increasing, at least, the number of  incidents involving these organizations in Egypt.    [Peri] Are you troubled over what will take place if  something bad happens to Mubarak?    [Sagi] This question, like others, concerns me and requires  due attention. Egypt is the leader of the Arab world which  marked the road to peace in this world. I think that the  Egyptian-Israeli model is a good point of reference to all those  who participate in peace negotiations. This is something which  the Arab world experienced and, in my opinion, found to be  better than anything else.    In my opinion, President Mubarak plays a very positive role  in his readiness to show the benefits Egypt enjoys from its  peace treaty with Israel and in his efforts to try to bridge the  gaps between the sides.    [Peri] What is King Husayn's state of health?    [Sagi] According to official medical bulletins, I think he  is in good health. For the time being, and to the best of my  judgment, there are no negative implications or side effects.  The king functions in a normal, reasonable, and full manner,  and I wish him long life.    [Peri] What is the condition of Saddam Husayn?    [Sagi] Three years after the Gulf War, Iraq's internal  problems are worsening, but not enough to threaten Saddam  Husayn's control. This is demonstrated by isolation of the  Kurdish enclave and the struggle with the Shiite population in  the south.    Saddam is in control of his army and of security. His  regime, although exposed to relatively -- but not sufficiently  -- difficult economic and domestic problems, is stable for the  time being. On quite a few occasions he has been successful in  circumventing the economic embargo on Iraq by cooperating with  foreign elements on both official and less official levels.    [Peri] What is your opinion of the reports and intimations  that Saddam Husayn is interested in joining the peace process?    [Sagi] These are merely gimmicks and speculation. They are  not worthy of any serious consideration.    [Peri] What about the other alternative? Should we expect  more nasty surprises from him.    [Sagi] Iraq's military capabilities have not improved since  the Gulf War. Their order of battle is small. They have  maintenance problems and the army has to both protect the regime  in Baghdad, deploy around the borders, and confront the Kurds.  In addition, they have tense relations with Iran and are deeply  involved in a struggle against the Shiites in the south. The  Iraqi Army is still large and capable of protecting the regime  but the danger of Iraq launching a military campaign against  Israel without the backing of a united Arab coalition or some  kind of strategic military upheaval in the region is reduced.    Obviously, I would prefer not to comment on Saddam Husayn's  ambitions, which he may have not renounced. It would be  irresponsible of me to say that there were definitely no signs  or remnant of Iraq's strategic surface-to-surface missile or  chemical warfare capabilities, or even of his continued attempts  to develop his nuclear project. If the international  supervision efforts are sufficiently effective, they may perhaps  guarantee that Iraq will not regain its previous strength. I am  not optimistic, however, concerning the effectiveness of the  inspection teams.    [Peri] Can Israel monitor what is happening in Iraq today?    [Sagi] We do our best. But this becomes more difficult as  distances grow. I would say that our ability to know what is  happening and to monitor developments in Iraq has improved  compared to the past. But we will never be able to confidently  state that we know everything. I can note with satisfaction  that in light of the intelligence need to cover every location  whenever possible, the level of cooperation between Israel and  other countries has increased.    [Peri] Are you referring to our intelligence cooperation  with the United States?    [Sagi] Yes, but not only that.    [Peri] Despite all the warnings, assessments, and  information, two IDF soldiers were killed in Lebanon this week.    [Sagi] Terrorism in Lebanon is not a new phenomenon. It is  merely the scope of terrorist activity that changes.    [Peri] Does what happened last week constitute a violation  of the understandings reached during "Operation Accountability."    [Sagi] I do not think so. It is most infuriating and  painful but the way I see things there was no violation of these  understandings, except for the firing of the katyusha rockets.  Hizballah claims, although I disagree, that operations against  the IDF and the SLA [South Lebanese Army] in the security zone  does not violate the understandings we reached. If we retaliate  against such activity, the situation will deteriorate.    [Peri] Who should restrain them?    [Sagi] The question is not who should but rather who is  capable of restraining them. Nobody made such a commitment. It  is no secret that Syria has the capability to control Hizballah  or at least restrict its actions. They know how to do this and  try to stop things from getting out of control.    [Peri] Now that we are conducting peace talks, do you  detect mental blocks or inhibitions among your staff in running  a different kind of intelligence service. Is there such a thing  as peacetime intelligence?    [Sagi] I am not familiar with such an expression. My  responsibility is to provide assessments for both the military  and political echelons. I would even say that we are  responsible for providing economic and technological information  in all fields that present a threat to Israel. Only the  integration of all these elements enables me to fulfill this  responsibility and provide intelligence assessments at the  national level.    Times have changed and sometimes the emphasis is placed on  different things. The way we collect, analyze and process  intelligence has also changed. It is the actual assessment  report itself that highlights these different aspects.    It is important to stress that the IDF Intelligence Branch's  top priority is still to give early warning about military  threats to the State of Israel. This despite, and perhaps even  because of, the political process.    The political process undoubtedly forces us to carry out a  great deal of study and research. It necessitates our deep  involvement. I would like to praise my people, who, despite the  emphasis on early warning about military threats, correctly  assessed, some three years ago, that a political shift of  strategic significance for Israel was taking place.    [Peri] Are you primed to identify signs of peace? Tomorrow  will mark the 15th anniversary of the signing of the peace  treaty with Egypt, and I remember President 'Ezer Weizman  remarking at the time that our intelligence dossiers had not  been in step with developments.    [Sagi] I think it is our duty, and not only our privilege,  to predict such developments. I think we have been successful  enough to give Israel time to adequately prepare itself.    [Peri] What has really changed in the concepts and modus  operandi of the Intelligence Branch since the start of the peace  negotiations?    [Sagi] The Intelligence Corps is a large body, and not  everyone necessarily does the same job. The integration process  takes place at the higher levels. Some people handle the  military side of things while others deal with the political  process. The higher one goes up in the Intelligence hierarchy,  the more integration is needed.    As for the threats, our intelligence package has greatly  expanded. Today, collecting intelligence on threats in Iran,  Iraq, or Libya is no longer a fantastic notion. This has a  profound impact: we have to invest heavily in people,  equipment, input, and in formulating concepts.    The political aspect requires additional  information-collection investments in people and places.  Without singing my own praises, I think we have good  intelligence. I do not believe that Israel suffers from an  intelligence block that prevents the political echelon from  making decisions.    [Peri] Did you think that the political process would be as  long, winding, complex, and complicated?    [Sagi] I said that the process would be complicated and  strewn with crises. Difficult, with many stalemates. But the  general trend I identified -- and I still adhere to my position  -- will be progress toward a political settlement. Whether or  not such a settlement will really be achieved depends on both  parties.    [Peri] What will the Middle East look like in another two  years? Will there be peace and open borders or hunger and  Islamic terrorism?    [Sagi] The fundamental problems will continue. Economic  problems will grow worse. There are very serious demographic  problems and a lack of resources. The Islamic wave has not  reached its crest yet nor has terrorist extremism.    On the other hand, additional progress will be made in the  political process which will moderate things to a certain  degree. We may reach agreement with the Arab world on issues of  joint interest.    The water problem and the military threat will remain.  However, I believe that the Arab countries will not expand  their budgets for military buildup purposes. Even Syria, which  has systematically built up its army, has not increased its  military budget.    [Peri] What about war?    [Sagi] War is still a threat in the Middle East but that  does not mean that the prospects for war have increased. On the  contrary, I think that the chances for a war in the foreseeable  future have been greatly reduced. The probability of war does  not necessarily grow if and when the political process runs into  a problem.    Nevertheless, if the political process runs aground,  developments in Syria will warrant special attention and a  higher level of interest from us.    [Peri] Who in your opinion is the most intriguing Arab  leader?    [Sagi] All of them are intriguing. However, I would say  that personally I am most interested in al-Asad. He is the Arab  leader that can have the most impact on the realization of my  assessments.    [Peri] During your tenure as head of the Intelligence  Branch, which Arab leader has made the most progress?    [Sagi] 'Arafat. It is interesting to note that he thinks  the same thing about us. He is not alone in this assumption.  There are other Arab leaders who think that Israel was the one  to come a long way.    [Peri] Which Arab country would you like to visit?    [Sagi] I would like to go everywhere. I have been to Egypt  because that is allowed.    [Peri] The hottest topic of discussion in both Israel and  the Arab world is the commission of inquiry into the Hebron  massacre. Are you following the hearings?    [Sagi] Like every other Israeli citizen.    [Peri] And as a major general in the IDF, how do you feel  about it?    [Sagi] I do not wish to comment on issues outside of my  purview.    [Peri] Where do you see yourself in another year or two?    [Sagi] I hope that I will still be functioning and in good  health.</p>

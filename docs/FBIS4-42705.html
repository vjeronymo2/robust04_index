			<p>BFN     [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl (Christian  Democratic Union -- CDU) has welcomed the declaration of the  Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] in favor of the  continuation of the Bonn coalition. "I am impressed by the high  result of FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel," Kohl said at the Christian  Democratic Union land conference in Berlin on Saturday [4 June],  referring to the vote of the FDP Federal Party Congress in  Rostock the day before. On Kinkel's initiative, a vast majority  of the liberals had advocated there the continuation of the  CDU/FDP coalition after the Bundestag election on 16 October.</p>

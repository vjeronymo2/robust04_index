			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ORIOLES POUND OUT AN 8-3 VICTORY OVER RYAN AND THE RANGERS IN OPENER  </P> <P> The Baltimore Orioles continued their mastery of Nolan Ryan Thursday night,  improving to 9-0 in Ryan's last 12 starts against them, with an 8-3 victory  over the Texas Rangers in the first game of a doubleheader.  </P> <P> Mike Devereaux hit a three-run homer and knocked in five runs for the Orioles,  who saw 16 players go down on strikeouts, including Phil Bradley five times.  </P> <P> The Rangers used a club-record 23 players, including six pitchers.  </P> <P> Ryan (15-10) allowed seven runs and nine hits, both season-highs, walked four  and struck out 10 in 6 1/3 innings. With only four remaining starts likely,  Ryan's hopes for a 20-win season are virtually over.  </P> <P> The Orioles raised their record against the Rangers this season to 7-1 and have  beaten Ryan all three times they've faced him.  </P> <P> Ryan only trailed, 4-3, in the seventh, but he'd thrown 130 pitches over six  innings and was arm-weary.  </P> <P> Ryan struck out the side in the fourth, the 300th time he has done so in his  career.  </P> <P> Toronto 12, Cleveland 4 -- George Bell hit a three-run double and Lloyd Moseby  had three hits, including a leadoff home run as the Blue Jays beat the Indians  in a rain-delayed game at Cleveland.  </P> <P> Mookie Wilson also had three of the Blue Jays' 17 hits.  </P> <P> John Cerutti (11-8) gave up two runs on five hits in five innings. Both runs  and four of the hits came in the fifth, immediately after a thunderstorm  interrupted the game for 1 hour 33 minutes.  </P> <P> Jim Acker pitched the sixth, allowing Paul Zuvella's solo homer, and he was  followed by three relievers.  </P> <P> Tom Candiotti (12-8) lasted only 1 1/3 innings, giving up five runs on six  hits.  </P> <P> New York 6, Seattle 4 -- Don Mattingly's two-run single keyed a six-run rally  in the eighth inning as the Yankees rallied to beat the Mariners at Seattle for  their eighth straight victory.  </P> <P> With New York trailing, 3-0, in the eighth, Steve Balboni drew a leadoff walk  and Seattle starter Scott Bankhead was relieved by Mike Schooler.  </P> <P> Schooler (1-6) walked two batters and allowed a run to score on a wild pitch.  After a groundout, pinch-hitter Don Slaught singled home a run to make it 3-2  before Steve Sax's bloop single to right tied the game.  </P> <P> Alvaro Espinoza singled to load the bases and sent Schooler from the game in  favor of Keith Comstock. Mattingly, hitting in his 12th straight game, greeted  Comstock with a single to give the Yankees a 5-3 lead, and Balboni followed  with a sacrifice fly for the final Yankee run.  </P> <P> Goose Gossage (1-0) pitched one-third of an inning in the seventh to earn his  first American League victory since Oct. 1, 1983.  </P> <P> Lance McCullers gave up a run-scoring groundout to Dave Valle in the eighth for  Seattle's final run before Dave Righetti came on in the ninth for his 23rd  save.  </P></p>

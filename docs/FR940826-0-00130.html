AIDE recommends that short-form applications not require and certification of financial qualification. If an application become mutually exclusive, according to AIDE, the applicant's payment of its winning bid would demonstrate that it was financially qualified. If the application did not become mutually exclusive, then the applicant should have a short period in which to file any required demonstration of financial qualifications by amendment. <FOOTCITE>105</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 105 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> AIDE Petition at 19&hyph;20. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 63.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We believe that, in order to prevent the delay in bringing service to the public that might be occasioned by bankruptcies or by prolonged financial negotiations, it is important to require licensee to have the financial ability to construct and operate a system in addition to being able to purchase the license. Consequently we will continue to require applicants to certify on their short-form applications that they meet any existing financial qualification requirements of the services in which licenses are auctioned. We will not, however, impose additional showings of financial qualification as part of the auction process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

Introduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 64. Several provisions of the Budget Act address participation by small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by women and minorities (referred to collectively as ``designated entities'') in the competitive bidding process and in the provision of spectrum-based services. Specifically, Section 309(j)(4)(D) of the Act, provides that, in prescribing competitive bidding regulations, the Commission shall,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> inter alia, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women are given the opportunity to participate in the provision of spectrum-based services, and, for such purposes, consider the use of tax certificates, bidding preferences, and other procedures&blank;*&blank;*&blank;* <FOOTCITE>106</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 106 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 47 U.S.C. &sect;309(j)(4)(D). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, section 309(j)(3)(B), provides that in establishing eligibility criteria and bidding methodologies the Commission shall seek to promote the objectives of ``economic opportunity and competition and ensur[e] that new and innovative technologies are readily accessible to the American people by avoiding excessive concentration of licenses and by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants, including small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women.'' To promote these objectives, section 309(j)(4)(A) expressly states that the Commission is required ``to consider *&blank;*&blank;* alternative payment schedules and methods of calculation, including lump sums or guaranteed installment payments, with or without royalty payments, or other schedules or methods.'' <FOOTCITE>107</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 107 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See also <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  47 U.S.C. &sect;309(j)(4)(C)(ii), requiring the Commission, when prescribing area designations and bandwidth assignments, to promote ``economic opportunity for a wide variety of applicants, including small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women''; section 309(j)(3)(A), establishing the objective to promote ``the development and rapid deployment of new technologies, products, and services for the benefit of the public, including those residing in rural areas, without administrative or judicial delays''; section 309(j)(12)(D)(iv), requiring that the Commission's 1997 report to Congress evaluate,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> inter alia, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  whether and to what extent ``small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women wee able to participate successfully in the competitive bidding process.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 65. In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Second Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  we adopted a broad menu of provisions that the Commission might employ to implement these statutory provisions. We adopted general provisions and eligibility rules designed to ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and/or women were afforded the opportunity to participate in both the competitive bidding process and in the provision of spectrum-based services. Specifically, we provide that small businesses (including those owned by women and/or minorities and rural telephone companies) that are winning bidders for certain blocks of spectrum could pay in installments over the term of their licenses. We also indicated that rural telephone companies may be eligible for bidding credits for licenses obtained in their service areas if they make an additional infrastructure build-our commitment beyond any existing performance requirements. We indicated that bidding credits may be available to designated entities on certain frequency blocks. In addition, we retained the option of establishing set-aside spectrum in certain services, in which eligibility to bid may be limited to some or all designated entities. Finally, we stated that we would consider the use of tax certificates as a means of creating incentives both for designated entities to attract capital from non-controlling investors and to encourage licensees to assign licenses to designated entities in post-auction transactions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 66. In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Second Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  we recognized that the provisions applicable to particular designated entities would vary depending on the nature of each individual service. For example, we retained the discretion to modify our general designated entity provisions for capital intensive services such as broadband PCS. In this regard, we stated that we would evaluate on a service-specific basis the capital requirements and other characteristics of the service to determine the appropriate provisions. We continue to believe that it is essential for the Commission to retain flexibility to select, and if necessary to modify, the general designated entity provisions and eligibility requirements on a service-specific basis depending on the capital requirements and construction costs of the particular service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> B.

Petitioners' proposals include requests that the Commission amend its definition of ``rural telephone company'' (1) to expressly include municipal- and government-owned telephone companies within the ``rural telephone company'' definition in accordance with the earlier Senate version of the Budget Act, <FOOTCITE>110</FOOTCITE>  (2) to define ``rural telephone company'' as a local exchange carrier with annual revenues of less than $100 million or serving no more than 100,000 access lines; <FOOTCITE>111</FOOTCITE>  and (3) to include within the definition of ``independently owned and operated'' LECs that either operate 50,000 access lines or less serve communities of 10,000 or fewer inhabitants. <FOOTCITE>112</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 104 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Anchorage Telephone Utility (ATU) Petition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 111 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Petitions of The National Telephone Cooperative Association (NTCA), South Dakota Network, Inc.

In addition, Blooston, Mordkofsky, Jackson &amp; Dickens (Blooston) and South Dakota Networks, Inc. (SDN) request that the Commission eliminate the term ``independently owned and operated'' from the definition of ``rural telephone company.'' According to Blooston, this restriction is unnecessary to prevent the largest telephone companies from taking advantage of provisions provided for rural telephone companies, since this same purpose is already served by the 50,000 access line limit, Blooston argues the Commission should amend its eligibility rules to indicate that they include the access lines of affiliates. Similarly, SDN indicates that the Commission should include ``and affiliates'' after ``50,000 or fewer access lines'' in the current definition. SDN maintains that the current language penalizes holding companies structured to permit telephone companies to offer paging and other nonregulated services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

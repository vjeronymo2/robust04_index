This morning's ceremony was attended by some provincial  leaders, including [provincial party committee Secretary] Guan  Guangfu, Ding Fengying, Wang Zhongnong, Wang Shengtie, Zhen  Guocheng, Xiao Quantao, and Xu Xiaochun; some retired veteran  comrades including Han Ningfu, Kong Qingde, Liu Huinong, Zhang  Xueqi, Shi Chuan and Tian Ying; and some other people.

The fund pledges to fulfill such tasks as mobilizing and  organizing overseas and domestic people from all walks of life,  Overseas Chinese, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan compatriots,  friendly people from all over the world, as well as overseas and  domestic social organizations, enterprises, and undertakings to  voluntarily donate and raise through a variety of channels,  funds to help Hubei's poverty-stricken old liberated areas shake  off poverty, achieve prosperity, and turn into spiritually and  materially civilized areas.    At this morning's ceremony, Wang Liying was elected  chairman.  Guan Guangfu, Han Ningfu, Zhang Caiqian, Liu Huinong, Xu Qingde,  Zhang Xiulong, Shen Yinluo, Chen Ming, and Jiang Yi were elected  honorary chairmen.    Guan Guangfu delivered a speech in which he said: On behalf  of the Hubei Provincial CPC Committee and People's Government, I  would like to extend warm congratulations to the newly  established fund as well as heartfelt thanks to retired veteran  leaders, veteran comrades, and people from all walks of life in  society for their unreserved concern for the old liberated areas  development.    Guan Guangfu stated: The provincial party committee and  people's government have been concerned about the backward  situation in the old liberated areas and have always attached  great importance to, and made continued efforts to push ahead  with, the old liberated areas development. Nonetheless, due to  lack of construction funds, Hubei's old liberated areas  development has lagged far behind other areas in the province.    Guan Guangfu expressed the hope that all areas, departments,  professions, and trades across the province, and people from all  walks of life in society, will show continued concern, support,  and assistance for Hubei's old liberated areas development; show  concern for, attach importance to, and provide assistance to  each and every investment activity developed by the newly  established fund; and join hands in promoting Hubei's  poverty-stricken old liberated areas development.    In the end, a total of 25 provincial leaders, retired  veteran  comrades, and persons in charge of the various departments  concerned, including Guan Guangfu, Ding Fengying, Wang  Zhongnong, Wang Shengtie, Zhen Guocheng, Han Ningfu, Kong  Qingde, Liu Huinong, Zhang Xueqi, Wang Liying, and others,  became the first group of people to donate cash to the newly  established fund.</p>

			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / UK Company News: CRS sees little sign of any significant high street recovery CO-OPERATIVE Retail Services, the largest retailing society in Europe, lifted sales last year but warned there was no evidence of recovery on the high street. Mr Harry Moore, chief executive, said: 'We have seen no sign of any significant improvement since the election and believe the climb out of recession will be very gentle indeed.' CRS reported a surplus before distribution of Pounds 33.2m (Pounds 30.6m) in the year to January 25. Turnover increased 9.2 per cent to Pounds 1.5bn. Net sales, which take account of VAT, were 8.2 per cent higher at Pounds 1.39bn. Mr Moore said the results were due to higher margins and contained costs. Trading margins improved from 3.5 per cent to 3.7 per cent helped by an improved mix of foods sold, but are still well below those achieved by retailing rivals. Food sales, which include the Leo's, Stop &amp; Shop and Pioneer chains, increased 9.8 per cent to Pounds 1.04bn. Non-food sales, covering the Living department stores, funeral and dairy services, rose 5.1 per cent to Pounds 200m. Interest costs increased to Pounds 18.9m (Pounds 14.3m) on net borrowings of Pounds 164m (Pounds 130.4m) taken out to finance expansion and new retailing technology. Gearing rose to 58 per cent (51 per cent) but will fall to 34 per cent after the sale of the dairy division to MD Foods, expected to be completed 'within weeks'. There was an operating surplus of Pounds 22.3m (Pounds 19.9m). Net exceptional charges of Pounds 638,000 (exceptional profit Pounds 6.22m) included Pounds 5.61m in redundancy and re-organisation costs from bringing distribution into three central warehouses. The exceptionals meant a reduced surplus before tax of Pounds 21.6m (Pounds 26.1m). The retained surplus was Pounds 20.6m (Pounds 22.6m).</p>

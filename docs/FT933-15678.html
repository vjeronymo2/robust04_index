			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Finance ministers warn of crisis in jobs and growth THE WORLD'S leading economies face a long-term crisis of slow growth and rising unemployment which will not be solved by macro-economic policies or by deregulation to free up markets, according to a report which was agreed yesterday by the finance ministers from the G7 countries. The report says that the G7 economies need greater wage flexibility and more active labour market policies for training as well as changes to national social insurance schemes which discourage job creation. The high cost of healthcare and the ageing of most populations means stronger control over health spending will be required along with greater competition in the provision of medical services to reduce costs. Mr John Major, the prime minister, said each G7 country had to take unpopular but necessary steps to keep in check growing social security budgets. He said Britain's social security spending was rising at 3 per cent per year in real terms after a sevenfold increase since 1945. He warned that this growth was structural, the product of Britain's ageing population and widening entitlements to benefits. By the year 2030, for every 10 pensioners there would be only 24 people of working age, compared with 34 today. The confidential report, which will be discussed by the G7 heads of state later today, suggests the G7 economies are facing structural obstacles which have undermined their long-term potential for growth. It calls on the G7 to build on macro-economic policies by co-operating to tackle common issues such as high healthcare costs and policies to promote training. Unlike previous G7 statements on structural issues, the manifesto for structural reform does not simply call for deregulation to free up markets. In a marked change of tone, which reflects the involvement of the Clinton administration, the manifesto casts doubt on the benefits of financial deregulation and argues for more active public policies, particularly in the field of education and training. The need to reduce unemployment was the main issue discussed yesterday by the heads of state and finance ministers in their afternoon meetings. Japan, as the G7 summit host, has argued that to head off mounting protectionism pressures bred by high unemployment, structural reforms are vital to revive growth. The approach is also likely to win backing from US president Bill Clinton who has called for an international ministerial meeting on employment creation. The report will form the core of the economic declaration to be adopted at the summit today.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Observer: Expense accounts Psst. Wanna sell a bank? Just when the City thought that the bottom had fallen out of the second-hand merchant bank market, along come some cheery customers from South Africa. Over the years lots of firms - ranging from the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation to the TSB - have been tempted to buy a prestigious City merchant bank and have not always been pleased with the outcome. However, it seems that even in the depths of a recession there are still people prepared to pay good money for less than prestigious London merchant banks. Barclays Bank, which rescued the loss-making Allied Trust Bank in 1990, has just sold it for Pounds 25m to South Africa's Investec Bank, and Barclays' old South African subsidiary, First National Bank, is said to be close to paying Pounds 50m for Henry Ansbacher, which lost Pounds 8.2m last year. Why are the South Africans so interested in these outfits? Most foreign banks coming to London open branches. But not South Africa's banks, it seems. This week, for example, Standard Bank has opened its new London subsidiary with capital of Pounds 35m. If it had a branch it wouldn't have had to invest this kind of money because it could have traded off the back of its parent's large South African capital base. Perhaps the Bank of England feels that it should only give new London banking licences to South African entrants who are prepared properly to capitalise their London business. If so, buying Henry Ansbacher and Allied Trust Bank makes some sense if they can be bought at a substantial discount to net asset value.</p>

			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / EC defies itself and edges away from tele-scrutiny: Danes frustrated at blocks on EC debates on TV THE European Community's much-heralded decision at December's Edinburgh summit to open up decision-making to greater public scrutiny is being blocked by several states, to the consternation of the Danish presidency. After the initial fanfare that greeted the televising of parts of three council of ministers meetings in February, Danish plans to broadcast debates in three EC ministerial meetings this month were vetoed. Denmark has put down three more debates for TV access next Monday and Tuesday. The member states' ambassadors to the EC will decide, probably tomorrow, whether to agree to their request, in what is being seen as a test of whether the 'openness' policy is substance or sham. Denmark is anxious to demonstrate to its own people that there has been a change in the EC's secretive decision-making, before Danes get their second chance to ratify the Maastricht treaty on May 18. Part of the reason they voted it down last June, Danish officials say, was fear that more and more decisions affecting them were being taken behind closed doors in Brussels. February's TV debut covered foreign ministers delivering set-piece speeches on the year ahead, and EC finance ministers did much the same at a later council. At the end of February, agriculture ministers submitted gracelessly to having their posturing on this year's farm price package partially televised, but felt bounced into accepting the cameras by Danish pressure. 'It was felt this was not the way to prepare people for more of this; they felt set up,' said one EC diplomat. Belgium, Portugal and Luxembourg - the member states most sceptical of the exercise - blocked Danish suggestions for televising debates this month on the development of EC transport policy, the EC strategy on global warming, and policing of the common fisheries policy. They were supported passively by what one EC diplomat called 'semi-silent voices' on the openness issue. The Danish presidency has got agreement that the opening of Norway's EC accession negotiations will be televised at next Monday's foreign ministers' meeting in Luxembourg. But the Danes also want TV access for a ministerial debate on the same day on how to make the EC internal market work, and, on the following day, for a discussion on 'employment and social dialogue' - which means the involvement of employers and trade unions in EC decision-making. 'Edinburgh' - where it was decided unanimously that important policy debates and new legislative proposals should be televised - 'should be implemented,' a senior Danish official says. But diplomats from member states which are middle-of-the-road on 'transparency' say little headway has been made on Denmark's latest demands. The UK, in particular, is reticent about the employment debate. From the Danish standpoint, the worst outcome might be agreement on broadcasting the internal market debate, but not the employment debate. This might confirm to Danish voters that the EC cares little about the issues to which they give priority, such as social policy and the environment.</p>

			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / King Midas ends his golden reign / A look at the sudden resignation of Lord Stevens as chief executive of Invesco MIM LORD Stevens has been the City of London's diminutive King Midas for most of his 30-year financial career. He built Invesco MIM into one of the City's biggest fund management groups with more than Pounds 30bn under its control. Along the way, he became a press baron, as chairman of United Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Express, and received a peerage in 1987 from the then prime minister, Mrs Margaret Thatcher, for his loyalty to the Conservative Party. But his sudden resignation yesterday as chief executive of Invesco MIM comes at the end of a less than golden year for the financier. Invesco's share price has fallen from 111p last September to 66p yesterday. However, shares in Drayton Consolidated, an investment trust managed by Invesco and also chaired by Lord Stevens, have been falling further for longer. They closed yesterday at 170p, compared with their five-year high of 586p which was touched in September 1989. Drayton has a substantial portfolio of unquoted investments and some of these have fallen sharply in value. As a result, the merchant bank County Bank and the stockbrokers Cazenove have been reviewing Drayton with a view to proposing reconstruction. An Invesco board member said yesterday that the poor performance of Drayton was the main reason for Lord Stevens' resignation from Invesco. Lord Stevens, pictured above, has been Drayton's chairman for 12 years and on its board since 1968. The Drayton problems have been particularly unwelcome for Invesco because they come at a time when it has been dogged by adverse publicity concerning its role as a manager of pension funds for the Maxwell empire. The company is convinced that it has done nothing improper in its work for Maxwell. However, the Invesco director says that the Maxwell relationship has unsettled the group's clients and potential clients. Lord Stevens had a series of business dealings with Mr Robert Maxwell in the 1980s. For a while they appeared to be mirror images of each other. Mr Maxwell was a media tycoon with a penchant for taking stakes in merchant banks and invest-ment groups. Lord Stevens was a financier who took the helm of a powerful newspaper group. In 1985, Mr Maxwell sold a stake in Fleet Holdings, the owner of Express Newspapers, to United Newspapers, which was the platform for United's subsequent bid for Express. Then in 1986, they each bought a stake in Britannia Arrow, the fund management group, and succeeded in blocking the bid for Britannia from merchant bank Guinness Peat. Then, Britannia itself bought the fund management group run by Lord Stevens, creating the corporate vehicle subsequently rechristened as Invesco MIM - whose employees today have mixed feelings about the Maxwell link.</p>

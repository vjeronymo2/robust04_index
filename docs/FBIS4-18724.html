			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] BUJUMBURA, April 8 (AFP) - Ethnic bloodletting  in the Rwandan capital continued on Friday [8 April] following  the death of the president in a plane crash and killing of the  prime minister, a Kigali journalist said Friday. [passage  omitted]    A Belgian government official in Brussels confirmed the  fighting in Kigali between the the Rwandan Patriotic Front and  army troops.    He said the Belgian cabinet would probably meet later Friday  to decide whether to evacuate Belgian civilians from Rwanda,  what troops to provide for the operation and how to coordinate  the operation with the United Nations.    The official, who asked not to be identified, said: "It is  difficult to assess the scale of the fighting. Nobody can leave  their homes to find out what is going on."    He said the timing of the Belgian cabinet meeting would  depend on the return here of Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc  Dehaene from vacation in Malta and Foreign Minister Willy Claes  from an official visit to Romania.    Ten Belgian UN peacekeepers were executed in Kigali on  Thursday after trying to protect Rwandan Prime Minister Agathe  Uwilingiyimana from elements of the Rwandan presidential guard,  their commander, Colonel Luc Marchal, said.    The prime minister was assassinated. There are between 400  and 500 Belgians in the 2,500-strong United Nations force in  Rwanda.</p>

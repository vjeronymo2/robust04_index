Relatively many have experienced losses. In  particular, year after year those with major losses have  depended on state subsidies to get by. This has become a huge  burden for Lhasa. It has gotten so serious that fiscal revenues  are out of breath. In line with the establishment of a socialist  market economy, what is the present situation of enterprise  production (operation) in Lhasa?    According to Lhasa Economic Committee statistics, from  January to September 1993, the total accumulated gross output  value of industrial enterprises in Lhasa (in fixed 1990 prices)  was 26.1082 million yuan, up 4.17 percent over the same period  of 1992, and accounting for completion of 74.70 percent of the  annual plan; of which, 13 industrial enterprises subordinate to  Lhasa city accounted for 15.0163 million yuan, completion of  80.47 percent of the annual plan. County-subordinate industrial  enterprises completed 450,200 yuan, up 105.76 percent over the  same period in 1992. From January to September, industrial  enterprises throughout the city accumulated total product sales  reaching 27.7651 million yuan (excluding county-subordinate  industrial enterprises). Of which, the Chengguan District  Minority Handicraft Industrial Enterprise accounted for 11.6031  million yuan, up 28.17 percent over the same period in 1992.  From January to September, industrial enterprises throughout  Lhasa had clearly improved economic results, realizing profits  of 2.09 million yuan (excluding county-subordinate industrial  enterprises), up 29.81 percent over the same period in 1992.  Twenty-six minority handicraft industries in the Chengguan  region had rather good economic results, realizing profits of  1.402 million yuan, up 38.13 percent over the same period in  1992. From January to September, two Lhasa-subordinate transport  enterprises transported a total of 6,474.3 tons, up 17.61  percent over the same period in 1992. They had a weekly  transport volume of 4.92 million ton-kilometers, up 23.93  percent over the same period in 1992, for a total income of  1.361 million yuan, up 79.31 percent over the same period in  1992. Economic efficiency is clearly up. The enterprise  production situation is pleasing.    For many years, because they were fettered by the old  system,  enterprises in Lhasa were unable to break out thoroughly from  "big rice bowl, iron rice bowl" conditions. They were unable to  motivate fully the enthusiasm of enterprise workers.  Furthermore, the dependent mentality of enterprises to "wait,  depend on and demand" was rather serious. There was much talk of  objective causes, little search for subjective differences. The  subjective capabilities of enterprises could not be brought into  play. Reliance on government was rampant. Some enterprises even  relied on state fiscal subsidies or bank loans to get by. This  was a burden on state finances. Enterprises owing bank loans had  no way to repay on time. The burden became more serious year  after year and enterprises became ever poorer. They have never  been able to stand on their own feet.    Given the difficulties and problems enterprises face, in the  process of implementing the spirit of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  southern tour and the party's 14th Plenum, the Lhasa Committee  of the Communist Party of China and the Lhasa people's  government summarized enterprises' existing problems. They  believe that to get enterprises out of difficulty requires great  effort to further deepen enterprise reform and strengthen the  operational mechanism of enterprises while improving economic  results. Toward this end, they formulated specific implementing  methods to enact the State Council's and Autonomous Regions'  regulations regarding transforming the operational mechanisms of  state-run industrial enterprises. To deepen enterprise reform,  leading cadres of the Lhasa Committee and the Lhasa government  along with sectors managing enterprises actively transformed  functions, performed services well, deepened survey research on  each enterprise, grasped major current problems of enterprises  and helped them resolve major contradictions. To reform  enterprise work methods, they implemented reforms aimed at  leadership and guidance, leading enterprises toward the market  to participate in market competition and enhance  competitiveness. At the same time enterprises throughout Lhasa  commonly held big discussions on "liberating thinking, changing  thought patterns, seeking differences, seizing good  opportunities and deepening reform." Thus they made enterprises  recognize that reform was the only way out. Based on minority  handicraft industry market economy development trends, the  Chengguan Regional People's Government and Economic Committee  transformed and merged 34 former minority handicraft enterprises  into 26. They expanded the enterprise scale of production  (operations) and went after hot selling products, enhancing the  enterprises' ability to adapt to and compete on the market. At  the same time various enterprises further perfected internal  contract responsibility systems. According to a survey, 13  Lhasa-subordinate industrial enterprises and 26 minority  handicraft industries all implemented various forms of contract  and target responsibility systems, putting each economic target  concretely on the workshop, the small group and the individual.  They thoroughly reorganized the "big rice bowl," smashed the  "iron rice bowl," turning pressure into a motive force and fully  motivating the enthusiasm of enterprise management personnel and  production (operation) workers. After smashing the "big rice  bowl," transport enterprises tightly captured good opportunities  in the transport market. They actively organized resources,  "putting down their bowls to find rice [searching out work to  do]," making rational allocations, fully uncovering potential  and thinking of every possible way and means to improve existing  transport equipment utilization rates and make transport  production good for the future.    Due to deepened reform and ferreting out enterprise  potential, they further enhanced the role of subjective  enterprise potential. In a timely manner various enterprises  seized economic markets, actively introduced technology,  increased the colors and varieties of products and augmented  vitality. The output value and efficiency clearly rose in five  Lhasa-subordinate industrial enterprises: the Lhasa wood article  plant, carpet factory, handicraft and artworks plant, food and  oil processing plant, and clothing company. In particular, by  the end of September 1993 the food and oil processing plant had  already surpassed its entire annual production task and each  economic target. At the same time, various enterprises actively  began movements to save energy and expenses and create income.  Under conditions of the changeover from the old to new economic  system, intense market competition, higher prices on various raw  materials, and a shortage of circulating funds, enterprises  throughout Lhasa strive to reduce product costs, do all they can  to shrink nonproduction expenses, expand product sales and  reduce inventories. Product costs fell to various degrees and  economic efficiency rose at five enterprises: the Lhasa mining  company, cement manufacturing plant, wood articles plant,  handicraft and art products plant, and the East Wind sideline  food products plant.</p>

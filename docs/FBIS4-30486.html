			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Hitotsubashi University Professor Yukio </F> Noguchi by unidentified reporter; place and date not given:  "Loan Shark Who Lives in Shack"]    [Text] There are signs that the Japanese economy is finally  making a recovery from the collapse of the bubble, but it has no  time to take a breather. The reason is that Japan is faced with  a bevy of crucial future issues such as welfare and attendant  fiscal burden based on the imminent arrival of an aged society,  industrial infrastructure and international relations. We asked  experts how they would portray visions of the Japanese economy.    [Boxed item: "Basic Public Works Investment  Program." The Social Infrastructure Construction Program  was approved by the government in June 1990 in response to  requests from the United States for expansion of domestic demand  during the Japan-U.S. Structural Impediments Initiative talks.  The program called for public works investments totaling about  430 trillion yen during a 10-year period beginning in fiscal  year 1991 and ending in fiscal year 2000. The report released in  December 1993 by the prime minister's private advisory organ  known as Economic Reform Research Council and the outline of  external economic reforms issued by the government in March of  this year indicate that a final decision will be made in June,  including provision for funding. Sources suggest that the  government will ask the private sector to augment government  programs by a total of 100 trillion yen.]    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] I see that you described Japan as "a loan  shark that lives in a shack" in your book, An Outline for  Reform of the Japanese Economy.    [Noguchi] The reason why the Japanese current trade surplus  is so huge is that there is an absence of domestic investments  which offset the high savings rate. The difference between  savings and domestic investments represents the surplus in the  recurring balance of payments and, while that difference is  invested overseas, Japan's social infrastructure remains  impoverished. In other words, Japan lives in a shack while it  practices its role as a loan shark. We should alter this  situation by rechanneling overseas investments to Japan and  improving our living conditions. The end result of such action  will be a reduction in the surplus in balance of payments.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What actions should we take in specific  terms?    [Noguchi] In Japan, social infrastructure affecting living  conditions such as sewage, road and park systems, and commuter  railways still exist in a meager state. We should improve those  systems while savings rates are still high. If we wait until the  arrival of the aged society and when savings rates have fallen,  it will be too late.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Wouldn't it be adequate to stimulate  private-sector investment through deregulation, without relying  on public works spending?    [Noguchi] Your suggested approach would be adequate if we  were speaking of merely reducing balance of payments surpluses  by equalizing savings and investments, but our ultimate goal  should be an improvement in our living standards. Attainment of  that goal will require a revision of the basic public works  program and a bold expansion of public works investment.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The Economic Reform Council's report  stipulates as a prerequisite of improvement in social capital,  "the provision of funding which will not leave a legacy of debt  for future generations."    [Noguchi] Logic says that if you use government bonds to  fund  public works projects, you will leave a legacy of debt for  future generations. However, if restrictions relative thereto  are imposed, a huge tax increase will be required and it will  become impossible to implement that which is required. It is the  obligation of our generation to build a quality social  infrastructure and leave it as a legacy for future generations.  It would be acceptable to issue government bonds for that  purpose.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] However, wouldn't that result in leaving  unpaid bills for payment by future generations?    [Noguchi] Many people think that government bonds, like  household debt, leave the need to repay debt at a future date,  but this is a major misunderstanding. Government bonds represent  a household debt like the husband borrowing from the wife and  differs in substance from a situation in which a household  borrows from outside sources. The redemption of government bonds  provides for repayment of debt to a nation's citizens. Thus,  government bonds do not represent a legacy of debt for the  nation as a whole. Redemption of government bonds will have to  be handled through modest future tax increases, but such  measures would be appropriate from the standpoint of equitable  distribution of fiscal burdens.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The Ministry of Finance has stated that it  already faces a financial crisis in the current situation  wherein the government bond balance has exceeded 200 trillion  yen.    [Noguchi] The ratio of government bond balances outstanding  rose sharply against the gross national product (GNP) from the  1970's to the 1980's. I believe the risk of financial failure  existed during those years. However, since the 1980's, the ratio  of the balances against GNP has fallen. Accordingly, fiscal  deficits are not a very serious problem. It is only logical that  fiscal authorities concern themselves about expansion of  deficits, but the problem lies in converting such concerns  directly into government policy.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The viewpoint exists that Japan's  balance-of-payments surplus is a valuable resource.    [Noguchi] Since we exist in a situation where insufficient  savings is a worldwide problem, Japan's surpluses play an  unmistakable role in international society. Thus, if Japan were  to reduce its surpluses as well as overseas investments, the  money supply and demand situation would tighten and interests  rates would rise in foreign nations. However, notwithstanding  the potential for such a situation, there is a need to reduce  balance-of-payments surpluses to take enhancement measures  relative to our living standards. I believe that "reduction of  balance of payments surpluses for the sake of international  coordination" represents a conceptual misinterpretation of  substantive issues.</p>

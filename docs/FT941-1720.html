			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Bath bypass protestors threaten to escalate action Protestors against a bypass near Bath threatened yesterday to turn their action into a repeat of the Twyford Down campaign against a motorway in Hampshire. Demonstrators against the Batheaston and Swainswick bypass climbed on construction equipment and occupied empty houses to try to prevent work starting. Several arrests have been made including one yesterday for breach of the peace. The bypass cuts through Solsbury Hill, a bronze age settlement.</p>

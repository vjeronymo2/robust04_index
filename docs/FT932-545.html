			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Bank under pressure THE German Bundesbank will find itself in the international firing line again this week as its European partners pile on the pressure for lower German interest rates ahead of its council meeting on Thursday, writes Gillian Tett. In spite of the continued inflationary pressures in Germany, there is speculation that the forthcoming G-7 summit might prod the Bundesbank into action. But with the D-Mark continuing to soften against the dollar and European currencies, the markets remain wary of predicting how fast or how far the Bundesbank might move. Following French calls for a concerted interest rate cut last week, the markets will be watching the Bank of France closely to see whether it is prepared to instigate any further independent rate cuts. With French official rates now below German rates for the first time in 26 years, many economists doubt that France could implement rapid cuts in the face of continuing Bundesbank intransigence. Nevertheless, the deepening recession in France has led some observers to interpret last week's statements by Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French finance minister, as an indication that France might be willing to move ahead with bold rate cuts. 'All this puts the focus on the extent to which the French really need the Germans to cut their rates,' said Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist with Midland Global Markets. Following the slight weakening of the French franc late last week, there are fears that any rapid move could trigger selling of the French currency. The yen is expected to remain volatile in the run up to the Japanese general election, in spite of bouncing back from some its earlier losses last week. Continuing tension over Japan's huge trade surplus with the US is expected to make the yen-dollar rate sensitive to speculative movements ahead of next week's G7 summit in Tokyo.</p>

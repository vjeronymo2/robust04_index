			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hamas official spokesman Muhammad Nazzal by </F> Tal'at Rumayh and Mahmud Bakri in Khartoum in early December]    [Text] [AL-SHA'B] Brother Muhammad Nazzal, since the  signing of the Declaration of Principles called the Gaza-Jericho  agreement, the question that keeps coming up is: What is Hamas'  position on the representative institutions that will be elected  after the implementation of the agreement?    [Nazzal] Hamas' decision is to boycott and not participate  in  the autonomy elections. This is because these elections are an  inseparable part of the Gaza-Jericho plan. Hamas believes this  plan eradicates the Palestinian cause. Consequently, not  participating in these elections is harmonious with our  rejection of this political plan.    [AL-SHA'B] However, there are those who demand that you act  as an opposition within these Palestinian institutions. What is  your reply? How do you envisage the intifadah under these new  conditions?    [Nazzal] Hamas' opposition to this agreement is continuous.  We do not believe there can be opposition through participation  in these institutions. It is our opinion that participation in  these elections is an acknowledgement and a tacit recognition of  the legitimacy of this agreement. The issue is not related to  an existing political system but concerns the land and the  homeland.    As for the intifadah, it can be clearly seen that the  military action has escalated quite a lot. It is clear that the  number of Israeli casualties is constantly increasing. Perhaps  it is one of the few times in which the number of Palestinian  martyrs is equal to the number of dead Israelis.    [AL-SHA'B] This has caused great apprehensions about the  possibility of Palestinian infighting as a result of this wide  gap in positions. What practical measures have you taken to  prevent this infighting?    [Nazzal] We believe the other side [PLO] is required to  prove its good intentions regarding infighting. For our part,  we have reiterated that we are against Palestinian fratricide.  Political assassination is not our course. It is the other side  that has issued threats and statements.    Therefore, the other side is required to prove its good  intentions. For our part, an indication of our good intentions  is that during the long course of the negotiations Hamas has not  harmed any of the Palestinian negotiating delegation's members.  We have issued no threats against anyone. Hamas has not  assassinated any Palestinian for political reasons.    [AL-SHA'B] Shaykh Ahmad Yasin [Hamas leader now in Israeli  jail] has recently sent several letters to Hamas which some  lawyers believe contain directives to the Hamas leadership to  adopt other means of struggle.    [Nazzal] Shaykh Ahmad Yasin's letters are clear and have  been published by the media. He has clearly stated that he  supports the continuation of military action against the  occupation and the continuation of the resistance. He has  answered some questions that Hamas has submitted to him, seeking  his view on them. I do not believe there is disagreement. The  escalation of the confrontation against the occupation is  unanimously supported by all Hamas quarters.    [AL-SHA'B] What is your current status in the unified  leadership of the intifadah?    [Nazzal] Hamas has never been a part of the so-called  national leadership of the intifadah. This leadership was  comprised of the parties participating in the PLO, namely the  Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the Democratic  Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the People's Party, and  the Fatah movement. However, after the signing of the  Gaza-Jericho agreement, Fatah and the People's Party withdrew  from the unified national leadership in compliance with  'Arafat's commitment to halt the intifadah. Thus, the unified  national leadership has ceased to exist from the theoretical  point of view. Moreover, it has also ceased to exist from the  practical point of view, since the start of the negotiations in  Madrid.    Following the Gaza-Jericho agreement, the 10 factions have  decided to form the so-called national and Islamic leadership of  the intifadah. This leadership will comprise the 10 factions'  forces in the occupied territories. This leadership exists and  we are a member of it. However, so far no final formula has  been formulated for the work mechanism of this leadership.  However, there is a real determination on our party to work  through this leadership in the near future.    [AL-SHA'B] How do you evaluate the relationship between you  and these factions, especially as there are huge ideological  differences among you? Some analysts believe your agreement  with them will not last long.    [Nazzal] The 10 factions are a formula that has existed  despite the presence of ideological and political differences.  The 10 factions do not share the same view regarding a  settlement. Some factions believe in a political settlement.  The 10 factions agree on their stand on the current settlement  which is based on the Madrid conference. They agree on the need  for the intifadah to continue. Therefore, we can say there is  an agreement on a minimum common denominator.    [AL-SHA'B] Within the Islamic circle, is there coordination  between you and the Islamic Jihad?    [Nazzal] In principle, we have no reservations about  cooperating with any Palestinian group calling for the  continuation of the resistance against occupation and rejecting  the current plan. Hence, our hands are extended to all Islamic  and non-Islamic Palestinian forces.    [AL-SHA'B] Does this mean there is no joint coordination  within the Islamic ranks in particular?    [Nazzal] There is coordination with the Islamic Jihad within  the framework of the 10 factions.    [AL-SHA'B] How do you see the next phase?    [Nazzal] I can say that as far as we are concerned, the  resistance must continue in the next phase. We believe the  continuation of the resistance will keep the Palestinian issue  alive and will blow up all the bases of coexistence with this  entity [Israel].    I believe that the Gaza-Jericho agreement will be the bridge  that the Israelis will use to enter the Arab region. Therefore,  the Arabs and Muslims must fully realize that they are targeted  by this agreement.</p>

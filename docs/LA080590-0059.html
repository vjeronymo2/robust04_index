			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHERIFF'S AIR SQUADRON SEEKS LA VERNE SITE  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department would like to move its squadron of  16 helicopters and two airplanes from Long Beach Airport to Brackett Field in  La Verne because of a nearly tenfold rent increase at the Long Beach facility.  </P> <P> Long Beach's Airport Bureau of Public Works raised the rent last October for  the sheriff's Aero Bureau from $1,510 a month to $14,150 a month, said Lonnie  Mitchell, a spokeswoman for Long Beach's Airport Bureau of Public Works. The  rent increase came at the completion of a 20-year lease and one-year lease  extension.  </P> <P> The rent jumped dramatically because the property was rezoned in 1982 to permit  commercial uses -- instead of exclusively airport-related operations -- and  because of a vast increase in property values, Mitchell said.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Cmdr. Lee Baca said the Aero Bureau hopes to move to Brackett Field  -- sandwiched between Puddingstone Reservoir in San Dimas and the Los Angeles  County Fairgrounds in Pomona -- if a reasonable rent and other lease terms can  be negotiated with the San Gabriel Valley airfield.  </P> <P> Before any agreement is reached, however, the Sheriff's Department has been  ordered by the County Board of Supervisors to hold public hearings in La Verne,  Pomona and San Dimas so that residents in those communities can hear about and  discuss the proposal.  </P> <P> The sheriff's aircraft "will have a significant noise impact on the residents"  in those communities, according to a resolution by Supervisor Pete Schabarum  that requested the public hearings.  </P> <P> La Verne Mayor Jon Blickenstaff agreed. "I think there are some possible  benefits as far as having better access to services from the sheriff's  helicopters. But I'm also concerned about noise and safety," Blickenstaff said.  </P> <P> The hearings have not been scheduled.  </P> <P> The sheriff's Aero Bureau supports deputies on the ground in chasing suspects,  and it transports prisoners and performs surveillance duties. The 53-employee  bureau also assists in searches and rescues in remote areas.  </P></p>

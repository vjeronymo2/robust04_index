			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE CITY ELECTIONS;  </P> <P> BERNARDI'S CHALLENGER;  </P> <P> HALL'S LABOR BACKING MAY PROVE DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD IN RUNOFF  </P> <P> Mingling in the crowd of volunteers at Los Angeles City Council candidate Lyle  Hall's campaign headquarters in Sylmar on election night were many union  members, some of whom do not even live in the 7th District.  </P> <P> Their presence highlighted both the strengths and the Achilles' heel of the  fire captain's coming runoff campaign against veteran Councilman Ernani  Bernardi, Hall's supporters acknowledge. His organized-labor connection gives  Hall a ready-made constituency and bank of campaign help to draw from, but it  also makes him vulnerable to charges that he is a "special-interest" candidate.  Bernardi on Wednesday accused Hall of being "beholden" to labor interests.  </P> <P> Hall, 49, was raised in Burbank and has been a Los Angeles firefighter for more  than a quarter of a century.  </P> <P> The 6-foot, 2-inch, 220-pound Hall joined the Fire Department in 1962, working  his way through the ranks to his current position as captain at Fire Station 75  in Mission Hills. Two of his three brothers also work for the department.  </P> <P> On the wall of his Sylmar campaign headquarters hangs a commendation for his  rescue of three police officers under gunfire in 1969 in South-Central Los  Angeles. For that deed, he won the Fire Department's Medal of Valor.  </P> <P> "You do what you have to do, and then you worry about it later," he said.  </P> <P> Born in North Dakota, he married at 17. He and his wife had four children  before they were divorced. He remarried, and he and his second wife, Kitty,  have two children. They live in Panorama City.  </P> <P> Hall became a well-known figure in City Hall, and demonstrated his political  skills as a lobbyist for the 2,700-member United Firefighters union from 1976  to 1984.  </P> <P> During that time, the union spent $25,000 in an unsuccessful effort to defeat  Bernardi because of his role in a campaign to limit police and firefighter  pensions.  </P> <P> Hall said he sees his labor support as a plus in the heavily blue-collar  district.  </P> <P> But he also hopes to campaign on other issues. Specifically, he said he wants  to reclaim the district -- street by street -- from the grip of gangs and crime  through more police officers and innovative prevention and rehabilitation  programs.  </P> <P> In January, Hall took accumulated sick leave and vacation days to campaign full  time for the council, his first try for political office. It was an idea he had  been discussing for two years with Harvey Englander, an aggressive political  consultant who is known for his campaign mailings and who engineered Michael  Woo's 1985 defeat of Councilwoman Peggy Stevenson.  </P> <P> When Hall announced his campaign for the City Council last December, he pledged  not to say anything bad about the incumbent. But as the election grew closer,  he sent out a spate of mailers, many of them attacking Bernardi for his age and  absence from council meetings.  </P></p>

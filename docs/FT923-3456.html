			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Banks urged to balance goals MR BRIAN PEARSE, chief executive of Midland Bank, warned yesterday that banks and companies should take care to balance the pursuit of rewards for shareholders against other goals. 'The relentless focus on financial performance places a high value on the pursuit of shareholder value as the dominating factor in business management,' he said, in a seminar for the Chartered Institute of Bankers. He warned of 'dangers if shareholder value is over-accentuated - for example if short-term decisions are taken that are not in the customer's best interest'. There has been a debate between banks and their shareholders over the past few years about whether banks have been run with sufficient emphasis on rewarding shareholders. Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, warned recently that banks should put the interests of shareholders and customers above the public interest. Mr Pearse insisted yesterday that there was nothing to distinguish a bank's obligations to its shareholders from those of any other limited company. He said that a bank had 'moral and social obligations' to take account of its relationships with 'suppliers, staff, customers and the community'. Mr Pearse added: 'There will be times in the business cycle when the long-term fulfilment of strategic aims requires short-term profit sacrifices while investment or restructuring is undertaken.' So a bank's policy of increasing dividend payments to shareholders may 'need to be reviewed' when profits are under pressure. UK banks have been reluctant to cut dividends. Midland's dividend cut after its poor 1990 financial results was the first by a UK clearing bank since the 1930s.</p>

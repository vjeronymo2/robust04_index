			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / 6m homeowners 'in debt trap' MILLIONS of homeowners are trapped in debt and there can be no hope of a consumer-led recovery until the government takes steps to help them, according to a survey released today. NOP Corporate &amp; Financial, a market-research company, interviewed 35,000 people for the survey. It estimates that more than 6m mortgage holders are in the debt trap. Of these 1.5m have negative equity, where the size of their mortgage exceeds the value of their homes. The rest - 4.5m - are suffering from reduced equity, where the price of their home has fallen since they bought it. Those in the debt trap are mainly in the 25-45 age band and were formerly the country's main spenders. They are unlikely to lead a consumer recovery because they have less discretionary spending potential than before, the survey says. In 1988 mortgage holders were spending on average nearly twice as much as non-mortgage holders on discretionary purchases (excluding groceries). Both groups have reduced discretionary spending since then, but the survey finds that mortgage holders have cut back more than non-mortgage holders. Non-mortgage holders show a greater propensity to save than mortgage holders. Savings account for about 13 per cent of their expenditure compared with 9 per cent for mortgage holders. Success in reducing the rate of inflation is a 'Pyrrhic victory', says the report, given high real interest rates and low monetary growth, which have squeezed recovery. Job losses and fear of unemployment remain the main causes of consumer caution, it says. It doubts the possibility of a consumer-led recovery unless the government initiates measures to alleviate the debt burden, particularly for those with negative equity. Personal Finance Overview.

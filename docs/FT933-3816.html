			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / International Company News: Indosuez recovers to FFr320m BANQUE Indosuez, one of France's leading investment banks and a subsidiary of the Suez holding company, saw net profits recover from FFr81m in the first half of 1992 to FFr320m (Dollars 37m) in the same period this year, helped by windfall profits from the European currency crisis. The bank, which is heavily exposed to the Paris property market and was last year forced to make steep provisions for its property losses, said the improvement in this year's interim profits reflected growth in operating income and tight cost control. Indosuez was again forced to make substantial provisions of FFr1.31bn on property and financial losses during the first half of 1993, against FFr1.39bn at the interim stage last year. However, its gross operating profits rose from FFr1.66bn to FFr2.63bn over the same period and costs were static. The company said it had made 'substantial profits' from capital and money market instruments by benefiting from the changes in interest and exchange rates during the first half. It warned that the growth in gross operating profits might slow down during the second half because of the sluggish economic environment and more stable state of the capital markets.</p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: EL MONTE;  </P> <P> MOTEL ORDINANCE CHANGED  </P> <P> Changes in the city code regulating motel registrations were approved by the  City Council on Tuesday in an effort to curb prostitution and drug activity.  </P> <P> The amendments to the 6-year-old law mandate bookkeeping procedures to make it  easier for city officials to spot registration inconsistencies that suggest  possible illegal activity. Motel operators now are required to submit  information on posted room rates and to segregate money collected for the city  under its transient occupancy tax.  </P> <P> A section of the retooled ordinance calls for an evaluation of the  effectiveness of the changes in eight months. Another portion allows the city  to modify or revoke the permit of any motel operator not in compliance.  </P></p>

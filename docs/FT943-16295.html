			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Caldwell shares hit by warning Shares of Caldwell Investments fell 9p to 49p after the USM-quoted textiles group warned of a trading slowdown in Germany, its main market. Mr Stanley Wootliff, chairman, said that after an 'excellent' first three months the level of demand 'dropped significantly' in the second quarter. On turnover of Pounds 3.39m (Pounds 2.96m), pre-tax profits for the six months to April 30 fell from Pounds 176,300 to Pounds 147,500 as operating income was hit by a force majeure contract cancellation. The interim dividend is maintained at 0.3875p, payable from earnings of 1.15p (1.48p) per share.</p>

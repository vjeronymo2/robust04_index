			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Philip Sherwell in Bangkok: "Embassy Aide May </F> Testify in Drug Case"]    [Text] A Thai court is calling a key member of the  undercover narcotics team at the British Embassy in Bangkok to  give evidence in the trial of two Britons charged with drug  trafficking.    The agent, a Thai woman named in previous evidence as  Kanchana Yoowattana, allegedly gave customs officers the tip-of  that led to the arrests nearly a year ago of Sandra Gregory, 28,  and Robert Lock, 30.    Ms Kanchana works for British drug liaison officers who  co-operate with Thai authorities to crack down on the region's  roaring narcotics trade. It is unclear whether she will give  evidence.    Gregory and Lock appeared in court for a three-hour hearing  yesterday.    The court was previously told that the British Embassy drugs  officers told Thai customs officials to watch out for Lock, whom  they suspected of recruiting couriers to smuggle heroin to Japan.    But under cross-examination by Lock's lawyer yesterday, the  investigating police officer, Capt Noppadol Karnchanarom,  repeatedly said he could not remember many details of the case.  A red-eyed Gregory, who is facing a life sentence after pleading  guilty to possessing 87 grammes of heroin valued at  &pound;24,000,  was barefoot and dressed in a brown prison tunic.    She says she was carrying the drugs for Lock, who was  arrested with her at Bangkok airport last February, but he  denies this.    Speaking earlier from a police holding cell, Gregory, from  Sowerby Bridge, Yorks, broke down in tears as she described her  life in jail.    "They've taken away nearly all the English books from the  library. There's just a pile of Bibles and Mills and Boon  romances there. The good stuff like the Shaw has gone," she said.    "They have removed our Walkmans as well because someone  smuggled a tape recording out of the prison. I'm going out of my  head with boredom; and it's so tiring trying to be brave all the  time."    She said she had also had trouble getting medical treatment  recently and was locked in a cell with up to 100 women for more  than half the day. She spent the rest of her time working in the  prison bakery.    Since the royal pardon last summer of Karyn Smith and  Patricia Cahill, Gregory is the only British woman in jail in  Bangkok. There are about 20 American women in the same jail, but  she said many had become hostile following plans to make a  Hollywood film about the released Britons' experiences.    "They all say I'll be out of here on a pardon. But it's been  made quite clear to me that won't happen," said Gregory.    Lock, from Oundle, Peterborough, has pleaded not guilty to  conspiring to export heroin with intent to sell.    The case is expected to continue for several months.</p>

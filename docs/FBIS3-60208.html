The cocaine was hidden in two containers' false walls on the  Polish vessel "Lublin II," which according to the documentation  contained a consignment of bananas and coffee from Ecuador.    Pogorzelski said the haul could be even larger because the  search inside the third container on vessel was continuing.    The containers were shipped by an Ecuador-based fruit  company  to a firm based in the tri-city of Gdansk, Sopot, Gdynia.    The State Protection Bureau (UOP), the customs office are  investigating the case under the supervision of the Gdynia  prosecutor's office.    "Lublin II" is owned by the "Polamerica" company, whose  shareholder is the Polish Ocean Lines Company.    The haul is one of the largest in the history of Polands  fight against the narcotics trade, which has become a major  problem in recent years for Polands drug-enforcement officials.</p>

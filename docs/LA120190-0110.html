			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISCREDITED MILLI VANILLI STILL ON 1990 GRAMMY BALLOT  </P> <P> And the winner of the 1990 Grammy is . . . Milli Vanilli?  </P> <P> That Grammy nightmare could become reality -- sort of -- when the music  industry awards are handed out in New York on Feb. 20. Though the lip-sync duo  was stripped of it's best new artist Grammy from last year, Milli Vanilli  appears in four categories on the first-round ballot that went out this week to  the 6,000 voting members of the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp;  Sciences. The duo is listed for album of the year, record of the year, pop  performance by group or duo and song of the year.  </P> <P> The ballots, which will be used to select actual nominees for the 1990 Grammy  awards, were printed and readied for mailing before the lip-syncing story  broke.  </P> <P> Academy president Michael Greene said Friday that votes in the first three  categories would not be counted.  </P> <P> "The same factors that rendered them ineligible for the award last year renders  them ineligible this year," Greene said.  </P> <P> But Milli Vanilli's "Blame It on the Rain" is making it into the song of the  year category. Though the song category honors the writers -- in this case pop  songsmith Dianne Warren -- and not the performers, it could be a huge  embarrassment to the academy to even tangentially honor former Milli frontmen  Rob Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan.  </P> <P> But Greene said that as far as he knows there is no reason to remove the  group's work from the song category, though the matter will be decided  officially at a meeting of the academy's awards and nominations committee on  Monday.  </P> <P> Greene said that no letter will be sent to Grammy voters to make them aware of  the ineligibility but that a reminder of it might be included in regular  communications concerning the voting updates.  </P> <P> But the pair themselves find the appearance on the ballot "amusing," according  to their manager, Carsten Heyn.  </P> <P> "We appreciate the mention on the ballot," Heyn said, after speaking to Pilatus  and Morvan, who are trying to launch a singing career of their own. "And we  hope that Robby and Fabrice will win a real Grammy in the future in order to  give back to the fans what they deserve."  </P></p>

			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / N Korea hardens line on N-deal North Korea appears to be backing away from a promise made to the US agreeing in principle to full international inspections of its seven declared nuclear facilities. Negotiations between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency on these inspections have reached an impasse after Pyongyang said it would bar full access to a 5MW reactor and a 'radiochemical laboratory', believed to be a plutonium reprocessing facility, at the Yongbyon nuclear complex. North Korea said at the weekend it had agreed in re-cent talks with the US to allow inspections that would guarantee 'the continuity of (nuclear) safeguards'. But it was under no obligation to accept full IAEA inspections, since it had only 'suspended temporarily' its March 1993 decision to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The IAEA wants to inspect the reactor's fuel rods and substances used in the radiochemical laboratory to guarantee that the North has not diverted plutonium for its suspected nuclear weapons programme. But North Korea will only permit the replacement of film and batteries for surveillance cameras at these sites. The IAEA has refused the offer, stating that the North must submit to the full range of IAEA inspections initially accepted in 1992. North Korea claimed it agreed to new, limited IAEA inspections in return for the promised suspension of this year's US-South Korean 'Team Spirit' military exercise, which has not yet been announced. Pyongyang appears to be toughening its stance on regular IAEA inspections of its declared nuclear facilities, explaining that they will only be allowed after the US holds another round of high-level talks with the North in an attempt to improve relations. The US has rejected that demand, saying it will discuss improved ties only if the North permits regular IAEA inspections and renews talks with South Korea on denuclearisation. The US has indicated that if North Korean fails to reach an inspection accord with the IAEA, it will ask the UN Security Council to impose sanctions on Pyongyang. China and Japan are urging caution in transferring the issue to the UN since it could increase tensions in the Korean peninsula.</p>

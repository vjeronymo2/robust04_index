Government at all levels must take the "vegetable basket" and  "rice sack" seriously. No matter how heavy their workload is,  they must place the "vegetable basket" and "rice sack" high on  their agenda. They must devote major efforts -- and display  great resolution -- to carrying out this major task that has a  direct bearing on people's lives and economic development as a  whole. This is the demand set by Chen Huanyou, secretary of the  provincial Party Committee and governor, at the provincial  conference on the "vegetable basket," grain, and edible oil that  was held yesterday.    Comrade Chen Huanyou said: The overall situation in our  province is excellent insofar as the "vegetable basket" and  "rice sack" are concerned. In recent years, Jiangsu's grain  output has stabilized at around 32 billion kg; production of  nonstaple foodstuffs has also increased. Last year, output of  hogs and aquatic products reached new highs; production of  poultry, eggs, and fruit is on the rise, and acreage for  vegetables -- output as well -- expanded significantly in rural  areas. Therefore, we have a solid base and there should be no  shortages. Why then did prices rise sharply a short while ago?  The reasons are as follows: 1) Prices of farm products were  too low to begin with, so prices naturally rose once controls  were lifted. 2) The effect of natural disasters. The freezing  cold last November did considerable damage to vegetables. 3) An  excessive amount of vegetable plots in the outskirts have been  diverted to other purposes in recent years. In some localities,  those plots have not been promptly replaced. 4) Inefficient  administration. It is still not easy for peasants to sell their  produce in cities, and a handful of unlawful businessmen were  cornering the market and cheating the customers. 5) Regulatory  mechanisms were not functioning well. After grain prices rose  abnormally, no immediate action was taken to bring prices down  by selling large quantities of grain. Therefore, we must have a  high sense of political responsibility and pay great attention  to solving the problems related to the "vegetable basket."  Only then will we be able to maintain social tranquility and  stability and create a good external environment for reform and  economic development. [passage omitted]    Ji Yunshi, member of the Standing Committee of the  provincial  Party Committee and deputy governor, and Jiang Yongron, deputy  governor, were present at the meeting. Jiang Yongrong gave a  report outlining specific arrangements with regard to "vegetable  basket" work.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / French PM orders austerity cuts worth Pounds 2.5bn MR Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, signalled his new government's priorities yesterday by ordering austerity measures at home, and by announcing that his first foreign trip would be to see Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Germany. Convening his 30-strong cabinet for the first time, Mr Balladur said he wanted 'at least FFr20bn' (Pounds 2.5bn) in spending cuts. This would start with cost-trimming in the ministers' own departments to curb a budget deficit which it is estimated would otherwise rise to FFr300bn this year. The prime minister will announce his full programme to the French parliament on April 8. Parliament meets tomorrow for the first time since the conservative coalition's landslide victory in Sunday's elections. Mr Balladur had wanted to see Mr Kohl as early as next week, the government spokesman said, but could do so only after the German leader returned to Bonn from holiday on April 19. Mr Balladur's centre-right government has come to power with a 'new initiative' on monetary co-operation with Germany as its most specific manifesto promise in the foreign policy field. The premier's enthusiasm to cement the links between France and Germany is shared by Mr Edmond Alphandery, his economics minister. Mr Alphandery, a centrist politician and former economics professor, plans to meet his German counterpart, Mr Theo Waigel, at the Group of Seven summit which starts on April 14 in Tokyo. Mr Alphandery yesterday stressed his support for the franc fort policy of protecting the French currency. 'Our main objective will be to restore confidence in economic and financial circles,' he said. The Balladur team also hopes the German government will give a more sympathetic hearing to French complaints about the European Commission's conduct of the Gatt negotiations, particularly in agriculture. Mr Jean Puech, minister for farming and fisheries, promised to conduct 'an active, permanent and vigorous defence of our agricultural and maritime interests, in Gatt as well as in Brussels'. The chances of Mr Puech clashing with fellow EC ministers and the Commission are therefore all the greater, because France's fishermen have recently been following the example of the country's farmers in carrying out often violent protests at what they see as the EC's refusal to protect them from cheap imports. These protests culminated in an incident last Sunday, when three British navy officers were abducted by French trawlermen. Le Monde newspaper commented yesterday that in combining farm and fishing responsibilities in one portfolio, Mr Balladur had created a sort of 'alternative European affairs ministry', which could clash with ministers with formal responsibility for EC policy. The government's air fleet is to have its budget trimmed by a third, and ministers were asked to take scheduled air flights whenever possible. Balladur gives his team pro-EC stamp, Page 3</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Trade push pays off, says Brown The Clinton administration yesterday said its aggressive year-old trade promotion strategy had helped US companies win contracts for 70 big foreign projects worth Dollars 17bn. 'We can now say that the strategy is working and working with successful, measurable results,' said Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, who heads the Trade Promotion Co-ordinating Committee which devised the strategy. He predicted that the US would exceed the goal it set a year ago to export Dollars 1,000bn in goods and services annually by the year 2000. Mr Robert Rubin, the president's economic adviser, said export promotion was an integral part of the administration's economic policy, which calls for increasing US productivity, opening markets through negotiation and helping US companies to win sales. Mr Brown said the administration had 'redefined the relationship between business and government', making government an active partner in the efforts of US companies to export. It had created a 17-agency Advocacy Co-ordinating network 'to ensure co-operation across the government' and had established a 'war room' in the Commerce Department to track over 160 important foreign projects. It had also launched high-level sales efforts by Mr Brown and other administration officials, including the president. More effective use had been made of export financing and much progress had been achieved in eliminating unnecessary, ineffective export controls. Mr Kenneth Brody, chairman of the US Export Import Bank, said the agency was 'no longer' passive in the face of strong competition from its foreign rivals. He has created a new project finance division, which this year has more than doubled the lending of 1993 to Dollars 360m. The division is now pursuing a Dollars 3.5bn backlog of requests for finance of infrastructure projects. The bank's Tied Aid Capital Projects Fund is aggressively countering foreign offers to eliminate the use of foreign tied aid. In an annual report, submitted to Congress yesterday, the TPCC said that it would support the Middle East peace process through expanded trade missions, private sector initiatives and finance packages.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the South Atlantic EEZ, Amendment 2 would: (1) Prohibit the harvest and possession of wild live rock north of the Dade/Broward County line in Florida; (2) south of the Dade/Broward County line, phase out harvesting of wild live rock by January 1, 1996, establish an annual quota on harvests of wild live rock of 485,000 lb (219,992 kg) for calendar years 1994 and 1995, and prohibit the taking of wild live rock by chipping during those years; and (3) provide for a permit system for the harvest and possession of live rock from aquaculture operations that will be implemented when appropriate criteria are developed through a subsequent amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the Gulf EEZ, Amendment 2 would: (1) Prohibit the harvest and possession of wild live rock off Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and south of the Monroe/Collier County line in Florida; (2) from the Monroe/Collier County line to the Florida/Alabama boundary, phase out harvesting of wild live rock by January 1, 1997, contingent upon development of a Federal aquaculture permitting system; (3) from the Pasco/Hernando County line in Florida to the Florida/Alabama boundary, prohibit the taking of wild live rock by chipping during the phase-out period; (4) from the Pasco/Hernando County line to the Monroe/Collier County line, limit the taking of wild live rock by chipping to nonpower-assisted, hand-held hammers and chisels during the phase-out period; (5) from the Monroe/Collier County line to the Florida/Alabama boundary, establish a daily vessel possession limit for wild live rock during the phase-out period; (6) require a permit to harvest or possess live rock from aquaculture operations; and (7) provide an exception to the taking of prohibited corals as part of the aquaculture permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For both the South Atlantic and Gulf, Amendment 2 would: (1) Define live rock and add it to the fishery management unit; (2) redefine allowable octocorals to ensure that individual colonies and not whole rocks are taken under the octocoral quota; (3) establish a Federal permit and reporting system for wild live rock harvesting during harvest phase-out periods; (4) allow and facilitate live rock aquaculture; (5) require a permit to harvest and possess live rock in the EEZ for scientific, educational, or restoration purposes; and (6) provide for separate management of coral and coral reef resources by each Council in its geographical area of authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A description of the fishery and the rationale and effects of live rock harvesting restrictions during the phase-out periods in the Gulf EEZ off Florida and prohibitions on harvesting in the EEZ off Alabama and in the South Atlantic north of the Dade/Broward County line in Florida were contained in the emergency interim rules and are not repeated here. Rationales for prohibitions on harvest and possession in other areas, the phaseout of harvesting in remaining areas off Florida, permits and reporting, the redefinition of allowable octocorals, and separation of management between the Councils are discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To prevent effort shifting from the current areas of harvest, Amendment 2 would prohibit wild live rock harvesting and possession in the EEZ off Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, in addition to areas closed under the emergency interim rules. No landings of live rock have been reported from these areas. Coral habitats are at such a premium in the northern Gulf that local governments and private organizations are considering construction of artificial reefs to supplement scarce natural hard bottom habitats. Amendment 2 would close the Gulf EEZ off Monroe County to all harvest and possession in order to prevent effort shifting from the South Atlantic EEZ following closures in that adjoining jurisdiction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> About 99 percent of reported live rock landings are from the Gulf EEZ off Florida north of Monroe County and from the South Atlantic EEZ south of the Dade/Broward County line. All landings of live rock to date have been of ``wild'' live rock, that is, non- aquacultured live rock. The Councils propose to phase out these landings and replace them with aquacultured products from either state or EEZ waters. The delay in implementation of a harvest and possession prohibition in these areas is designed to allow live rock harvesters additional time and resources to make the transition to aquaculture.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

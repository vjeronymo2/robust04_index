			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Independent body to examine electricity plant closures plan PROFESSOR Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, is to step up his investigations into two developments which have been widely blamed for the threat of pit closures. He announced yesterday he would appoint an independent assessor to examine recent decisions by National Power and PowerGen, the two large electricity generators in England and Wales, to shut several coal-fired power stations. Prof Littlechild, director-general of electricity supply, will also bring forward his own review of the way electricity distribution companies buy their power supplies. The growing practice among distributors of building their own gas-fired power stations has triggered suggestions of 'sweetheart' deals which may be squeezing coal out. Prof Littlechild promised to report publicly on both issues by December, meaning that his findings can be fed into the full review of energy policy which has been promised by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, in January. The two big generators announced on September 30 that they were closing 12 power stations. Although these represented less than 5 per cent of generating capacity in England and Wales, most of them were coal-burning. Under new licence conditions, Prof Littlechild has the power to investigate plant closures to ensure that they will not drive up electricity prices. If he thinks they will, he can recommend an inquiry by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Prof Littlechild was reviewing power purchasing practices to ensure that they were economic before the coal crisis. He said last week he would accelerate the review because of concern about the gas deals, but yesterday's announcement was the first indication that he would try to fit in with Mr Heseltine's timetable. If the gas deals turn out to be uneconomic, the regulator can penalise the companies by disallowing their costs, but he cannot force them to stop using gas. As an independent regulator, the director-general of electricity supply can only be asked by Mr Heseltine to carry out certain tasks. But Prof Littlechild said last night: 'This was a decision I made myself. I think it is important to have an impartial and objective review. 'The most useful contribution I can make is to ensure that the electricity industry is operating efficiently.' PowerGen said the review was 'not unexpected. We fully understand the pressures currently facing Prof Littlechild'. Dr Bob Hawley, chief executive of Nuclear Electric, the state-owned nuclear utility, yesterday denied suggestions that nuclear power stations should be closed to make way for coal. He said this would be a 'quick fix' that would overlook the long-term benefits of nuclear power. Nuclear stations could generate electricity at a competitive price and without emitting gases into the air, he said. Although Nuclear Electric would receive Pounds 1.2bn in subsidy this year, it aimed to be profitable by 1995.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special Dispatch": PAI HSING To Stop Publication Next </F> Month"]    [Text] The PAI HSING semimonthly magazine, after more than  a decade in business, will close next month due to heavy  financial losses. It is reported that Hong Kong businessman  Tsui Tsin-tong has lost HK$20 million [Hong Kong dollars] since  he became a partner of the magazine early last year.    Lao Chi-san, the magazine's general supervisor of the  editorial board, formally informed the staff two days ago of the  board of directors' decision that the magazine will "temporarily  suspend publication" after its last edition on 1 June.    Lao said last night that the magazine was shut down  primarily  due to its unacceptable financial losses. He believed that the  remaining 20 workers will be laid off and paid in accordance  with the labor decree, adding that he has no idea whether the  boss has another publication plan.    The magazine was set up by local literary figure Hu Chu-jen  in early 1980's. A total of 280 issues were published despite  financial difficulties until early last year, when Tsui invested  in it. To expand circulation, the semimonthly was changed into  a weekly magazine on 2 April last month, more workers were  hired, and more color pages were added. The magazine was  changed back into a semimonthly again in November last year to  reduce losses.    A source close to the magazine said that Tsui openly had  said  he would invest $HK30 million when he became a partner of the  magazine a year ago. The magazine's losses have amounted to  HK$20 million.    The source added that Tsui had decided to invest in the  magazine to keep the business going due to his close  relationship with Hu, the founder and the boss at the time, when  the magazine was in financial straits a year ago. Tsui was also  eager to run the magazine better and increase the circulation so  that the magazine would continue to be published as it had been.    After failing to increase circulation through increasing  investment, changing the semimonthly into a weekly, and altering  policy, the management decided to change it back to a  semimonthly. The board of directors finally decided to close  the magazine because it had incurred losses of HK$1 million a  month.    The number of workers had increased to 70 or 80 after Tsui's  investment, but it had gradually decreased to 20, the source  added.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with IZVESTIYA commentator Otto Latsis </F> by Moscow correspondent Hans Geleijnse in Moscow; date not  given: "West Must Not Exaggerate Danger Posed by Zhirinovskiy --  Political Clown Will Make A Poor Show"]    [Text] Moscow -- Ever since the Russian elections last  December, the alarm bells have been ringing around the world,  especially in the West. The reason is the march into parliament  of media clown and agitator Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of a  group that bears the misleading name of the Liberal Democratic  Party of Russia [LDPR].    Otto Latsis, the cautious, and probably for that reason  alone  already highly influential, 60-year-old commentator of the  Russian newspaper IZVESTIYA is extremely concerned about  Zhirinovskiy's surprising election victory. However, it is not  the Zhirinovskiy phenomenon itself that frightens him, but the  reactions to it, which he considers exaggerated.    NATO, which has experienced a serious identity crisis since  the disappearance of its enemy, the Soviet Union, is being given  an unexpected stimulus to survive by Russia. New members, the  countries of Central Europe and the Balkan states, want a place  under the alliance's umbrella.    In the United States, Germany, and the Netherlands, the  so-called Zhirinovskiy factor is providing ready ammunition for  bringing the defense cuts under fire. In short, the  reincarnation of the Red Peril of communism as a poisonous  black, fascist threat is being taken extremely seriously.    Latsis has always been a party journalist. However, as a  qualified economist, he opted for reforms right from the start  and also became a strong opponent of Stalinism. He left the  party in 1990. "The danger in overestimating Zhirinovskiy lies  in setting off a chain reaction. I dread to think that NATO  might welcome neighboring countries like Poland, the Czech  Republic, and the Baltic republics into the club. The militants  here would then immediately cry: `You see, the West is still  our rival.' That would not only prove fatal to reaching further  arms reduction agreements, but would also kill off Yeltsin's  reform policy."    That nearly 24 percent of the vote went to the man who  intends to drop atomic bombs on Germany if necessary, propagates  the idea of a Greater Russia, and commands considerable support  within the Army, may well give cause for something more than  raised eyebrows in the West. According to Latsis, "I would be  the last person to say that there is no reason to remain alert;  the question is how to do so. And above all, based on what  assessment?"  <H5>  Wrong Track </H5>   According to Latsis, anyone comparing the present situation  in Russia with the situation in Germany during the 1930's, who  regards Zhirinovskiy as a new Hitler, is entirely on the wrong  track. Zhirinovskiy has managed to get this far not only because  his democratic opponents not only underestimated him, but also  because of the population's dissatisfaction with the economic  chaos and impoverishment, and its dented national pride in a  country that was once so powerful but is now in decline.    According to Latsis, the votes for Zhirinovskiy are  absolutely no proof whatsoever that fascism and extreme  nationalism are rampant in Russia. "Under such circumstances, I  would even go so far as to say that the Russian population is  less nationalistic than the U.S. population. However, there is  more. According to my estimates, a maximum of 8 percent of the  electorate could be considered hard core militant Zhirinovskiy  supporters. The rest voted for the LDPR as a protest."    Zhirinovskiy gained his victory entirely from the national  party list for the National Duma, the new parliament. His  victory was a direct consequence of his personal charisma: He  has humor on his side, and is someone who "dares to speak the  truth to the motley crew in the Kremlin."    However, in the regional lists, which determined over half  of  the seats in the Duma, Zhirinovskiy and his LDPR did not make a  breakthrough there. "The regional candidates were familiar to  the people and were judged far more on the content of their  platform. That [fact] alone proves that the electorate did not  vote `for fascism,'" says Latsis.    "The protest was also reflected in the 48 percent [of the  population] who did not go to the polls. I believe that half of  these people are totally indifferent, while the other half would  vote for democratic candidates under better circumstances. Why?  If they had wanted to make their protest known, they would have  gone to the polls to support Zhirinovskiy. That did not  happen," Latsis continued.    He sees both the leader of the LDPR and the forces  supporting  him (Latsis claims that both Zhirinovskiy and his party are an  invention of reactionaries from the former KGB and the Army --  GAZET VAN ANTWERPEN correspondent's note) losing ground when  things actually have to be done in the parliament. Latsis  predicts that in 1996 Zhirinovskiy will play a major role in the  presidential elections, but that he certainly will not win.  "You cannot play the clown for two years. He will now have to  make grotesque promises. We must also wait and see which kind  of people his party attracts, and how much support he will  receive in daily political practice," he says.  <H5>  Remedy </H5>   According to Latsis, the only remedy against Zhirinovskiy is  to throw overboard any idea of shock therapy. Reforms are  necessary, but they must be well-considered and cautious. A  second correction must entail the recognition of the  dissatisfaction with the fate of the 25 million Russians who  have been living outside Russia for generations.    According to Latsis: "The democrats have simply given this  issue to Zhirinovskiy. I am glad that in his New Year's  address, Yeltsin announced that he would respond sharply to  discrimination--or even worse--against Russians living outside  Russia. A man like Foreign Minister Kozyrev should have done  that much earlier, exerting diplomatic pressure on countries  that are attempting to force their ethnic Russian citizens into  a second-class position, like the Baltics. That policy should  also have been presented better to the people. In that way,  Zhirinovskiy would have been deprived of an important weapon."    The situation will only become dangerous if the democrats  continue to refuse to draw the right conclusions from the  election result. The West must merely now show its willingness  to help Russia in its reconstruction, and realize that the  economy of this gigantic country cannot make a 180-degree  turnaround from one day to the next, Latsis argued.    As for NATO, Latsis advised Yeltsin to first allow some time  for guiding Russia inside a joint alliance. Subsequently, the  membership of neighboring countries will no longer pose a  problem. The opposite is impossible, Latsis warned, because in  that case the democrats--and not only they--can probably forget  all about it.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Gold rose on the London bullion market after Comex opened higher as buy-stops were triggered by local traders. 'It's a typical short covering rally in a bear market. . . I think the range for the year has been Dollars 348 - Dollars 360 and that says it all really,' one London dealer said. The market remains wary of the approach of the Islamic month of Ramadan from March 5, during which period average gold prices have exceeded those of the preceding month only once in the past seven years, UBS analyst Andy Smith said. But this time round gold is entering Ramadan at the lowest levels since 1986. Average prices in the month following Ramadan have usually also been lower in the past seven years. At the London Metal Exchange copper and aluminium prices eased back from their highs during late trading amid reports that Russia had cancelled duties on metal exports. There was no confirmation, but after the exchange closed a government adviser, speaking in Moscow, said some Russian companies were receiving tax breaks. At the close cash copper was Pounds 1,298.75 a tonne, up Pounds 7.25 on the day, while cash aluminium was down Dollars 4 at Dollars 1,318.50 a tonne. The May robusta coffee price ended Dollars 11 higher at Dollars 813 a tonne on short-covering. Compiled from Reuters</p>

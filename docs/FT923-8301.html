			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Four new telecoms licences confirmed THE government yesterday confirmed details of its plans to award telecommunications licences to four companies in order to increase competition for British Telecom and Mercury. The licences, which are subject to approval by parliament, are the first to be awarded since the government's duopoly review of the industry in 1990, which opened the sector to further competition. The Department of Trade and Industry said it was studying applications from a further 22 groups. The companies that are to receive a public telecommunications operator's licence are Ionica, a Cambridge-based private enterprise, Millicom, a US telecommunications company, National Network, based in Buckinghamshire, and WorldCom, a Swiss-owned company operating in the UK. The four will be able to build fixed networks throughout the UK and provide local, trunk and international services. Two of the four plan to use radio links and the DTI has allowed Millicom the use of space in a radio band for that purpose. Millicom plans to offer voice, data and videophone services on its radio-based network, which it hopes to start in 1994 and build into a national network by the end of the decade. Millicom said it would be able to handle the launch on its own but would look for partners for the national build-up. The company said its technology would enable it to offer voice communications 'at a substantial discount' to BT's rates. Ionica, which is also using a radio-based system, plans to make its network available to half the population when it launches its service in 1994. The company, which is funded by a group of private investors, expects to invest 'hundreds of millions of pounds'. National Network, which uses the Post Office's private network, intends to invest about Pounds 150m in the next few years to build its own fibre-optic system, although it is talking to several groups about possible equity participation. The companies' ability to compete with BT and Mercury may depend on how much they are able to invest in networks over the coming years. Mr Paul Norris, industry analyst at the securities company BZW, said: 'Mercury has invested Pounds 1.5bn to gain 7.5 per cent of the UK telecoms market.' The government also announced yesterday that it was issuing licences to 13 private mobile radio operators and to Hutchison Paging to provide fixed services in addition to the mobile services it is currently licensed to offer.</p>

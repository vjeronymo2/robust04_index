The document makes changes to the procedure for electing farm  leaders. From now on, collective farmers are deprived of the  right to independently nominate candidates for election to  collective farm chairmen at general meetings. This can only be  done by the district head of administration. Without his  permission, the members of the farm also have no right to remove  the chairman from his post. According to INTERFAX, over the  last two years the number of collective farms in Uzbekistan has  doubled.</p>

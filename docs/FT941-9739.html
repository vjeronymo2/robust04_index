			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / As They Say in Europe: It couldn't happen here Michael Portillo, number two in the British Treasury, created a stir recently when he told students that if they got good examination results it was not because they had bribed anyone, and if they won contracts it was not because of their relationship with government ministers. That was the sort of thing that happened abroad, he said. In the ensuing uproar, unfortunately, most of the allegations were withdrawn. But, as others have pointed out, in Britain, alone in Europe, you can buy good examination results by opting out of the state system. In France or Germany to do such a thing for your offspring would mean they were dim, in need of extra help. Each country is corrupt in the eyes of others. But not in the eyes of its own citizens unless things get out of hand, as in Italy. In France corruption operates within the systems of patronage worked by political parties. There is also a nice blurring of the frontiers of the public and private sectors that can enable individuals to cross the line profitably. If the state-owned Electricite de France places huge orders with (private) French suppliers the day before rules on the European single market come into force, is that wrong? Certainly not. Softening the rules of the market is a doctrine that has been espoused by Edouard Balladur, the prime minister. In Germany things are different again. There, the federal system ensures power is so decentralised it is difficult to get together the critical mass necessary for large-scale corruption. It occurs in the most dreary circumstances: the papers are full of tales of top people paying off members of the lower classes with public funds for minor services. In the Netherlands corruption cannot really be confronted at a high level because it may damage the financial interests of the state. Spanish corruption arises from an unfamiliarity with the rules of the modern state: the regulations are in place but are hard to understand, let alone implement, in a land that entered the twentieth century only a few years ago. Greece remains Balkan in its attitude towards regulation. British corruption, in the eyes of others, arises from its twin virtues of tradition and the old boy network. There was also something shocking in the way John Major became prime minister after the resignation of Margaret Thatcher, as she then was. He was chosen, not by the people, but by 300 Tory members of parliament who gave him a job whose powers are scarcely matched in any other democracy. The fact that a British government can do more or less as it likes is seen as alarming. Some allege it is now laying the foundations of the corrupt state of the future. The proliferation of quangos and the curious Self-Financing Regulatory Agencies, which support themselves through raising money for services that others are compelled to purchase, are an Aladdin's cave for those less scrupulous than the fine people who staff such organisations at present. The writer Christopher Booker, an expert on these matters, believes things are going wrong already. As does the Public Accounts Committee of parliament which issued a disturbing report on the matter a couple of weeks ago. So Mr Portillo's views on corruption abroad have been greeted in part as entertainment, in part as a curious element in the British psyche. But not as a contribution to a comparative study of the pathology of improbity. In the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, under the headline 'Where you can't buy the examiners,' the paper's London correspondent wrote: 'Attacks on 'the foreigners' had already become the recipe for success at the last Conservative party conference.' He noted that now there were stricter laws introduced by one beneficiary of that mood, Peter Lilley, the social security secretary. He has imposed new rules against 'treacherous foreigners who come from the European Union to Britain to swindle the social services'. Le Monde compared the Portillo outburst to that of Edith Cresson, the one-time French prime minister, who spoke of the depraved sexual morals of Anglo-Saxons. It concluded: 'There should exist in each European government a minister responsible for insults and imprecations. Like their colleagues, they should meet regularly to harmonise abuse at the very heart of the Union. There exists near Brussels a convenient location for their conferences: the Chateau de Moulinsart, property of Captain Haddock.' Captain Haddock, for the uninitiated, is the drunken oaf who accompanies the boy detective Tintin on his adventures. In England he lives at Marlinspike Hall: each country has a home for Captain Haddock. And, nearly everywhere, he has an English name . . .

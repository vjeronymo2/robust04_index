			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / 'Healthy' ERM could still grow into Emu: Lionel Barber assesses EC finance ministers' steps likely to restore confidence in currency system TO TALK of a new realism permeating the affairs of the European Community may be premature. But after two days of talks in a former sanitorium in Kolding, Denmark, over the weekend, EC finance ministers took several steps likely to rebuild confidence in the European exchange rate mechanism, while keeping the more ambitious project of European Monetary Union in their sights. Mr Horst Kohler, German state secretary of finance, picked up the meeting's central theme: the need to regain credibility. He doubted whether a majority of EC member states would be ready for monetary union by 1997, the earliest date set down in the Maastricht treaty, and he served notice that Germany would not support moves to water down the targets on inflation, budget deficits and government debt - the so-called 'convergence criteria'. Without as much as a whimper, all present agreed. Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president and one of the architects of Emu, declared that there was no need for change. Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgian finance minister, who just a week ago predicted that member states would have to alter the targets if the recession continued into 1994, said he had been misunderstood. 'There is not going to be a fast-track to monetary union,' said an EC official. 'It's going to be a long hard slog.' Clearly a funny thing happened on the way to Kolding. There are two likely explanations: one is that ministers are desperate to capitalise on the Danish Yes in the (second) referendum last week on the Maastricht treaty, and are well aware that loose talk about amending its provisions would scare the markets. Just as important is the influence of the two high-level official investigations into the exchange rate crisis last autumn which led to the forced departure of the British pound and the Italian lira from the ERM, followed by devaluations of the peseta, the escudo and the punt. In a commendable exercise in transparency, the Danish presidency of the EC won agreement to make public the reports, one by the committee of central bank governors and one by the EC's monetary committee. Both reject wholesale reform of the ERM, emphasising instead the need to apply the rules more rigorously. By spreading the blame for the crisis, the committees defuse the Anglo-German row that followed it: the Bonn government is criticised for financing unification through borrowing, a policy mix which forced up interest rates and deepened the recession in Europe. The UK is implicitly rebuked for sticking to an overvalued exchange rate and for failing to raise interest rates to deter speculators. The reports' conclusions could have come out of the mouth of the Bundesbank: each member state must first put its own economic house in order, and no member state has an obligation to intervene in the markets to prop up weaker currencies. Ministers supported a call for an 'early warning system' whereby the monetary committee or central bankers would use confidential economic indicators to strengthen the case for a member state to devalue. The call for frank, if confidential, discussions prior to devaluation may be easier said than done, according to an EC official involved. As was evident during the crisis last September, ministers and officials prefer to use code rather than spell out the case for a general realignment in the ERM. Yet Kolding's achievement was to produce a consensus on the ERM - even among the weaker currency members such as Spain and Portugal and those outside the system such as the UK and Italy. This consensus is an essential building block for Emu, said one EC official. Mr Norman Lamont, UK chancellor of the exchequer and an outspoken critic of the Bundesbank, conceded that the German central bank had fulfilled its obligations in support of sterling in the run-up to Black Wednesday.

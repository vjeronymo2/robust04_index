			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: A dry season in prospect for Johannesburg stocks - A nervous mood pervades the JSE The euphoria which accompanied the resounding referendum victory in South Africa three weeks ago has been replaced by a nervous mood on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) as investors contemplate the fragility of overseas markets and a number of negative factors on the domestic front. Although a negative outcome of the referendum would have been a catastrophe for the market, a positive outcome had been largely discounted. Analysts agree that its effect was neutral, since it merely confirmed that the country is addressing the complicated process of political negotiation, with all the attendant uncertainties. Buoyed by the strongly rising Dow Jones Industrial Average, the JSE all-share index rose nearly 8 per cent in the first two weeks of January. However, with the gold price slumping to a near six-year low in March, the market lost a lot of its momentum. This was followed by a 2 per cent fall last week as the JSE tracked the movements of the weak Japanese and London markets. The overall index closed at 3,440 yesterday, (the market was closed on Monday for a public holiday), down 7.4 per cent from its 1992 high of 3,713 in mid-January. Mr Roy McAlpine of Liberty Asset Management, the fund managers, comments: 'Everybody agreed that for the last few months the market looked fairly frothy. In this situation, at any possible opportunity it is likely to have a correction.' The weakness in the Nikkei average, he says, merely precipitated what was bound to happen eventually. Mr McAlpine observes that a frothy market in South Africa normally stops people buying, but it doesn't make them sell out. Hence last week's correction took place on fairly low volume. He also argues that the market is technically strong in the sense that it is dominated by institutions which hold most of the prime stock, and which tend to take a long-term view. Two factors on the mining side have had a bearish influence on the market: a very weak gold bullion price and a recent fall in the share price of De Beers, which closed yesterday at R83.80, down from a year's high of R96.85. De Beers dominates the JSE, making up nearly 10 per cent of the overall index. Last year turnover in De Beers accounted for 11 per cent of total turnover. The recent slide in its share price reflects poor prospects in 1992 which have led analysts to predict flat earnings for the year. Two other recent events which failed to revive the JSE were the country's budget, and the announcement by the Reserve Bank (central bank) of a 1 per cent cut in interest rates. Mr Rob Lee of the Board of Executors investment institution, says investors were disappointed by the budget, because although it was expansionary, and hence good for short-term growth, it did not contain fiscal incentives for business or individuals. The cut in interest rates was widely discounted, so it had a negligible effect. Of potential benefit for foreign investors was the recent announcement by the Reserve Bank that it plans to intervene in the volatile financial rand market. If the bank succeeds in narrowing the discount between the investment currency and the commercial rand, this would offer a currency appreciation for foreigners, thus making the JSE more attractive. It is too early, however, to properly assess the implications of the Bank's announcement. One potential threat to market prices, which is being ignored for now, is the country's severe drought which economists estimate will knock at least 0.5 per cent off economic growth this year. Mr McAlpine notes that historically there has been little correlation between GDP growth and the performance of the JSE. Analysts agree that shares are looking fully priced until there is evidence of an economic upturn, which is not expected until later in the year. Although there is unanimity that 1992 will not see the industrial index rise again by 40 per cent, as in 1991, there is also a widespread belief that the country's longer term prospects are good, and that the stock market will continue to reflect this.</p>

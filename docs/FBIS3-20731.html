"Elipton To Be Manufactured (Also) in </F> Serbia?!"]    [Text] (From VJESNIK correspondent) Belgrade -- The  Thursday edition of POLITIKA published a statement by Tomislav  Simic, owner of the "Elektron" factory in Sabac and president of  the local branch of the SSJ [Party of Serbian Unity] led by  Zeljko Raznjatovic-Arkan, stating that a "secret Russian weapon"  would be manufactured in his factory in the second half of next  year. This is the Russian "elipton" bomb that the leader of the  Russian Liberal Democrats, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, bragged about  when he visited Belgrade recently. On this occasion, Zirinovski  allegedly gave this "powerful Russian weapon" to Arkan, who  boasted that the "Russian bomb" had already been tested at  Brcko, where "13 Muslims were killed in the experiment."</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Symbol shows 'green' forestry Timber grown and sawn in Britain should in future carry a symbol guaranteeing that it was harvested under licence on the basis of sustainable forestry, if a scheme launched this week is successful, writes James Buxton. The Woodmark scheme, introduced by the Forestry Industry Committee of Great Britain, aims to meet public demand that consuming timber does not mean depleting forests. This demand has risen since Britain accepted forestry resolutions at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. From the middle of this year sawmills should stamp every plank of British wood with the Woodmark if they are satisfied that it was appropriately harvested. FICGB: UK, 071 930 9422.</p>

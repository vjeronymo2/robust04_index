			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Social market, Polish style AT FIRST sight, the result of Poland's election on Sunday looks like a step back to the future. In reality, by endorsing the two parties that ruled Poland for four decades of communism - one of them working under a new name, both with new policies - the electorate is not seeking the return of the old command economy. It is registering its desire to see market reforms tempered with greater attention to the problems they have inflicted on disadvantaged members of society, from public sector workers to old age pensioners. The consequence may be some slowing of the pace of change, but no real change in direction. With luck, Poland may even enjoy something it has not seen despite the momentous and largely positive developments since the demise of communism: a period of political stability in which the government can take a medium- to long-term view of the economy rather than having to indulge in crisis management. In one sense, these may seem foolishly bold pronouncements. The totalitarian past is so recent and Poland's position in the vanguard of economic and political reform so pivotal that any hint of a resurgence by the old nomenklatura might be expected to send shivers of apprehension through western and eastern Europe. The fact that such shivers were noticeably absent yesterday speaks eloquently about the scale of change that has already taken place. For one thing, the economy is in unrecognisably better shape than four years ago, with industrial production rising, the private sector now accounting for well over half of economic activity, and foreign investment making important inroads. For another, Polish politics appears to be maturing. Under the new electoral law that governed Sunday's poll, the number of parties represented in the Sejm (parliament) has been slashed from 29 to six. Most took care to explain their distinctive policy platforms, and although Polish voters have arguably endured too many elections in recent years, more of them than on some previous occasions turned out to exercise their choice. The result seems likely to be peaceful alternance in government of just the kind that parliamentary democracy was designed to achieve. Much now depends on the negotiations between parties to form a new coalition but here, too, the signs are not discouraging. The man at the centre of these talks - Mr Aleksander Kwasniewski, leader of the ex-communist Democratic Left Alliance - has repeatedly stressed his desire to press ahead with market reforms. Assuming he can keep hardline colleagues in check, he seems bent on establishing a broad-based coalition with a solid parliamentary majority, preferably including the centrist Democratic Union that led the outgoing government. Such a coalition would have a strong chance of surviving for a full four-year term and of governing without the interventions from President Lech Walesa that destabilised its predecessors. A government of this stripe will want to modify economic policy as the voters have asked. In boosting social spending and public sector wages, it may push up the budget deficit, fuel inflation and dampen economic growth. Poland's relationship with the IMF and World Bank could suffer turbulence as a result. But a new government will also be aware that its members' desire for reform and economic integration with western Europe imposes strict limits on their room for manoeuvre. It will be for Poles to decide how strict those limits should be.</p>

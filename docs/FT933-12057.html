			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Israeli attacks threaten Mideast peace talks: The Israeli-Lebanon border ISRAEL yesterday continued its fiercest air, sea and artillery onslaught in more than a decade against Arab guerrillas in Lebanon, seriously endangering the Middle East peace process. Fears that southern Lebanon might be plunged into war mounted last night as Israel said that a column of tanks and armoured personnel carriers was moving into the area and as the pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrillas vowed to keep attacking Israeli forces. For the second consecutive day Israeli aircraft, gunboats and artillery pounded targets across Lebanon, drawing retaliatory rocket, mortar and anti-aircraft fire. Hizbollah guerrillas stepped up their attacks, launching more than 60 Katyusha rockets into northern Israeli settlements. Arab governments condemned the Israeli offensive. Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the 51-member Islamic Conference Organisation urged immediate United Nations action to stop the attacks although a request by Lebanon for a Security Council meeting was later put on hold, apparently at the urging of the US. Council sources said Washington was anxious to avoid a debate when Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, was due to fly to the Middle East at the weekend. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, deplored both the Israeli attacks and the rocket strikes against northern Israel. However, on a tour of the north yesterday evening, an unrepentant Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, threatened to make southern Lebanon uninhabitable unless guerrilla attacks stopped immediately. 'We want to make it unequivocally clear that if there is no quiet here, there will be no quiet for the residents of south Lebanon,' he said. At least 35 people have been reported killed and more than 130 wounded since the assault was launched on Sunday in response to attacks by Hizbollah on Israeli troops deployed in south Lebanon. The Israeli army said that one soldier was killed and three others wounded in a Hizbollah attack yesterday  -the first Israeli military casualties since the offensive began. Thousands of Lebanese refugees were streaming northwards towards Beirut after Israel warned residents of 35 southern villages to flee if they wanted to escape further bombardment. In Tehran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader, urged the guerrillas to strengthen their resistance against 'the aggressor and the bullying regime of Israel'. Hizbollah officials said they would continue their attacks and admitted they were designed to sabotage the Middle East talks. A spokesman for the Palestine Liberation Organisation in Tunis accused Israel of having delivered a death blow to Middle East peace negotiations. Mr Ahmed Abderrahman told Reuter that the 'aggression. . . shows clearly the true face of the Israeli government as a war cabinet and not a peace cabinet'. In Paris Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, softened an earlier condemnation of the Israeli offensive by a ministry spokesman and blamed Hizbollah for the escalation of violence. Ireland also protested over 'unacceptable' shelling that had injured two Irish peacekeepers in Lebanon. Syria, which lost three soldiers in the first wave of Israeli attacks, said the continued action was putting the peace negotiations to a critical test and endangering the stability of the region, a view echoed by Egypt, the Arab League, Jordan and newspapers in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. More than 30 attacks by Israeli aircraft, helicopters and gunboats were reported yesterday, ranging from Tripoli in the north to Tyre in the south. Hizbollah strongholds and camps used by Palestinian allies were the main targets. A UN spokesman said that repeated barrages of artillery shells had been fired at the area just north of the zone occupied by Israel. Israeli gunboats were also blockading the ports of Sidon and Tyre. Yesterday's attacks came after an estimated 100 Katyusha rockets had been fired by Hizbollah and its Palestinian allies at Israeli troop positions and at settlements in northern Israel, where up to 150,000 people remained in reinforced underground bomb shelters. Two Israeli civilians died in the town of Kiryat Shmona on Sunday and 23 others were wounded. Israeli leaders yesterday sought to reassure the public that the armed forces would not be drawn into a large-scale ground attack as in 1978 and 1982. More than 650 Israeli troops died in the ill-fated 1982 invasion which forced the majority of Palestinian fighters out of Lebanon but also politicised the Shia population and led to the creation of Hizbollah. However, Gen Ehud Barak, army chief, refused to rule out at least limited ground operations north of the Israeli-controlled area of southern Lebanon. Mr Christopher said in Singapore that progress in Middle East peace talks was the only antidote to the fighting. The State Department denied earlier reports that the fighting had put his trip to the Middle East in question. The resumption of fighting is also a blow to the Lebanese government headed by Mr Rafik al-Hariri, the prime minister, who in the past eight months has secured more than Dollars 1bn in foreign investment and aid towards the rebuilding of the country.</p>

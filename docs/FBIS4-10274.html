			<p>BFN     [Text] Former UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar  said it would be premature to talk about a presidential  candidacy. He said that any candidate would demand that the  elections be clean and have guarantees.    [Begin Perez de Cuellar recording] I did say that any  candidate who runs for the presidency, or for a seat in the  unicameral Congress we now have, would demand that the elections  be clean, that the elections have guarantees. But having said  that does not mean I have accepted becoming a presidential  candidate. I believe that would still be a little premature. We  do not know if the current president will run for reelection;  that is not known, either. But naturally I cannot fail to say  that I feel very honored [words indistinct] who believe I could  represent a democratic solution in the upcoming general  elections. [end recording]    Let us continue to listen to Javier Perez de Cuellar, in an  exclusive interview with Radio Programas del Peru from Paris.  Perez de Cuellar said that if he becomes a candidate, he would  not be a candidate in opposition to President Alberto Fujimori,  but rather to his government policy.    [Begin recording, in progress]...not in opposition to  President Fujimori, but to a policy, and not necessarily against  an individual. We are not dealing with an individual. The  Peruvian problem is not the problem of an individual, it is the  problem of government, a problem of policy. When I gave you an  answer, what I meant was that I don't want to be a candidate in  opposition to the president, if he runs for reelection, but to  various aspects of his policies. And this is how it should  be--not an opposition to an individual but to his policy, to his  government actions. Therefore, if I were a candidate, I would  not be a candidate in opposition to the president, but in  opposition to the policies of the current government. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Spain, Banking and Finance (7): Locals were winners - The broking houses IT was hard, during the first half of this year, not to bump into a group of globe-trotting merchant bankers in the lobby of any one of Madrid's top half-dozen hotels. The billion-dollar issues of Repsol and of Argentaria had teams of them arriving every other day from New York and London. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the US banks who acted as global co-ordinators in the Repsol and Argentaria offerings respectively, were out in force - as was S. G. Warburg which was co-lead manager for the UK tranche in both issues. There were smaller teams from a clutch of other international houses who had secured minor roles in the placements. All the merchant bankers gained something, some more than others, through their involvement in the offerings. But arguably the real winners were not the top global firms but the domestic institutions who for the first time played a part in important deal-making. The two huge issues represented a big step forward for Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) which was co-global co-ordinator with Goldman Sachs in the Repsol issue, and also for Argentaria whose broking unit was likewise teamed up with Morgan Stanley in the issue of the parent bank. In particular the two offerings represented a breakthrough for Banco Santander de Negocios (BSN), the premier domestic merchant bank, which joined forces with S. G. Warburg as co-lead manager in the large UK placements of both issues. The Repsol offering underlined the strong role that Goldman Sachs has consolidated in big Spanish deals. The US bank established its reputation in Spain by guiding Telefonica shares on to the international markets in the mid-1980s and this led it to secure the co-ordination of 26 per cent of Repsol shares in 1989. Goldman Sachs then went on to lead the subsequent flotation of Endesa, the state-controlled electrical utility. The Argentaria issue was highly important to Morgan Stanley because the US bank has its eyes on forthcoming privatisations in France and in Italy. Morgan Stanley discovered that it was able to tap a very rich vein of American investors who were extremely interested in European banks. S. G. Warburg had wanted to lead a European placement for Argentaria and received a minor setback when the banking group gave it responsibility only for the UK and awarded a continental Europe tranche to Union of Bank of Switzerland. The London-based bank - which already had Repsol's UK offering under its belt - has, however, established a strong link between British investors and Spanish securities. All the three global firms which were most involved in the issues were 'shadowed' by Spanish institutions. The experience was at first unsettling for none wanted to share its expertise in international book-building but by the end there was a fair amount of praise. 'If we do another issue we will be much more confident about Spanish institutions,' said an executive of one of the US bank's involved in the placements. The general view, somewhat to S. G. Warburg's chagrin, was that BSN had 'been learning a lot' and gained 'very useful exposure' as the co-leader in the UK for the two placements. BSN certainly revelled in its opportunity. 'Goldman got its break when it placed Telefonica and then it got mandates everywhere and all the way to Mexico,' said a senior executive at the Madrid-based bank. 'The key to getting a deal is to have done one before and that is what we have achieved.' BSN - a subsidiary of Banco de Santander and headed by Ms Ana Patricia Botin whose father is chairman of Santander - has already built up considerable international experience in Latin America and particularly in Mexico where it has managed the Emerging Mexico Fund, matador bond issues and equity placements. Flushed with its involvement in the Repsol and Argentaria issues, BSN now casts itself as a potential 'Latin' Goldman, a specialist in big 'southern' deals stretching from Italy to Chile. Goldman and J. P. Morgan are role models for BSN. Its executives, all young and invariably foreign-trained, admire the deal-orientated motivation and the team spirit of the two US banks. Ms Botin was herself employed for several years by J. P. Morgan. Whether BSN secures big mandates in the Hispanic world and elsewhere remains to be seen. But the bank is likely to play increasingly important roles in future Spanish privatisations.</p>

In a press release at the beginning of this week, the  governor of the Bank of Uganda, Mr. Charles Kikonyogo stressed  that the introduction of the new currency note does not mean a  currency change. The new note, he said, will circulate side by  side with other notes currently in use. He added that the new  note will reach everybody in the country through the banking  system. The relevant posters will soon be on display at banks,  post offices and district administration offices.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Chechnya claims that "the Russian leadership is  virtually ready for an armed aggression against the republic."  A statement by Chechnya's State Security Department says that  it is with this aim that Russia is redeploying its troops around  the republic.    According to Groznyy, an elite Russian air assault unit has  taken up position at Mozdok (North Ossetia). Russian Interior  Ministry special troops are reported to be moving toward the  Chechen borders following Moscow's decision to extend the state  of emergency to the zone of Ossetian-Ingush conflict.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Lei (1728 7191): "Qin Wenjun, Deputy </F> Director of XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, Says There Are Three  Reasons Why CPPCC Will Not Set Up Branch Organization in Hong  Kong"]    [Text] Beijing, 9 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Qin Wenjun,  member of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National Committee and  deputy director of XINHUA NEWS AGENCY branch in Hong Kong,  pointed out this afternoon that there are three reasons why the  CPPCC will not set up a branch organization in Hong Kong at this  time; they are: Consideration given to the administration in  Hong Kong at this time; consideration given to problems after  1997; and the relevant provision of the Basic Law.    The Second Session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee  continued panel discussions this afternoon. Hong Kong members  of the CPPCC National Committee were divided into two panels,  and Qin Wenjun, as convener of the first panel, presided over  the discussion of the first panel together with Xu Simin.    In the panel discussion, Qin Wenjun said: During today's  discussion, many members have proposed that the CPPCC should set  up a branch organization in Hong Kong, and in recent years some  members have kept making such a proposal. We will relay your  ideas and suggestions to the senior levels and will ask them and  the relevant departments to study and consider them.    He said: In my opinion, it is not very suitable to establish  a branch organization of the CPPCC in Hong Kong under the  current conditions, and there are three main factors, which are  provided for the members' reference.    First, the CPPCC is a political organization in which  China's  CPPCC members participate in government and discuss government  matters, whereas Hong Kong is still under the administration of  the British Hong Kong authorities, so it is not suitable to  establish such an organization in Hong Kong.    Second, after 1997, the Chinese Government will practice  "one  country, two systems" in Hong Kong, therefore it is believed  that the way such an organization will be established at that  time is a problem that is being deliberated by the relevant  quarters.    The third point is that the Basic Law has relatively clear  stipulations on the issue of establishing Hong Kong branches or  offices by the organizations inside the country (including  government departments and power organs).    He said that therefore, judged from the current situation,  it  is not very convenient to set up a branch organization of the  CPPCC in Hong Kong.</p>

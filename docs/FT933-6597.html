			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Money Markets: New hopes on rates EXPECTATIONS that the Bundesbank would cut its discount rate at today's council meeting strengthened yesterday after the latest German inflation data were lower than the market had expected, writes James Blitz. The market appears to expect that the discount rate will be reduced by 1/2 percentage point today, from its current level of 6.75 per cent. However, there were fewer expectations that the central bank would call for a cut in the repo rate at next week's money market tender, preferring to keep it at around 6.80 per cent for 14-day funds. Expectations of a cut in the discount rate floor were strengthened by inflation figures for most of the German states which suggested that annualised inflation will be at 4.1 per cent in August, down from 4.3 per cent in July. This news helped to lift sentiment in the German cash and futures markets. The Bundesbank will probably heed the fact that five-year bunds also rallied on the news, closing about 40 ticks up. It was striking that 100 per cent of bids for funds were accepted by the Bundesbank in its weekly tender yesterday, but that only DM90.3bn was added. This was some DM10bn below expectations. Mr Adrian James, an economist at NatWest Markets, said this suggested that banks were holding back on bids, expecting easier borrowing conditions through a cheaper discount window. The low level of bids left dealers scrambling for funds at one stage, and call money was as high as 7.0 per cent. Euromark futures were up on the inflation news, reflecting expectations of lower rates. The December contract rose 7 basis points to 94.10. Better sentiment in Germany fed through to the French sector, where Pibor contracts were also higher. September finished 3 basis points higher at 93.20 and December was up 6 at 94.33. French policy continues to give the impres-sion that rates will only be reduced if the Bundesbank eases first. Sterling markets were mostly unaffected by the news in Europe, although the September short sterling contract closed 2 basis points firmer at 94.18. Three-month sterling cash was again unchanged at 5 7/8 per cent on the bid side. There was a daily shortage of Pounds 600m in the discount market, which was swiftly despatched.</p>

			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GLENDALE COLLEGE ORDERS BAN ON INDOOR SMOKING  </P> <P> The Glendale College Board of Trustees has voted unanimously to prohibit  smoking in the buildings on its campus.  </P> <P> The ban was approved Monday and will take effect in two weeks to allow students  and staff to adjust to the new rules.  </P> <P> It affects smoking in the student cafeteria, in faculty and staff dining rooms  and in private offices on campus.  </P> <P> Smoking has been prohibited in the classrooms for many years. Smoking will be  allowed outdoors, except in posted areas.  </P> <P> "If the airlines can do it, then Glendale Community College can do it," said  Board President Ted Tiffany. College staff proposed the ban as a way to protect  nonsmokers' rights to clean air, said Thomas M. Fallo, vice president of  administrative services.  </P> <P> There are no guidelines for enforcing the policy. "Peer pressure will probably  be sufficient for the present time," Fallo said.  </P> <P> Student Body President Tod Campbell said that student opinion was mixed on the  issue. Some smokers are not pleased with the ban, but it is timely and  appropriate, considering the health benefits of such a measure, he said.  </P> <P> Trustee Robert K. Holmes also proposed a ban on selling cigarettes at the  college. Supt. John Davitt said that the only source of cigarettes on campus, a  vending machine near the science building, is to be eliminated by March 1.  </P></p>

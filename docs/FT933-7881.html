			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / China promotes inland development zones CHINA has launched a drive to promote economic development zones in its inland regions to narrow the gap between the struggling hinterland and relatively prosperous coastal areas. Mr Liu Peiqiang, a senior official of China's State Council, or cabinet, said the government aimed to provide an economic boost for areas that had lagged behind the south and other regions in the scramble for investment funds. The authorities recently clamped down on the unrestrained spread of development zones in coastal regions - these zones offer generous tax breaks  -in an effort to re-direct investment elsewhere. A widening income gap between coastal and inland areas has begun to cause political problems. It has also resulted in a mass migration of people from China's hinterland to areas of opportunity, especially in southern China where the economic boom has been most pronounced. The State Council has approved 30 development zones across the country, but provincial and local governments have sought to develop thousands of such areas in a scramble for investment funds. The authorities in Beijing have disallowed most of these proposed zones in a nationwide clampdown. Mr Liu indicated that provincial capitals would be a favoured location for new development zones whose purpose is to attract foreign investment in processing and high-tech industries. South Korea yesterday began work on a Dollars 30m (Pounds 20.2m) industrial park for South Korean industry near the city of Tianjin, 130km east of Beijing. The site is being developed by the Korea Land Development Corporation, which is partly owned by the South Korean Construction Ministry. It will be the South Korean government's largest investment in China since diplomatic relations were established last year. Two-way trade is expected to reach Dollars 13bn, making China South Korea's third largest trade partner.</p>

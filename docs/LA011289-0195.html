			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE URGE TO CREATE;  </P> <P> SCR DIRECTOR BENSON SAYS FUGARD'S 'ROAD TO MECCA' EVOKES ENORMOUS COST ARTISTS  PAY FOR ROLE IN SOCIETY  </P> <P> When "A Road to Mecca" opens Friday on the Mainstage at South Coast Repertory,  it will be the third play by Athol Fugard that Martin Benson has directed at  the Costa Mesa theater -- more than that of any other playwright.  </P> <P> Yet the 51-year-old SCR co-founder is more readily associated with Shaw and  Synge because of the accolades heaped upon his staging of their works.  "Misalliance" in 1987 and "The Playboy of the Western World" in 1985 won 14 Los  Angeles Drama Critics Circle awards between them.  </P> <P> "The humanness of Fugard's plays is what lures me," Benson said. "The people  are so utterly real. And they are all in a situation of extremis. Fugard is a  great storyteller. I don't necessarily think he is a great poet, say, as  Tennessee Williams is. But his stories are so trenchant, so piquant. They're  always very vivid, very spare."  </P> <P> The first play by the South African playwright to draw Benson's attention was  "Blood Knot," a primal tale of love and hate between two black brothers -- one  of whom can and does pass for white. Benson mounted the play, which can be seen  as both a family drama and a metaphor for apartheid, on SCR's Second Stage in  1982.  </P> <P> The second was "Master Harold . . . and the Boys," a parable of shame taken  from an incident in Fugard's life. The play unfolds one quiet, rainy afternoon  in a small cafe and climaxes with a shattering insult when the proprietor's  son, a white boy of 17, invokes racial privilege against the black waiter who  has virtually raised him from childhood. Benson did "Master Harold" on the  Mainstage in 1985.  </P> <P> "Fugard often writes about his own experience," said the lanky, bearded  director, who flies acrobatic planes as a hobby and sat picturesquely in his  office wearing an old leather pilot's jacket with a sheepskin collar. "That is  why he is such a great storyteller. He can take the simplest incident and  construct around it, creating import and impact. But it starts with the  simplest things."  </P> <P> This time especially, because the central figure in "The Road to Mecca" seemed  to Fugard glancingly remote at first, in real life a lonely curiosity shadowed  by rumor.  </P> <P> As he has written, the seed for "Mecca" was planted during a drive through the  village of New Bethesda in the Karoo desert, 15 miles from where he was born in  1932. On a return trip to buy one of the "dirt-cheap" houses for a hideaway  from the city, the playwright heard of a reclusive widow in the village who was  considered crazy by the locals.  </P> <P> "They said that her craziness took the form of rather silly statues and  sculpture that she made and had all around her house," Fugard wrote.  </P> <P> Later, he used to stroll by her house to look at her garden of statues -- all  facing in the direction of Mecca. But "apart from seeing her in the distance  once or twice, and nodding at her," the playwright recalled, he "never got to  know her personally."  </P> <P> Fugard realized, of course, that the tensions between an eccentric widow and a  town alienated by her deviation from the norm would make "a damn good story."  Yet he was not hooked until years later, after she died, and an actress asked  him why he "never had two women together" on stage.  </P> <P> Coincidentally, Fugard discovered that during the last years of her life, the  woman, named Helen Martins, had developed a deep friendship with a young woman  who taught in Cape Town and was rebelling against the mores of South African  society at large.  </P> <P> "The young woman gave me . . . a photograph of herself and Miss Helen," Fugard  wrote. "I took one look . . . and there was my play."  </P> <P> First staged in 1984 at Yale Repertory under Fugard's direction, "The Road to  Mecca," is set in New Bethesda in Miss Helen's house. The time is 1974. There  are three characters -- Miss Helen, the young teacher Elsa, who arrives one  night on an urgent visit, and Marius Byleveld, the village pastor, who is  concerned about Miss Helen's health.  </P> <P> Fugard, who is also an actor, played Marius in a 1987 revival at the Spoletto  Festival and again on Broadway in 1988. Given Fugard's frequently stated  identification with Miss Helen, it was compelling casting, inasmuch as Marius  personifies everything against which Miss Helen stands.  </P> <P> Alan Mandel, the noted Beckett actor who directed Pinter's "The Caretaker" at  the Los Angeles Theater Center last season, is making his SCR debut as Marius.  Nan Martin, last seen at SCR in "Aunt Dan and Lemon" and more recently at LATC  in "The Seagull," is Miss Helen. And Christine Healy, who was in "The Real  Thing" two seasons ago at SCR, is Elsa.  </P> <P> "One of the most powerful messages in this play," SCR's Benson said, "is the  artist's need to create. It doesn't necessarily have to do with a palpable  appreciation for art, or whether the art is good even. It has to do with a  particular urge -- genetic, psychological, whatever.  </P> <P> "One Sunday, when Miss Helen was all dressed up to go to church, which she had  done every Sunday of her life. She took off her prim dress and white gloves,  changed her clothes and mixed up some cement to create herself a mermaid. Why?  Who knows?  </P> <P> "But there is an implicit lesson that says the artist is a unique individual in  society, and that the artist pays an enormous price for that. There is a  certain amount of isolation. There is an inevitable amount of rejection."  </P> <P> More explicitly, Benson said, the drama derives its strength from the personal  interplay between Miss Helen and Elsa, while tracing a thematic tangent about  the moral and political climate of their country. "Mecca" focuses, for  instance, on the difference between trust and love rather than exploiting  "buzzwords that go off in our brain, like apartheid," he said.  </P> <P> In fact, for the first time in a major Fugard play, there are no black  characters -- except in reports about their brutalized, poverty-stricken lives  off stage.  </P> <P> As to on-stage villains, Benson said the play has none -- not even Marius,  whose Victorian values may approximate those of Pastor Manders in Ibsen's  "Ghosts" but without his hypocritical motives.  </P> <P> "I think Marius truly means well," he said. "Like all of us, he does things out  of love that are harmful. I think he truly loves Miss Helen. But he sees that  her spirituality vastly exceeds his own, which makes him a desolate man."  </P> <P> After his most recent Mainstage outings, the lack of villainy is something of a  change of pace for Benson. Last season he directed Wallace Shawn's "Aunt Dan  and Lemon," which is about the banality of evil. In September, as the SCR fall  opener, he directed Arthur Miller's "The Crucible" about the Salem witch  trials.  </P> <P> "I don't think there's any dark moment in my soul," he said. "There was no  tie-in in my mind. I didn't pick Miller or Fugard to satisfy some need of my  psyche."  </P> <P> Perhaps not. But "The Crucible," at least, must have satisfied some need in the  public's psyche. It broke the SCR box-office record set last spring by Richard  Sheridan's 18th-Century comedy, "The School for Scandal."  </P> <P> "I never dreamed it would be our top-grossing show ever," said Benson, who has  directed more than a third of the Tony-winning company's 230-plus productions  in the last 25 years.  </P> <P> He was surprised, moreover, that "Misalliance" had also been a box-office smash  -- although he likes to quip that Shaw is "one of the best young writers  writing today."  </P> <P> "In a lot of circles," he said, "they think of him as 'dusty old Shaw,' and  come to think of it, a lot like Miss Helen."  </P> <P> Happy with the analogy, Benson paused.  </P> <P> "You know," he said, "Shaw was reviled in his early days. He went though  terrible depressions about his writing. His plays were crucified, just like  Miss Helen's statues. But he kept working. So does Miss Helen. It's what  'Mecca' is all about."  </P> <P>  "The Road to Mecca" by Athol Fugard plays through Feb. 16 at South Coast  Repertory's Mainstage, 655 Town Center Drive, Coast Mesa.

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: Bell, Stet in tender for Matav Stet, the Italian state-owned telecom utility, and its consortium partner Bell Atlantic, the US regional operator, have entered the leading first-round bid in Hungary's telecom privatisation tender. Stet International and Bell Atlantic are believed to have offered between Dollars 800m and Dollars 850m for the 30 per cent shareholding in Matav, the Hungarian national operator, in eastern Europe's largest single privatisation so far. The figure comfortably betters submissions made by two groups regarded as the strongest contenders in the sale. Deutsche Telekom of Germany, in alliance with the UK's Cable &amp; Wireless and regional Bell company Ameritech, is understood to have bid Dollars 420m-Dollars 500m. France Telecom, linked with US West, another Baby Bell, is thought to have offered over Dollars 450m. The German and French-led proposals also lag behind that of Telefonica of Spain, the fourth competitor to be shortlisted, although estimates of Telefonica's bid vary. None of the groups would officially confirm the figures. Advisers also warned that consortium bids were 'apples and pears' and not wholly comparable. Stet in particular worked on the assumption that Matav will continue to dominate local telephone services. Stet's lead in the first round of preliminary, 'indicative' bids is no reliable guide to the outcome of the second and decisive phase. Final bids are due on December 14 and the Budapest authorities hope to complete the transaction by the end of the year. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bank's International Finance Corporation are to invest a combined Dollars 90m in Matav.</p>

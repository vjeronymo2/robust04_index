			<p>BFN     [Text] Borys Tarasyuk, head of Ukraine's National  Disarmament Committee and deputy foreign affairs minister,  delivered a speech at a plenary CSCE session in Vienna today.  In particular, he informed the session participants about the  measures taken by the leadership of Ukraine in the field of  nuclear disarmament and armaments control. Relevant decisions  by the Supreme Council, the president, and the government  convincingly testify to Ukraine's responsible attitude toward  issues of the nonproliferation of mass annihilation weapons, and  Ukraine's readiness to establish equal partnership relations  with all countries to ensure universal peace and stability.    Touching on the nuclear weapons nonproliferation issue, the  Ukrainian representative told the participants in the forum that  a relevant agreement on the implementation of the IAEA  guarantees in relation to the nuclear materials used for  peaceful nuclear activities in Ukraine was coordinated with that  agency recently.    In his speech Borys Tarasyuk paid special attention to the  prospects of Ukraine's participation in multilateral  undertakings to control the export of sensitive goods and  technologies. In particular, he criticized the stand of the  former Cocom [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export  Controls] member states, which does not take into account  Ukraine's proposal on its participation in the process of  creating a new international regime of export control.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Day in Parliament" program] </F>   [Excerpts] [passage omitted] An assistant minister in the  office of the president, Julius Ole Sunkuli, today informed the  House that 18 people have died and scores of others injured in  ethnic fighting between Kalenjins and Kikuyus in the Burnt  Forest area of Uasin Gishu district. In a ministerial statement  regarding the situation in the area, Mr. Sunkuli further told  the House that so far 28 people have been arrested in connection  with fighting. [passage omitted]    He gave the breakdown of those killed as 12 Kikuyus, five  Kalenjins, and one person of unknown origin. Those arested  include 18 Kalenjins, seven Kikuyus, and three Luhyas. Those  arrested have been charged with being in possession of dangerous  weapons and being in possession of firearms, Mr. Sunkuli said.    Responding to the assistant minister's statement, the  official leader of the opposition, Wamalwa Kijana, said the  government must be firm and resolve to end the tribal clashes.  Mr. Wamalwa charged that the government seemed to pay lip  service to the recurrent tribal clashes and called for a  permanent solution to the issue. He warned that if the clashes  went unchecked there was a danger of an outbreak of civil war in  the country. The leader of the opposition wondered why not a  single member of the opposition had been arraigned in a court of  law for being involved in the clashes, as alleged by the  government.    Mr. Mwai Kibaki, member for Othaya, DP [Democratic Party],  who on Thursday [31 March] last week sought a ministerial  statement regarding the tribal clashes in Burnt Forest,  responding to the assistant minister's statement, charged that  the people burning houses and committing atrocities in the area  seemed properly equipped and were well organized. The member  asserted that the curfew imposed in the area was bound to serve  no purpose since houses had already been burnt. He wondered  which houses they were supposed to go to since theirs have been  burnt. Mr. Kibaki said the country had enough security  personnel capable of maintaining law and order in a single  division. [passage omitted]</p>

Customs Intendant Jose Herrera Meza also revealed that last  year the BAOE halted the illegal shipment out of the country of  over 436 archeological treasures, paintings, and woven items  concealed in other goods or equipment marked for export.    In addition, the unit found forged bills worth some  $113,700,  compared with only $65,000 in 1991.    Concerning the drug, RAP Captain Luis Otoya Moscol, head of  the BAOE, said that in 1992 only 38 kilos and 415 grams of  cocaine hydrochloride had been seized by Customs at Jorge Chavez  International Airport. In Iquitos, 50 kilos and 590 grams of the  same drug were seized, while 59 kilos and 770 grams of PBC  [cocaine paste], and 7 kilos and 200 grams of washed paste were  confiscated at the rest of the country's Customs stations.</p>

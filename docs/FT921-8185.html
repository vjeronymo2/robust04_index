			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Social workers lose jobs after long strike MORE than 100 employees of Camden council in north London yesterday lost their jobs as social workers following a long-running strike. The striking social workers, all members of the Nalgo public-sector union, will be considered for other jobs within the council over the next four weeks. But Camden said they were unlikely to secure jobs within the authority because of cost-cutting and would probably be made redundant. Nalgo yesterday accused Camden of trying to escalate the dispute and said it planned to ask other council staff to strike in support of the social workers. The union plans to extend an existing ban on Nalgo members applying for social work posts in Camden to all social services posts. The strike, which has lasted nearly 10 months, started after the council refused to pay a nationally negotiated increase in 1989. Camden had previously negotiated a local increase to boost recruitment. Staff then went on strike in April last year . Mr Phil Turner, who heads the staff and management services committee, said the national agreement did not apply because the local agreement 'offered better terms'. He said the council had offered conciliation and arbitration, which was rejected by Nalgo and the social workers. The council said it has been forced to restructure the social work department because of recent legislation. Before Christmas last year, social workers were offered new posts and a pay rise. The deadline for acceptance was yesterday.</p>

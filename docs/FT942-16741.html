			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Amec chairman warns of tough building markets Amec, the UK construction, engineering and property group, returned to the black last year, making pre-tax profits of Pounds 21m. This compared with losses of Pounds 88.2m in 1992, when figures were depressed by property write-downs and contract provisions. The turnround was less than expected, however, and the shares fell 5p to 135p. Sir Alan Cockshaw, chairman, warned that UK construction markets were likely to remain difficult while too many companies were chasing too little business. He joined the heads of other large UK construction companies in calling for much-needed rationalisation to take place within the industry. Sir Alan added that he did not believe this would occur. Mr Martin Laing, chairman of John Laing, last month blamed banks and institutional shareholders for propping up 'enfeebled contractors', adding to the damaging over-capacity. Amec said yesterday it was placing greater emphasis on pursuing overseas orders and establishing long-term relationships with customers to reduce its dependence on conventional bidding, where margins were expected to be 'extremely competitive in most areas of UK markets'. It added that similar conditions prevailed in many parts of continental Europe, apart from Germany where demand for construction remained strong. The company had also made good progress in the Far East. Amec, as previously indicated, is increasing its final dividend from 1p to 1.5p making an unchanged total of 3p. Earnings per share of 3.6p compared with a 44.5p loss after exceptionals. Group turnover rose by 3 per cent to Pounds 2.18bn due mainly to increased hook-up work on North Sea oil and gas rigs. This work was expected to decline in the current year, said Sir Alan. Mechanical and electrical engineering profits, which have held up better than general building and civil engineering, rose from Pounds 18m to Pounds 22.8m on flat turnover of Pounds 1.36bn. General contracting profits, by comparison, fell from Pounds 22.7m to Pounds 9.6m. Housebuilding moved back to a small profit last year. Overall the residential and commercial property division reduced its losses from Pounds 17.1m to Pounds 7.6m. In the UK, profits fell from Pounds 37.3m to Pounds 28m. Losses in the US went up from Pounds 2.6m to Pounds 6.1m, but the figures masked a strong second-half improvement. Lex, Page 18</p>

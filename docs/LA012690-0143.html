			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SEA VIEW LEAGUE GIRLS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> TUSTIN TAKES OVER AFTER A QUARTER TO BEAT UNIVERSITY  </P> <P> For the second time this season, University High School took on Tustin in a  matchup of the Sea View League's top teams. This time the game was on the  Trojans' home court, but for the second time, University lost, this time 67-52.  </P> <P> Christine Garner led the way with 21 points as Tustin (17-5 overall, 6-0 in  league play) moved two games ahead of University (14-5, 4-2) in the league  standings.  </P> <P> Garner, who hit eight of 13 shots (62%), was more than just an offensive force.  Her defense against University's leading scorer, Denise Gandara, helped Tustin  pull away in the second half.  </P> <P> "Garner did a great job against Gandara," Tustin Coach Rick Falk said. "She  (Gandara) had 10 in the first quarter. Garner held her to five points the rest  of the game."  </P> <P> The key was Falk's change from a zone defense to man-to-man in the second  quarter. "They were killing the zone," Falk said.  </P> <P> Especially Gandara, who made four of seven shots in the first quarter to help  University take a 20-15 lead.  </P> <P> But with Tustin's defensive switch, University and Gandara cooled off in the  second quarter while Tustin got hot behind the penetration of point guard Wanda  Sequeira and an improved performance at the free-throw line.  </P> <P> Sequeira scored six of her eight second-quarter points at the line. She also  twice assisted Garner, who had eight second-quarter points as Tustin outscored  University, 18-9, to take a 33-29 lead at half.  </P> <P> The Tillers, who made only three of 11 free throws in the first quarter, made  six of eight in the second and shot 46% to University's 33%.  </P> <P> Tustin made 11 of 12 free throws in the second half and pulled ahead, 50-38, on  Shari Needham's three-point basket at the end of the third quarter.  </P> <P> University was never able to cut the lead below double digits and trailed by as  many as 17 late in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Tustin had three players score in double figures: Garner (21), Needham (18) and  Sequeira (17). University center Tara Wolff scored 12 points, mostly off  perimeter jump shots.  </P> <P> "I've never seen (University Coach) Doug (Sorey) play a zone," Falk said. "It  was a complement to our kids.  </P> <P> "This is a big one for us. Probably the biggest game our kids have played.  Before the game I told the kids to concentrate on the fact that we're the best  team. There is no pressure on us."  </P> <P> Tustin won the first time around, 58-53.  </P> <P> In another league game:  </P> <P> Corona del Mar 40, Newport Harbor 39 -- Host Corona del Mar won its first  league game in two years when Mollie Flint scored a layup at the buzzer. Flint  finished with eight points and Heather Flaherty had 23 points and 23 rebounds  to lead Corona del Mar (3-15, 1-5). Stacy Giem had 19 points for Newport  Harbor, which fell to 2-3 in league play.  </P> <P> Estancia 58, Saddleback 47 -- Melody Earle had 18 points and Liz Collins had 12  points and 18 rebounds for visiting Estancia (8-10, 3-3). Janet Chacon had 22  points for Saddleback, which dropped to 2-4 in league play.  </P></p>

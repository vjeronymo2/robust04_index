			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Primerica looks at bid valuing Travelers at Dollars 5.5bn PRIMERICA, the US financial services group, is planning a bid valuing Travelers, the composite insurer hit in recent years by troubled property investments, at Dollars 5.5bn (Pounds 3.57bn). This would rank it as one of the largest insurance takeovers in US history. If completed, the all-share deal would create a financial services group combining one of the US's biggest insurers with the country's second largest retail stockbroker, Primerica's Smith Barney Shearson. The new group, capitalised at more than Dollars 15bn, would be among the largest financial services companies in the US. Primerica said it was discussing a possible merger with Travelers under which it would offer 0.80423 of a share in Primerica for every Travelers share. Mr Sanford Weill, chairman, who has built Primerica through takeovers since the late 1980s into a diversified consumer credit, investment and insurance group, agreed to pay Dollars 722m for a 27 per cent stake last September. Since then, he and three other Primerica executives have sat on the Travelers board and have been instrumental in efforts to sort out the insurers' finances and operations. Few analysts yesterday predicted much opportunity for co-operation between Travelers and existing Primerica operations, though the group could benefit by selling annuity and other life insurance products through Smith Barney's 10,500 stockbrokers. However, the combination would bolster Travelers' weak capital position, helping raise its credit ratings and make it easier to attract investment funds. 'The combined entity would be well capitalised and would in the long-term benefit both financially and operationally,' said Mr Lawrence Mayewski, senior vice-president at AM Best, an insurance rating agency giving the insurer an A-minus rating. The deal, which would leave Travelers shareholders with just under a third of the shares in the new group, was valued at Dollars 5.5bn yesterday as Primerica's share price rose Dollars 1 1/2 to close at Dollars 47 1/2. At Dollars 36 5/8, up Dollars 5/8, Travelers shares remained near their high for the past year, though below the Dollars 37 1/2 value implied by the Primerica offer.</p>

			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> HANK WILLIAMS JR. STICKS TO GUNS  </P> <P> Despite a setback from the U.S. Supreme Court, country music star Hank Williams  Jr. plans to continue his fight against a woman who claims to be his father's  daughter.  </P> <P> The high court Monday let stand a ruling that Cathy Yvonne Stone, 37, a country  music performer known as Jett Williams, is entitled to have her fight for some  of the late country music legend's royalties put before a jury.  </P> <P> At the same time, the court left intact an Alabama Supreme Court ruling that  declared Stone an heir to the elder Williams.  </P> <P> "The U.S. Supreme Court has refused to hear the case -- this is not a judgement  -- and we're simply going to seek other remedies," said Merle Kilgore, Hank  Jr.'s manager.  </P> <P> Stone was born in 1953, five days after Hank Sr. died at age 29. Her mother,  Bobbie Jett, and Williams had signed an agreement months earlier in which he  acknowledged that he might be the father of the then-unborn child.  </P> <P> Stone said she has won the five-year fight.  </P> <P> "I feel it's as big a victory for my father, Hank Williams, as myself," she  said. "This is what should have been done in the beginning."  </P></p>

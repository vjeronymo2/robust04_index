			<p>BFN     [Text] Srbobran, April 19 (TANJUG) -- The separation of  Moslem and Croat forces in the area of Gornji Vakuf and the  division of the territory of this town in central  Bosnia-Herzegovina, which began on Tuesday [19 April], are  accompanied by frequent incidents and exchange of fire between  the two armies, Bosnian Serb military sources said.    Moslems will keep the name Gornji Vakuf for their part of  the  town, while the Croats will change the name to Uskoplje. Gornji  Vakuf will be the third town that has been carved up by the  Moslems and Croats. Mostar, the biggest town and the  administrative seat of the region of Herzegovina in the  southwest of the republic, and Vitez, in the central part, have  already been divided. These towns were the sites of the  heaviest one-year Moslem-Croat clashes in the central and  southern parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina when they were fighting for  territories.    The ceasefire agreement and division of territories followed  the signing of an agreement on a Moslem-Croat federation in  Washington on March 18 under strong U.S. pressure. The  federation should eventually form a confederation with  neighbouring Croatia.</p>

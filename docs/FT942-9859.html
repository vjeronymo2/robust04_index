			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Personal View: Don't cut and run in a crisis Despite years of effort and restructuring, the international real estate crisis which erupted in 1989 has strained the banking system and had a negative effect on economic recovery in the US, Europe and Japan. Now, however, solutions and ideas beckon from an unexpected quarter: the international debt crisis. For more than a decade, bankers and public officials have worked together to resolve the debt crisis which hit Latin America in 1982. Last month, Brazil became the last of the big Latin American economies to resolve its external debt problem by completing a Dollars 49bn financing package. The two crises were very different, but borrowers and lenders associated with the international debt problem learnt some important lessons which may now point the way out of the real estate slump. The first is, don't cut and run. Many institutions which did just that are clamouring to do business with developing countries again, now that they are recovering. I see a similar response developing in the real estate market. Lenders and other property holders should resist the temptation to sell prematurely. Yet they should not be afraid to deal in the marketplace. In order to assess the resources necessary to maximise the market value of property and determine a reasonable time frame for realising that value, proper analysis is required, avoiding the flawed assessments of economic and market trends that occurred in the 1980s. As lenders and property holders make such an analysis on each of their properties, they will often find that time is on their side. Staying with the business affords more opportunities for finding buyers of distressed property. Those who remain for the long haul will stand a better chance of realising the full value of assets and will be in the best position to profit when the market turns. The second lesson is to take each case on its merits. The debt crisis highlighted that, from country to country, different economic policies were needed to reflect different realities. A like-minded logic compels the same strategy in real estate: each property is unique. In most cases, packaging debt of varying quality tends to lessen the value of the most attractive assets. As creditor banks and debtor property holders work towards individual solutions they invariably hit upon financial innovations that figure prominently in shaping the subsequent turnround. One enduring legacy of the international debt crisis is the emergence of secondary markets dealing in developing country debt. Non-existent 10 years ago, these markets now do more than Dollars 2,000bn of business annually. Liquidity adds value. The debtor does not change - the nature of the paper does. The first step toward securitisation of foreign debt was in 1984, when Mexico and its creditor banks agreed, as part of a multi-year restructuring, to allow the conversion of Mexican debt into equity. Chile, Argentina and other countries later used this restructuring instrument in their privatisation efforts. This heralded a market-based solution to the debt problem. Banks and other institutions soon began making markets in debt. This trend led to Brady bonds and, more recently, mutual funds of emerging market debt. Real estate can learn from this experience and, indeed, a variant of the debt-equity swap is now emerging. A few real estate lenders are refinancing debt in return for a substantial equity stake in the underlying property. That way the lender does not just take the losses; if a property's value bounces back, both lender and borrower reap gains. The biggest beneficiary of the international debt experience, though, has been the emerging field of commercial mortgage securitisation. In 1993, Dollars 18bn of new commercial mortgage-backed securities was issued in the US - three times the 1990 level. Securitisation is becoming a sure-fire way of liquefying real estate portfolios and expanding the investor base. Of course, banks will continue to be an important source of new mortgages, but they will come to rely on securitisation as a means of diversifying real estate portfolios and avoiding the interest rate squeeze that hurt bank profits during the 1970s. The experience of the last decade suggests that no crisis is intractable. As institutions go about fixing these crises, they find that they are also changing business fundamentals in a positive way. In a very real sense they are creating the future from the wreckage of the past. The author is vice-chairman of Citibank and Citicorp with responsibility for North America commercial real estate. Since 1982, he has been chairman of the industry-wide advisory committees for Brazil, Argentina, Peru and Uruguay, and principal co-chairman of the committee for Mexico</p>

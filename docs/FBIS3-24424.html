			<p>Language: <F P=105> Armenian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Arpi Totoyan: "LRAGIR on Diaspora"] </F>   [Excerpts] LRAGIR [Newspaper] is the newest daily in  Armenia's press. The paper began publishing in October 1993 with  Haykazn Ghahriyan as editor-in-chief and Tadeos Khachatryan as  editor. At first glance, that is from the standpoint of  presentation, the paper owes much to artistic editor Artur  Ghandilyan whose page layout makes the paper attractive. This  point needs mentioning given that the Armenian press pays little  attention to page layout which comes on the top of poor paper  and ink quality which makes their output virtually unreadable.    In addition, LRAGIR is one of the few Armenian papers that  publishes material worth reading. Most papers carry articles  that often echo anachronistic ideas in a multicolumn format  which tires the reader. LRAGIR's articles and analyses indicate  that an effort has been made to keep them brief, a quality that  is much sought but rarely found in Armenia's papers. With  serious and independent reporting added to these attributes, one  gets a daily which has been missed by many for so long.    Another factor that distinguishes LRAGIR is that it writes  about the Diaspora more than any other paper in Armenia. Its  recent issues in particular (late January and early February)  carried several articles on the Diaspora. For example, the  paper's 29 January issue carries an unsigned article entitled  "The Armenian Diaspora: The Era of Parties is Fading." The  article subjects the political life of the Armenian diaspora,  with its organizations, factions and future outlook, to a  detailed and accurate analysis. [passage omitted]    LRAGIR continues its interest in the Diaspora with reports  about Diaspora assistance to Armenia in its 1 and 2 February  issues. The first article by Vahe Tondrakyan is entitled  "Diaspora's Current Assistance to Armenia" and subtitled "Aid  Declines Steadily." The second article by Hayk Mesropyan is  entitled "Armenia an International Beggar" and subtitled "The  Diaspora and Humanitarian Aid." Both article are shorter than  the political analysis of the Diaspora. The first article  briefly enumerates the assistance provided by the largest  Diaspora organizations and says that this aid began with the  earthquake [of 1988] and has been declining steadily. Tondrakyan  writes that after creating branches and press organs in Armenia,  Diaspora organizations thought their work was done. He describes  assistance by political parties as a "supply of financial and  technical means for information and press dissemination to their  sister organizations."    Although interesting, the views of the writer are difficult  to debate in today's conditions. Those views are summarized in  the following paragraph: "It is becoming steadily clear that the  Diaspora's assistance to Armenia and the Nagorno-Karabakh  Republic is only temporary and that in the future it is the  latter that must help the Diaspora."    Hayk Mesropyan's article contains even sharper points. After  stating that "today Armenia has earned the reputation of being  an international beggar," he continues with evident bitterness:  "What is most painful is that our Diaspora brethren also have  the same disrespectful attitude toward Armenia."

			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALCULATED RISKS;  </P> <P> SINCE MANY AMERICANS' FAVORITE FOODS PROVIDE HALF THE DAY'S ALLOWANCE OF 30%  CALORIES FROM FAT, HEALTH EXPERTS SAY CONSUMERS NEED MORE NUTRITION EDUCATION.  </P> <P> "If you are one of the 2 out of 3 Americans who do not smoke or drink  excessively, your choice of diet can influence your long-term health more than  any other action you might take." -- U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop  </P> <P> Since the Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition and Health was published last  year, news about diet and health has been prolific. Consequently, terms like  "30%-fat-calories" and "good health" have become synonymous as this country's  battle of the bulge rages forward.  </P> <P> But the plethora of information, available through such sources as the media,  bookstores and supermarket check-out counters, has had a chilling effect on  consumers trying to figure out how to adhere to the recommendations in the  report.  </P> <P> Many people, in fact, are having considerable trouble with the edict that fat  in the diet must be reduced to 30% of the day's total calories. Health experts  say that understanding scientific data and identifying foods that are rich  sources of fat are seen as two major obstacles.  </P> <P> In his report, Koop pointed out that many of the diseases plaguing this country  have beginnings in dietary excess and imbalance. The typical American diet, it  was reported, is too high in calories, fat, salt, sugar and alcohol and too low  in fiber and other protective factors. He explained that since there are so  many risk factors for disease that are uncontrollable -- heredity, age and sex  -- Americans should make the effort to take action in the one area over which  they have control: Diet. Still, government surveys demonstrate that consumers  have been frustrated in their attempts to do so.  </P> <P> The American Dietetic Assn., a national organization of nutrition  professionals, hopes to change that through its National Nutrition Month  program, slated this month.  </P> <P> "There are so many guidelines," said Betty Nowlin, a registered dietitian and  media spokeswoman for ADA, "that consumers are confused about what is accurate  information to believe. It is the role of ADA, being experts in nutrition, to  be the leaders in providing accurate information to the public.  </P> <P> "People in today's fast-paced society want quick, easy, assessable information  that they can transfer into their regular life styles," said Nowlin. "They need  to have choices available."  </P> <P> She explained that many people today still don't realize that "simple, gradual  changes" in eating habits can produce the recommended decline in fat level,  without neglecting good taste. Data such as the following, accumulated by the  United States Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration  supports that notion:  </P> <P>  -- Public awareness of the link between dietary fat and heart disease rose  from 45% in 1982 to 80% in the mid-1980s.  </P> <P>  -- Only 29% of the people surveyed knew that a product described as  cholesterol-free could still be high in saturated fat.  </P> <P>  -- As few as 11% of those queried in 1984 and 1986 correctly indicated that  hydrogenation made a fat more saturated: 27% thought it meant a fat was less  saturated.  </P> <P>  -- Women's diets changed considerably between 1977 and 1985. They shifted to  non-fat and low-fat milk and diet carbonated drinks, less meat and fewer eggs.  Still, they consume too much fat -- typically from cheese and cream desserts,  salad dressings and table fats.  </P> <P> To dispel some of the myths responsible for these figures, ADA has compiled a  variety of facts about fat -- its primary sources (especially those hidden in  the diet) -- and offers tips on assessing fat in the diet. It is hoped that the  information will make the 30% fat goal attainable, by encouraging people to  consume diets that are lower in fat overall, and discourage the "good food/bad  food" syndrome of eliminating entire food groups that are perceived as high in  fat.  </P> <P> For some people, for instance, the way to reduce fat in the diet has been to  delete certain foods from the diet. Items that supply essential nutrients for  proper functioning of the body are often replaced by stand-ins with the  perceived health benefit. It is viewed as a quick and painless solution to the  problem of nutrition in the fast-paced society of today.  </P> <P> One ADA member described a client that resorted to taking fiber pills before  meals to prevent overeating and increase her fiber intake. She recommended that  the client eat a piece of fruit before meals instead.  </P> <P> Another member recalls the client who said, "Tums give me all the calcium I  need," failing to comprehend that low-fat dairy products are a more easily  absorbed source of the mineral and offer other vital nutrients for little fat.  </P> <P> Others still observe dieters who boast of having "only a salad" for lunch,  without understanding that the amount of fat they consumed was just slightly  less than if they'd eaten a hamburger with all the trimmings. One standard  restaurant ladle of dressing can have as much as 300 calories, according to  ADA.  </P> <P> A way to avoid scenarios such as these, is to become better prepared in the  supermarket and learn to fit favored foods into a reasonably balanced 30% diet  plan. Reading food labels is a good place to start. Since most products list  the amount of fat in grams on the side of the package, this is the best way to  become familiar with the actual amount of fat in foods typically consumed.  Then, serving sizes of these items can be adjusted to fit in a 30% diet plan,  based on the method described below.  </P> <P> The process of estimating fat in the diet is similar to the method of counting  calories, once popular with dieters. And the procedure is simple.  </P> <P> First, determine how many calories you usually eat during the course of the  day, eliminating snacks, Nowlin said, because items such as crackers and  desserts offer little nutrition for a high calorie price.  </P> <P> Then, see how many grams of fat you are allowed for your caloric intake  (below), based on the 30% fat level. Since most food labels tell the number of  grams a food contains per serving, this is the most efficient way to meet the  goal. (Translation of grams of fat to percent of fat calories is more tricky  and won't be explained here).  </P> <P> The Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for energy intake (calories) is based  upon the energy needs of people doing light work throughout the day. This  figure may be adjusted more or less depending upon energy expenditure. In other  words, the more you move around during the day -- whether at work or during an  exercise program -- the more calories, and therefore fat, you are entitled to.  </P> <P> For example: the RDA for calories for young to middle-aged males ranges from  2,300 for sedentary to 3,100 or more if active. The RDA is 1,800 to 2,100  calories for females. While there is no RDA for dieting women, it is  recommended that they stay within the 1,200 to 1,500 calories-per-day range  unless the diet is supervised by a physician.  </P> <P> To achieve the 30% goal, a person consuming 1,200 calories per day is entitled  to no more than 40 grams of fat. For every 300-calorie increment, add 10 grams  of fat per day: 1,500 calories, 50 grams of fat; 1,800, 60 grams of fat; 2,100,  70 grams of fat, etc.  </P> <P> In the beginning, this process may seem troublesome, but keeping a mental or  written note of the grams of fat as they accumulate is a good way to keep track  of fat in the diet. Eventually, when you've memorized the amount of grams in  regularly eaten foods, you can easily budget favorite foods back into the diet.  </P> <P> In the meantime, see the accompanying list of food substitutions that may be  helpful in assessing foods to include or exclude from a 30%-fat diet and  exchange the following low-fat recipes for the high-fat foods pictured on Page  1.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BRANIFUL MUFFINS  </P> <P> 1/2 cup warm water  </P> <P> 1 cup raisins  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon honey  </P> <P> 4 cups wheat or oat bran flakes cereal  </P> <P> 1/4 cup granulated sugar  </P> <P> 2 1/2 teaspoons baking soda  </P> <P> 3/4 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups plus 2 tablespoons flour  </P> <P> 3/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons oats  </P> <P> 1/2 cup oat bran  </P> <P> 4 egg whites  </P> <P> 1/3 cup canola oil  </P> <P> 1/2 cup brown sugar, packed  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon vanilla  </P> <P> 2 cups buttermilk  </P> <P> Juice and grated zest of 1 orange  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons margarine, chilled  </P> <P> Combine water, raisins and honey in small custard cup and let soak until plump.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in large bowl, combine cereal, granulated sugar, baking soda, salt,  1 1/2 tablespoons cinnamon, 1 1/2 cups flour, 3/4 cup oats and oat bran.

			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LAFCO VOTES DOWN LAGUNA BEACH ANNEXATION OF LAGUNA LAUREL AREA  </P> <P> Laguna Beach city officials, fighting to keep development out of pristine  Laguna Canyon, were handed a setback Wednesday when the county's Local Agency  Formation Commission voted against annexation of the planned Laguna Laurel  development by the city.  </P> <P> However, at its March 1 meeting, the commission will consider placing the  Irvine Co.-owned development within Laguna Beach's sphere of influence, which  could allow the Laguna Laurel area to be annexed in the future.  </P> <P> The city had requested that LAFCO approve annexation of about 2,500 acres of  land in Laguna Canyon, including the 1,600-acre Laguna Laurel project.  </P> <P> Although the commission decided on a 5-0 vote to exclude Laguna Laurel from  Laguna Beach's annexation proposal, it also unanimously decided that at its  March 1 meeting it will consider annexation of a 900-acre area east of Laguna  Canyon Road that is already in the city's sphere of influence.  </P> <P> "We feel a very special affinity for that canyon and would like to have a say  about what happens in that canyon," Laguna Beach Mayor Robert Gentry said after  the LAFCO meeting, which was attended by about 10 Laguna Beach city officials  and residents.  </P> <P> Gentry said annexation was sought because city officials believe that the  Irvine Co.'s plan for a multimillion-dollar housing and commercial project in a  part of Laguna Canyon does not coincide with the desires of many Laguna Beach  residents to preserve the wilderness area.  </P> <P> "It's not that we're out taking land," Gentry said of the city's effort. "It's  the geography of the canyon, it's the name of it and the history of it" that  belongs to Laguna Beach, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Discussion 'Premature'  </P> <P> In opposing Laguna Beach's annexation plan, Irvine Co. official Carol Hoffman  told the commissioners that "discussion of annexation at this time is  premature." Hoffman noted that the property is still undeveloped and requires  no municipal services.  </P> <P> Gentry told LAFCO that the city is the "logical" agency to provide services to  the area, which will also include a school within the Laguna Beach Unified  School District.  </P> <P> City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said the city's hopes of gaining any control of  the Laguna Laurel area are in vain without agreement by the Irvine Co.  </P> <P> But Hoffman said after the meeting that she could not say whether the company  would ever agree to annexation of the property by the city.  </P> <P> "It's hard to speculate at this point. The city has been unwilling to discuss  development for any of our properties," Hoffman said, adding that if the  company does not want the area to be annexed, the county would be able to  provide such municipal services as police and fire.  </P> <P> The County Board of Supervisors on April 27 approved a development agreement  for the Laguna Laurel project on a 3-2 vote, one of a series of such developer  agreements approved in advance of an unsuccessful slow-growth ballot measure  last June.  </P> <P> The Laguna Laurel project calls for 3,204 housing units, 475,000 square feet of  commercial space and two golf courses. The agreement requires the Irvine Co. to  help the county finance $14 million in road improvements and provide 17.4 acres  of open space. The firm must also conform to other county requirements and  provide another $36.7 million in road improvement financing and 1,340 acres of  open space.  </P> <P> The Laguna Laurel area previously was within Laguna Beach's sphere of  influence. But LAFCO removed it from the city's sphere in 1981 at the request  of the Irvine Co.  </P></p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Cadbury Schweppes A Mexican mineral water company might seem a risky investment for Cadbury Schweppes, but the Pounds 188m deal is logical enough. Mexico is one of the world's largest markets for soft drinks and consumption is growing by 9 per cent annually. Aguas Minerales is the market leader in bottled water. More important its bottling capacity should transform the distribution of Cadbury's Mexican brands and make the group into a much stronger competitor. The price implies a goodwill write-off of Pounds 100m and will also mean a small dilution of next year's earnings. But Cadbury must inevitably pay up for such fast-growing businesses and its highly-rated shares are a sensible currency. Investors are doubtless more concerned to know it has learnt from the experience of rivals like PepsiCo. In 1982, Pepsi took a large exceptional charge after admitting it had been defrauded by local Mexican management.</p>

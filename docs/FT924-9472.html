			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Failure to consult unions was 'within law' MR NEIL Clarke, the chairman of British Coal, yesterday insisted that he had acted within the law when he omitted to consult unions before announcing plans to close 31 pits with 30,000 redundancies. Under fierce questioning from Labour MPs, Mr Clarke told the Commons employment committee he believed that the 'unprecedented drop' in demand for coal was a 'special circumstance' and that the law allows that the normal pit closure procedure need not be followed under such circumstances. He said the market had dictated that coal production should fall by 30m tons between the this financial year and next. Mining unions are seeking judicial review of British Coal's failure to follow agreed consultation procedures. If the courts back the unions, the consultation procedures might last nine months. Mr Clarke said British Coal's preference would have been for a 'more gradual process of closure'. He hinted that the Department of Trade and Industry was to blame for the announcement last month that the 31 pits would be closed before the end of March. It had not been possible to begin the closure programme at British Coal's preferred time of June, with enhanced redundancy terms. Mr Clarke said that after the closure announcement, the Employment Department had contacted British Coal to express the view that the corporation had broken the law. Privatisation of the electricity industry had led to the drop in market demand for coal and it had not been possible to begin the closure programme in June. He said the coal industry had between 20 and 40 years left at current prices, but less at world prices. That was because British Coal did not have the Pounds 250m to develop environmentally friendly coal technology and would not have the funds to invest in deep mine shafts.</p>

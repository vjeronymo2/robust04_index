			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / International Company News: Write-downs may force Foster's to launch ADollars 1bn issue FOSTER'S, the Australian-based international brewing group, is today expected to reveal asset write-downs of between ADollars 600m and ADollars 1bn (Dollars 431.6m-Dollars 719.4m), forcing it to raise up to ADollars 1bn with a share issue. The group was due yesterday to report its results for the year to June. Postponement of the figures is believed to have been caused by last-minute delays in underwriting arrangements for the share issue. Meanwhile, Mr John Elliott, the former chairman and chief executive of Foster's, yesterday announced his resignation from the company's board. In an anti-climactic announcement - considering Mr Elliott's status as one of Australia's best-known businessmen - Mr Nobby Clark, Foster's current chairman, said Mr Elliott had made a 'significant contribution' to the company. The resignation has been seen as inevitable since early June, when Broken Hill Proprietary (BHP), the Australian resources group, appointed receivers to Mr Elliott's private company, International Brewing Investments (IBI), in which BHP has a significant stake. IBI, in turn, holds a near-controlling 38 per cent stake in Foster's. BHP is expected to support the share issue, but the attitude of Asahi, the Japanese brewer which holds 19.9 per cent of Foster's shares, is less certain. Since June, a banking syndicate has appointed its own receivers to IBI, and BHP has made a bid valued at ADollars 2.39 a share for IBI's stake in Foster's. These events have demonstrably removed Mr Elliott's influence over Foster's shares, and thus the rationale for him to sit on the board. Announcing Mr Elliott's resignation yesterday, the Foster's board also announced that Mr Ken Biggins, another IBI representative on the Foster's board, would retire, but no statement was made about the future of another of Mr Elliott's 'associates' at Foster's, Mr Geoffrey Lord. Mr Elliott has influenced the group that is now Foster's since the early 1970s, when he began the transformation of what was then a small Melbourne jam maker. Through a series of audacious takeovers, he fashioned the Elders group, then Australia's largest agribusiness company, and the Carlton &amp; United Brewing operation, into the conglomerate that is now the world's fourth largest brewer. But the seeds of yesterday's exit were sown in 1989 when Mr Elliott tried to take control of Foster's through a privately-owned vehicle. The debt required proved unserviceable and IBI's problems have kept Foster's in crisis ever since. Mr Elliott's power base at Foster's has been severely diminished since 1990 when, amid concern over the company's future, he stood aside as chairman and chief executive. Mr Elliott retains some rural interests, mainly in Victoria, and has a high-profile position as president of the Carlton Football Club, one of the most successful clubs in the Victoria-based Australian Football League. Foster's shares rose 11 cents from a near low point for the year to ADollars 1.59 on Australian stock exchanges yesterday following news of Mr Elliott's exit. News Corporation shares fell 78 cents to ADollars 22.54 on Australian stock exchanges following Friday night's announcement in New York of a USDollars 1.7bn combined international debt and equity issue.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Sergey Afonin] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 15 TASS -- "Russia and Vietnam step up  trade and economic cooperation, and we are sure that the visit  to Moscow by Vietnamese Premier Vo Van Kiet will promote the  further deepening of business ties between the two countries and  enhance their effectiveness," Lev Antoshchenkov, deputy chief of  the main agency for trade and economic cooperation with Asian  countries and the Asia-Pacific region at the Russian Ministry of  External Economic Relations, told ITAR-TASS.    The value of trade between Russia and Vietnam made up more  than 300 million dollars last year, Antoshchenkov said. Both  sides no longer establish rigid quotas on trade. Instead they  coordinate the lists of goods in which they are interested.  Russian consumers receive from Vietnam rice, meat, tea, coffee,  vegetables and friut, spices, rugs and carpets, footwear, sewn  articles, knitgoods and other goods. Incidentally, the  exhibition of goods that opened at the Vietnamese trade mission  in Moscow on June 14 shows Vietnam's export potentials. Vietnam  is interested in purchasing from Russia road-building equipment,  metals, fertiliser, timber and sawn timber.    Russia deliveries of sets of equipment for the construction  of various facilities are of much importance to Vietnam,  Antoshchenkov said. The construction of the Hoabinh hydropower  station will be completed this year. The biggest hydropower  station in South East Asia with a capacity of two million  kilowatts will go into operation in September. A hydropower  station will be build in Yali in the Danang District. This will  make it possible to supply enough electricity to central  Vietnam. The construction of the Laokai complex with an  enrichment factory to produce 1.5 million tonnes of apatite  concentrate a year will be completed this year.    Both sides expressed satisfaction with a successful  functioning of the joint venture Vietsovpetro which extracted  over 20 million tonnes of crude oil from the shelf of Vietnam in  the period of the venture's existence. The volume of extraction  will surpass six million tonnes this year.    Vietnam will continue goods deliveries towards repaying its  debt to Russia, Antoshchenkov said.    During the visit of the Vietnamese Premier accompanied by a  large group of officials from various ministries and agencies,  representatives of the Vietnamese business circles will hold  substantive talks for the speeding up of the implementation of  the earlier achieved arrangements and will discuss projects for  cooperation. A number of documents, including agreements on  cooperation in the area of agro-industrial complexes and  fisheries will be signed.</p>

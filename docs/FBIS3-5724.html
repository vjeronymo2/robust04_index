			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] An informed source in the Export Promotion  Department told PRACHACHAT THURAKIT that the Thai commercial  center in Los Angeles recently sent the department its report on  Thai-U.S. trade issues involving intellectual property and  worker rights. The report states that Thai efforts to protect  U.S. intellectual property have gained a positive support from  Richard Gephardt, Democratic congressman from Missouri, who is  considered highly influential with the Clinton administration.    The report from Los Angeles also gave furthur details on the  situation following an accusation from the U.S. private sector  on Thai violation of U.S. intellectual property rights applying  to video and musical recordings, which caused about $120 million  in damages for the U.S. entertainment industry, and on the Thai  Government prohibiting state enterprise organizations to set up  their labor unions. The Thai practices prompted the United  States to announce that it will review all GSP privileges it had  previously granted to the country.    In this regard, Thailand has tried continually to solve the  problems concerning the protection of intellectual property.  These include issuing various rules and regulations, suppressing  producers of illegal tapes and videos, and implementing  international guidelines for the protection of intellectual  property.    Apart from these efforts, the Thai Government has also  proposed a draft law on the establishment an intellectual  property and international trade court to show its improvement  in intellectual property protection. This court will handle  both civil and criminal cases with judicial procedures to be  carried out within six months. "These practices have prompted  the United States to respond positively to the outcome of the  Thai actions. An indication is that even Richard Gephardt, a  leading figure in the majority party of the U.S. House of  Representatives, has highly praised the Thai actions following  his meeting with Prime Minister Chuan Likphai in January.  However, the United States will continue to watch the actions  of the Thai side closely because there still are several points  that the Thai Government will have to correct," concluded the  informed source.</p>

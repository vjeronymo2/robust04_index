			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Over 30,000 trade unionists from Solidarity have  demonstrated in Warsaw against this year's draft budget, the  decrease in incomes, and the increase in the numbers of  unemployed. Solidarity Chairman Marian Kraklewski said that the  demonstration today is solely a component in the struggle for  welfare rights. However, he added that if the government does  not fulfill the trade union postulates, Solidarity will organize  successive demonstrations, this time directed against the  government.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] In the view  of  the organizers, at least 40,000 trade unionists came to Warsaw.  The police spoke of 30,000, but everyone was in accord in  stating that the demonstration was an enormous one. The  demonstrators demanded the cessation of increased energy and gas  prices, an increase in expenditures on social welfare benefits,  an active struggle against unemployment, the adoption by 15  March of laws relating to the pact on the state enterprise, and  a 2-percent increase in remuneration within the productive  sphere. Solidarity Chairman Kraklewski warned that if the  government does not take into account these postulates, then the  next demonstrations will have a political character.    [Krzaklewski] [video shows Krzaklewski marching in  demonstration, talking to correspondent] If the government does  not fulfill the social welfare and economic tasks in accordance  with economic tendencies, and with the expectations of society,  then the next stage is a demonstration against the authorities  which are incapable of implementing something such as this.  This is natural. Such is the course of affairs in democratic  states. However, today's demonstration is not against the  government but against the decisions and plans of this  government. It is (?grinding us down). The next might be  political.    [Correspondent] What do you think about the postulates  contained in the Solidarity petition?    [Labor Minister Leszek Miller] It is difficult for me to  agree with many of them. For instance, the shock increase in  prices. The union is here doubtless thinking of the increase in  the price of energy. Well, precisely. Instead of two large  increases there will be three smaller ones. The rate in the  increased prices of energy carriers is less this year than it  was last year. Or else there is the accusation that the  government is not implementing the earlier Solidarity  postulates, normally when it is the pact on the state enterprise  that is being spoken about. The laws comprising the pact have  been sent to the Sejm. Two of them have already been adopted.  The rest are at the disposal of the Sejm Extraordinary  Commission. I think that they will shortly be adopted. To sum  up, many of these postulates are quite simply being implemented.    [Correspondent] The demonstrators walked down the Royal Way,  from Pilsudski Square to the office of the Council of Ministers  [URM]. However, not all the trade unionists got there; when the  head of the march was holding a rally before the URM, the end  had not yet left Pilsudski Square, a few kilometers away.  [passage omitted] The demonstrators also chanted before the  seat of the government, Left leg there, fear God there, and Red  rascals. After a few minutes, a trade union delegation entered  the URM and presented URM Head Michal Strak with the Solidarity  postulates.    [Strak] I accept this stance. I will pass it on to Prime  Minister Pawlak. I wish to say that this government knows why  and by whose votes it found itself here, where it finds itself.    [Correspondent] After the talks, Minister Strak tried to go  out and meet the demonstrators. [passage omitted] The  demonstration ran its course calmly. Nonetheless, its size meant  that traffic in the center of Warsaw was paralyzed for several  hours. [end recording]    [Announcer Malgorzata Szelewicka] Are you pleased with the  course of the demonstration?    [Krzaklewski] I am pleased. I am edified by this enormous  turnout and the determination shown today by union members. I  do not agree of course with the figures that were given.  [passage omitted]    [Szelewicka] Two days ago Premier Pawlak said on the  Wiadomosci program that the government ought to break with the  liberal policy of the previous governments. What is the union  demonstrating against?    [Kraklewski] Well, we have demonstrated against obvious  facts. Against the draft budget law, that in effect, according  to our experts' stance too, will bring about a successive year  of impoverishment for workers and their families. In addition,  other families, those of pensioners and others. We cannot agree  that in the third year of economic growth, the incomes of Polish  families again decline. Such a rule, to the effect that with  economic growth there is an increase in the incomes of employees  and the incomes of families, is a certain fundamental rule of  market systems, economic and social. It cannot be other than  thus, for in that case when are the incomes of the populace to  increase, if not with such a large economic growth as has been  signalled in 1993, as is being signalled in 1994?    [Szelewicka] You said that the time might still come when  there will be a struggle for power. When?    [Kraklewski] The time will come, above all, for the  presentation of a stance toward the government, a political  stance. At the moment, the government does not reflect upon this  demonstration. I listened to the statement by Mr. Miller. It  frightened me, especially after such a demonstration. I saw  this enormous charge of tension, charge of hurt. After all,  these people came in such numbers.    [Szelewicka] Why did that statement frighten you?    [Kraklewski] It frightened me because of its inaccurate  reflection, on the evaluation of the mood that has accumulated  in relation to this government policy.    [Szelewicka] The mood?    [Kraklewski] The mood is very radical. People came in such  numbers because they really do feel bad. After all, they would  not come because someone ordered them to. They feel very bad.  They clearly feel this burden on their own backs. And we had  to apply much of our authority and many measures putting things  in order so as to control this enormous feeling. We controlled  it thanks to the fact that these were trade union structures.  If this had been a political demonstration, by everyone against  the government, then I don't know what it would have looked like.    [Szelewicka] Many politicians of the right took part in the  demonstration. Is this a foretaste of cooperation?    [Krzaklewski] I don't know if there were many. In relation  to the number of demonstrators this is a very small percentage.  We did not forbid anyone attending.    [Szelewicka] [Words indistinct] a significant number?    [Kraklewski] Yes, but in relation to almost 100,000  demonstrators, according my calculations, a dozen or so or a few  dozen politicians? These are, above all, politicians who  supported this demonstration as a demonstration not only in  favor of social welfare solutions, but as a demonstration for  another economic program, one that the government ought to  present.    [Szelewicka] Thank you very much.    [Kraklewski] Thank you very much.</p>

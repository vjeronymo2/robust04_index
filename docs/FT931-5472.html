			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Bull to cut jobs after further deficit GROUPE BULL, the French state-controlled computer company, plans to cut about 3,000 jobs, almost 8 per cent of its workforce, this year after falling further into the red with a net loss of FFr4.72bn (Dollars 863m) in 1992 against a deficit of FFr3.3bn in 1991. Mr Bernard Pache, who in July took over as Bull's chairman from Mr Francois Lorentz, said the group suffered from the combination of recession, adverse currency movements and the turmoil in the personal computer market, now destabilised by an aggressive price war. This year's job losses follow two years of stringent cost cutting at the French group in which two other computer companies, IBM of the US and Japan's NEC, both have minority stakes. Bull's workforce has been reduced by 11,450 people since 1990 to 35,130 today. A third of the next round of 3,000 job losses will be in France, where it employs about 13,000 people. Bull hopes most of the cutbacks will be voluntary, although Mr Pache stressed that the rationalisation plan had yet to be finalised. The group made provisions of FFr2.4bn in its 1992 accounts, FFr1.4bn of which will be used to pay for this year's cuts. The remainder has been held in reserve. These provisions aggravated Bull's financial difficulties last year. The group saw sales fall by 9.8 per cent to FFr30.19bn in 1992 with a third of the fall attributed to currency fluctuations. However, it managed to reduce its operating losses by 44 per cent to FFr642m. Bull made progress in its debt reduction programme cutting its net debt to FFr9.4bn in the year to end-December 1992 from FFr10.9bn in 1991. The group last month received a capital injection of FFr2.5bn from the French government and France Telecom, another of its minority shareholders. This cash advance will be translated into equity.</p>

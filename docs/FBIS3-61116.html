			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Stanislav Babkin: "Economics: Either the Finance </F> Minister Cooks the Figures, Or the Budget Is Very Flighty"]    [Text] The official figures of the Ministry of  Finance claim that after 10 months of this year the revenue  portion of the consolidated budget (in constant prices) rose by  321 percent while expenditures rose by 317 percent. The  consolidated budget deficit equalled K2 trillion, or 11 percent  of revenues.    Similar reports used to be prepared before party congresses,  to account before the people. The Ukraine budget already  resembles a whore supported by officials of the Ministry of  Finance and the National Bank, who share her among themselves as  entities invested with government status. But facts are stubborn  things: it is well-known that the budget deficit no longer  includes the shortfalls of the local budgets which hide a system  of direct subsidies, of many trillions in loans to loss-making  industries which are provided without any guarantees of being  repaid during the given time period and of refinanced credits  from the National Bank which are not counted as government debt.  This alone allows them to manipulate the figures as they wish.  For example, here are the results for the unconsolidated  (government) budget for the first 10 months: revenues rose by  303 percent, while expenditures by 352 percent. The budget  deficit of K5.713 trillion was covered by National Bank credits  amounting to K8.465 trillion. The result: revenues surpassed  expenditures by K2.752 billion.    In the West, similar falsifications of facts would have  served as the basis of a new Watergate, but in Ukraine budget  deficits are written off year after year, while trust for the  minister of finance has not diminished.    Today, the Ministry of Finance is the second, after the  National Bank, inflationary center. The latter, however, does  not react in any way, since it still gets the seigneurage  revenues which accrue to it from printing money. (This year, it  is 240 percent.) Thus, by distorting the free-market principles  of monetary policy, these two naturally antagonistic entities,  with the help of the budget, are playing their game. By the way,  the attack by the people's deputies on managers of commercial  banks, who supposedly receive tens of millions of karbovanets in  salaries, would fully apply to the management of the National  Bank, who get just as much. But to count other people's money is  an ungrateful task. The Ministry of Finance proved this, having  declared at the start of December that the consolidated deficit  is headed for K20 trillion. For this reason, it was decided to  bolster the budget by raising prices by 70 percent in a month,  banning banking entities from providing credits, etc. But will  it be enough? Independent economists calculate that this year  inflation will reach 6,400 percent. It seems that the National  Bank will keep printing money for a long time to come. By the  way, this is how the current budget started.</p>

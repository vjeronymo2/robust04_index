			<p>BFN     [Text] In Sierra Leone, 16 ministers and eight top ranking  civil servants who served under former President Joseph Momoh  were arrested over the weekend for failing to reimburse money  they had acquired illegally during their service. This matter  involves several hundreds of thousands of dollars. The current  justice minister had given the former ministers a three-week  deadline to refund the money, but they failed to meet it.    In other news, the Revolutionary United Front launched an  attack on government positions yesterday. According to local  journalists, the attack backfired, as the rebels reportedly lost  15 of their men.</p>

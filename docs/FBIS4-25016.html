			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, 1 Jun (XINHUA) -- U.S. President  Clinton has said: "We must regard our relations with China  within the broader context of our interests in the Asia-Pacific  region, of which America is an integral part."    Clinton made the statement in an article published in the  LOS  ANGELES TIMES on 31 May. Commenting on the reasons for  extending the most-favored-nation [MFN] trade status to China,  Clinton said: "After many years' arguments and repetitive  vetoes, we no longer implement two sets of policies toward China  -- one set from the Congress and another from the President.  Instead, we will implement a single American policy toward  China." He added: "Linking human rights to the MFN has brought  us to a dead end."    Clinton continued: "We will have more contacts, more trade,  more international cooperation, and more extensive and regular  dialogues on human rights issues with China."    Clinton believes that a 21st-century economy is taking shape  in China. In 1993, China was the world's fastest growing  economy. China is not only an enormous market for  American-produced commodities, but has also provided  opportunities for more jobs in America. China has a veto power  in the United Nations Security Council and it is an important  factor for Asian, and even global security. Clinton indicated:  The United States and China share major interests in some  fields.    He said in conclusion: "The actions I have taken on China  suit the long-term interests of both the United States and  China."</p>

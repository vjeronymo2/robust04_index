According to the PDS there is a solution to Italy's data  processing problems: it is through the creation of a  megastructure formed by none other than STET [Turin Telephone  Finance Company] and Olivetti. An indissoluble union of public  and private.    The PDS plan is contained in a document that is still "top  secret," to which the party's industrial experts are still  adding the finishing touches. In the meantime, IRI's [Institute  for Industrial Reconstruction] financial institution has  announced respectable results for 1993: net profits were over  1.4 trillion lire, with almost 30 trillion lire in combined  revenues. All the while Finsiel, STET's leading company, is  reorganizing: from now on it will consist of a department for  directing operations and five "business units."    "Innovation no longer exists in Italian data processing,  where the time for young entrepreneurs, capable of launching  daring challenges to pre-existing operators, has passed," the  PDS document says. The document is a total of 24 pages plus 11  pages of tables. This is why it is necessary to create a  conglomerate that will directly involve Tecnitel's STET,  Finsiel, and Olivetti. It is in fact impossible to overcome  the crisis "without the direct involvement of STET, with its  manufacturing department of telecommunications equipment and  network services, and with its data processing services  department (Finsiel), and Olivetti and its manufacturing and  services department."    According to [Achille] Occhetto's [PDS secrtary] party, this  conglomerate will be in a position to gather together all the  small and medium-sized enterprises of the sector, and thanks to  oportune alliances with European partners, will be able to face  the big competitors.    The PDS's plan is a radical one, behind which lies an  unclear  diagnosis of the Italian and international data processing  sectors. The Italian data processing sector is made up of  companies with a "scarce capacity to understand the situation,"  says the PDS, and where a "strong trend towards daily  production, without long-term goals, exists." They are  companies that "did not know how to take advantage of  opportunities presented by financed research projects." In the  research field, the efforts of Italian companies "are not only  less than those of companies in other countries, but above all,  they are not focused on national advantages and involve research  of little use and scarce productivity." What's more,  "investments abroad tend to be ignored."    But the document does not limit itself to drawing a global  picture of the sector, it closely examines the situation of  individual companies, all of which are not very comforting.  Olivetti? "It cannot make it alone." IBM? "It's beginning to  gasp." As for Bull, "it is too dependent on the lobby system  and public administration." According to the PDS, if Olivetti  is incapable of overcoming the present "difficult phase," a  problem will be created not just for the Ivrea conglomerate,  "but the entire Italian data processing field will ready to  collapse." The Finsiel group position appears to be better off.  "It is moving in an opposite direction from the rest of the  sector which is encountering great difficulty in even  maintaining its position."    Nevertheless, the "progressive" experts do not hide the  difficulties inherent in the project. The document states that  this conglomerate "is not easy to manage." That is why its  strategic management "must be given to a group of managers that  have not been compromised by the errors of the industrial and  old power systems." It requires a management with strong  technical expertise, capable of exercising a cultural leadership  with high professional integrity.    Is the PDS "planning" the future of Italian data processing?  In the meantime, STET is grinding out profits. Yesterday in  Athens, where he was present at the inauguration of the  Athens-Salonica highway mobile radio network, Michele Tedeschi,  the number-two man at STET, reported its net profits for 1993  were over 1.4 trillion lire, more or less in line with those of  1992. Consolidated revenues were almost 3O trillion lire; an  increase of more than 1O percent.</p>

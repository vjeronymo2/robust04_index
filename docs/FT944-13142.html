			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Net income climbs 25% to Dollars 185mat Xerox Net income at Xerox, the US document processing company, climbed 25 per cent in the third quarter to Dollars 185m, or Dollars 1.60 a share. If a one-off tax benefit in the same period last year of Dollars 23m is excluded, earnings from the company's core document processing business jumped 48 per cent. With revenues in the latest quarter improving only slightly to Dollars 3.6bn, Xerox said that the strong income growth was driven primarily by productivity improvements. During the quarter the company's workforce was reduced by 1,100 as Xerox continued with its worldwide re-structuring and productivity programme, which is aimed at reducing payrolls by more than 10,000 by early 1996. Since the start of the year, 7,700 jobs have been eliminated at Xerox to take the size of the workforce worldwide to less than 90,000. The advances in productivity and tight controls on costs boosted the ratio of selling, administrative and general expenses to revenues by 2.3 percentage points to 29.3 per cent during the quarter. On the sales front, revenues from the sale of digital products jumped 17 per cent, while revenues from black and white copiers, which represent almost two-thirds of total revenues, were flat during the quarter. Xerox was aided by an improved performance from its Brazilian operation, where demand for the company's products rose and foreign currency losses from balance sheet translation fell.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Norway (12): State giant is obliged to explore overseas - Profile / Statoil, whose future has been assessed by a leading investment bank Last month, two independent government-commissioned valuations assessed the value of Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, at between NKr72bn and NKr80bn. The purpose of the appraisal - the first ever, but now planned to be undertaken on an annual basis - was to help the government in its assessment of the value and relative performance of Statoil within its industry; but it also makes a good reference tool for eventual privatisation of the group. The highly sensitive issue of privatisation is not currently on the government's political agenda, and is not likely to emerge until Norway can no longer provide sufficient petroleum reserves to underpin Statoil's production or continue to supplement the group's reserves' base. Goldman Sachs International (GSI), the US investment bank, assessed Statoil's worth at between NKr72bn and NKr78bn; while Fiba Nordic Securities, a domestic firm, valued the group at NKr80bn, or 17 times expected 1995 earnings of NKr17.6bn and three times book value. Statoil was established in 1972 as a vehicle to participate in exploration and development on the Norwegian continental shelf, and began basically as a two-man show and a telephone, managed by Mr Arve Johnsen until 1988. It expanded rapidly into downstream operations with Mr Johnsen at the helm, and by 1984 began managing the state's direct financial investment in petroleum operations. Mr Harald Norvik succeeded Mr Johnsen in 1988, and currently oversees 12,000 employees within and outside Norway. He is faced with the daunting task of finding more oil elsewhere in the world to maintain the group's output and reserves; and, to this end, he established an alliance partnership with British Petroleum nearly five years ago, to help shoulder the burden of expense related to foreign operations. Statoil currently consists of four principal operating units: exploration and production, natural gas, refining and marketing, and petrochemicals. GSI ranks Statoil as the seventh largest independent oil company in the world. Last year, its total production reached 204m barrels of oil equivalent, or 560,000 boe per day. By the end of 1993 reserves stood at 3.87bn boe, giving a reserve life of 19 years. In order to improve its declining oil production profile, Statoil has embarked on an ambitious international exploration search. 'Recent successes in the Far East, combined with the enormous growth potential of the former Soviet Union, make this new business development a potentially high-growth, though high-risk, area,' GSI said. Since 1991, Statoil has revised its proved reserves upwards by about 191m boe, or 33 per cent of total production, but GSI believes there is significant upside potential for the estimate. The US bank forecast that Statoil's total production would fall from 221m boe this year to 178m, or by some 20 per cent, by the year 2000, with the outlook for oil even more dramatic, in line with the general prognosis for Norway's production. With the important fields of Statfjord, Gullfaks and Oseberg in decline, Statoil's oil production is expected to fall by 35 per cent to 124m barrels by the year 2000. 'With no immediate prospect of significant discoveries on the Norwegian continental shelf, and the relatively immature and uncertain nature of Statoil's international exploration potential, it is unlikely that Statoil will be able to change the trend in oil production in the near term,' GSI said. The US bank points out that the most significant discovery on the NCS since 1986 has been the Norne field, operated by Statoil, with peak production from this field expected to be around 14.6m barrels a year - or 12 per cent of the peak production from the giant Statfjord field. 'On the international side, only the Azeri and Chirag fields in Azerbaijan offer the potential for significantly boosting Statoil's oil profile,' GSI said, but warned that, given the unstable political environment in the region, Azerbaijan should not be relied on to fill the gap. At the same time, Statoil faces rising production costs, lower revenue generated by pipeline tariffs and uncertainty over future gas contracts, according to GSI. Concern is expressed over Statoil's ability to formalise new gas sales contracts, which currently amount to 3.0bn cubic metres annually and are expected to more than triple by 2002. However, the bank believes that by then Statoil may be competing with cheaper supplies from other domestic producers or a more politically stable Middle East. 'Should Statoil not be able to tie in sufficient supply contracts for its gas, then some developments may well be delayed, which would further negatively impact the company's overall declining production profile,' GSI warned. Nevertheless, Statoil benefits from a well-protected Scandinavian retail market, in which it has captured a 25 per cent share, owns two modern complex refineries and, by 1995, will be well-placed to reap rewards from a forecast upswing in the European petrochemicals industry.</p>

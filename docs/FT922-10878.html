			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Letter: Engineering - when status is irrelevant Sir, Ron Kirby (Letters, April 24) rightly states that more young people are going into engineering via higher education and that salaries are better. But before we get carried away into this brave new world, my daughter's experience is salutary. She expects to graduate this summer. She has spent the last 16 years being educated. Getting 10 O-levels, three A-levels, all at good grades, winning a scholarship and going to university. She has been influenced by me and the WISE campaign (Women in Science and Engineering) to become a civil engineer. She hopes to become chartered and has a real interest in transportation. She has experience in civil engineering through vacation jobs with county councils, carrying out responsible projects such as road realignments. Since the beginning of the year she has written more than 50 letters to employers of civil engineers. Most say they are not recruiting graduates this year because of the recession. When she has gone for interview (on four occasions) she is competing with sometimes more than 400 other applicants. In short, the recession is dreadful and is uniquely cruel to 1992 graduates. This current situation surely makes this present correspondence concerning status and salary of engineers irrelevant if you don't even have a job.

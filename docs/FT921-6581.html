			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Developing cars across borders ACROSS the industrialised world, multinationals are dispersing their research, design, development and engineering activities from single or dual locations to multiple ones. Nissan has added development centres in the US and now Europe to its base in Japan. Hewlett Packard now develops personal computers in France as well as California. Glaxo does drugs research in six countries as well as Britain. This trend is part of a wider organisational pattern in which formerly centralised activities are starting to be pushed out to multiple centres around the globe, in as balanced a fashion as possible. So at first sight Ford of Europe seems to be turning back the clock by considering a reallocation of tasks between its British and German development facilities which could relegate the UK side to junior status. The exact nature of the company's plans are unclear. But any shift in the power balance towards Germany would be a backward step from a narrow UK point of view. Though far fewer jobs are likely to be transferred in the short term than the 1,200 mooted in an internal discussion document, the issue is of equal national economic significance to the threatened closure at some stage of one of Ford's UK assembly plants. A shift in Ford's development balance towards Germany would be much more controversial than General Motors' 1970s transfer of its Vauxhall's development responsibilities activities to its Opel offshoot in Germany. It would be a signal to other multinationals, existing and emergent, to consider doing likewise - to the considerable detriment of employment prospects for British graduate engineers, and of the UK economy. Natural advantage Germany already has a natural advantage in its reputation for the supply and quality of development engineers, despite their higher salary levels and social costs. Considerable infighting was needed within Sony last year for its UK subsidiary to persuade Tokyo to locate a new European television development centre in Wales instead of Germany. Yet, from a corporate point of view, Ford's deliberations are not only understandable, but arguably overdue. The point overtly at issue is 'co-location': the need to locate more of its different functional specialists on particular projects together, in either Germany or Britain , so that they can work more effectively in multi-disciplinary teams in order to slash Ford's product development times and costs to Japanese levels. Too complex Some worldwide development networks work well, but Ford's is arguably too complex for an industry where projects are so large. With Britain and Germany, plus Detroit and its Mazda affiliate in Japan, it now has four centres to co-ordinate where ideally only three would do. Within Europe, Ford's extra complexity is said to incur a 10 per cent cost penalty and requires over 250 people more than the company would otherwise need. Deeper motives may also be contributing to the product development debate. Put starkly, Ford's management seems increasingly fed up with its problems in Britain. Ford's UK factory productivity has been improved after years of painful effort, but despite similar levels of capital intensity, it is still lower than at the company's continental European plants. The significance of such productivity gaps was underlined yesterday by a comparative Anglo-German study from Britain's National Institute of Economic and Social Research. In addition, Ford is now making heavy losses in the UK, in contrast with its performance in Germany and elsewhere on the continent. With eastern Europe also beckoning, a shift of some of the company's UK development activities to Germany seems not only natural, but overdue. Ford of Europe may have taken far too long to get to grips with many of its problems, but at least it is moving on this one. An uncomfortable conclusion for Britain, perhaps. But, to misquote the famous saying about General Motors, what's good for Ford is not necessarily good for Britain.</p>

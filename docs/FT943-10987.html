			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Observer: Back to basics When it comes to personal pensions there can never be too many consumer guides through the minefield. Legal &amp; General is the latest to have a try with The Transfer Maze, which it has published to co-incide with its return to selling personal pensions for those transferring out of schemes run by their past employer. But it is not just the consumers who need help through the labyrinth. Life insurers and their regulators have been too dilatory in agreeing compensation arrangements for people whose pension transfer has gone awry after bad advice. They obviously need a guide book of their own. For example, should insurers who sell pensions through independent financial advisers support those IFAs when the latter are unable to cough up compensation on their own? Even more tricky, how do you get life companies who do not write pensions business but who are reliant on a strong IFA sector for their own survival to contribute. Anyone who could produce such a guide would have really earned a reputation as an industry trend setter.</p>

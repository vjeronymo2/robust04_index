			<p>BFN     [Text] On the basis of a circular issued by President 'Ali  Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, anyone trying to smuggle foreign  currency out of the country will be identified and handed over  to the judicial authorities for punishment.    During a news conference today, Intelligence Minister 'Ali  Akbar Fallahian said: Since implementation of the new policy on  foreign currency, eight gangs involved in the illegal purchase,  accumulation, and smuggling of hard currency abroad have been  arrested and handed over to the judicial officials.    Referring to Iraqi provocations to create terror inside  Iran,  he said: During the past four months, the Iraqi Ba'thist  regime, in pursuit of its particular objectives, has exported  some sabotage gangs and has resorted to planting bombs in Iran,  in particular. However, thanks to efforts of the intelligence  forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran, two high-ranking Iraqi  intelligence officers have been arrested inside our country. He  added: These two intelligence officers, named Ra'd Mustafa  Fattah and Arkan 'Abd al-Amir 'Ali, have confessed to their  mission, including the import of explosives to Iran.    The intelligence minister pointed out: Four Iranians who  have been cooperating with the Iraqi intelligence officers have  been arrested and have confessed that they were involved in  intelligence work.    Stressing that the Iraqi regime intends to depict our  country  as insecure by detonating bombs in Iran, Mr. Fallahian went on:  During the past four months, 22 bombs have been imported into  the country by Iraqi elements. In addition to the arrest of the  above people, 14 bombs have been discovered.    About the latest investigations on the discovery of a  microphone in our country's London Embassy, the intelligence  minister said: The dimensions of this espionage affair are not  limited to the discovery of a microphone alone, and we have not  divulged all of the issues yet. A country's embassy is regarded  as its territory in accordance with international regulations,  and they have violated our sovereignty while the British press  unanimously presents the issue as a normal occurrence.    Another issue mentioned by the intelligence minister was the  return of the Iranians living abroad. He said: Iranians living  abroad can take advantage of the facilities we have provided for  them.    About the plot to assassinate the President on 1 February  1994, marking the anniversary of Khomeyni's return to Iran,  Intelligence Minister Fallahian said: Investigations on this  matter are still continuing.</p>

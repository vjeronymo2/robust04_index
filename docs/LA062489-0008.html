			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ZSA ZSA'S ENCOUNTER WITH POLICE  </P> <P> In defense of our very fine police department I must tell you that the officer  did not (as Gabor said) "make her sit in the middle of the street."  </P> <P> He did what any good officer would do after being hit by a citizen: He  handcuffed her wrists behind her back and sat her down on the curb while he  conducted his investigation. I saw this with my own eyes.  </P> <P> SHELLY KORNHANDLER  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

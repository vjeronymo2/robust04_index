			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President F.W. de Klerk by announcer Lester </F> Venter in Cape Town on the "Agenda" program -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Venter] Mr. President, I think the first thing that  everyone wants to know is what impact will your holding of an  election in Natal with the declaration of the state of emergency  in that area have?    [De Klerk] It should definitely increase the chances of  having a free and fair election. Maybe that is putting it too  negatively. It will ensure that a free and fair election can be  held because there will be a high level of manpower in the  security forces. It will, with the additional powers that they  have, make it easier for them to maintain law and order and to  safeguard the interest also of the voters.    The regulations have been drawn, specifically so as to  ensure  that this state of emergency will be compatible with an  election, and therefore the right of parties to hold meetings is  an inherent right. They will be asked, however, to give notice  so that proper protection can be arranged. Marches will still  be allowed, although permission will have to be obtained. But  free political activity has been written into the regulations  (?just) subject to reasonable procedures. Those regulations  have also been cleared with the TEC [Transitional Executive  Council] so that the parties participating are basically happy  with the arrangements made to ensure free political activity.    On election day itself, it should definitely be to the  advantage of an incident-free, or as incident free as possible.    [Venter] What that means, Mr. President, is that you  envisaged the state of emergency lasting up until and including  the days of the elections.?    [De Klerk] I really do -- if a wonder happens and everything  calms down to such an extent that we can lift it sooner, we will  look at that. In terms of the law, a state of emergency is  imposed automatically for a year, but there is authority to lift  it sooner. We would want to lift it as soon as circumstances  permit.    [Venter] Well, then many people say that an election under  state of emergency are mutually exclusive, that you can't really  have a free and fair election under a state of emergency?    [De Klerk] Well, we've had quite a few in the past in South  Africa. Although circumstances are now different...    [Venter, interrupting] ... people the negative impression in  fact?    [De Klerk] Yes, but as I say, to the satisfaction also of  the  parties represented in the subcouncil, and of the  representatives of the management committee of the TEC, special  provision has been made to ensure compatibility between a free  and fair election with free political activity on the one hand,  and on the other hand simultaneously, the additional powers to  the security forces to ensure that the public order is properly  maintained, and that the public is effectively protected,  because those are the main grounds for the decision.    [Venter] Have you acquired to your satisfaction the  agreement, if not in fact the full agreement, of all the parties  in the TEC to the implementation of the state of emergency?    [De Klerk] I don't think that all the parties will agree,  but  sufficient agreement in terms of the rules and procedures of the  TEC has been obtained. They have said yes to the regulations.  I didn't need their approval for the declaration. That was my  decision, and my decision alone.    And I would like to emphasize because I see some people are  making political propaganda and say that we have declared this  because of collusion between the government and the ANC, because  the ANC actually wanted it, it is simply not true. I started  mentioning the fact that we will, as a government, look into  this option more than a week ago during a visit to Natal. In  reply to your question, we've constantly monitored the  situation. I've been briefed yesterday by our intelligence and  security forces. I've been briefed this morning, and the  decision to do so was taken at 09:30 by me. And I thereafter  phoned Mr. Mandela, and thereafter phoned Chief Minister  Buthelezi because I wanted them to be fully advised.    [Venter] Now, mentioning Chief Minister Buthelezi, of course  you have substantive agreement, (?which) is sufficient to allow  you to carry on with the state of emergency and its  implementation from within the TEC. But now, of course, Mr.  Buthelezi and his Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] are not part of  the TEC. Now can you tell us something about his reaction when  you told him about it, and what do you expect?    [De Klerk] I don't want to say what he said to me. He has  made a statement since then, and from that also it is clear that  he is critical of the decision, that he feels that his people on  the ground will react negatively toward it. I hope that he will  give a positive lead because this is not directed at the kwaZulu  government. It is not directed at the IFP [Inkatha Freedom  Party]. This decision does not have a political motive. This  decision is based on the necessity to stabilize kwaZulu-Natal,  to bring the deaths to an end, to ensure that the climate is  created where free and fair elections can take place, and to  prevent further deaths and to protect people and their property.    [Venter] Of the troops that will be deployed, are you  intending that troops of the National Peace-Keeping Force should  be deployed?    [De Klerk] That is not being considered at the moment. All  the planning is that it will be SADF [South African Defense  Force] troops, and the deployment will take place in an  incremental basis during the next week. It is also as a result  of a general call-up which was made some time ago with the view  to have a sufficiently high level of manpower for the whole of  South Africa in the weeks running up to the elections, the  election days itself, and the few days after the election. So  it will be SADF.    [Venter] So if you deploy troops, Mr. President, are you  prepared to see them used in order to reach the objective that's  set, mainly the holding of a free election?    [De Klerk] Yes, obviously. That is not the main objective.  It will flow from that. The main objective is to ensure that  there will be public order, and to protect the public. But yes,  it will flow from that, and yes we will use them, but they will  act within the law and subject to the regulations. A state of  emergency means that you give some additional powers that are  not ordinarily available in terms of the ordinary laws of the  day with regard to detention, with regards to the control of  movement of people, with regard to searching, etc., etc. That  will be clear from the regulations when they are shortly  published.    [Venter] But now talking about the ordinary law, the  ordinary  law for example contains provisions against the carrying of  dangerous weapons in public, and many people will say that you  have not adequately seen to the implementation of those laws up  until now.    [De Klerk] The regulations once again will contain  provisions  with regard to the public display of all dangerous weapons. It  will also be sensitive inasmuch as one can under these  circumstances toward recognizing traditions and cultures. What  has been seen in the past in that regard is often a situation  with too little policemen or security force people available,  and with a large crowd of 10 or 20 thousand people, it is simply  impossible to implement the law under such circumstances. I  have seen public rallies, even also of the ANC, with traditional  weapons visible, but mostly one saw that at IFP gatherings. And  there were circumstances where it was actually practically  impossible to implement the law because of too low a number of  security force people. Once again implementation will become  easier with a higher level of manpower.    [Venter] Is that in fact the intention to implement the  prohibition of the carrying of dangerous weapons?    [De Klerk] It will be part of the regulation subject to  certain exceptions.    [Venter] Let's talk a little more about the reaction by Mr.  Buthelezi. Now, it has been said that in the implementation of  the state of emergency, the troops and the added security forces  that will be sent in will work in conjunction with the kwaZulu  Police. Now Mr. Buthelezi is the minister of police in kwaZulu,  and he has spoken against the implementation. Doesn't that  immediately create a difficulty in having two security forces?    [De Klerk] Hopefully not. I don't regard that as a political  issue. The security forces, the commanders on the ground will  interact with the kwaZulu Police in kwaZulu Police areas. Chief  Minister Buthelezi is also basically against the election. But  as head of government, he committed himself to full cooperation,  to ensure -- and also making available facilities and everything  -- to ensure that an election can take place, and to ensure that  those who want to vote will be able to vote. I therefore don't  think that it is necessarily a problem. If, of course, there is  a lack of cooperation, then that will create a situation which  will have to be managed, and you can be assured it will then be  managed.    [Venter] Could you give us some idea of what could be  involved if that cooperation isn't forthcoming, and I ask that  question because it is a distinct likelihood at this stage,  given what Mr. Buthelezi...    [De Klerk, interrupting] I think it is speculative. He did  not say that we would not have the cooperation of the kwaZulu.  I think it is speculative at this stage. The legal position of  the armed forces operating under the state of emergency is that  they will have the powers that they have throughout  kwaZulu-Natal, and that is their task. They will use those  powers with discretion to ensure that the goals of the  declaration -- namely, to maintain public order and to ensure  the safety of the public -- will be served.    [Venter] Do you expect, when you have your meeting next week  with Mr. Buthelezi, King Goodwill Zwelithini, Mr. Mandela and  yourself -- when you walk into that meeting, it's going to be a  very much tenser and more difficult meeting than it would  otherwise have been without the state of emergency.    [De Klerk] It might be, but I think the meeting becomes  even more important. But may I just emphasize: I didn't declare  the state of emergency out of the blue. The declaration of the  state of emergency is actually a judicial finding--that there is  a state of emergency on the ground and that is then recognized  and certified. You don't create a state of emergency by  declaring it. You certify that there is a state of emergency,  and that is the case.    And the focus of the debate shouldn't be on the declaration  of a state of emergency. The focus of the debate should be why  was it necessary for me to sign such a declaration. But why?  Because of the breakdown of law and order, because of the  failure to really effectively contain it, because of the many  deaths, because of the threats and the war cries. And what my  intelligence is telling me, what is from more than one side in  the pipeline. That is what must be addressed in the debate; not  the formality of having declared it. I'm sending troops into  kwaZulu-Natal because it is my duty, because that is the primary  duty of a government, and kwaZulu is part of the Republic of  South Africa. It is not an invasion, as Chief Minister  Buthelezi has said. It is part of the Republic of South Africa,  and my duty in that regard as head of the government extends  over the whole of South Africa.    [Venter] Just briefly, Mr. President, as we close off. The  last state of emergency in South Africa drew a very negative  international reaction. Now have you had an opportunity to  canvas what the likely international response to this is going  to be?    [De Klerk] No, but I have reason to believe -- I didn't  canvas it, I didn't ask anybody's permission. I didn't first  clear it before I took the decision. But I have reason to  believe from discussions with an ambassador here and a  delegation form overseas there that it will be welcomed, that  the distinction between this state of emergency and previous  ones will be understood. In the past under a state of  emergency, we acted against parties because they were parties.  We acted against the ANC because it was the ANC, and because it  was a banned organization. This time we are acting to defend  the right of all parties to operate freely. This time we are  acting to ensure that people who want to interfere with the  rights of all South Africans through violence and through  creation of unrest, interfere against their basic human rights,  to act against them. It is a totally different situation, and I  have no hesitation to say that I will have the moral support of  the international community.    [Venter] Mr. President, thank you very much.    [De Klerk] Thank you.</p>

Lin Chien-hsiung, director of the Finance Ministry's  National  Treasury Department said that before floating the bonds, his  department will consult with the Central Bank of China to make  sure the bonds will be issued on a loose capital market.    A loose capital market ensures that the government bonds  will  not trigger inflation and can prevent excessive liquidity.</p>

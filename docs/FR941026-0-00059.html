			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response, the Department simplifies the format for the annual escrow account statement in the final rule. HUD provides sample statements for both single-item accounting and aggregate accounting practices. In each, the annual escrow account statement includes a historical description of what actually was paid in and out of the account in the previous computation year. It also contains a forward-looking projection of anticipated activity in the account for the next year. The escrow account statements are prepared like bank statements, in a format that is familiar to the borrowers. By doing so, the Department intends that the borrowers will be able to better understand account activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD is sensitive to the concern that the statements may be too specific in nature. However, some specific information is necessary to make the disclosure useful to borrowers. If the account has exceeded the RESPA limits during the year, then the servicer must explain why. If the mortgage documents require a lower cushion, then the servicer will use that amount. The example provides a checklist for servicers to complete to explain why an account exceeded RESPA's limits. The Department concludes that borrowers need this explanation; otherwise, over-escrowing of accounts may continue. In addition, for borrowers who closely monitor their escrow accounts, HUD believes that the annual escrow account statements will provide sufficient information to borrowers to save servicers time otherwise spent in responding to borrower inquiries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Twenty-one commenters suggested that the annual escrow account statement be divided into two separate statements: (1) An annual escrow account statement providing historical information that the servicers mail to borrowers with Internal Revenue Service (IRS) information at calendar year-end; and (2) an escrow analysis statement, including the projection of the next cycle's calculations, that the servicers deliver to borrowers within 30 to 60 days of completing the escrow computation cycle. This practice would benefit servicers by combining part of the annual escrow account statement with existing IRS requirements. It would also benefit the borrowers by providing information in a useful and understandable fashion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department considers these comments informative. Many servicers will provide two such accountings to borrowers anyway. The IRS information requires calendar year-end totals. The year-end statements, however, do not necessarily correspond with the servicer's escrow account computation year. At any time, however, servicers may change the escrow account computation year to a calendar year-end period by using short year statements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Twenty-five comments wanted HUD to exclude foreclosures and loans that are 60 days or more delinquent from the rule's requirements for annual escrow account analysis and statements. In the final rule, HUD provides that servicers need not submit an annual escrow account statement if the mortgage loan account is delinquent (30 days or more) or if the servicer has initiated a foreclosure action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Short Year Annual Escrow Account Statements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule required the servicer to issue a short year annual escrow account statement to a borrower within 60 days of a loan payoff or 30 days of a transfer of servicing. Fifty-five commenters opposed these requirements, including 32 mortgage companies, 16 banks, 3 associations, and 4 attorneys. They stated that the IRS requires such information at calendar-year end; thus, they claimed, HUD's requirement was unnecessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department believes that servicers should provide borrowers with relevant information at a meaningful time, when borrowers will focus their attention on the information. HUD believes that borrowers should have the opportunity to correct escrow account errors when servicing is transferred or soon after loan pay-off. If servicers fail to deliver this information to borrowers for up to 12 months after the event, borrowers will be less likely to obtain corrective action of any errors made. Consequently, the final rule retains the short year escrow account statement provisions, although the Department has extended to 60 days the time for a transferor servicer to submit a short year statement to the borrower.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Transfer of Servicing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Upon the transfer of loan servicing to a new servicer, the proposed rule required the new servicer to perform an escrow account analysis before making any change to a borrower's escrow deposits. The proposed rule required the new servicer to submit an initial escrow account statement to the borrower within 45 days after establishing the new escrow account. Thirty-seven commenters asked HUD to eliminate this requirement. They questioned the benefit to the borrower and the time and cost involved in preparing the statement. Seven commenters suggested that HUD extend to at least 90 days the deadline for submitting the initial escrow account statement, because of integration issues associated with transfers of servicing. Three commenters were unclear whether the initial escrow account statement was required if the new servicer does not change the borrower's required escrow deposits or if the method of escrow account analysis does not change between servicers. Two comments stated that if the initial escrow account statement is required, it should be prepared by the transferor servicer, because that servicer performs an escrow account analysis before transferring the account. One comment questioned whether the initial escrow account statement applied to transfers of servicing between affiliates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department concludes that borrowers will benefit by receiving initial escrow account statements from new servicers under certain circumstances. The final rule requires a new servicer to provide a borrower with an initial escrow account statement if the servicer changes either the monthly payment amount or the accounting method previously used by the transferor servicer. Because post-rule accounts will be using aggregate accounting methods, no initial escrow account statement is needed for post-rule account transfers of servicing. In pre-rule accounts where there is a change in the escrow account balances, the new servicer shall use the effective date of the transfer of servicing to establish the new escrow account computation year. Where there is no change in the escrow account balances, the new servicer shall continue the escrow account computation year that the transferor servicer started. (The Department expects to publish soon a final rule on mortgage servicing transfers, adding a new &sect;3500.21 to Regulation X.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to comments, HUD extends the time for new servicers to deliver the initial escrow account statement from 45 to 60 days from the date of servicing transfer. The new servicer shall treat shortages, surpluses, and deficiencies in the transferred escrow account according to the procedures set forth in &sect;3500.17(f). A pre-rule account remains a pre-rule account upon the transfer to a new servicer, as long as the transfer occurs before the conversion date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Surpluses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Eleven comments requested clarification of HUD's proposed ``surplus'' definition. HUD's proposal defined a surplus to be an amount, determined at the time of escrow analysis, by which an escrow account balance exceeds the target balance for the account. The comments indicated that HUD's definition should state that a surplus is a balance in excess of the allowable cushion, if any. HUD disagrees. HUD believes that its definition in the final rule more accurately describes the surplus to be the excess of the current balance over the target balance. The target balance reflects the borrower's accrued payments for escrow account items  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the cushion selected by the servicer. A servicer may choose to use no cushion or one that is less than the maximum set by RESPA. It is therefore incorrect to state that the surplus is the balance that exceeds the allowable cushion. HUD retains the term target balance, rather than allowable cushion, in its definition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

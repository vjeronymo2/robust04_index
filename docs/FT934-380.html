			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / EU ministers wrap up agreement on packaging: But arguments on recycling are set to continue Consumers across the European Union could soon be sorting through their household waste to pick out bottles, plastics and other materials for recycling, following an agreement reached by environment ministers before Christmas. The compromise agreement on waste recovery and recycling targets in the EU's directive on packaging and packaging waste will have important consequences for Europe's packaging and waste management industries as well. It was reached after 18 months of wrangling between member countries and lobbying by the packaging industry, which believed original targets in a draft published last year were too severe. The argument, however, is not over. The directive must be ratified by the European parliament, and was opposed by ministers from Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands, who were demanding tougher targets. Germany is expected to campaign hard for amendments. After introducing the most ambitious targets in Europe for waste collection and recycling two years ago, it is already exceeding the proposed targets and has been forced to export large quantities of packaging waste after its own recycling industry proved inadequate. The council of environment ministers agreed that within five years of the directive's implementation: Not less than 50 per cent, but no more than 65 per cent, of packaging waste should be recovered rather than simply dumped. A minimum of 25 per cent, and maximum of 40, should be recycled, with a minimum of 15 per cent of each category of material. Within 10 years, the council would have to agree a 'substantial increase' in these percentages. This is somewhat softer than the original draft, which called for 90 per cent of packaging to be recovered within 10 years, with 60 per cent recycled. Moreover, some exemptions were granted to Greece, Ireland and Portugal, because of their geographical position on the fringes of the EU, and their comparatively low consumption of packaging. Ministers also agreed that member countries would be allowed to exceed the targets, but only if this did not lead to a distortion of the European internal market for packaging through those countries exporting the waste. That means a German company, for instance, might be prevented from exporting excess packaging waste to other member states, unless there was a bilateral agreement with a country prepared to take it. The compromise received a cautious welcome from packaging organisations. Mr James Jensen, director general of the Packaging Federation, which represents some of Europe's largest packaging companies, called it a 'victory for common sense'. 'What has emerged is a good balance,' he added. Ms Jane Bickerstaffe, technical director of Incpen, the London-based Industry Council for Packaging and the Environment, was more cautious. She said the targets were 'more realistic, more sensible', but the directive faced a rough passage through the European parliament. Mr David Veitch of Procter and Gamble Europe, a member of the executive committee of the European Recovery and Recycling Association, said he was pleased ministers had recognised the need to review the targets later, according to the progress being made and available technology. Reaction in Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark, has been predictably negative. Mr Hans Alders, Dutch environment minister, said the directive had been so weakened it had 'nothing to do with the environment'. Mr Klaus Topfer, German environment minister and architect of the country's environmental legislation, said the agreement would set back progress on environmental protection in Europe and force Germany to produce more waste. 'It is not supposed to be the EU's job to standardise the environmental tempo in all member states at any price or even to reverse it,' he said. Germany already recycles 66 per cent of its paper, 55 per cent of glass, 48 per cent of tin plate, and 20 per cent of plastics, and has an overall recycling target of 60 per cent by mid-1995. It says Europe as a whole already recycles more than 25 per cent of its packaging material - if figures for glass, recycling of which is well established, are included - and so the new directive may be a harmonising measure, but is not progressive. But France and the UK, in particular, have complained that German waste exports are undermining their domestic waste management companies, which can no longer compete with cheaper waste paper coming across their borders. 'It was very clear to environment ministers in Brussels that the German model needed to be scaled back to meet the concern of member states angered by German waste exports,' said Ms Nacy Russotto, director of the Association of Plastics Manufacturers in Europe. Officials at the German environment ministry counter that Germany's waste export problems are only temporary as two recycling plants in eastern Germany are due to be functioning next year and will be able to recycle nearly all the waste paper now exported to neighbouring countries.

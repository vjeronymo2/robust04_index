			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / TGWU computers disrupted by 'ambush' Ninety-four campaigners protesting at the TGWU general union's dismissal of one of its Merseyside officers yesterday occupied the union's Pounds 4m national computer centre in Newcastle. The day-long occupation in support of Mr John Farrell, the union's former north-west region trade group secretary for general workers, seriously disrupted the computer system's functions including pension payments. The campaigners, including Mr Farrell, left late in the afternoon but warned of further direct action. They said the occupation had been to publicise their claim that Mr Bill Morris, the union's general secretary, had acted as 'judge, jury and executioner' in dismissing Mr Farrell. Mr Morris, who flew to Newcastle to reassure the building's staff of his full support, condemned the action of Mr Farrell and his supporters as 'Chicago-style gangsterism'. Mr Morris said the protesters 'ambushed' the clerk who arrived to open the offices and demanded the keys with threats. Mr Farrell's supporters, who travelled overnight from the north-west, loaded with enough food for an occupation lasting weeks, insisted that their entry to the building had been peaceful. Mr Farrell was dismissed last month on various conduct-related grounds. The union said yesterday these included abuse of dispute benefit payments. He took High Court action, which ultimately failed, to prevent his dismissal. Mr Farrell said yesterday he had been dismissed because of his outspoken criticism of Mr Morris. Under Mr Morris - who had become a 'vicious rightwinger' - the union had no recruitment strategy to stem declining membership.</p>

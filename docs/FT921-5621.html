			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Baker acted on Iraq loan guarantees MR JAMES BAKER, the US secretary of state, intervened personally to support the granting of Dollars 1bn (Pounds 570m) of US government loan guarantees to Baghdad after he received complaints during an October 1989 meeting with Mr Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi foreign minister. In the Washington meeting, Mr Aziz demanded the Dollars 1bn of guarantees and complained to Mr Baker that the US handling of the scandal over improper Iraqi loans from the Atlanta, Georgia branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) was making Iraq 'very unhappy'. The disclosure, made yesterday in a congressional statement by Mr Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House banking committee, seems likely to further fuel controversy over the role played by Bush administration officials in assisting the financing of Iraq in the months leading up to the August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Declassified US government documents released by Mr Gonzalez show that at the time of the Baker-Aziz meeting, the US Treasury and Federal Reserve already suspected BNL Atlanta of providing loans to Iraq that helped Mr Saddam Hussein to finance his development of nuclear, chemical and ballistic weapons projects. Mr Gonzalez also released documents showing that Mr Baker swiftly contacted other cabinet members to argue for the Dollars 1bn of Iraqi loan guarantees, while Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, deputy secretary of state, lobbied the Treasury and Office of Management and Budget. Approval for the Dollars 1bn of further US loan guarantees was given in November 1989.</p>

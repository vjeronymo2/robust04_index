			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SLAYING BY INGLEWOOD POLICE TRIGGERS RARE LATINO PROTEST  </P> <P> Inglewood's Latino community, which has been almost invisible in the city's  political life, emerged into the spotlight this week, protesting the death of a  businessman's son shot by police April 5 after a two-hour chase.  </P> <P> After the funeral of 23-year-old Javier Arreola Monday, about 150 friends and  family members marched outside Inglewood City Hall, calling for justice and  accusing the police of mistreating Latinos.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Inglewood Police Chief Raymond Johnson emphatically rejected  protesters' allegations that racism played a role in Arreola's death.  </P> <P> Johnson said officers had no idea what Arreola's ethnicity was before the  shooting.  </P> <P> "It's absolutely ridiculous," Johnson said. "The officers had no way of knowing  who or what he was. And it wouldn't have mattered anyway. That's foolish."  </P> <P> A predominantly Latino demonstration is a rare event in Inglewood. Latinos have  generally kept a low profile in the city, where the power structure is  dominated by blacks and whites. Latinos rarely attend City Council and school  board meetings and have no elected representatives, although they constitute  30% of the city's population and about 44% of the school district's population.  </P> <P> But two days before the Arreola shooting, Jose Fernandez, an aide to state Sen.  Cecil Green (D-Norwalk), outpolled four other candidates in the District 3 City  Council election April 4 to qualify for a June runoff against Bruce Smith.  </P> <P> The Latino community is "waking up," Fernandez said Tuesday. "I'm sure this has  stirred up a lot of emotions. They feel they want to be included in the system.  They want their opinions taken into consideration, like everybody else."  </P> <P> Of Arreola's death, Fernandez said: "It's a total tragedy for everyone. For the  officers, for the family, for the city."  </P> <P> In an interview Tuesday, Arreola's father, Lennox bakery owner Francisco  Arreola, disagreed with statements by other relatives and family friends  accusing the police of anti-Latino bias. But he denounced the police for his  son's death, which he called "a crime."  </P> <P> This week, Arreola's family retained Inglewood attorney Harold Sullivan, who  said he is preparing a lawsuit against the Inglewood police. Sullivan said an  independent autopsy commissioned by the family this weekend showed that Arreola  was shot four times in the back and the back of the head at a range of about  three feet with a .357 Magnum. He questioned the necessity of shooting the  unarmed man and questioned the police versions of how and why the shooting took  place.  </P> <P> "I believe the police overreacted," Sullivan said. "I believe the officer who  shot him became too emotionally involved. We know from police psychologists  that people become angered in a chase situation. I think (Arreola) was cowering  behind the wheel. How many times do we hear police say 'He reached for a  weapon'. . . . I don't understand why he was shot four times in the back."  </P> <P> </P> <P> D.A. Investigating  </P> <P> As in all officer-involved shootings, the Los Angeles County district attorney  is investigating, along with the Inglewood Police Department. The Los Angeles  Police Department is also investigating because the incident took place in its  jurisdiction. The investigations should be complete within the month, Johnson  said.  </P> <P> The early morning shooting took place on the Santa Monica Freeway near La Brea  after officers shot out Arreola's tires. Police say officers fired after  Arreola ignored commands to surrender, backed up his van toward the officers  and ducked under the dashboard as if reaching for a weapon. No weapon was  discovered in the van. Officers said they found almost two ounces of cocaine  and added that Arreola's mouth and nose were smeared with the drug.  </P> <P> Johnson said Arreola ignored commands to surrender in both Spanish and English  during the chase and after he came to a stop. He said officers fired from the  back and sides of the van after Arreola started to back the van toward them and  ducked down in the front seat.  </P> <P> Johnson said he did not know whether the independent autopsy's report that the  shots that killed Arreola were fired from a distance of three feet is accurate.  </P> <P> "He had adequate time to surrender," Johnson said. "He did not respond to  orders. We don't like it, we don't relish the loss of a life. But it started  with him, not with us."  </P> <P> The 100-mile chase from Inglewood to Riverside County and back to West Los  Angeles began when Arreola fled from police cars responding to a midnight call  from a guard at an Inglewood construction site. Police said the guard reported  that Arreola's van had been circling the site and that a hole had been made in  a fence.  </P> <P> Arreola had a list of construction materials in the van that he needed for a  market he planned to open in Inglewood. Family members say police told them  that Arreola probably intended to rob the construction site, although police  have not said a theft occurred.  </P> <P> Attorney Sullivan said Wednesday that Latinos in Inglewood feel that the police  discriminate against them.  </P> <P> "It's common knowledge in the community that the police come down harder on  Hispanics than other groups," Sullivan said. Latinos "have generally been very  pacific, but they feel wronged in this case. They feel too much force was  used."  </P> <P> Inglewood Police Sgt. Harold Moret said the department does not discriminate  against anyone.  </P> <P> "We consider ourselves a caring, compassionate department," he said.  </P> <P> The vehemence of the protest comes partly because the dead man was the son of a  prominent businessman. Francisco Arreola owns the Arreola bakery, a fixture on  the bustling Inglewood Avenue corridor in Lennox, and has been working to  increase Latino political presence in the Inglewood area.  </P> <P> At the urging of Inglewood Mayor Edward Vincent, Arreola and Inglewood  businessman Jose Marrero formed the Inglewood-Lennox Latin American Chamber of  Commerce last year. Arreola was involved in several City Council campaigns  during last week's election, supporting candidates including Fernandez; the  bakery van in which Javier Arreola died bore signs promoting Fernandez's  candidacy.  </P> <P> Arreola said in an interview Tuesday that he disagreed with charges that racism  was an element in the shooting, saying demonstrators made those statements in  the heat of emotion. But he called for a full investigation of his son's  shooting.  </P> <P> "I want to know why they killed him," Arreola said in Spanish. "The law applies  to everyone, including the police. I want to know the truth about what  happened."  </P> <P> Arreola is a husky, stolid man who remains more comfortable speaking Spanish  than English 22 years after he arrived in the United States from Mexico. He  worked in a factory for seven years, then opened the family bakery where  Javier, one of seven children and the elder of two sons, worked along with  other relatives.  </P> <P> Arreola considers himself a loving but tough father. He admits that Javier  succumbed to drugs and other bad influences as a youth attending Lennox  schools. Arreola himself called police and had his son arrested in 1986 when he  discovered that Javier had stolen money from the family business.  </P> <P> Javier served six months in jail.  </P> <P> Since then, Francisco Arreola said, he and his son had reconciled, and Javier  was building a new life. Along with an uncle, Javier was preparing to open a  mini-mart on Arbor Vitae in Inglewood.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Wasn't Violent'  </P> <P> "He worked at my side at the bakery," Arreola said. "He had been married for  two and a half years with two children. He was excited about the new business.  He wasn't violent or aggressive. He didn't own a weapon."  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Arreola attended the Inglewood City Council meeting with Marrero,  the head of the Latin American Chamber of Commerce. Unlike Monday, there were  no angry words or picket signs. Javier Arreola's father stood silent at the  speaker's podium next to Marrero, who addressed the council on his behalf.  </P> <P> "All we want is justice," Marrero said. "Too many questions have to be answered  on how this happened. We request a complete inquiry and investigation, and we  request that the results be made public."  </P></p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / International Company News: Nestle climbs 9.2% and announces rights issue NESTLE, the world's largest foods group, yesterday revealed better-than-expected profits for 1992. The group also proposed a dividend rise, announced a rights issue, and set out a plan for simplifying its share structure. Consolidated net profit rose 9.2 per cent last year to SFr2.7bn (Dollars 1.8bn), or SFr73 per share. The directors, describing the performance as satisfactory, are proposing that the dividend be increased from SFr21.50 per share to SFr23.50, and from SFr43 to SFr47 per participation certificate. Meanwhile, the group, which also became the world's largest supplier of mineral waters following its SFr3.4bn acquisition of Source Perrier last summer, announced plans for a light rights issue. The terms would be disclosed later. The group said it would be 'at below market price' at the rate of one for every 25 registered or bearer shares and two for every 25 participation certificates. They directors are also proposing to convert the participation certificates into bearer shares at the rate of two shares for each certificate, and then to convert all bearer shares into registered shares at a rate of one for one. The aim was to simplify the capital structure and increase the market liquidity of Nestle shares. 'The board is convinced this measure will render Nestle shares even more attractive to institutional investors,' the company said in a statement. Owners of bearer shares and participation certificates could remain anonymous by not registering their holdings. In that case, however, they could not vote their holdings. The 9.2 per cent growth in net profit for the year was, as forecast, substantially below the 16.5 per cent rate achieved in the first half, but it was higher than some recent analysts' estimates. Sales were up 8 per cent to SFr54.5bn and the group said volume grew 3.3 per cent. 'This increase, which is neither influenced by currencies nor by acquisitions, is all the more satisfactory since it was obtained in spite of economic downturns in many regions of the world,' Nestle said. Trading profit gained 10.8 per cent to SFr5.6bn, indicating a margin improvement for the third year in a row.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, June 9 -- Head of the National Radio and TV  Council Ryszard Bender signed on Thursday a licence to broadcast  nationally for the Warsaw-based Radio "Zet" station. The  station is the second private radio station, along with the  "RMF" radio from Krakow, that will air programmes nationwide.  Bender told a press conference that he hopes that the licence  for the third non-public radio station, the Catholic "Maryja"  radio, will be signed next week.    Owner of the Radio "Zet" station Andrzej Wojciechowski said  that his radio would change its programmes and start as a  completely new station. He also said that on Thursday afternoon  his radio will start broadcasting a special signal, inaudible to  human ear, that will act as a repellent to mosquitoes. The  signal will resemble sounds emitted by bats.</p>

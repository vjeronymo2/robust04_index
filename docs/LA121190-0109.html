			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL REPORT: SEEKING A NEW WORLD;  </P> <P> BUZZWORDS FOR THE NEW DECADE  </P> <P> * Techno-nationalism is the practice of using technology as a tool of national  power in global economic competition, either by trying to withhold  technological knowledge from other states or by wielding it aggressively as an  economic weapon.  </P> <P> * Techno-globalism, in contrast to techno-nationalism, is the concept of  sharing technology freely across borders and perhaps even cooperating in the  development and manufacture of new products.  </P> <P> * Multipolar describes a world in which global power is diffused among many  countries, in contrast to the bipolar structure of the Cold War where the  United States and the Soviet Union served as poles of international power. In  the multipolar world ahead, experts say, alliances between states are likely to  shift more rapidly than they did during the Cold War.  </P></p>

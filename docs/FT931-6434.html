			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Insurers brace for NY bomb damage claims INSURERS, including underwriters at Lloyd's of London, could face claims of hundreds of millions of dollars as a result of the weekend's bomb damage at the World Trade Centre in New York City. However, with considerable uncertainty surrounding the circumstances of the claim, it is likely to be weeks before the industry can estimate the loss. The New York Port Authority, which owns and operates the centre, has a complex series of insurance policies covering both property and liability claims, which is reinsured in the London insurance market. London market sources last night doubted whether the policies would cover damage caused by terrorists. However, lawyers acting for the Lloyd's underwriters involved met Port Authority officials yesterday and last night spoke of a 'spirit of co-operation' between the parties. It was 'too early to tell one way or the other about coverage,' said Mr Lawrence Pollack of New York lawyers LeBoeuff Lamb Leiby and MacRae, but the Port Authority had a long history of placing insurance with Lloyd's, which 'values this business dearly'. If claims do prove to be valid, it is understood that damage to the building's fabric and interruption to business alone will generate substantial losses. Last year UK insurers and their continental European reinsurers paid Pounds 800m on property, interruption and loss of rental policies after the bomb attack on the Commercial Union building in the City, a much smaller building than the Trade Centre. In New York legal actions - both from the wounded and relatives of the five people killed in the attack, and potentially from commercial interests - are expected to swell the total size of the loss. Many of those caught up in the bombing might sue for compensation for stress, possibly producing additional claims on other policies. 'This is one of the most litigious cities in the world. It is a can of worms,' commented one London broker. On the Port Authority insurance programme, US companies would meet claims to a limit of Dollars 400m (Pounds 282m). Above this Lloyd's underwriters would meet all property claims up to an overall limit of Dollars 600m, through an excess of loss reinsurance programme placed by CE Heath, the brokers. These property damage policies would also typically cover losses through business interruption. Heath has also placed a reinsurance programme in London to provide Dollars 100m of cover for all liability claims above Dollars 4m. Below Dollars 4m, all claims will be paid from the Port Authority's insurance programme. Additional claims could also come from the building's tenants, which make their own insurance arrangements to cover risks to property, business interruption and liabilities.</p>

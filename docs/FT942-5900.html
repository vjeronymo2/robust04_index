			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Observer: Downbeat daub Poor old Denis. Lady Thatcher's husband should have been in his element at Tuesday night's bash at the Royal Academy, laid on by Guinness to celebrate its sponsorship of the RA's Summer Exhibition. Sir Denis's old golfing chum, Lord MacFarlane, chairman of Guinness's United Distillers, had asked him along as guest of honour, to thank him for all his help over the years, opening factories and suchlike. But when it came to the highlight of the evening - the gift of a special bottle of hooch to mark the 500th anniversary of Scotch whisky - up popped the lady herself to accept the gift. With her usual aplomb, Britain's ex-prime minister went on to argue that the RA was a 'pure Thatcherite' organisation, because it was not supported by a 'penny piece of taxpayers' money'. As for the exhibits, she opined that she shared Sir Winston Churchill's view: modern artists should not be let loose until they had proved they could paint a real picture.</p>

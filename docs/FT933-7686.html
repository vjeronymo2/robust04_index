			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Indonesian finances hit by yen surge INDONESIA may suffer a 10 per cent financing gap in its annual budget as a result of the Japanese yen's appreciation and lower than expected oil prices. Economists estimate that 40 per cent of Indonesia's Dollars 55bn (Pounds 37bn) foreign public debt is denominated in yen. Interest and principal repayments for fiscal 1993 were budgeted at Dollars 8bn but with the yen's appreciation could rise to nearly Dollars 9bn, say economists in Jakarta. While about a third of Indonesia's exports go to Japan, the three main items  -oil, liquefied natural gas and plywood - are traded in US dollars. Indonesia, therefore, has to buy yen to service its yen-denominated debt. Meanwhile, the average oil price since April has been less than the Dollars 18 per barrel assumed under the 1993 budget.</p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AUTOMATION LOOMING FOR U.S. MACHINE SHOPS;  </P> <P> FEDERAL LAB BREAKS TRAIL BY TEST RUN  </P> <P> Nearly everything that people touch, all manufactured products, involve the use  of metal-cutting machine tools.  </P> <P> In countries such as Japan and Sweden and West Germany, the machine-shop owners  are automating their lathes and drills, saving time and gradually taking over  the market that once belonged undeniably to the United States.  </P> <P> And yet in the United States, less than 11% of the machine tools in many  metal-fabricating industries are computerized; fewer than half the plants have  installed automated machines, and, even among plants that have invested in  computerized automation in the last five years, only about one in six machines  is computerized.  </P> <P> But U.S. machine shops are beginning to automate, and one government research  lab will be showing small companies how to do so without going into the red.  </P> <P> Next month, the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg,  which is about 30 miles south of Baltimore, will open an automation-technology  project that it calls the Shop of the '90s.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Help Small Shops  </P> <P> The project is designed to help small metal-working shops gain on foreign  competitors by automating their operations with inexpensive, off-the-shelf  computers and software available now at any computer store.  </P> <P> At the national institute, Adrian Moll created the demonstration project by  modernizing his own 56-employee machine shop, called the Fabrication Technology  division. There, workers design and build the special instruments and equipment  used by institute researchers.  </P> <P> Until last year, the institute was the Bureau of Standards, where scientists  built measuring instruments and systems that gave science and industry a basis  for accurate measurement. In 1988, the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act  changed the federal research lab's name and its focus.  </P> <P> Now, its 3,000 scientists also build better integrated circuits, develop  tougher industrial ceramics, create improved enzymes and transfer these  discoveries to U.S. companies.  </P> <P> At any given time, about 200 companies or organizations are sponsoring  cooperative research at the institute on such projects as new measurement and  quality control technology.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Thousands of Calibrations  </P> <P> Its products include thousands of instrument calibrations that often are  essential for safety and quality control in industrial operations, and its  standard reference materials are used nationwide to ensure the accuracy of  clinical lab tests.  </P> <P> During the last year, Moll and his division staff installed and taught each  other to use a personal computer network that allows them to automate routine  machine-shop activities such as estimating costs, planning manufacturing  processes, managing the tool room, tracking jobs and costs, and designing and  manufacturing products.  </P> <P> Automating his own shop, Moll says he "ran the project the same way a small  machine shop would. We didn't buy anything until we needed it. All the  equipment was bought piecemeal, then installed when we had time." Still, he  kept the shop up and running, and profitable, during the entire process.  </P> <P> A shop owner's average cost to put a similar system to work, Moll says, would  range from $5,000 to $20,000, depending on how much of the software a company  decided to buy. "Shopping around helps," he adds. The yearlong project cost  $300,000, including the cost of visiting manufacturing technology centers  around the United States to talk about the project.  </P></p>

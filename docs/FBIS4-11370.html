			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 22 April (NA) -- Defense Minister  Oscar Camilion asserted on 22 April that the theft of  information on the costs involved in manufacturing the Pampa  plane from the Cordoba Materiel Area is not "important." He  stated that this "does not affect in the least" Argentina's  chances of selling the aircraft to the United States.    In remarks made at the Defense Ministry when asked about the  theft that took place at the Cordoba Materiel Area, Camilion  noted: "No confidential material, designs, or manufacturing  processes have been stolen."    The minister stated moreover that the hard disks stolen from  four computers in a Material Area office "have nothing to do  with the designs for the plane."    "A truck would be needed to steal them," said Camilion  ironically in referring to the designs for the Pampa, a modern  trainer.    The minister further stated that the theft -- which occurred  between 21 and 31 January while personnel from the Materiel Area  were on holiday -- "does not affect in the least" the Pampa's  chances of being the successful bidder at the international bid  to take place in the United States on 12 May.    On that date, the U.S. Armed Forces will decide on the  purchase of 700 trainer aircraft, the cost of which will range  between $5 million and $7 million [figures as received].  Companies from Italy, Brazil, the United States, Germany, and  Switzerland will participate in this international bid in  addition to Argentina. [passage omitted]</p>

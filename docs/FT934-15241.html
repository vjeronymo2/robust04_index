			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Tory MPs fight to stop further defence cuts TORY BACKBENCHERS will next week launch an attempt to stop further deep cuts in defence spending in the drive to meet public spending targets for the next three years. Several Tory MPs are expected to use a two-day Commons debate on this year's defence white paper to say the armed forces are already stretched. This will follow the publication on Monday of a report by the Commons defence committee which is expected to be critical of some of the the white paper's plans. Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Conservative chairman of the committee, said this week he was 'extremely alarmed' by reports that more defence cuts might be in the offing. This new expression of backbench discontent follows clashes between Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, and the Treasury over demands for billions of pounds of additional cuts from the Pounds 23.5bn defence budget. Mr Rifkind is demanding a full-scale review of the armed forces if the Treasury refuses to drop its demands. Even if he beats off all the Treasury's demands, defence spending is set to drop by 1995-96 to its lowest level as a proportion of Britain's gross domestic product for decades. Though the white paper contained a series of new cuts, some long-awaited measures were put off. These may now be examined by EDX, the cabinet committee charged with sharing out the spending cake. They include plans for an air-launched nuclear missile and a decision on whether to upgrade existing tanks or buy more Vickers Challenger 2s. MoD pension payments have been outside the public spending control total from April. This makes the option of encouraging staff to retire early more attractive since the wage bill could be trimmed while the corresponding increase in pension outlays would not be counted. Defence suppliers may in future contract to provide staff as reservists to support the armed forces, under proposals put forward by the Ministry of Defence yesterday. Companies would undertake to provide a service, such as maintaining equipment sent to foreign trouble spots, for an agreed payment. They would have to ensure that enough of their employees became members of the volunteer reserves, to allow them to be deployed. Unions are seeking talks with ministers following over the 500 redundancies planned at Devonport naval dockyard in Plymouth, Devon. They say that the government had promised when it awarded the Trident submarine refitting contract to Devonport that there would be no more than 350 job losses.</p>

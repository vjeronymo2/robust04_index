			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Agreement on constitution is vital to settling the crisis A POLITICAL settlement of the Bosnian crisis now hinges very largely on the capacity of the three warring factions to agree on a constitution for Bosnia-Hercegovina. Though disagreements on other aspects - such as the precise frontiers of the provinces or constituent parts into which the country is to be divided, and the conditions for a cessation of hostilities  -are still deep, it is generally accepted that these would be easier to solve once a constitutional accord was reached. In spite of participants' statements to the contrary, there can hardly be doubt that progress has been made since the two co-chairmen of the Geneva conference on the former Yugoslavia achieved their minor miracle this month in persuading all the warring factions to sit down at the same negotiating table. That feat was capped by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen in gaining the acceptance of the three parties - the Bosnian Moslems, Serbs and Croats - for their constitutional and military plans as the framework and basis of the negotiations. The linchpin of the 10-point Vance-Owen constitutional plan is its first two principles: that Bosnia and Hercegovina shall be a decentralised state, with most governmental functions carried out by the 10 provinces into which it will be divided; and that the provinces shall not have any international legal personality and may not enter into agreements with foreign states or international organisations. Those principles, endorsed by the Bosnian Moslems and Croats, have so far been rejected by the Bosnian Serbs, who rightly believe the plan would end their dreams of becoming part of a Greater Serbia. Anxious not to be blamed for a breakdown of the talks and to present himself as a constructive participant in the peace process, Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, has put forward his own eight-point constitutional plan, a cleverly-worded document which, at first sight, has many similarities with the Vance-Owen proposals. It is clear, however, that the Serbian principles do not explicitly endorse the creation of an independent and sovereign state of Bosnia-Hercegovina, nor its division into 10 separate provinces. Instead, Mr Karadzic has proposed 'a composite state', made up of 'three constituent peoples as its three constituent units', a definition which would permit the Bosnian Serbs to set up their own state within Bosnia-Hercegovina, as a first step, and ultimately to merge with Serbia proper. A good part of yesterday was spent in bilateral negotiations aimed at finding common ground between the two constitutional plans. One thing is clear, however. Conscious of the fact that they are acting under a mandate from the UN and EC, Mr Vance and Lord Owen insist they will never agree to a solution which does not provide for a sovereign Bosnia-Hercegovina, whose territorial integrity is guaranteed and whose constituent parts will not be allowed to join another state. Whether Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, in Geneva to participate in the talks, will want, or be able, to pressure Mr Karadzic to bridge the gap between the two positions is the great question.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jimmy Seepe] </F>   [Text] The Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] is now prepared to  serve in the cabinet of national unity despite the  organisation's earlier refusal to do so, said one of its  parliamentary representatives this week.    But according to PAC chief negotiator, Gora Ibrahim, the  interim constitution will have to be amended by parliament since  it only entitles parties that gained a minimum of five percent  of the votes to have a cabinet position.    Ibrahim told NEW NATION of how PAC sees its future role in  parliament and how it plans to work within the system.    On president Nelson Mandela's overtures to try to give  recognition to the role liberation movements had played, Ibrahim  said he did not know how Mandela planned to do that.    Ibrahim, however, said negotiations were continuing with  Mandela on the type of role and positions that the PAC could be  expected to hope for in government.    "We appreciate the president's gesture to accommodate the  PAC  in the cabinet," he said. "But I do not know of any position  that had been left for us."    It has been suggested that the president was trying to  provide the PAC with an important post in the government besides  a cabinet position. It has also been mooted that Mandela might  even give the organisation one of the positions that belong to  the ANC.    "While the PAC appreciates the gestures made by Mandela  there  are constitutional issues that have to be resolved," said  Ibrahim.    "Our participation in the cabinet would be illegal if the  constitution was not amended," he said.    Ibrahim said his organisation cannot force changes to the  constitution since its voice had been weakened by the percentage  votes it received from the electorate.    He said the PAC's role in parliament would be guided by  concern for the aspirations of the people such as land, housing,  employment, education and health.    "We will not oppose everything that comes before  parliament,"  Ibrahim said. "We will not oppose measures that will improve  the lot of the majority."    On the future of the Azanian People's Liberation Army  (APLA),  he said APLA commanders were negotiating about the future of the  force but could not spell out when and where they would assembly  them for integration into the South African National Defence  Force (SANDF).    He also could not say how many of APLA cadres would be  involved.    Ibrahim said he hoped that APLA's participation would not be  prejudiced by the percentage of votes the organisation had  achieved in the elections "since a new army should not represent  the wishes of political parties but the interests of the nation".    "Integration should be determined on merit and  qualifications," he said. "I think APLA would be able to meet  all those."    Before the elections, PAC supported wildcat strikes by civil  servants in the former homelands but Ibrahim admitted to NEW  NATION that the strikes were "premature".    "They (North-West provincial parliament) have been there for  less than a week," he said, "but their grievances will have to  be addressed sometime."    But Ibrahim predicted that the ANC government would be faced  with immense problems trying to control strikes arising from  expectations raised during the election campaigns. He cited  housing as an example. "There is no way that enough housing can  be provided in the foreseeable future -- for more than  eight-million people living in shacks and squalid areas," he  said.</p>

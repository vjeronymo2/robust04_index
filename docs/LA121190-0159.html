			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOVIETS HALT UPRISING; ECONOMIC PLAN REJECTED BY 2 REPUBLICS  </P> <P> The Parliament of the Soviet republic of Georgia today declared a state of  emergency in a region that was making separatist moves, and the Soviet  republic's government reasserted its control over the rebellious area, a report  said.  </P> <P> The trouble occurred in the South Ossetian Autonomous Region, one of three  major subdivisions of the republic of Georgia in the Transcaucasian part of the  western Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Also today, the Parliament of the Russian Federation and the president of the  republic of Kazakh rejected Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's proposal to  retain central control over the economy.  </P> <P> The Georgian legislature took its emergency steps two days after the South  Ossetian region held illegal elections to form its own parliament, the  independent Interfax news service said.  </P> <P> Gorbachev has proposed a new union treaty to keep the 15 republics together and  to maintain central government control over natural resources and major  industries.  </P> <P> But the Russian republic's Congress of People's Deputies and Nursultan  Nazarbayev, president of Kazakhstan, the third-largest Soviet republic, each  said they would sign the proposed treaty only if it gives them control over  their own economies.  </P> <P> Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation has taken the same stand.  </P></p>

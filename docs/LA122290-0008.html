			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAHARA CLUB AND DESERT ENVIRONMENTALISTS  </P> <P> The Sahara Club, a group of plant-crushing motorcycle enthusiasts is aptly  named.  </P> <P> Large portions of the Sahara desert and other eroded wastelands of North Africa  are man-made. In historical (that is, Roman Empire) times, many now ugly and  hostile areas of North Africa were verdant and friendly. They became deserts  after men cut down all of the trees and their goats nibbled all of the smaller  plants out of existence.  </P> <P> MARK SEECOF  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

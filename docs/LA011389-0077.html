			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Interest rates on 52-week Treasury bills fell to the lowest level since  November. The Treasury Department sold $9 billion of the bills at an average  discount rate of 8.45%, down from 8.49% at the last auction Dec. 15. The rates  were the lowest since Nov. 17, when the one-year bills sold for 7.92%. The new  discount rate understates the actual return to investors -- 9.16% with a  $10,000 bill selling for $9,145.60.  </P></p>

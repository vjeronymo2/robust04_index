			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Legal Briefs: Ham imprimatur New EC food registration regulations due in July should comfort Parma ham producers who last year failed to stop Marks and Spencer selling their famous ham, according to London solicitors Lewis Silkin. The regulations, similar to the French appellation controlee scheme for wine, offer registration and certification to producers of cheese, sausages and beer traditionally associated with particular areas. The most exclusive tag will be Protected Designation of Origin followed by Protected Geographical Indications and Certificates of Special Character.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Observer: Slow start to the season Alan Rothenberg, the ambitious Los Angeles lawyer and chief organiser of this year's US football World Cup, probably has a few mixed feelings right now. While he can glory in the fact that the tournament earned a profit of Dollars 60m - twice the original estimates and by far the most money ever generated by a World Cup - and bask in the approval of Fifa, international football's governing body, not everything is going to plan. Fifa gave the tournament to the US in the hope that it would spread the gospel in the last great territory unconquered by the game. That evangelism has been cast on stony ground. Fifa wanted the US World Cup to boost a new US professional outdoor football league, known as Major League Soccer. The MLS is due to kick off in April 1995. But so far only seven cities have agreed to host an MLS team, leaving five of the spots unfilled. It seems big investors and corporate sponsors are shying away, and MLS may not have enough money to make its debut. Rothenberg has hinted that MLS's opening may be delayed until 1996. He has to make his mind up in the next 10 days. If MLS fails to appear in 1995 the US Soccer Federation - president, Alan Rothenberg - could be covered in embarrassment. Mind you, he can comfort himself with Dollars 7m in pay and bonuses, awarded to him last week for organising the 1994 World Cup.</p>

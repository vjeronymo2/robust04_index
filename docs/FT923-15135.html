			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Privatisation in Eastern Europe (12): Slow starter that is struggling to catch up - Bulgaria The preliminary stage of the privatisation programme involves the transformation of state enterprises into joint stock companies whose shares can eventually be sold off to the public Bulgaria was the last of the former Soviet satellites to throw off communist rule and the slow pace of political reform is reflected in the equally slow pace of privatisation. Ironically it is one of those countries which needs privatisation the most. It was long the most slavish copier of the Soviet model and its Dollars 12.2bn foreign debt is one of the most onerous per capita burdens in the region. Geographically it is one of the furtherest away from western markets, although relatively close and easily connected by sea to the Middle East. Leaving the vast bulk of industry and most other assets in the hands of the former communist nomenklatura for so long provided a vivid example of the danger of delaying change. In the spring of 1991 the Bulgarian Socialist (former communist) party government introduced a 'small privatisation law' which had to be repealed a few months later. It proved to be a conduit for managers of state enterprises to abuse their positions by widespread asset-stripping. As Hungary and other former socialist countries found in the early days of privatisation the temptation for the managers of state assets to usurp the privileges of ownership and hive state assets off into private companies owned by them or their political allies is enormous in the absence of effective legislation and other safeguards. Since then the situation has improved substantially. The non-communist government which emerged after the October elections under Prime Minister Filip Dimitrov placed a high priority on privatisation. It called in officals from the European Community's Phare Fund and other western advisers and also asked privatisation experts from Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland to share their experience. The net result was a privatisation law which was approved by parliament on May 8 this year. The law benefited from the experience in privatisation accumulated elsewhere in the region over the last three years but still needs further implementary legislation to come fully into effect. Bankers familiar with the privatisation process say that Bulgaria has moved fast in recent months to draw up vital complementary legislation in the foreign investment, company law, competition, banking, insurance and other fields designed to attract much needed foreign investment. At the same time, many of the former monolithic state enterprises have been restructured prior to privatisation. Progress in all these areas improves the prospects both for an eventual debt reduction agreement on Polish lines and approval of credits from the IMF, the World Bank and other institutions. The need to attract foreign investment was underlined by the 27 per cent drop in industrial production last year. Heavy investment is needed not only to improve efficiency but also to reduce the levels of environmental pollution, including the danger of nuclear contamination from the country's big Soviet designed nuclear power station. Until recently foreign investors have tended to shy away from Bulgaria although recently the Rover Group, the UK car manufacturer, negotiated a joint venture with the Defence Ministry to assemble cars, Land Rovers and pick-up trucks at former military plants. Earlier this year Mr Dimitrov spent 10 days in the US hoping to drum up investor enthusiasm for privatising important sectors such as telecommunications and modernising the countries extensive, but largely obsolescent electronics industry. Other sectors with foreign investment potential; which were slated for privatisation included tourism and agro-business. The Bulgarian-American enterprise fund has Dollars 55m available to finance such projects over the next three years. The first stage of the privatisation programme involves the transformation of state enterprises into joint stock companies whose shares can eventually be sold off to the public. At least 20 per cent of the shares of privatised enterprises will be retained by the government and placed in an investment fund. This will be used to finance social security funds and limited compensation for former owners who were illegally expropriated.</p>

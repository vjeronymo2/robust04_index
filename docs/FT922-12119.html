			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Letter: The monopoly factor must decide any bid for Midland Bank Sir, Institutional shareholders in Midland Bank are surely deluding themselves if they expect a successful bid from Lloyds to win them a higher price. Of course Midland would be worth more to Lloyds than to Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. Competition between UK banks would be reduced, particularly in the key market for small and medium sized firms, in payments services and in bank credit cards. So the clearing banks could increase their margins, at their customers' expense. The reduction in competition in these markets would clearly be against the public interest. With a Lloyds bid a Monopolies and Mergers Commission reference is certain; the MMC would be failing in its duty if it did not recommend against the takeover - particularly when a takeover by Hongkong Bank would strengthen Midland and increase competition in the UK market - and the government would be failing in its if it did not accept the MMC's recommendation. A counter-bid from a European bank? Now that would be another matter. Andrew D Bain, 1 Stafford Street, Helensburgh, Dunbartonshire G84 9HU</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Cupid shares down on warning Shares in Cupid tumbled 27 per cent to 16p yesterday as the USM-quoted bridal wear, formal wear and nursery products group revealed that it would be 'substantially loss-making in the current financial period.' Revealing deepened interim losses of Pounds 456,000 (Pounds 168,000) in January, the group suggested it was unclear whether it would return to profitability in the year to March 31 and announced the launch of a restructure of the group, now ongoing. Mr Richard Shaw, chief executive, has been temporarily requested by the board to take no executive actions and he is presently in discussions with the company.</p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Arts: An artist who provokes a smile / Review of Thomas Rowlandson in Richmond Thomas Rowlandson, the regency caricaturist and watercolour painter, travelled extensively and sketched prolifically. A rapid and brilliant draughtsman, his drawings are a persuasive and amusing impression of his age, although their documentary value is often limited. Rowlandson was quite prepared to subordinate accuracy to his comic vision, or to the requirements of his compositions. Not surprisingly, therefore, his drawings are unreliable as topographical records. Luckily this has not deterred The Museum of Richmond from assembling a loan exhibition of 35 of his drawings illustrating Richmond and its environs. Richmond was a fashionable resort in Rowlandson's time, and this was no doubt an attraction for an artist with one eye on a market for his work. However perfunctory Rowlandson's topography, he was certainly careful to ensure that his views of Ham House, Hampton Court, Mortlake, Kew and other spots along the river, were sufficiently accurate to be recognisable. He was also attracted to Richmond for its 'rural' qualities, and this aspect of his work is perhaps less familiar than his caricatures of metropolitan manners and customs. There is a mannered charm about Rowlandson's response to the countryside, although landscape is seldom the primary subject of his drawings. His representation of trees and foliage, usually highly stylised, nevertheless has a whimsical appeal. It is a pleasant surprise to find that the artist who - in the words of his companion Henry Angelo - 'burlesqued even the burlesque' can also evoke a lyrical mood. The drawing entitled 'Richmond Park' is close in spirit to some of Gainsborough's landscape studies, and the scene of anglers beneath an arch of Richmond Bridge is an unexpected exercise in the sentimental sweetness of Francis Wheatley. Although Rowlandson does sometimes show sensitivity for landscape, his pen moves with greater alacrity and power when drawing figures. His compositions are frequently focused on a group of caricatured figures in the foreground; surrounding figures may be drawn 'realistically', ingeniously lending a credibility to the caricatures. Rowlandson's repertoire of caricature types may seem predictable, centring on leering yokels, dandified officers, foppish aesthetes, bloated parsons and suchlike, but the figures themselves have a lifelike vitality thanks to the artist's brilliant gifts as a draughtsman. His eye for movement and posture, usually taken from life, accounts for the enduring success of his caricatures, no matter how tiresome they become. The centrepiece of this exhibition is perhaps 'The Star And Garter, Richmond Hill', a drawing which features the famous view of the Thames from the top of the hill. The horizontal format of the composition allows Rowlandson scope for a panorama of narrative incidents - a formula which Frith later used, and perhaps exhausted, in his representations of Victorian life. In the foreground a prosperous middle class family ostentatiously ignore a begging woman as they pass along the road. This incident, clearly intended to be no more than amusing, is nevertheless portrayed entirely without pathos, and indicates Rowlandson's limitations. For all his genius as a caricaturist, his vision is superficial and complacent. Unlike Hogarth, whose comic spirit he inherited, Rowlandson does not emotionally engage with his subjects beyond indicating their comic potential. Although this exhibition shows only a tiny fragment of Rowlandson's vast output, it is nonetheless representative of his range. His popularity is perhaps connected with his ability to persuade us that the regency period was indeed prosperous, socially untroubled and rollicking good fun; this, of course, cannot be entirely true - Rowlandson's metier was to provoke a smile rather than a thought.</p>

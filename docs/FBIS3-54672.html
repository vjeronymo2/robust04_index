			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tamara Nikolayeva in the "Lithuania" column: "A </F> Year Ago They Were Dissatisfied With Landsbergis and Now With  Brazauskas. The Incumbent Authorities Have Little Time To  Fulfill Their Pledges"]    [Text] Social tension in Lithuania is mounting. It is  hard to tell to what extent this is due to the difficult  situation in the socioeconomic sphere and to what extent to the  artificial fanning of passions by representatives of the right  opposition. Meanwhile, the industrial and agricultural  production decline continues in the republic. The minimum wage,  pensions, and student grants, with the start of the heating  season when the owner of a two-room apartment has to pay more  than 70 lits (an average pension) for public utility services,  have lost any meaning even as a source of purely biological  survival. At the other pole of society whole fortunes are  emerging. At the same time, the basis of civilized capitalism  -- a broad middle class -- is not being formed at all.    In November alone there were two major actions aimed against  government socioeconomic policy. One of them was organized by  pensioners and invalids, the other by land owners who even with  falling production cannot sell even a small part of their output  owing to the shrinking of the domestic market. Nor can they get  any money for the products sold from the monopoly processors.    The social and economic complaints of both are quite  understandable. Having served their purpose as a cause to  express protest, however, they are now increasingly moving into  the background under the pressure of political slogans and  demands, the main ones being the resignation of the republic's  present leadership, and early Seimas and presidential elections.    Seimas Chairman Cheslovas Yurshenas stated that the  "rightists" have issued a challenge to the legally elected  authority, taking advantage of the natural discontent of the  people owing to the economic difficulties. The ruling majority  in the Seimas assessed the November protest actions as the first  patently demonstrated wish to overthrow the government after the  "leftists'" one-year spell in office. The right opposition  paper LETUVOS AYDAS is increasingly playing up the idea that  early elections are simply vital. The independent TV-3 channel  from Kaunas is conducting purposeful day-to-day propaganda  against the republic's leadership.    The rightist opposition's trumps in this political game are  indexation of the population's bank deposits and  Lithuanian-Russian relations. The first card is apparently a  sure win: Will there be many people capable of rejecting a  100-fold indexation of deposits, as proposed by the right  opposition in the person of former premier Gediminas Vagnorius?    The other trump -- Lithuanian-Russian relations -- in  contrast to the first, is not such a "win-win" as before, when  Russian troops were still in Lithuania. Most people in  Lithuania understand the present leadership's aspiration to  establish normal mutually advantageous economic relations with  Russia, and this is being persistently demanded also by  Lithuanian industrialists and entrepreneurs. Nonetheless, any  positive shifts in Lithuanian- Russian relations are interpreted  by the "rightists" as a "secret conspiracy with Moscow" and the  intention by the authorities to fall into the Russian sphere of  influence. The right opposition party, the Fatherland Union,  created on the foundations of Sajudis and led by Vytautas  Landsbergis and Gediminas Vagnorius, has expressed its concern  over the accords reached in the course of a recent meeting in  Vilnius between the Lithuanian and Russian presidents on setting  up a commission to corporatize the gas pipeline passing across  Lithuanian territory as well as two major Lithuanian enterprises  using Russian raw materials -- Azotas in Ionava and Nafta in  Mazheyka. The "rightists" interpret these accords as a threat  not only to the economic but also political independence of  Lithuania.    In the thick of the power struggle the "rightists" are not  inclined to reckon either with considerations of economic  expediency or the need to preserve social stability in order to  overcome the crisis. Presumably the "rightists" suppose that at  the present stage of the crisis there is every reason to hope  for their advent to power through early elections. In this  context the "leftists," incidentally, stated that last year's  early elections, too, were staged by the "rightists" but the  winner was the Democratic Workers Party of Lithuania [DWPL].  Today, however, the situation in Lithuania has changed  substantially. At that time there was disappointment with the  ruling Sajudis' policy and today the disappointment is no less,  but this time with the DWPL. Of course, this party has received  an unenviable legacy but its social policy pursued over the year  has proved to be very far removed from its election pledges.    Nonetheless President Algirdas Brazauskas' popularity rating  is still fairly high, running at least 10 points ahead of  Vytautas Landsbergis'. The "leftists" have stated that they are  not going to part with power until 1996 and that they will do  everything to fulfill their election promises and lead the  country out of the crisis. The "rightists," however, are  pressing for a referendum to be held on the issue of early  elections. Only if the present ruling majority, as represented  by the DWPL, manages to adjust its social policy, will the idea  of early elections possibly pass away, deprived of fertile soil.</p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Palm oil price downturn forecast MALAYSIAN PALM oil output is gradually rising after a seasonal downturn and traders say this could reverse the strong price uptrend as stocks, now the lowest in three years, are also likely to build up again, reports Reuter from Kuala Lumpur. 'We expect the market to hit a downturn in the coming months,' said one trader. 'Forward months are already trading at a discount and we expect strong selling at above MDollars 900 (Pounds 200) a tonne.' Palm oil prices eased in afternoon trade yesterday on news that Malaysia end-March palm oil stocks were higher than expected. The Palm Oil Registration and Licensing Authority put them at 483,744 tonnes, down 4.66 per cent from the end of February, but that was higher than an earlier trade estimate of 450,000-460,000 tonnes. 'There was active producer selling following the PORLA news,' one broker said. The July contract on the local palm oil futures was hovering at MDollars 892 a tonne, down from a previous close of MDollars 901 a tonne. Palm oil output in Malaysia, the world's biggest producer, rose to 441,390 tonnes in March from 382,860 tonnes in the previous month, the authority said. Traders said output could rise to 560,000 tonnes by June. Production is likely to peak in October or November before a seasonal downtrend sets in again. Analysts and traders said local palm oil reserves could also rise to 570,000 tonnes by June and 800,000 tonnes by September unless demand picked up sharply. 'We see stocks going up steadily in May, June and July,' said a trader with a European firm. 'Again, it depends on the export side, both by Malaysia and Indonesia.' Palm oil futures had surged to MDollars 944 a tonne on March 20, the highest since May 1989, on supply tightness. Traders said the July contract could find support at MDollars 880 a tonne.</p>

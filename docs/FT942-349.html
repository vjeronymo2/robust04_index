			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: Ontario Hydro shake-up urged Ontario Hydro, the biggest power utility in North America, urgently needs to reassess its structure as a government-owned monopoly to cope with growing competitive and financial pressures, according to a report commissioned by the utility. Although the report makes no firm recommendations, its authors, led by Hydro's chief financial officer, clearly signal their preference for at least a partial privatisation. A group of financial advisers, including three US and Canadian investment banks, concluded that 'the market appetite for an initial issue of Ontario Hydro equity would be in the order of CDollars 5bn (USDollars 7bn)'. The offering would include an international component. However, a final decision on Hydro's future rests with the provincial government. The left-of-centre New Democratic Party has resisted privatisation but allowed the utility to proceed with a restructuring which has already resulted in 7,000 job losses. The shake-up has been spearheaded by Mr Maurice Strong, who took over as chairman in late 1992 after a career in diplomacy, which included organising the Rio summit on the environment. The report concludes that 'the need for change is urgent and stakeholders will have to make significant choices soon if the competitiveness of our electric power industry is to be sustained and if Ontario Hydro's assets are to retain their value'. It notes that the Canadian power industry cannot afford to be out of step with the increasingly competitive climate in the US, where deep discounts are being offered to industrial customers. Furthermore, a capital infusion is required to redress the lop-sided balance sheet, which carries CDollars 34bn of debt supported by less than CDollars 4bn of equity. Unexpectedly slack demand for electricity in recent years has left Hydro with substantial surplus capacity.</p>

			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> ISRAEL TOUTS REMOTE-CONTROL PLANE  </P> <P> Israel said today it will unveil an unmanned remote-control plane, designed for  both war and peace, at the Paris air show next month.  </P> <P> "The Impact unmanned air vehicle is the most advanced operational  reconnaissance UAV in the world," said Rafi Laufer, a deputy general manager at  state-owned Israel Aircraft Industries.  </P> <P> But it also has great civilian potential in its ability to cruise slowly for up  to 12 hours, transmitting television pictures by night or day to controllers  directing it up to 90 miles away, he said. "It can, for example, monitor  traffic and forest fires for much cheaper and far longer than manned aircraft,"  Laufer told a press briefing.  </P> <P> The Impact has an eight-foot wingspan and propellers in front and at the back.  It can fly at an altitude of up to 19,000 feet, he said.  </P></p>

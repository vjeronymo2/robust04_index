			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As previously discussed, &sect;923.55 of the order provides that whenever cherries are subject to grade, size, quality, maturity, pack or container regulations, those cherries must be inspected by the Federal-State Inspection Service (FSIS). Since this rule would establish minimum size and maturity requirements for Rainier variety cherries, such cherries would have to be inspected and certified by the FSIS as meeting the applicable requirements of the regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on available information, the Administrator of the AIMS has determined that this action would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons are invited to submit their views and comments on this proposal. A 15-day comment period is deemed appropriate because the committee has held several meetings concerning the need to regulate Rainier variety cherries, and all interested persons were invited to participate and express their opinions on this issue. In addition, to be of maximum benefit to the industry, any regulation covering Rainier cherries should be in place for the 1994 season, which begins in mid-June, and adequate time is needed to advise producers and shippers. All written comments timely received will be considered before issuance of any final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 923  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Cherries, Marketing agreements, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR Part 923 is proposed to be amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 923_SWEET CHERRIES GROWN IN DESIGNATED COUNTIES IN WASHINGTON  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

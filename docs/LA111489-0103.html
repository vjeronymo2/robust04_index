			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> *Styron's choice: Novelist William Styron says that in 1986 he almost joined  the ranks of such authors as Ernest Hemingway, Virginia Woolf and Jack London  who have committed suicide. Styron wrote in December's Vanity Fair that he  "used alcohol as the magical conduit to fantasy and euphoria, and to the  enhancement of the imagination." But in 1985, he said, his body suddenly  rejected alcohol, and he grew depressed. After going so far as to redraft his  will and to pen a suicide note, Styron checked himself into a hospital for  treatment and regained his will to live.  </P> <P> * Split: The wife of former New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange says her  husband has left her for his speech writer, and Naomi Lange wants the speech  writer's identity known. "The point is he's gone off because of Margaret Pope,"  Mrs. Lange said in a newspaper interview. "Society is totally sick when people  rob other people's husbands, and I think Margaret Pope's name should be  exposed." Lange had said in a two-line statement that he had separated from his  wife, whom he married in London in 1968.  </P> <P> * Leavin' on a jet plane: Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, flew out  of Hong Kong Monday, ending what could be the last royal visit to the British  colony before China resumes sovereignty in 1997.  </P> <P> * Early Thanksgiving: A post-campaign television commercial by New Jersey  Gov.-elect James Florio may prompt a few double takes. There's no campaign  rhetoric this time, just a simple word of thanks. In the ad, a beaming Florio  tells voters he appreciates the landslide victory they gave him last week over  Republican James Courter.  </P></p>

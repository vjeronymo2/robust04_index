			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Brussels to look deeper into Italtel venture The structure of Italy's state-controlled telecommunications sector is to come under European Commission scrutiny as part of an antitrust investigation into the proposed joint venture between Italtel, Italy's telecoms equipment manufacturer, and Siemens of Germany. The Commission yesterday announced it was deepening its investigation into the deal struck in March between Stet, the state-controlled holding company which is Italtel's parent, and Siemens. The two companies agreed to merge their equipment manufacturing interests in Italy. Stet and Siemens would each control 50 per cent of the new company, which would have a turnover of about L3,400bn (Dollars 2.2bn) in 1994. The Brussels inquiry, which follows a one-month preliminary examination of the case, could last up to four months. It is thus likely to overlap with the build-up to privatisation of the Italian state's 65 per cent holding in Stet, expected to take place in the middle of 1995. The Commission said it was concerned about the impact of the Italtel-Siemens deal on the Italian market for the supply of telecoms switching and exchange equipment in the state sector. It said the joint venture would command around half the Italian market for public switching and transmission equipment. But Brussels is also worried about vertical links between Italtel/Siemens and Telecom Italia, Italy's main domestic telephone company. Telecom Italia, which is Italtel's principal client, is also a subsidiary of Stet. 'One of our concerns is that one of the main EU companies, Siemens, will have the same status (within Stet) as Italtel, which has a very important relationship with Telecom Italia,' the Commission said yesterday. The announcement of an in-depth inquiry was not unexpected, given that Italtel already had nearly 50 per cent of the Italian equipment market before the merger. But it is the second antitrust setback this month for Stet and Telecom Italia. Last week, a Milan appeal court ruled that Telecom Italia would have to provide more leased lines for Telsystem - an Italian telecoms services company that wants to provide telecoms services for businesses in Italy  - pending a ruling by Italy's antitrust authority.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beirut, April 8, IRNA -- Muslim alim, Allameh Seyyed  Mohammad Husayn Fadlallah here today lambasted Clinton for  having called on Yasir 'Arafat to condemn the recent operations  of the Palestinian strugglers in 'Afula in northern Palestine.    Fadlallah who was delivering his sermons at Imam Reza Mosque  in southern Beirut Friday said no one Zionist is innocent in the  occupied Palestine since the mere fact of their presence on the  occupied land is a criminal act.    He said the innocent side in the conflict are the Lebanese  and the Palestinians who are targets of regular attacks of the  Zionist soldiers.    Allameh Fadlallah also criticized the pope for describing  the  operations of the Palestinian strugglers as some sort of  antagonism with non-Arabs, and called on him to support the  Palestinians that are being killed daily by the Zionists and  demand the Zionist regime to allow Palestinian refugees on their  homeland.    He said Vatican's recognition of the Zionist regime is in  fact an endorsement of the occupation of Palestinians lands by  the Zionist regime.</p>

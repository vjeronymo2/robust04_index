			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / UK Company News: Taunton Cider and Kenwood ready to make market debut THIS SUMMER will see two rapidly-growing newcomers on the stock market with the flotations of Taunton Cider, Britain's second-largest cider maker, and Kenwood Appliances, one of the UK's leading household equipment manufacturers. Taunton Cider has chosen July for its stock market debut, little more than a year after the Pounds 100m management buy-out from brewers Bass, Courage and Scottish &amp; Newcastle. The listing is expected to value the Somerset-based maker of Red Rock and Diamond White ciders at between Pounds 130m and Pounds 150m. It is believed the flotation could double the value of shares held by some 96 per cent of the company's 500 employees. Taunton is expected to sell just under 50 per cent of its shares. The group, advised by merchant bankers Samuel Montagu and brokers James Capel, will launch a prospectus in June. Forecasts are for profits of about Pounds 16m this year. Kenwood Appliances, which was bought by management and Candover Investments from Thorn EMI for Pounds 56m in 1989, will have a market value of between Pounds 80m and Pounds 100m, said Mr Timothy Parker, the 36-year-old chief executive. Although the flotation date has not been set, Mr Parker said it was likely to be after annual results are published in June. The nine-strong management team will end up with about 10 per cent of the Kenwood shares, he added. The group aims to raise between Pounds 40m and Pounds 50m, the bulk of which will be used to pay off Kenwood's Pounds 35m debt. Sales for the year to the end of March 1992 had increased from Pounds 76m to Pounds 90m, Mr Parker said. Forecasts are for pre-tax profits of more than Pounds 9m.</p>

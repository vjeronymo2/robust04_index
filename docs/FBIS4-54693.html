			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fahrudin Becic] </F>   [Text] The people of Gorazde remember 4 May as the  beginning of the aggression on this town. Just as they did two  years ago, chetniks attacked this morning as well. They were  shelling defense lines at the northwest section of the  battlefield. They opened mortar and intensive infantry fire at  the Pobjeda Factory from Grbavo Brdo. The situation was the  same along the entire line of separation at the left bank of the  Drina. They were peaceful at the right bank this morning, but  despite all decrees, resolutions, and ultimatums, they are still  positioned only several hundred meters away from the town  center. UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] forces are trying to do  something, but without effect. They are explaining this by the  fact that they have no authorization and precise instructions  from their superiors and that they are waiting for results of  the Silajdzic-Akashi and Karadzic-Akashi talks.    The Chetniks, however, are not waiting at all. They continue  plundering, carrying out provocations, blackmailing, and  distorting facts. This could certainly not be done without  influential sponsors in the United Nations.</p>

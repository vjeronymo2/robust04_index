			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Pressure for EU referendum set to grow: Move seen as way of appeasing Eurosceptic MPs Pressure on pro-European cabinet ministers to back a referendum on Britain's future in Europe is set to intensify early next year amid signs that rebellious Tory backbenchers will step up their feud with Mr John Major's government. As the cabinet prepares to work out its negotiating position for the next stage of European Union integration, the government is being pressed to promise a referendum on the issue in an effort to appease Tory Euro-rebels in the Commons. Mr Major and other ministers are expected to debate a referendum early in the new year, when they discuss their negotiating position for the EU's inter-governmental conference in 1996. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, are among pro-European ministers who have already made clear they are against consulting the British public over any deal signed at the conference. However, the pressure on both men to back a referendum looked set to grow yesterday amid signs of a worsening feud between the government and the nine Tory MPs who lost the party whip after voting against the European Finance Bill this month. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, issued one of the sharpest attacks yet on the group, arguing that their dissent threatened to consign the party to the political wilderness. 'We have to remember that the Conservative party is not a debating society, it is not indulging in internal discussion for some sort of literary purpose,' he told BBC1's On the Record programme. 'Politics is about power.' But one of the rebels, Mr Nicholas Budgen, MP for Wolverhampton South West, demanded that the government rule out at once the possibility of joining a single currency. 'The whip should be publicly offered back to us all at the same time,' he wrote in the Mail on Sunday. 'This should be an occasion for generosity and not for nitpicking and malice, comparing the character of the various members of the group.' At meetings of the cabinet's sub-committee on European questions next month, ministers are expected to set out the broad direction they want the EU to take into the next century. In an effort to end deep divisions within the Conservative party over the next stage of European integration, the cabinet may also agree the conditions under which it would offer a referendum to the British people. Friends of Mr Clarke said yesterday the chancellor might back a referendum in the event that the IGC set Europe on a strongly pro-federalist path. 'I think there will be a government announcement and one that will not leave people isolated,' a close ally of the chancellor said. 'There has been a move towards common ground in the cabinet in the last week or two. We can't stick with the current uncertainty over a referendum because it's too divisive.'

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 7 January: On Friday, the Sejm adopted a new  geological and mining law, that will replace the law that has  been in force for 40 years. There were 245 deputies for the  adoption, 16 against, and four abstaining. During the debate it  was stressed that the present law ameliorates the eternal  conflict between the need to extract the resources of the earth  and the obligation to protect the environment.    The law specifies a new method of exploring for and  obtaining  natural resources from the earth. The provisions of the previous  law were determined for the needs of the former economic system  (the mining law in 1953 and the geological law in 1960). It,  among other things, regulates the principles for the extraction  of minerals, the granting of concessions, issues of work safety  underground, and responsibility for damage from subsidence.    The law reserves the ownership of mineral deposits to the  state treasury. Minerals such as sand or coal that are to be  found on the territory of someone's property do belong to him,  except if he wishes to sell them, in which case a concession is  required.    The new law, among other things, changes the method of  collecting the dues for mining subsidence. Hitherto this took  place on administrative lines, whereas it now finds itself at  the disposal of the courts, where the basis for claims is the  civil code. The law has abolished the provision whereby the  entity responsible for the damage was obliged to cover the costs  only up to a level equal to the cost of building a single-family  house, irrespective of the level of damage caused. Currently,  compensation is to cover the full value of the damage. Those  extracting "the riches of the earth" will be forced to take into  account in extraction costs the payments for environmental  protection that have so far been omitted.    The geological and mining law regulates in detail the  principles for the granting of concessions to foreign entities  for the search for and extraction of minerals. Payments for  concessions are henceforth to be negotiated with every entity  separately.    The draft geological and mining law had been in parliament  for a year and a half. The Sejm adopted the new law on 29 May  of last year, but the dissolution of parliament made impossible  the continuation of the legislative process. The government of  Waldemar Pawlak directed the draft for renewed consideration by  the Sejm as a matter of urgency.</p>

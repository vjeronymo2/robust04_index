			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Collor goes on counter-attack BRAZIL'S President Fernando Collor has launched a counter-offensive against the flood of corruption allegations threatening his political future. Drawing on his two main assets - the respect commanded by Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, the economy minister, and his own marketing skills - Mr Collor hopes to win over what he calls 'the silent majority' and thus resist pressures by the media and political opponents for his resignation. Documents emerged on Sunday further linking Mr Collor to Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, the businessman under congressional investigation for alleged extortion, and purporting to show that deposits averaging Dollars 53,000 (Pounds 28,000) a month have been made into the account of the president's secretary by a company owned by Mr Farias. The money was allegedly used to pay Mr Collor's household expenses. To show his defiance in the face of the latest accusations Mr Collor resumed his traditional Sunday run, after a break of six months. The message printed on his T-shirt was 'Don't talk about crisis. Work]' He has also begun sending out daily handwritten notes referring to the existence of a 'syndicate of coup-makers' whom he accuses of 'irresponsible anarchism', insisting they will not succeed in forcing him out of office. Mr Moreira is meanwhile taking every opportunity to predict good economic news, despite little evidence of improvement, and has relaxed restrictions on consumer credit to stem complaints about the recessionary effects of tight government monetary policy. Predicting economic growth this year of 2-3 per cent, Mr Moreira says real interest rates will fall next month. He insists that the political crisis is not damaging the economy. 'The allegations of Sunday, the speculations of Monday and the rumours of Thursday will not affect the functioning of the country because this government has withdrawn from the economy, no longer fixing prices or regulating everything, and allowing it to function independent of political problems,' he said.</p>

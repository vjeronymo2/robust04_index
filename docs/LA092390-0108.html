			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLOUR-IZING THE ROCK LANDSCAPE;  </P> <P> MORE THAN PRINCE OR MICHAEL JACKSON, LIVING COLOUR HAS REINTRODUCED ROCK TO ITS  BLACK MUSIC HERITAGE  </P> <P> The four members of Living Colour responded to the first question in unison and  so emphatically it sounded rehearsed.  </P> <P> The question was, "Should anyone still care that you're a black hard-rock  band?"  </P> <P> The answer: "No!"  </P> <P> For all intents, the response was rehearsed. The issue of race has been with  Living Colour since it began in the mid-'80s, and the band would like nothing  more than to lose it. After all, Living Colour established itself on grounds  that have nothing to do with race.  </P> <P> Its 1988 debut album, "Vivid," sold nearly 2 million copies, largely to the  standard hard-rock market. The album's acceptance came very slowly -- it was  out for nearly a year before it became a hit, despite the patronage of Mick  Jagger, who had band member Vernon Reid play on his 1987 solo album "Primitive  Cool" and produced a couple of the songs on "Vivid." Many, including Living  Colour, have suggested that initial resistance to the album was due to race,  though there's no question that the novelty of a black hard-rock band also drew  critical attention.  </P> <P> But the band did become a hit and more than held its own as the opening act on  the Rolling Stones' 1989 mega-tour. (Remember, a young Prince was booed  mercilessly opening for the Stones in the early '80s). And there seems to be no  resistance to the new album, "Time's Up" -- it leaped into the Billboard  magazine pop album chart Top 20 after just two weeks in release.  </P> <P> The album beats the sophomore jinx with some intense metal thrash (the title  track), matured songwriting (the South African-flavored "Solace of You") and a  funny attack on Presley exploiters ("Elvis Is Dead").  </P> <P> Still, the uncomfortable and distracting race issue will not die.  </P> <P> "Part of it's just wearying, because you deal with it so much," said Reid, the  New York group's founder and guitarist. "We've done interviews where not a tune  has been talked about. I saw a review (of 'Time's Up') from England that was  totally from a point of view . . . dealing with race."  </P> <P> Yet for the better part of the next hour at Epic Records' Century City offices,  the band addressed the issue readily, presenting articulate arguments  supporting the notion that their race should be ignored, but also  well-considered reasons why it cannot. And it's not as if the band has shied  away from it. The fact is there just aren't many black hard rockers, and none  that draw the attention that Living Colour has. Even if the band doesn't go to  the issue, it seems to go to them.  </P> <P> Reid, who started Living Colour after schooling in the free-jazz Harmolodics of  Ornette Coleman, insisted that the band's name is not meant as a reference to  skin color -- he said it came from the old Walt Disney television program  presented "in living color." But Reid, who has written criticism and essays for  the Village Voice, is also the outspoken founder of the Black Rock Coalition,  an organization that promotes awareness of rock's black roots and serves as a  base for social and political activity, including the anti-censorship movement.  </P> <P> "It's a black-originated art form and a lot of black people don't realize that,  and they don't associate themselves with rock 'n' roll," said drummer Will  Calhoun. "I think it's something that should be reiterated into the culture. So  in that sense, yes, I think the issue should be made."  </P> <P> Singer Corey Glover, a dynamic performer who has also done some acting  ("Platoon"), continued: "The education has to be there to let people know we  are not doing something alien to our culture, not doing something alien to our  socio-economic background either. We happen to be black folks, but if you're  brought up in a society with the range of music and types of music you listen  to, that's going to be reflected in the music you play. No one asks M. C.  Hammer why he plays the music he plays. It's expected of him."  </P> <P> Bassist Muzz Skillings added, "We don't think about it, because Vernon grew up  playing this music, I grew up playing this music, Corey's always wanted to be  in this kind of band and Will's been doing the same kind of things. In our  neighborhoods, bands that played rock 'n' roll played the stuff from the  'Woodstock' album, playing everything on it. So it's no strange thing."  </P> <P> Said Reid, "You go back and forth between thinking it doesn't matter and we're  just a rock band, and the fact that it's the kind of society that has racism. .  . . Some people have looked at us and said, 'So what? These guys are black and  they rock.' They missed the point. We're trying to tell a segment of the  African-American story, our perspective. That by and of itself makes a  difference."  </P> <P> If Living Colour ever thinks it can ignore the race issue, all it has to do is  recall last October when it shared the bill with the Stones and Guns N' Roses  for four nights at the Los Angeles Coliseum. Guns N' Roses was at the height of  controversy over the use of racial and gay epithets in its song "One in a  Million." As the shows approached, Reid was quoted in the news media about the  matter, and Guns N' Roses singer Axl Rose was perturbed.  </P> <P> "After we played on that first show I wanted to check out Guns N' Roses to see  if they were good live," Skillings recalled. "I was standing backstage. I saw  Axl coming down the stairs and he walks by. But then five minutes later  somebody taps me on the shoulder. I look up and it's him.  </P> <P> "First thing out of his mouth: 'You got a problem with me, man?' I said, 'What  you talking about?' So then he goes on, 'It's in the media that I'm some sort  of racist, man . . . I ain't no damn racist.' He went down this long list: 'I  don't think you're a (racial epithet). Anyone can be a (epithet). If you're a  bad person you're a (epithet). I don't think black people are (epithet). I  don't think black bands are (epithet).'  </P> <P> "And he just went on and on. So then he sticks out his hand and I say we should  talk about it, just talk about it."  </P> <P> But moments later on stage, Rose attempted to defend the song and managed to  dig himself in deeper with a string of profanities and slurs that only served  to further inflame the matter.  </P> <P> On the second night, Reid used the stage to make a brief attack on anti-black  and anti-gay language before the band launched into a furious version of its  hit "Cult of Personality."  </P> <P> "We all played a little harder," Calhoun said. "I broke a few more sticks that  night."  </P> <P> Said Skillings, "Something like that does remind you, it does smack you in the  face in case you might have dozed off a little bit, that it's reality that  certain attitudes don't change."  </P> <P> "Type" is the title of one of the new album's key tracks and its first single.  The song isn't so much about racial stereotypes as the tendency to use labels  indiscriminately, be they "type O" blood or Abstract Expressionism.  </P> <P> "It's like people don't take the time or don't have the time to know what  post-structuralism is or post-modernism," Reid said. "They just say, 'Oh yeah,  that's modern,' or, 'That's Cubist.' You know what I mean?"  </P> <P> Now Living Colour is confronting its own typing -- apart from the racial  identification. The first album came with some mystery and intrigue. What does  a black rock band sound like? How will it be marketed? What kind of audience  will accept it? Now there's no novelty, and certain expectations -- both in  terms of sounds and sales -- have been established.  </P> <P> "We're no longer the X-factor," Skillings said.  </P> <P> "When a band does a first album and it does well they have nothing to lose,"  Glover said. "The question becomes how much do you believe in your concept? How  much do you let people's expectations and the thought of losing your success  affect your work? And the main thing is it's important to keep your work away  from that."  </P> <P> "We do this for ourselves first," Skillings said. "But it's not like we do it  totally for ourselves and (ignore) the audience. It's good to get feedback and  figure out how you affect people on one level. That's good and healthy. But  when it gets to the point where people put their own head trips or baggage or  their own value systems on your music and say, 'I think you guys should be  doing this or that,' that really has no place."  </P> <P> But if on the tour they learned through the Guns N' Roses episode that the  racial issue can't be ignored, they learned from the Stones that a band can  survive on its own terms.  </P> <P> "They could have gone out and done a tour of their hits," Reid said. "But they  actually had to support a new album. Their whole thing was the Stones are still  a viable, vital thing, not a nostalgia band and not trying to cash in on the  old hits. They went out there trying to pump out the new songs, even with all  the machinery going on around them."  </P></p>

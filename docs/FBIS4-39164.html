			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 106 (596) by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy and edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk named the former prime  minister, Leonid Kuchma, as his main rival at the forthcoming  presidential elections at a meeting with the editors of a number  of Russian newspapers Thursday evening. He said the winner of  the presidential race would become clear only in the second  round which, in his words, would become a "duel" between himself  and Kuchma.    The head of state based his argument on the results of an  opinion poll, which had indicated that 27 percent of the  electorate would vote for Kravchuk and 20 percent for Kuchma.    However, the Leonid Kuchma thinks his main rival will be the  last Supreme Soviet speaker, Ivan Plyushch. "Plyushch," he said,  "really concentrated power in Ukraine into his own hands."  Observers back that argument up by the fact that Plyushch has  the support of most local authorities in the Republic. He was  behind a law, which will give the heads of local authorities all  power in their regions after the 26 June elections, and that  will help him considerably in his pre-election campaign in a  number of regions and at local polling stations, they say.    The speaker of the current Supreme Soviet, Aleksandr Moroz,  is thought to have less chances of success. However, his recent  exploits have done much in the objective sense to earn him more  popularity among the eastern "Russian-speaking" regions of  Ukraine. Moroz has a balanced approach to the Crimean issue, and  his firm opposition to President Kravchuk's plea for the  presidential and local elections to be postponed to a later date  is also in his favor.    The Supreme Soviet on Thursday evening rejected Kravchuk's  proposal to defer the elections.    IF Note: A parliament resolution stated that it [the  parliament] considered it undesirable to postpone the elections  to a later date give that preparations for those elections were  almost complete, with "election constituencies and commissions  set up and candidates for the presidency and local government  registered."    However, the parliament approved Kravchuk's proposal to  create a legal base for the future president to exercise his  powers. Supreme Soviet commissions have been recommended to  submit their proposals for draft laws governing then powers of  the Ukrainian president, cabinet of ministers and local  authorities and governments by 12 June.    The government has been requested to submit a draft law on  the cabinet of ministers to the Supreme Soviet, also by 12 June.  The law would define the rights of the cabinet of ministers and  regulate its relations with local authorities.</p>

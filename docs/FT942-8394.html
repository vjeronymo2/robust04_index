			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Robust house sales help recovery at Westbury Westbury, the Cheltenham-based housebuilder, yesterday reported a swing from losses of Pounds 2.18m to profits of Pounds 8.31m pre-tax for the year to February 28. The turnround reflected a more stable trading environment and record house sales of 2,685 units compared with 2,428 last time. Turnover increased by 15 per cent to Pounds 152m. The 1992-93 deficit took account of exceptional charges of Pounds 7.35m, including a Pounds 5.6m write-down on the land bank. A tax charge of Pounds 2.36m (credit Pounds 2.01m) left earnings per share of 9p (losses 0.3p). An increased final dividend of 3.5p makes a 5.25p (5p) total. The shares closed 11p higher at 175p. Commenting on the results, Mr Geoffrey Maddrell, chairman, said: 'After four successive years of recession, the industry appears to have stabilised over the past year. 'All of the economic indicators affecting our industry are as favourable as at any time in the recent past; this encourages us to foresee a modest recovery in our markets over the next few years.' Operating profits jumped from Pounds 630,000 to Pounds 9.55m while losses from the group's interests in associated undertakings fell from Pounds 617,000 to Pounds 248,000. Net interest costs fell to Pounds 990,000 (Pounds 2.19m). The group ended the period with net borrowings of Pounds 4.5m, equivalent to gearing of 5 per cent. During the year Westbury invested Pounds 48m on new land, strengthening its land bank with planning consent from 5,850 plots to 6,600 plots at an average cost of Pounds 15,400. Mr Richard Fraser, chief executive, commenting on the outlook, said: 'The current year has started well and our expectations of higher sales volume, an increase in the average selling price and an improvement in the operating margin are being borne out.'</p>

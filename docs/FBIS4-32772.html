			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia -- Strategic Affairs Secretary (SAE) Mario  Cesar Flores on 26 May proposed the resurrection of old security  and intelligence services -- such as the DSI (Security and  Intelligence Division) and ASI (Security and Intelligence  Advisory Office) -- within nonmilitary ministries for the  purpose of fighting corruption. Flores believes the  resurrection of these services must be studied carefully so as  to prevent a recurrence of what happened during the military  government, that is, the establishment of virtual parallel  governments within the respective ministries. "It is a good  preventive measure to have internal intelligence services within  ministries. Care must be taken, however, to prevent them from  becoming virtual parallel governments as they did in the past,"  Flores said during a lecture he gave at a seminar entitled:  Intelligence Activities Within a Democratic State, which is  being sponsored by the Chamber of Deputies National Defense  Committee.    Flores also proposed the creation of intelligence agencies  that would temporarily operate abroad -- whenever the need  arises for obtaining confidential information in other  countries. Flores said: "Brazil used to have agencies abroad.  At present, it has none."    Upon noting that Brazilian diplomats may obtain public  information such as that published by the press, Flores noted  that diplomats should not act as secret agents. He said:  "Diplomats may supply routine information. But there are cases  in which diplomats should not get involved because if they are  caught carrying out secret, illegal activities they end up being  expelled from the host country."    In his lecture, Flores stated that it will be incumbent upon  the new president to organize the Brazilian intelligence  service. He said: "In its administrative reform, the future  government will probably promote a central intelligence  organization that will be conceived as part of the package of  organizations answering to the president." In his opinion, the  new government will have to create a national defense council,  which will consist of representatives from the Justice Ministry,  the Foreign Ministry, the Armed Forces General Staff (EMFA), the  Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and the SAE. Flores believes the  council will be primarily charged with reestablishing  intelligence activities consistent with a democratic system.</p>

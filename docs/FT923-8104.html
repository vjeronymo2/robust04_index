			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Manoplax boost for Boots NEWS that its heart drug Manoplax has received UK approval lifted Boots, taking the shares up 7 to 429p. Although Manoplax has been in tests for three years, a setback at the beginning of the trial period had left analysts somewhat cynical. However, yesterday's announcement raised hopes that other approving authorities could soon follow suit, with the lucrative US market high on the agenda. Estimates vary as to how much Manoplax might be worth to Boots. While the UK market is likely to bring in around Pounds 10m a year from next year, US approval could mean Pounds 100m a year by 1997. Mr Nick Hawkins at Kleinwort Benson said that the news, together with firm retail sales and recent selling pressure, meant that the shares were good value. Queens Moat falls Improved profits and an increased dividend failed to halt a slide in the shares of Queens Moat Houses as the hotel group surprised the market by disclosing an unexpected jump in debt levels. The company undermined sentiment further by stating it intended to pursue opportunities in the German hotel market, which may involve additional capital expenditure. 'The borrowing position has caused giant disappointment,' said Mr Bruce Jones at Smith New Court. 'The figures were fine and the depreciation policy positive. But they have created a credibility and sentiment problem and won few friends.' Mr Mark Finnie at County NatWest argued that Queens Moat may need a cash call within the next two years if it fails to contain debt levels. 'Expansion is something the market does not want to hear about at the moment,' he said. However, Kleinwort Benson painted a more positive view. Analyst Mr Paul Slattery said worries over the debt position had been overdone and pointed to the 'dramatic growth' in trading profits. Kleinwort has pulled its full-year forecast back Pounds 7m to Pounds 93m, with County on Pounds 94.5m, Paribas on Pounds 94m and Smith on Pounds 95m. Queens Moat shares tumbled 8 to 57p with 6.2m traded. CU pleases Insurer Commercial Union (CU) was a strong performer after a set of interim results that surprised the market. The shares rose 8 to 443p. The company was still in deficit over the first half, but its loss narrowed to Pounds 18.1m from Pounds 26.3m. The forecast was for a loss of between Pounds 19m and Pounds 35m. There was some disappointment that the dividend was merely maintained at 9.25p but Mr Steven Bird, insurance analyst with Smith New Court, raised his current-year forecast to break-even from a Pounds 20m loss, and improved his 1993 estimate by Pounds 14m to Pounds 130m, arguing that the stock 'remains the prime buy in the sector'. Burmah firm Oil group Burmah Castrol was one of the stronger performers in the market, receiving encouragement from a couple of positive pieces of research. Securities house Smith New Court put the stock on its buy list ahead of interim results on September 3. Analyst Mr Nick Clayton said the stock was at a 16 per cent P/E discount to the market and that the shares were attractive up to 600p. Also, Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken put out an internal buy note, saying that Burmah was: 'A good solid company that is now back to a reasonable rating.' The shares closed 18 higher at 543p. Saatchi wanted Advertising group Saatchi &amp; Saatchi rose sharply as investment houses in the US and UK turned positive on the stock following an encouraging set of results. The shares jumped 14 to 150p. In London, SG Warburg Securities upgraded its short-term recommendation to buy from hold and increased its full-year profit forecast to Pounds 21.5m from Pounds 17.5m. Meanwhile, in New York, Smith Barney published a buy recommendation after hosting a meeting between potential investors and Saatchi executives in the US. Drug group Wellcome fell 4 to 778p as Robert Fleming, the merchant bank which handled the recent Pounds 2.16bn sale of shares by the Wellcome Trust, again cut its bid price. The bid was trimmed by 3p to 777p. Smith &amp; Nephew was slightly easier at 136p despite its defensive qualities. Nomura reduced its 1992 forecast by Pounds 5m to Pounds 145m, principally to reflect a weaker dollar. The shares eased  3/4 to 136p. ICI returned to the level it had reached before announcing a demerger. One analyst said investors were realising that it would be a long time before the impact of the planned demerger was felt. The shares fell 10 to 1094p. BP held steady at 189p on turnover of 11m receiving some support from a Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken buy recommendation. Shares in Eurotunnel edged up a penny to 324p after the company said talks on additional costs with tunnel constructer TML were making progress and could be over 'within week'. Airports operator BAA continued its recent advance, this time boosted by the release of slightly better than forecast July passenger traffic figures, up 11 per cent on the same month last year. The shares gained 4 to 633p, with talk of some dealers switching out of BAA and into British Airways. The airliner's shares closed 8 down at 245p. Hotel group Forte suffered from Queens Moat's figures. The stock closed at 130p, off 7. A big seller of Rank Organisation unhinged the shares, off 9 at the close at 534p. Shares in manufacturer Northern Foods made a technical bounce after the recent battering which followed a bout of downgrades. They jumped 17 to 249p in heavy volume of 3.1m. Talk that Dutch conglemerate SHV had raised its stake in retailer Nurdin and Peacock helped the shares 3 to 151p. In engineers and metals, Siebe rebounded 9 to 598p in thin trade. A broker's recommendation earlier in the week continued to benefit TI Group, with the shares 4 better at 270p. Shares in Williams Holdings fell 13 to 241p, with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew reported to have been the day's main sellers. Turnover reached 2.2m. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (4).

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Bipartisan drive to strengthen US SENATORS Sam Nunn and Pete Domenici yesterday cast aside party loyalties to make a bipartisan appeal for a long-term programme of reforms to strengthen the US economy and reduce the budget deficit. At a news conference, they urged a radical re-shaping of the tax system, involving the replacement of personal income taxes by consumption taxes, as part of a strategy to increase national savings and balance the federal budget by 2002. They also urged deep cuts in planned federal spending so as to help pay for increased investments in education, training and commercially relevant research and development. Mr Nunn, a Democrat from Georgia, and Mr Dominici, a Republican from New Mexico, were releasing the first report of the Strengthening of America Commission, a bipartisan group of 60 prominent Americans assembled by Center for Strategic and Internantional Studies, a Washington think-tank. It specialises in foreign policy but, since the collapse of the Soviet Union, has recognised that 'some of America's biggest trouble spots are not abroad but at home.' It argues that deep-seated social and economic problems at home can be solved only if the US develops a bipartisan consensus on policies, similar to that forged on national security in previous decades. The report's most radical proposal is that personal income taxes be abolished and replaced by a progressive consumption-based tax. It is not urging a value-added tax, but a reform of existing personal taxes. Taxpayers would take annual income, add net borrowing, gifts and bequests, and subtract all savings, such as net investments and increases in bank deposits. The advantage of such a tax is that it would remove the current fiscal bias against saving while letting rich individuals be taxed at higher rates than the poor, thus retaining progressivity. The commission believes the new tax would stimulate savings and investment. It would be phased in as part of a strategy to balance the federal budget within a decade. The commission advocates an 8 per cent cut in planned federal spending, saving Dollars 1,500bn over the next decade. The consumption tax would also raise an additional Dollars 376bn - equivalent to a 3 per increase in revenues. However, spending cuts would have to be legally guaranteed before taxes could be raised, and tax increases would be limited to no more than Dollars 1 for every Dollars 2.75 of spending reductions. Much of the spending reduction would be achieved by capping the growth of entitlement programmes such as Medicare, the health scheme for the elderly. The commission also argues strongly for increased investment in areas critical for future economic competitiveness. Sales of new homes fell 6.1 per cent in August, providing further evidence of US economic weakness. The drop was the biggest since March and compared with analysts' forecasts of a gain of about 2 per cent.</p>

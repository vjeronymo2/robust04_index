			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Provisional Methods for Training Laborers Who Will Serve </F> Abroad"]    [Text] Article 1    Aim: To improve the quality of Chinese laborers (including  postgraduates, the same hereinafter) who will serve abroad, to  meet international labor service market demands, and to improve  management over these laborers, methods have been formulated as  follows:  <H5>  Article 2 </H5>   Units responsible for training and organizing these  laborers:  The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC]  will exercise management over Chinese laborers who will serve  abroad, in line with their relevant trades, and will guide and  coordinate the formation of all levels of training centers, as  well as the training of Chinese laborers who will serve abroad.  Departments in charge of foreign trade and economic cooperation  under the ministries and commissions of the State Council, and  the foreign trade and economic commissions (departments and  bureaus) (hereinafter called departments in charge) of  provinces, autonomous regions, cities directly under the central  authorities, and cities on separate listing, are responsible for  organizing and guiding the training of laborers in their  departments (localities) who will serve abroad.  <H5>  Article 3 </H5>   The establishment of training centers: The departments in  charge or the companies entitled to send laborers abroad  (hereinafter called entitled companies) must establish training  centers according to their specific conditions. They may  establish training centers according to different professions  and trades -- depending on their different conditions -- or they  may establish comprehensive training centers. These training  centers must possess the necessary educational conditions,  teachers, mathematical equipment, and teaching programs, and  must submit all these to MOFTEC for approval.  <H5>  Article 4 </H5>   People to be trained: All kinds of laborers (including  ordinary or senior laborers and postgraduates) who will be sent  abroad (or outside the borders) by the entitled companies must  be given training.  <H5>  Article 5 </H5>   What to be taught: 1) The relevant state laws, regulations,  principles, and policies; patriotism; and foreign-related  discipline.    2) Courses on foreign languages, adaptability, and the  relevant countries' (regions') basic situations, to be provided  according to the countries' (regions') characteristics and  requirements.    3) The relevant countries' laws, regulations, financial  knowledge, customs, habits, and manners.    4) Education on transforming concepts, on establishing a  correct concept of labor and professional ethics, on abiding by  the relevant countries' labor system, on studying advanced  foreign production technology and managerial experience, on  obeying management, and on seriously fulfilling contracts.  <H5>  Article 6 </H5>   Teaching material: 1) State laws, regulations, principles,  and policies; foreign-related discipline and rules; the relevant  countries' laws, regulations, customs, habits, and manners  (hereinafter called the general material); the general training  program to be worked out by MOFTEC.    2) Language-teaching material will be compiled by training  centers in accordance with the relevant countries' requirements.    3) Professional and technical teaching material will be  compiled by different departments in strict accordance with  state criteria. To cope with the technical requirements of the  relevant countries or foreign employers, MOFTEC can invite some  experts to provide additions to professional and technical  teaching material.  <H5>  Article 7 </H5>   Training methods: Chinese laborers who will serve abroad  must be given examinations or assessments on their  qualifications before attending training courses. Relevant  training methods must be adopted in accordance with laborers'  different levels and with different countries' requirements  concerning foreign laborers: 1) Technical laborers with junior  title or above who have mastered the relevant skills and the  expressions for daily use in the official languages of the  relevant countries (regions) will be exempted from technical and  foreign language courses, provided they can produce technical  position title certificates and foreign language examination  certificates (school reports). They need to attend only  training on common subjects at an appointed time.    2) Ordinary technical laborers must be given assessments  before being recruited. They must attend appropriate technical  training, courses on simple expressions for daily use and work,  and courses on common subjects.    3) The professional and technical assessments of laborers  (including managerial personnel) sent abroad under a project  contract system (usually involving 15 people or more) must be  supervised by the contract-performing unit or by the unit that  sends these personnel; their training and examination on common  subjects will be carried out by appointed training centers.    Article 8    Training period: The course on the general material should  be conducted for not less than a week; the period for language  training must be arranged according to the requirements of the  relevant countries to which the laborers will be sent, but at  least a week of intensified training must be provided on simple  expressions for daily use and work, as well as on professional  skills. Training centers must give examinations in accordance  with international practice and the technical requirements of  the relevant countries, or they may arrange training courses on  appropriate skills in light of the actual situation.  <H5>  Article 9 </H5>   Training fee: In principle, either the participants or the  units that will send laborers abroad are responsible for paying  the training fee. The arbitrary collection of charges is  strictly prohibited. MOFTEC will adjust the training fee.  <H5>  Article 10 </H5>   Examination and end of training: Examination must be  conducted before training ends. Examination questions must be  set according to the general program and detailed criteria must  be provided so as to ensure training quality. Upon fulfillment  of training targets and being proved qualified through  examination, a "certificate of qualification for laborers who  will serve abroad" will be issued by MOFTEC or an authorized  training center.  <H5>  Article 11 </H5>   Dispatching procedures: From now on, a "certificate of  qualification for laborers who will serve abroad" gradually will  be introduced when laborers submit procedures for exits to  foreign countries (regions). Without this certificate, no  laborer can be sent abroad. The foreign countries (regions) to  which Chinese laborers can be sent will be determined by MOFTEC  after consulting with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the  Ministry of Public Security.  <H5>  Article 12 </H5>   Punishment: MOFTEC will conduct regular inspections of  training centers. If a training center provides poor quality  training, resorts to deception, or arbitrarily issues  "certificates of qualification," and depending on the merits of  each case, it will be criticized, given an economic punishment,  suspended from business for three to six months, ordered to  correct its mistakes, or disqualified from the status of being a  training center.  <H5>  Article 13 </H5>   By-Regulations: These methods will come into force on 1  October 1994, and MOFTEC is responsible for explaining the  relevant provisions.</p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Metals upsurge showing signs of tarnish - Why there are fears of another false dawn among LME traders PRICES ON the London Metal Exchange have been rising strongly in recent weeks, turnover is high and some traders have dusted off the vintage champagne bottles to celebrate. The casual observer might well mistakenly assume that the LME's upbeat mood is signalling that a full-blown world economic recovery is on the way. After all, LME traded metals - aluminium, copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc  -are essential to the industrialised world and are used for a wide variety of products. But the LME is giving some distorted signals. One reason for the present buoyancy is that US-based commodity funds have piled in with big 'buy' orders. These funds have been excessively influenced by the tentative economic revival in the US, suggests Mr Neil Buxton, research manager at Metal Bulletin Research. He says: 'They see investment in metals as a good way to play that economic recovery. Metals prices have been falling since 1988-89 and other financial markets are not offering such good returns as in the past.' That is not to suggest the funds are entirely wrong. Most analysts believe that metals prices will finish this year at a higher level than they started it. 'That's not saying much,' Mr Buxton points out, 'because they started at such a low level.' However, it will take some time before the overpowering economic gloom lifts sufficiently to justify a strong rise in metals prices. As Mr David Humphries, an economist at the RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining group, suggests, metals demand in Japan, which accounts for about 18 per cent of world usage, will fall this year. Prospects in the European Community, accounting for 30 per cent, are looking dim because Germany, the driving force, is 'coming off the boil'. Only in the US, accounting for 25 per cent of world metals usage, is demand showing tentative signs of recovery. Mr Graham Deller, analyst at the Metals and Minerals Research Services consultancy group, points out that OECD industrial production - an important indicator of potential metals demand - was lower in the first quarter this year than in the final quarter of 1991 and was unchanged in the 1992 second quarter. MMRS is looking for industrial production to improve by only 0.5 per cent this year. 'As industrial production usually leads metals prices by about six months, even if there is a pick-up in the second half of this year, we would not see any big pick-up in metals prices until late 1993 or even 1994,' Mr Deller says. What do the statistics tell us about metals markets in the first half of this year? The sharp price rises in June saw all the LME traded metals finish the month higher than they were in January (see table). However, average prices of aluminium, copper, lead and nickel over the six months were all below their 1991 level. Tin's average price was up, braced by severe producer cuts that will leave the market substantially under-supplied this year. The average zinc price was sharply up (by nearly 9 per cent) but this was caused by traders playing games and using options to cause a nasty technical squeeze in the LME's market for the second time in only six months. The LME executive eventually had to step in on June 15 to limit the daily backwardation (the premium charged for metal for immediate delivery). This eased the situation but the LME is having to continue monitoring zinc because it seems very likely that the squeeze will re-emerge strongly in October. Analysts suggest the same group of traders and producers who squeezed the zinc market in June have rolled their positions over to October. 'They like this market and have no intention of selling. They are probably going to go longer,' said one trader. 'They have a million tonnes (a year) of production between them.' Copper, which recently touched its highest price in 18 months, is also being buoyed up by the threat of another LME squeeze in the fourth quarter of this year and early 1993. Traders suggest that Sumitomo of Japan, which caused an options-related squeeze last year and forced the LME executive to intervene in the copper market, is moving in the same direction again. However, copper, the LME's 'flagship' contract and the most heavily-traded, is also benefiting from the usual supply disruptions at a time when demand is holding up reasonably well. Most analysts say copper supply and demand are more or less in balance. While there has been some drop in demand from Japan because of that country's slowing growth, the Chinese have re-emerged as substantial copper buyers this year. Mr Ted Arnold, metals specialist at Merrill Lynch, points out that the Chinese might buy 200,000 tonnes of copper in 1992, 'which would take up all the slack from Japan'. Other metals are also likely to feel the impact of China's recent dramatic economic growth - its industrial production was up by an estimated 18 per cent in the first half of this year. 'The potential for increased base metal demand from China is huge - and it will be tempered only by the availability of foreign exchange and the country's existing infrastructure,' says Mr Euan Worthington, head of the mining team at SG Warburg, the financial services group. Meanwhile, disturbances caused in metals markets by the collapse of the Soviet Union are by no means at an end. 'Although total exports from the former communist countries could be slightly down from the 1991 levels because of depressed prices, coupled with shortages of raw materials and closures because of environmental concerns, exports are still likely to be high by historical standards. They will therefore continue to act as a depressive influence on prices,' says Mr Robin Bhar, consultant to Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, part of the Banque Indosuez Group. Aluminium and nickel will be hit particularly badly because exports of these from the Commonwealth of Independent States and the former eastern Europe have a bigger impact on western supply-demand balances than other metal exports. On the positive side of the metals equation, Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group, points out that stock levels remain relatively low, at less than 10 weeks of consumption compared with 15 to 20 weeks at the end of past recessions. The exception is aluminium, because of the Russian exports. But all metal stocks are likely to shrink quickly when demand picks up, he suggests - and prices go up as stocks go down. LME traders meanwhile hope that the recent upsurge in business is not another false dawn. One said: 'We've been staggering along for 18 months on wafer-thin margins and low prices. Now business has at least doubled. But will it hold?' Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, is hopeful. He says: 'On the LME genuine trade business from producers and consumers has risen. Brokers have increased their position-taking and there has been growing speculative interest from managed funds. There is a feeling that the metals cycle is on the turn.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- LME METAL PRICE CHANGES (US cents a lb)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                Price on      % change      Average for       % change                 June 30   since Jan 1    1st half 1992   on 1991 ave.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Aluminium            59         +15.5             57.7           -5.2 Copper            110.5         +12.3            100.5           -2.2 Nickel            338.3          +3.9              338           -8.9 Zinc               61.7         +16.4             57.2          +12.1 Lead               27.7         +12.5             23.8           -4.8 Tin               322.7         +28.1              267           +5.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

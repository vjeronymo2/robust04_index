			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Tatjana Lenard: "A Plot Against the Serbs"] </F>   [Text] The latest Muslim offensive against the Srpska  republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina has shown the real character of  the Muslim-Croatian marriage. Just as the Serbs predicted, the  Muslim-Croatian coalition was not made for peace, but for a new  war.    After the Muslims in Bosnia realized that they would not be  able to reach their territorial aspirations -- which even the  United States considers too lofty -- at the negotiating table,  they turned to the gods of war. They think that they have more  chances for success now. According to Serbian military sources,  Muslim troops are getting weapons and equipment through various  humanitarian operations. The NATO ultimatum and the loosening  of the Serbian military ring around Sarajevo have enabled Alija  Izetbegovic to transfer tens of thousands of soldiers from  Sarajevo to other fronts, from where they are now attacking  Serbian positions.    Apart from that, since the Washington agreement was signed,  nobody asks what Croatian Army troops are doing in Bosnia  anymore. Through the alliance with the Muslims under the SDA  [Party of Democratic Action] patronage, Croatia -- against which  sanctions should have been introduced on Muslim request because  of the presence of over 50,000 soldiers in Bosnia -- has become  a legal participant in the war since it is now defending the  borders of the future confederation.    It is becoming clear now why Franjo Tudjman, the Croatian  president, accepted this absurd union with the Bosnian Muslims,  which will neither enable him to reestablish the Independent  State of Croatia nor to prevent the creation of an Islamic state  in the heart of Europe. On the contrary, owing to demography  and to the huge capital Muslim countries have, it can be assumed  that a strong Muslim state, in which Croatian children would  have to learn the Koran, could reach the Adriatic Sea. It is  obvious that the Croatian president was not only attracted by  the promises about NATO and European Union membership for his  country and by the return of Krajina to Croatian jurisdiction.  He was far more attracted by the legal nature of  Muslim-Croatian military actions that should bring new  territories to both Muslims and Croats -- which they would share  and then part. The Muslim-Croatian confederation is probably  only a temporary marriage of convenience. This assumption is  also supported by the meeting announced for the 5 April in  Ankara between the Bosnian Muslims and Croats and the Turkish  military leadership.    The leading peacemakers, the United States and the European  Union, are passively observing all this, and it is not excluded  that they might help their friends by a NATO action against the  Serbs under the pretext that they are protecting the UN  Protection Forces [UNPROFOR]. Judging by the UN Security  Council resolution on the extension of the UNPROFOR mandate,  such a recipe can also be applied to Krajina now.    It has been once again proven that the U.S. peacemaking  efforts are nothing else but favoring of the Serbian enemies, or  -- as Mrs. Albright, the U.S. ambassador to the UN, stated in  Sarajevo -- it is yet another proof that the United States is a  real friend of the Muslims. Under these conditions, it can  hardly be expected that the Serbian side will accept the unequal  treatment, the politics of accomplished facts in negotiations,  and blackmail in connection with the removal of the sanctions.  The United States should finally realize that its political  and, as they are announcing, military presence is not enough to  resolve the situation in Bosnia.    Without the real wish to achieve peace and an active  participation of the Serbian side under equal conditions,  without political, economic and military blackmail, the peace in  the former Yugoslavia will not have a real chance.</p>

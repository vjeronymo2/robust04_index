			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / OFT says stock exchange price secrecy uncompetitive London Stock Exchange rules which allow the prices of large blocks of shares to be kept secret for up to five days are anti-competitive, the Office of Fair Trading said yesterday. The exchange declined to comment on the criticism, except to say it is studying the OFT's report on competitiveness in share-dealing. However, it is understood that the exchange will shortly approve changes to its rules. These will limit the time during which trades can be kept hidden and force immediate disclosure of some large trades which are now concealed. Until now, the Stock Exchange and its large, market-making members, have argued that publishing each large trade immediately means that competitors can respond by instantly lowering the price they will offer for the same shares. This practice, they say, led to swingeing losses for market makers in the late 1980s when immediate post-trade transparency was required. The OFT report comes as the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, is also asking whether current trading rules are fair to investors. Regulators, including the Treasury, are concerned that London's standing as a centre for international share trading could be damaged. The SIB is expected to deliver its review early next year. Submitting the report to the Treasury, Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of the OFT, referred to the SIB review. He said he was bringing the OFT report to public attention now 'in part in order to inform that process'. 'In deciding whether to direct the exchange to amend its rules, you may therefore wish to consider the implications of my report for SIB's continuing work,' Sir Bryan said. The Stock Exchange's markets committee will meet today to consider the report. The exchange is expected to alter the current rules to cut the time some large trades are kept secret to 60 minutes from 90 minutes. In addition, trades which may in future be hidden will have to be at least five times Normal Market Size - the average size of each transaction in that share for the previous 12 months. This is an increase from the current threshold of three times NMS. Rules on trade publication only apply to market makers - securities firms which agree to buy and sell large blocks of shares through all market conditions. The OFT report maintained that allowing the trades to be hidden meant that some market makers had an advantage over others. As a result of the uncertainty, the 'spread' between the price they offer to buy and sell the same shares is widened, thus potentially disadvantaging investors. Details, Page 8</p>

			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Discrepancies in audit fees reported THE AUDIT fees paid by quoted companies over the last year were substantially higher than those paid by private companies, a survey has found. In companies with turnover of between Pounds 1bn and Pounds 3bn there was no difference in fees between public companies and private companies, but in companies with turnover of less than Pounds 1bn fees for quoted companies were much higher. The analysis is based on the audit fees disclosed in the latest sets of accounts of a sample of 4,000 private companies and more than 200 public companies by JDH Consultants, a Glasgow-based organisation. The average audit fee for quoted companies with a turnover of about Pounds 1m was Pounds 9,000, three times the level for private companies. For those with turnovers of Pounds 10m, the fees were twice those of private companies at Pounds 22,000 and for those with turnovers of Pounds 100m, fees were three times the level at Pounds 150,000. For public companies with turnover of around Pounds 1bn, fees were Pounds 650,000 against Pounds 470,000 for private companies. Auditors claim that it is impossible to make comparisons of audit fees based simply on turnover because so many other factors determine the fee. However, the study shows a consistent connection between size and fees, and a clear differentiation between public and private companies. The survey highlights that there are also wide variations in audit fees charged by private companies by industrial sector. For companies with sales of around Pounds 100m, fees were greatest in printing and publishing, mechanical engineering and textiles, and lowest for the wholesale and retail trade and food and drink manufacturers. It also shows the dominance of auditing even in small companies by the larger accountancy firms. Although there were 1,674 different auditing firms for the 4,000 private companies, 29 per cent by number and 58 per cent by fee were controlled by just 12 firms. Two Midlands accountancy firms are merging to become a regional firm with 16 partners and fee income of about Pounds 6m. Cooper-Parry, Watson, Sowter &amp; Co, based in Derby, and Prior &amp; Palmer of Nottingham will become Cooper-Parry, Prior &amp; Palmer. Report of Audit Fees of UK Private Limited Companies.

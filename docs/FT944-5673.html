			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Thermal imaging in civilian role Military research into uncooled thermal imaging is set to be transferred into civilian applications, according to an agreement this week by GEC-Marconi and the Defence Research Agency. Until recently, thermal imaging equipment, which is used to create pictures from the heat radiated by objects, needed to be cooled to very low temperatures of minus 200`C. However, GEC-Marconi and the DRA have developed a detector capable of operating at room temperature, which is cheap enough for civilian use. Applications being explored include cameras to help the rescue services work in poor weather conditions. GEC-Marconi Avionics: UK, tel 0268 522822; fax 0268 883140.</p>

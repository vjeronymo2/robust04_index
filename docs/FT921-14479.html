			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Community bankers hold talks on setting up EMI EUROPEAN Community central bank governors yesterday discussed setting up the European Monetary Institute, the proposed forerunner of a European central bank. Its establishment as an advisory body on monetary union was agreed at the Maastricht summit last month. The plan is to have it begin operation in January, 1994. Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, said after EC central bank governors' monthly meeting at the Bank for International Settlements that the organisational structure of the EMI, staff numbers and the question of whether employees would be seconded from national central banks or would be on the EMI payroll needed to be resolved. Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, Danish central bank chief, said that they also need to define how the EMI would relate with the national central banks.</p>

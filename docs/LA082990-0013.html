			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCREEN STYLE: WILD AND WEIRD WEAR  </P> <P> THE FILM: "Wild at Heart"  </P> <P> THE SET UP: David Lynch, director of television's quirky "Twin Peaks,"  showcases another of his own strange visions. The plot stays simple: Sailor and  Lula (Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern, pictured) hit the road after her mom, who's  not crazy about him, takes a contract out on his life. In their travels they  meet up with a wild assortment of oddball personalities and purely absurd  situations. The world according to Lula is, "wild at heart and weird on top."  And it's rated R.  </P> <P> THE LOOK: Patricia Norris, who served as costumer and production designer on  the film, says that from Day One she realized the clothes would have to be a  bit bizarre. They're not "real clothes, as in things you would actually wear,"  she says. "There's something about this film that's beyond your sense of  reality." Sailor's best outfit is a sublime and strange mix: black shirt over  black jeans and one of the loudest-color snake-skin jackets this side of a  Motley Crue video. "It's somewhere between cool and annoying," Norris says.  Lula's look favors underwear-as-outerwear, her basic uniform being a sheer  lingerie teddy over tights and cowboy boots. "The underwear is just fun,"  Norris says. "She dresses the way you'd never look around mommy."  </P> <P> THE STORES: Wardrobe is minimal here, since both romantic leads wear only what  they tossed in the car before they left town. "It's sort of a capsule  wardrobe," says Norris. Lula's trademark lingerie was picked up at Trashy  Lingerie on La Cienega. Avoiding labels and well-known stores Norris, found  Sailor's wardrobe in what seems a likely spot -- Nicolas Cage's closet.  "Nicolas brought in the jacket," Norris says. "I saw it and realized that  jacket was going to guide my life. I made up three of them in a more obnoxious  shade of orange." The snakeskin blazer carries thematic as well as visual  punch. Twice in the film we hear Sailor state, "This here jacket's a symbol of  my individuality and belief in personal freedom." Words to live -- and dress --  by. DARIO SCARDAPANE  </P></p>

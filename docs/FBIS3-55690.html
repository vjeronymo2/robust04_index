			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement to the press issued by President Algirdas </F> Brazauskas -- read by announcer]    [Text] Having recently declared a wish to join NATO,  Lithuania is observing the NATO summit in Brussels with great  interest.    I welcome the invitation to participate in the program  called  Partnership for Peace which was presented this morning by the  heads of the NATO states and partners in cooperation. This is  the road for Lithuania for complete integration into NATO  political and military structures.    Lithuania looks positively at the efforts made by NATO to  respond to the changes in Europe and in the world and to ensure  a stable entrance into the 21st century.    I believe that the document defining the nature of  partnership signed by Lithuania and NATO will be a consistent  supplement to the efforts made by Lithuania to set up a  democratically controlled military force and relevant relations  between military and civilian institutions.    I have entrusted the government and the leaders of relevant  ministries to take the necessary steps and get ready to sign the  document on partnership, to assess the supplies, the resources,  and the forces, and to prepare a program of measures through the  implementation of which all the common objectives of partnership  will be achieved.</p>

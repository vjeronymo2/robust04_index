			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Ofwat meter study may inflame water debate NEARLY one household in 10 with a water meter as difficulty in coping with water bills, according to a study published yesterday by Ofwat, the water industry watchdog. The findings are likely to inflame debate over the benefits of water metering. The report into the social impact of water metering also finds that 41 per cent of homes fitted with a water meter make no effort to curb their consumption. Ofwat, together with the Department of the Environment, has thrown its support behind wider household metering to help cut demand for water in regions suffering a shortage. However, consumer groups have protested that poor families would pay more. Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat's director general, pointed out that 91 per cent of those surveyed had no difficulty in affording their metered water bills. He said: 'Overall, the trials do not appear to have caused difficulties for many customers and this is encouraging.' Advocates of metering will also get support from Ofwat's finding that 35 per cent of households used less water under metering. Nevertheless, the National Consumer Council said the results bolstered its opposition to meters. Ms Wendy Toms, of the council, said:'It is clear from this survey that if people can afford to pay bills generally then they are not going to save water. The hardship of saving water will fall most on the poorest people.' The survey was based on more than 6,000 homes in England and Wales where meters have been fitted on a trial basis. Only 3 per cent of the 21m homes in England and Wales now have a water meter, but the report notes that the areas hosting the trials 'are generally more affluent than Great Britain as a whole'. Ofwat said that within the 8.3 per cent of metered homes having trouble in paying metered water bills, most were low-income households where there was a struggle to pay other bills. On further interviewing, it found that 'the majority of this group worried a lot about their water bills and in some cases this had contributed to family tension and argument'.</p>

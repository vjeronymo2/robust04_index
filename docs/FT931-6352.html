			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Arts: Dmitri Hvorostovsky - Recital The noisy enthusiasm which greeted this recital suggests that Dmitri Hvorostovsky is well on his way to becoming a fully-fledged matinee idol. With arms outstretched and head held high, a smile of audacious pride allowed to creep across his face as he polishes off another song to his own satisfaction, Hvorostovsky is clearly practised at how to play the part. For the young Russian baritone who rocketed into public awareness when he won the BBC Cardiff Singer of the World competition in 1989 fame was won quickly. He has, however, worked in earnest to further his standing. His matinee recital at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Sunday was no mere after-lunch selection of favourite titbits from the celebrity singer's sweet-trolley. This was a serious programme of Russian song at its most demanding. The first half was all Tchaikovsky. By chance the audience included the Russian mezzo Olga Borodina (in London to sing Berlioz's La Damnation de Faust at the Royal Opera) whose Tchaikovsky recital at the Edinburgh Festival last year was so unforgettable. Comparisons are difficult to resist: if Borodina was the more determined to get to the heart of each song, Hvorostovsky was also musically eloquent, dramatically varied. Occasionally there were odd phrases in these songs where the baritone's instrumental shaping of the vocal line recalled old recordings of bel canto singers of the past. But when he sings out, especially at the top, the voice does not grow in size and brilliance as one might expect. The top notes at the end of 'Be it day that reigns', with the singer proudly inviting applause and Mikhail Arkadiev thunderously coming close to drowning him at the piano, suggested both of them thought that he was making more noise than he really was. The pleasure of the recital came not in the thrill of hearing a fine voice in full flood, as Hvorostovsky might suppose, but in the beauty of so much of the singing, its malleability, its sensitivity to colour. Of the Tchaikovsky songs, 'Amid the din of the ball' stood out for its conversational intimacy and 'On yellow cornfields', a marvellous song, for its feeling of intensity with room to spare. Musorgsky's Songs and Dances of Death were not monochrome sepulchral black, as they were with Christoff and Nesterenko, but subtly contrasted studies of Russian gloom. Encores included a pair of arie antiche and Bellini's I Puritani, suavely sung, the breath control as remarkable as ever. By that point it was no doubt a sensible idea to vary the programme, but it is Hvorostovsky's accomplishment as an imaginative and serious interpreter of Russian song that will stay in the memory. Now that so many young Russian singers are coming forward who fully have the measure of this repertoire, there is no excuse for audiences in the West to ignore it.</p>

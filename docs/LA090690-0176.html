			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: JOEY'S BAR-B-Q GIVES DINERS A GOOD RIBBING  </P> <P> Ever since Adam lost his, mankind has been searching for the perfect rib.  </P> <P> Although carnivorous perfection may never be achieved in this world, Joey's  Bar-B-Q is definitely a serious contender.  </P> <P> In short, this place is rib heaven.  </P> <P> While there are several dishes on the menu worthy of mention, the ribs are the  hero at this country-style restaurant.  </P> <P> Served dripping in a sweet, tangy barbecue sauce, the meat, whether it be pork  baby back or the larger beef ribs, is so tender it almost falls off the bone  and melts in your mouth.  </P> <P> The various rib platters, moderately priced at $8.95 to $13.95, are laden with  enough meat to satisfy anyone.  </P> <P> And the story could end here -- except for the rest of the menu.  </P> <P> The country sausage ($8.95) is made on the premises. The long, thick links are  not too spicy, are extremely lean and very tasty.  </P> <P> The barbecue chicken ($7.95) and ham ($8.95) dinners come in large portions.  All plates come with either a baked potato, baked yam with marshmallows, french  fries or veg-a-bob and a choice of baked beans or corn on the cob.  </P> <P> The dinner menu also features steaks ranging in price from $10.95 for a top  sirloin to $14.95 for a filet mignon.  </P> <P> For those who can't seem to make up their minds, Joey's also offers a huge  plate called The Works ($11.95), which includes ham, sliced beef, chicken, beef  ribs and a slice of the country sausage.  </P> <P> The lunch menu holds a variety of sandwiches, including a barbecue pork  sandwich served on a fresh roll stuffed with thick yet tender slices of pork. A  variety of domestic and imported beers and house wines are available.  </P> <P> Country-Western is the main theme of Joey's Bar-B-Q, from the wooden plank  floors and weathered wagon decorating the restaurant to the down-home country  singers featured six nights a week. Monday is Joey's day of rest.  </P> <P>  Joey's Bar-B-Q, 1339 N. East St., Anaheim. Open Tuesday through Thursday, 11  a.m. to 9 p.m.; Friday, 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Saturday, 4 p.m. to 10 p.m., and  Sunday, 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. (714) 991-9040. JAMES M. GOMEZ  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, May 13 (MTI) -- Hungary's National Police  Command (NPC) dismissed as completely groundless the article in  Friday's issue of the Belgian LE SOIR about a coup being plotted  for the second round of Hungarian elections. LE SOIR said,  quoting well-informed sources, that during an attempt to thwart  the sale of 30kg of false gold, Belgian security forces  discovered documents allegedly referring to plans of purchasing  weapons for use in a "coup attempt" at run-off elections on May  29.    The Belgian newspaper has not yet provided concrete details  or evidence confirming the news. Police will do their utmost to  prevent the second round of parliamentary elections from being  disturbed by any unexpected events, the NPC said.</p>

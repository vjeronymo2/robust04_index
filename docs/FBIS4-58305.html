			<p>BFN     [Text] Khartoum, 30 April (SUNA) -- The president of the  Republic of Sudan, Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir, has  called on the inhabitants of the Nubah Mountains, who fled and  sought refuge in Khartoum and other parts of Sudan, to return to  their villages and areas in south Kordofan, since the government  has expelled the rebels and made the area secure.    President al-Bashir announced the government's commitment to  transport and settle them in their areas, and to support them  with agricultural equipment, seeds, and everything necessary for  their agricultural activities. He said that the government will  remain committed to providing them with food until their harvest  is ready. He also announced that the government will extend  health services, increase the supply of medicine, open schools,  and provide teachers to the villages of those who return.  President al-Bashir called on the citizens of the Nubah  Mountains to rebuild their places of worship, in all their  different denominations.    The president had earlier addressed tens of thousands of the  inhabitants of the Nubah Mountains. They had gathered at the  al- Hilal Stadium in Omdurman to express their support for and  allegiance to President al-Bashir and his government for  granting them a state of their own, within the framework of the  federal system announced in Sudan.    Their new state is called South Kordofan, and like all the  other newly established Sudanese states, it has a governor, a  ministerial council for the administration of executive duties,  and a mini- parliament to keep watch on the government and its  performance, and to enforce the necessary laws.    The inhabitants of the Nubah Mountains, in their speech made  at the meeting, paid tribute to the government of the national  salvation. They declared their support for the revolution and  its orientation, and said that they will reconstruct their areas  and make them peaceful and productive. They also declared  support for peace and the government's endeavors to establish  peace. The Nubah Mountains were part of the state of Kordofan,  which was subdivided into three states within the federal  government framework: South Kordofan, which covers all the areas  of the Nubah Mountains, North Kordofan, and West Kordofan.</p>

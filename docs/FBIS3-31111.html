[passage omitted]    The UNPROFOR spokesman in Sarajevo, Lieutenant-Colonel Bill  Aikman, said they were interpreting the term "control" in a  broad sense.    "Troops do not have to stand beside each gun. But certainly  we have a clear indication of where they are (...) whether  they've been used (and) moved. Those are the sorts of ways of  controlling them," he told journalists on Monday. [passage  omitted]    An important meeting of Serb and Bosnian army chiefs, called  by UNPROFOR, was expected to take place at Sarajevo airport on  Tuesday morning.</p>

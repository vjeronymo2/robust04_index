			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow declines despite good economic data Wall Street ENCOURAGING economic news was not enough to prevent US equities from drifting lower for a second consecutive day, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 6.76 lower at 3,233.03. Big board volume was less than 194m shares, and advancing shares led declining by 918 to 838. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 mirrored the Dow's slight decline, easing 0.44 to 422.43 but the American SE composite edged 0.46 higher to 389.69 and the Nasdaq composite rose 2.79 to 637.16 in late trading. Stocks prices had been expected to advance following the release of better-than-expected retail sales and signs that inflation remained moderate in October. Retail sales rose 0.9 per cent in October, above the 0.6 per cent most analysts had expected. At the same time, the consumer price index rose 0.4 per cent, or 0.5 per cent stripping out the volatile food and energy elements. Although consumer prices were somewhat higher than expected, the increase was not enough to provoke fears of inflation. Humana tumbled Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 20 amid rumours that the hospital group may be heading towards a leveraged buy-out following news that Humana was eliminating its future dividend. General Motors, in the midst of a massive restructuring of its loss-making North American vehicle operations, was one of the most active NYSE stocks for a second day, adding Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 31 1/8 . On Thursday, the auto maker told analysts it is aiming to break even in 1993, before interest and taxes. For the first nine months of this year, GM lost Dollars 3bn before interest and taxes in North America compared with a Dollars 6.1bn deficit a year earlier. Among the other big US auto makers, shares in Chrysler slid Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 27 5/8 and Ford held steady at Dollars 39. The Gap added Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 34 1/2 , on top of its Dollars 2 3/8 gain on Thursday, although the highly-regarded specialty store group saw third-quarter pre-tax earnings slide to Dollars 62m from Dollars 70.8m a year earlier. Shares in Tele-Communications led Nasdaq trading following the release of third-quarter results late Thursday. The issue gained Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 19 1/8 after the company unveiled net income of 6 cents a share compared with a deficit of 7 cents a year earlier. Michael Foods was one of the biggest winners of morning trading following a ruling that a competing egg product infringes patents licensed to Michael Foods, although parts of the patent dispute remain unsettled. Shares in the company soared Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 11 7/8 but remained well below their 52-week high of Dollars 20 1/2 . In contrast, Holson Burnes plunged Dollars 5 1/2 to a 52-week low of Dollars 6 3/4 after the company, which makes and distributes photograph albums, said its 1992 earnings from continuing operations would be substantially below expectations. Canada TORONTO share prices ended weaker, leaving the market with a loss of 41 points for the week. The TSE 300 fell 14.25 points, or 0.43 per cent, to 3,269.53, with declining issues edging out advances 290 to 287. Volume was 49.257m shares worth CDollars 467.5m.</p>

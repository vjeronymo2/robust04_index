			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FALLING METAL BEAM MAY HAVE DAMAGED SPACE SHUTTLE ATLANTIS  </P> <P> The space shuttle Atlantis may have been damaged when a 70-pound metal beam  mistakenly left in the craft's engine room fell as the orbiter was being  hoisted into the launch position, sources said today.  </P> <P> With the shuttle Discovery on track for blastoff Saturday, Atlantis is  scheduled for launch around Nov. 7 to ferry a military satellite into orbit.  </P> <P> The $2-billion space plane was moved from its hangar to the Vehicle Assembly  Building earlier this week for attachment to a pair of solid-fuel boosters and  an external fuel tank before rollout to launch pad 39A next week.  </P> <P> A massive yellow sling was attached to Atlantis on Wednesday and two powerful  overhead cranes picked the shuttle up and then rotated it into a vertical  position so it could be bolted to its tank and boosters.  </P> <P> But as the nose of the shuttle rose, engineers heard at least three distinct  thuds apparently coming from inside Atlantis' engine compartment, according to  the sources.  </P> <P> When engineers were able to gain access to the shuttle's engine room, they  found a yellow, nine-foot, 70-pound I-beam resting near the floor of the  cramped compartment.  </P> <P> The metal beam, apparently left inside the engine room by mistake, fell through  the compartment as Atlantis was rotated into vertical position.  </P></p>

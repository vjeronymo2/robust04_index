			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Bucking the trend Concerted intervention by central banks means industrial countries know they have a problem with the dollar. It does not mean they know how to solve it. Yesterday's effort pulled the dollar a little further back from the Y100 threshold, and was slightly more successful against the D-Mark. It is hard to see how the effect can last, however, without some accompanying policy measures. The combination of a current account surplus and capital inflow into Japan and a current account deficit and capital outflow out of the US is a formidable force driving the dollar down. Intervention on its own is unlikely to work for long without at least some supporting movement on interest rates. Perhaps the Bundesbank will use the opportunity to accelerate German rate cuts, though this looks less plausible as signs of economic recovery proliferate. Japan could cut short term rates still further, though that might simply encourage more foreign capital to flow into its equity market. That leaves the US. There must be a strong chance that the Federal Reserve will bring forward its next tightening and raise its discount rate. In the short run, that would be awkward for the bond market, which is ironic since worries about the diminishing attraction of Treasury bonds to foreigners is one reason why the US is anxious to see the dollar stabilise. The nagging worry is that this may only be possible at the price of interest rates higher than the markets have yet factored in. The risk is that the US recovery will be stifled while that in Europe is still barely off the ground.</p>

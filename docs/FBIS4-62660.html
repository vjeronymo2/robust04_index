			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe 17 May TASS -- A powerful missile attack  was launched today on the 11th post of the Moskovskiy  borderguard unit, guarding the Tajik-Afghan border. The attack,  launched both from the territory of Afghanistan, controlled by  General Kozi Kobir's 55th Afghan Infantry Division, and from  mojaheed positions in the rear of the Russian borderguards,  lasted from 0800 to 1100. The enemy gun emplacements were  smashed by Russian retaliatory blows. There were no casualties  among Russian servicemen. The losses of the Tajik opposition  have not been reported, ITAR-TASS learned today from military  sources in Dushanbe.    It was stressed in this connection that the irreconcilable  Tajik opposition, entrenched in the northern provinces of  Afghanistan, became active again from 15-17 May. Several of its  attempts to break through the positions of the Moskovskiy and  Pyanj borderguard detachments were thwarted. The redeployment  of armed groups of militants, supporting the Islam movement for  the revival of Tajikistan, from the Hunduz and Tahor provinces  of Afghanistan to the Afghan part of Badakhshan is continuing.  Some of the armed groups are being massed opposite the  Shuroabad sector of the Tajik-Afghan border, near the positions  of the Moskovskiy borderguard unit, and the others -- in the  immediate proximity of the Pamir sector of the border.    According to a trustworthy military source in Dushanbe, the  purpose of these redeployments is to break through into  districts, bordering on the Gorno-Badakhshan autonomous region  of Tajikistan, in order to launch further operations against the  government forces of the Republc. The source said that all  these attempts were futile. The Russian borderguards and the  national defence forces of the republic have taken additional  effctive measures to strengthen the Tajik-Afghan border and the  highland areas of the Republic adjoining it.</p>

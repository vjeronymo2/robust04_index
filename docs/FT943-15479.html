			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / International Company News: Gantry drops out of Bridge Oil race The hard-fought bid battle for Bridge Oil, the Sydney-based oil and gas group, appeared to be over last night, after Gantry, one of the two rival suitors, dropped out of the race. Gantry - which was the bid vehicle for Enron, the US natural gas company, and the California Public Employees Retirement System, one of the largest state pension funds - said it would not proceed with an offer. This leaves the way clear for Parker &amp; Parsley, the Texan oil independent, to go ahead with its 90-cents-a-share cash bid. Gantry said P&amp;P's public statement that it would not accept a 95-cents-a-share offer for its 21 per cent holding in Bridge, meant that Gantry had no hope of reaching its 90 per cent minimum acceptance level. 'Thus, we have decided not to proceed with this transaction,' it said. Gantry had bought Bridge shares in the market on Thursday at prices up to 95 cents, boosting the target company's share price. However, during yesterday's trading, Bridge shares eased to 91 cents. Gantry's announcement came after the market closed. Santos, the South Australian oil and gas company, is buying a 32.802 per cent interest in the Anglia gas field in the North Sea from Conoco, the oil and gas subsidiary of Dupont in the US. Santos said the deal, which is still subject to regulatory and joint venture approval, had been under negotiation for some time, and would be backdated to January 1, 1994. The company declined to disclose its price 'due to confidentiality provisions'. The deal will boost Santos' budgeted gas production this calendar year by 5.3 per cent, and add 1.15m barrels of oil equivalent to the group's 1994 production. Proven gas reserves at the purchase date were put at more than 50bn cubic feet. Santos said its share of gas production from the Anglia field, which started producing in late-1991, had been sold forward under a 'life of field' contract to Total Gas Marketing. The other joint venture partners in Anglia are Ranger Oil and Amerada Hess. Although this is Santos' first investment in the North Sea, the company said it would consider further acquisitions there.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Qin Shaoxiang (4440 1421 4161): "The Old </F> Structure Cannot Drive the `High Speed Vehicle' -- Noted  Economist Professor Liu Guoguang Discusses Reform and  Development"]    [Text] To solve the problem of deep conflicts in  China's current economic life, we must perfect and strengthen  macroeconomic regulation and control and carry out comprehensive  in depth reforms. In a society with rapid economic growth and  tight economic relationships, we must enhance the strength of  reform. We must not cease development to work on reform. Without  effective macroeconomic regulation and control, there will not  be a mature market economy.    Since the latter half of last year, the Chinese economy has  exhibited the "three high" phenomena -- a high economic growth  rate, high investment growth rate, and high commodity price  increase rate. In light of the conflicts and problems occuring  in China's economic life, the central government assessed the  situation and made some timely policy decisions on macroeconomic  regulation and control. How are the prospects and effectiveness  of the strengthened macroeconomic regulations and controls? How  should the current and future conflicts and problems in China's  economic life be resolved? With these questions in mind, this  reporter visited famous economist and National People's Congress  Member Professor Liu Guoguang in October.  <H3>  The Prospects for Macroeconomic Regulation and Control Look  Good; Inflation Warrants Alarm </H3>   Liu Guoguang believes that the series of macroeconomic  regulations and controls adopted by the central government to  resolve previously existing and newly occuring problems in  China's economic life will soon show results. The excessively  high production rate fell for three straight months in July,  August, and September. In September, it fell to 19.1 percent.  The market peaks are tending towards stabilization, the finance  situation has improved, and the rate of funding available for  major construction has increased from 19 percent at the end of  June to 70 percent. There have been no "IOUs" issued for the  purchase of farm products, personal savings have increased  again, the revenue growth rate has risen, and exports have  grown. These achievements have gradually alleviated some  people's anxieties. A growing number of people have come to  understand that macroeconomic regulation and control is not  overall retrenchment but the reality of structural readjustment.    This set of macroeconomic regulations and controls has been  called a "soft attack." It mainly uses economic methods to scale  back in a planned way the excessive investment which overloaded  the national ability, as well as to rectify the chaotic finance  order, suppress serious inflation, and resolve the conflicts and  problems of the process of rapid economic growth. It does this  while avoiding the great economic losses of applying "emergency  brakes." Liu Guoguang feels that the establishment of a  socialist market economy requires effective macroeconomic  regulation and control. Becoming a market economy does not mean  a completely free, laissez-faire approach. Without effective  macroeconomic regulation and control, there cannot be a mature  market economy. He said that even in a normal market economy,  the government has to intervene in markets which have  deficiencies. This is even more true for China during a period  of structural transition, when some unpredictable problems will  undoubtedly occur. It appears that there are many vacuums during  this process of transition, and these would not exist during the  original accumulation phase in the early development of market  economies. At that time, the problems of a planned economy  making a transition to a market economy did not exist. If a  laissez-faire approach were used now, allowing the market to  function spontaneously, the problems would be even more severe.  Liu Guoguang said the main purpose of macroeconomic regulation  and control is to use economic methods to solve the conflicts  and problems in the process of rapid economic growth and thus  create an atmosphere conducive to reform.    Many people still have doubts about whether macroeconomic  regulation and control will work and whether the "soft attack"  will succeed. Liu Guoguang's view on the prospects for  macroeconomic regulation and control is that the first  possibility is that the various measures of macroeconomic  regulation and control will work quickly and be manipulated with  an appropriate degree of tightness and suitable timing. Thus,  the economy would be able to maintain a certain vitality and  appropriate growth rate but also avoid the serious consequences  of exacerbated inflation. In this way, the annual GNP growth  rate for this year would reach 13 to 13.5 percent and next  year's GNP growth rate would fall to about 10 percent. Inflation  would be kept below two figures. The second possibility is that  fear of excessively rapid commodity price increases will cause  continued retrenchment, resulting in economic shrinkage and the  prevention of economic restructuring. This would make it  impossible to implement several major reform measures due to a  restrictive environment. The third possibility is that excessive  relaxation in confused reaction to the finance shortfall will  result in the premature abandonment of macroeconomic regulations  and controls which were just begining to be effective and thus  cause even more severe economic overheating and inflation. Liu  Guoguang emphasized that the latter two scenarios must be  avoided. He said this set of macroeconomic regulation and  control measures can achieve the first scenario predicted  because the problems were recognized early and the measures  adopted were effective and timely. In looking at the current  situation, however, the progress on inflation may regress due to  the need to maintain a certain economic growth rate in support  of production.    Liu Guoguang predicts that if there are no sudden  developments, there will not be a repeat of 1988's panic buying  sprees, but the danger of inflation cannot be ignored. He said  that the retail price index last year rose 5.4 percent but in 35  large and middle-sized cities it rose 10.9 percent. The increase  in currency circulation this year pushed prices higher. The June  retail price index in 35 large and middle-sized cities rose more  than 20 percent. The accumulated inflationary pressure over the  past few years has begun to take effect. Experience proves that  when measures are not taken to curtail inflation over two  digits, the inflation will be exacerbated. When it is over 10  percent, all groups in society will take steps to protect  themselves. Macroeconomic regulation and control is an art. If  it is done well, there is a certain pace and relatively stable  inflation. He said that as long as the real income growth rate  of fixed income earners is greater than the rate of inflation,  and actual savings interests rates are appropriate, it will  guarantee that labor accumulation will not be reduced to naught  after inflation. Under these conditions, he would not oppose the  use of mild inflation to stimulate economic growth. Negative  interest rates, however, must not be used to support the  development of inefficient industries.    Liu Guoguang emphasized that during the structural  transition  period, effective macroeconomic regulation and control can  create an environment conducive to reform. But care must be  taken that the macroeconomic regulation and control uses reform  methods and economic techniques as much as possible.  Administrative techniques should not be used to intervene in  problems which can be solved with market mechanisms or indirect  control techniques. Practice has proven that the old structure  cannot carry out sustained rapid economic development and cannot  resolve the conflicts and problems which arise amidst rapid  movement. We must learn how to strengthen the potency of reform  in an environment with rapid economic development and tightly  stretched economic relationships. We cannot halt development in  order to carry out reform.  <H3>  Macroeconomic Regulation and Control Continues to Move  Forward; Strengthened Reform Is the Basic Approach </H3>   Liu Guoguang feels that the current progress made by  macroeconomic regulation and control still falls short of the  expectations of society and of the central government,  particularly in areas such as guaranteeing agricultural  production, raising peasant income, guaranteeing working capital  for efficient large and middle-sized enterprises, and  centralized funding guarantees for major basic construction  projects. These areas still need much work. In essence, one can  say that these conflicts and problems have arisen because the  defects of the old system have not yet been completely overcome  and the new system is still not completely formed. Therefore,  the way to resolve these conflicts and problems is to strengthen  reform and establish a socialist market economy structure.    He said that the market has moved towards reform during the  last ten years or so and, as we enter the 90's, the reforms have  changed in nature so that the task of reform is now to carry out  a comprehensive and basic transformation of the entire economic  structure to establish a socialist market economy structure.  Reform must be extensive in all areas of economic life at both  the macroeconomic and microeconomic levels. Therefore, to  resolve the deep underlying conflicts and problems in China's  current economic life and to perfect macroeconomic regulation  and control, we must not delay in pursuing a finance structure,  a tax revenue structure, a foreign trade and foreign currency  structure, an investment structure, a social guarantee system, a  public functionary system and other important reforms.    He said the main thrust of the finance structure reform is  to  strengthen the regulation and control function of the central  bank and to make the People's Bank of China into a true central  bank. A polcy-making bank must be established to carry out the  separation of policy finance and commercial finance, and  specialized banks should become true commercial banks. The  direction of the tax revenue structure reform is to promote a  divided tax system to rationalize the relative distribution  between the central government and local governments and reform  the distribution of profits between the state and state-owned  enterprises. The reform of the investment structure is to divide  construction projects into competitive commercial projects,  basic production projects and public service projects and also  to redetermine funding sources and change funding methods. It  should also promote a responsibility system for project managers  and reform the initiation and assessment procedures for  projects. The thrust of reform in foreign trade is to adopt  various measures to conform to GATT standards.    Liu Guoguang emphasized that reform is a complicated piece  of  systems engineering, and the reforms listed above cannot be  accomplished overnight. The attainment of many of the reform  goals is not a simple process. The specific implementation of  many reforms still requires much detailed research and the  identification of specific measures. The most difficult and the  most important aspects of establishing a new structure and  carrying out various reforms are the reform of state-owned  enterprises and the transformation of operation mechanisms. It  will be a long process. Enterprise reform still needs to go  through pilot project testing and gradual implementation. We  cannot promote a corporate system and implement a modern  enterprise system all at once. There are also many problems in  the process of corporatizing which will require research to  solve. Finally, Liu called for the immediate implementation of  the "Corporation Law" which stipulates the standards for  corporate norms and corporate behavior, to allow the reform of  state-owned enterprises to continue to progress. This will  provide an underlying foundation for the establishment of a  socialist market economic structure.</p>

			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Waigel welcomes pay restraint offer MR Theo Waigel, German finance minister, has welcomed the offer from the country's most powerful union to hold back pay rises for five years to no more than is required to maintain purchasing power. 'The longer we have to plan ahead the better for creating jobs and manoeuvring room for investment,' Mr Waigel told a Sunday newspaper. Mr Franz Steinkuhler, head of I G Metall, offered the pay pact under a solidarity accord designed to place financing of German unification on a sounder footing. But he insisted that the burdens of reunification should not just fall on wage earners. Mr Steinkuhler has reaffirmed the union's opposition to changing the constitution to make it more difficult to seek asylum in Germany. He said it was possible to prevent the widespread abuse of Germany's liberal asylum laws without changing the constitution. The German Social Democrats are divided on the issue and I G Metall's support for the status quo could make it even more difficult for SPD leaders to force change on a reluctant rank and file. But Mr Steinkuhler sees his union as an unofficial opposition. 'Governments come and go but the unions are always here. Governments, and oppositions, have to run after the opinion polls, but we can help shape opinion,' he said in an interview. He also expressed growing scepticism about the Maastricht treaty. The union supports the treaty, with reservations, but Mr Steinkuhler believes it would be unlikely to pass if there was a German referendum. He also said were growing doubts about the need for monetary union, some of which he shared. 'I'm not sure if it is a necessary precondition of economic union,' he said. Without a stronger social dimension he believed Maastricht would fail and that the social dimension had been 'nothing but promises'. Mr Waigel says he will leave himself time to find the best way to comply with a court ruling which has ordered the government to increase personal income tax allowances by 1996, Reuter adds from Bonn. 'We have time until January 1996 to find a truly comprehensive and workable solution,' Mr Waigel said yesterday. In a judgment that could force big changes in Germany's tax system, the Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe has ruled that the government had to give higher tax breaks to people on lower incomes. As the ruling made no refund provision, it is unlikely to have an impact on Germany's budget. But the court said that transitional arrangements would have to be made to ease the tax burden on the poor between 1993 and 1996.</p>

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / International Company News: Japan bails out credit group THE JAPANESE government is to provide Y19bn (Dollars 180.4m) to help restructure an Osaka credit co-operative. The move is another sign of official concern about deteriorating public confidence in some smaller financial institutions. Osaka Fumin Credit Co-operative, with an estimated Y55bn in non-performing loans, is to be absorbed by another credit co-operative in the region, Osaka Koyo. It is the first co-operative to receive assistance from the Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insures individual deposits for up to Y10m. The co-operatives are due to merge in November, and the Y55bn in problem loans will be transferred to the Osaka Society of Credit Co-operatives, which will buy them for Y35bn. Osaka Fumin was heavily-exposed to the property market and to the trading house-turned-speculator Itoman, which itself has been taken over by the Sumitomo group. The use of government funds, which the DIC said was necessary to 'maintain the soundness of the financial system', follows similar assistance to the ailing Kamaishi Shinkin Bank. The bank is to be liquidated later this year. It is understood that about 11 shinkin - small local banks - are receiving assistance from their central bank, Zenshinren. There has also been a rush of mergers among credit co-operatives, which are suffering from a lending hangover and an increase in company bankruptcies. The smaller financial institutions have faced increased competition from Japan's larger commercial banks, whose share of consumer credit has risen to 36.9 per cent in 1991 from 14.6 per cent in 1987. In an attempt to attract customers, some smaller institutions offered higher interest returns, increasing their costs. The pressure on small, regional institutions is particularly severe because of close ties to companies in their local area. This has tempted some to continue lending to these old clients even if their business prospects have deteriorated. With larger banks wary of taking on new branches, the government is having to bear an increasing amount of the bail-out burden.</p>

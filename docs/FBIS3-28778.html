"The U.S. has lately stiffened its attitude to seek numeral  targets in the talks, because the talks are reaching a crucial  point," said Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade  and industry, [MITI] after the day's ad hoc cabinet meeting.    Japan, for its part, remains opposed to introducing such  "numerical" targets to measure progress in opening Japan's  markets, he said.    "But I believe we cannot afford to cancel everything we have  discussed in the talks," Kumagai said, adding the two countries  should agree on whatever issues they could.    Areas for such partial agreement include simplifying Japan's  government procurement procedures and increasing private-level  cooperation programs in the respective automotive industries, he  suggested.    He also said the two countries have discussed in  working-level negotiations including in the final accord the  opinions of two sides about the numeral targets.    Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is scheduled to  leave Thursday for Washington to review progress in the  framework talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton on Friday.</p>

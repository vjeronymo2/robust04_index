This statement was made by Economy  Minister Ignacio de Posadas yesterday upon his return from Iran  where he headed a commercial mission.    De Posadas, who refrained from discussing domestic economic  policy, told television Channel 10 that Iranian authorities and  businessmen welcomed the initiative to resume the exchange of  products, such as meat, where Uruguay has lost its privileged  position in the Iranian market.    De Posadas explained: "There is interest in establishing a  payment mechanism to safeguard the two parties, which was one of  the important subjects discussed."    Regarding the products that may be of greater interest in  the  Iranian market, he mentioned rice, beef, milk by-products, and  textiles.</p>

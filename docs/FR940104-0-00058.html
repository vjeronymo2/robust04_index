			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With regard to the fish/shellfish ingestion scenario, one commenter maintained that the fish/shellfish ingestion scenario should have been performed on a site-specific basis ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA should have used parameters seen at individual sites), because not all sawmills are located on streams with commercial fisheries. The EPA chose the fish/shellfish ingestion scenario to be protective of the recreational fisher persons and the general population. The risk analysis was structured so that the hydrologic cataloguing unit (or watershed) was the basic unit of analysis to ensure that the contaminated sediment would be associated with a body of water large enough to support fish hatcheries and recreational fisher persons. When these assumptions were used in the fish/shellfish ingestion scenario using corrected values for dioxin found in formulation for PCDDs and PCDFs, the incremental risk to individuals with high-end exposures remains well below 1&times;10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> ^6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), one commenter asserted that the equation is overly conservative for estimating soil erosion from surface protection sites. This equation models the amount of soil which is dumped into a drainage area containing fish. For a more detailed description of the model, the reader is referred to background document of the proposed rule. The EPA believes that, although this may be a conservative approach, it is the best method currently available. It has been used to support other EPA rulemakings and guidance documents. The most notable example being the Assessment of Risks from Exposure of Humans, Terrestrial and Avian Wildlife, and Aquatic Life to Dioxins and Furans, from Disposal and Use of Sludge from Bleached Kraft and Sulfite Pulp and Paper Mills. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  Even using these conservative assumptions, the incremental risks from cross- contamination at these sites are not at a level of concern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Protection Agency, 1990.

EPA 560/5&hyph;90&hyph;13.

EPA disagrees and believes it is appropriate to consider the consumption rate of the entire population in estimating risk to the general population from this exposure pathway. However, an adjustment of 0.4 was made to the diet fraction to account for the fact that not all fish are contaminated. Thus, only some percentage of the population would be affected by the contaminated fish. As discussed in the Risk Assessment Background Document for the proposed rule, the 0.4 diet fraction was derived by estimating the percentage of rivers and streams (i.e., cataloguing units) that have at least one sawmill. A second adjustment was made in the calculation of population risk to account for the percentage of sawmills that operate surface protection processes (about 30% of the entire number of sawmills nationally). Population risk for the fish/shellfish ingestion scenario has been recalculated for the final rule using the corrected incremental storage yard soil TCDD-TEQ concentrations. The corrected estimate of incremental population risk from cross-contamination is three orders of magnitude lower than the risk originally stated in the proposed rule. The corrected number of cancer cases expected in 70 years is now 0.0002.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter asserted that the soil ingestion scenario was overly conservative because all of the soil consumption was attributed to contaminated storage yard soil and no consumption of ``indoor dust'' was considered. EPA considered only the consumption of storage yard soil in order to be protective of human health. The range of soil ingestion rates for average children aged 1 through 6 is presented in the EPA's Exposure Factors Handbook (1990) as 0.2 to 0.8 grams per day. These estimated values were determined from the clay content of fecal samples taken from children in this age group and thus represent consumption of soil. However, the percent of this consumption that is attributed to house dust is unknown, as is the contaminant concentration in the house dust. The EPA has recalculated the soil ingestion scenario using the corrected incremental TCDD-TEQ concentrations obtained from the formulation sample. The incremental risk estimated is below 1E&hyph;6, using the conservative assumptions. The Agency's risk levels are particularly protective with the use of these conservative assumptions, thereby further lending support to the Agency's decision not to list these wastes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BARKLEY POWERS 76ERS PAST PISTONS, 106-99  </P> <P> Charles Barkley is having the kind of season most valuable players have.  </P> <P> The forward for the Philadelphia 76ers has been leading the NBA in scoring most  of the season and has been near the top in shooting percentage and among the  leaders in rebounding.  </P> <P> He has been instrumental in the 76ers getting off to a better start than they  did last season. Although the Detroit Pistons double and triple-teamed him  Saturday night at Philadelphia, Barkley scored 22 points and had 12 rebounds in  a 106-99 victory that gave the 76ers an 18-8 record. Last season, they won only  14 of their first 26 games.  </P> <P> After losing seven of eight, the Pistons had won two in a row at home. But  while they were ganging up on Barkley, they left guards Rickey Green and Hersey  Hawkins alone. Green had a season-high 25 points, while Hawkins scored all of  his 21 points in the second half.  </P> <P> Detroit took a 72-70 lead on a jumper by Mark Aguirre with almost 11 minutes  remaining. But Hawkins converted consecutive three-point plays to give the  76ers a lead they never relinquished.  </P> <P> "In the first half I was trying to make things happen," Hawkins said. "In the  second half things came around for me and we took charge."  </P> <P> Isiah Thomas led the Pistons (16-10) with 30 points.  </P> <P> "We have been having our problems on the road," he said. "In the fourth quarter  instead of stopping them we were sending them to the line."  </P> <P> Milwaukee 114, San Antonio 98 -- After losing Friday night at Dallas, the Bucks  came out ready to play at San Antonio.  </P> <P> On the other hand, the Spurs were a bit weary from an overtime battle against  the Suns at Phoenix. They missed 12 of their first 14 shots and fell behind by  14 points.  </P> <P> The energy it took to pull even by halftime took its toll and the Spurs  couldn't keep up in the second half.  </P> <P> Jack Sikma, who made six three-point baskets, led the Bucks with 29 points and  played David Robinson nearly on even terms. Robinson had 25 points and eight  rebounds.  </P> <P> Two of Sikma's three-pointers came during a 16-7 run with which the Bucks  opened the last quarter to clinch their 18th victory in 26 games.  </P> <P> Chicago 128, Indiana 118 -- Although the Bulls played a tough game Friday night  against the Lakers, they came out strong at Chicago.  </P> <P> They scored 44 points in the first quarter and opened a 20-point lead. This  allowed them to give Michael Jordan, who played 44 minutes in the victory over  the Lakers, a good rest.  </P> <P> In fact, they almost gave Jordan, who scored 29 points in 34 minutes, too much  rest.  </P> <P> The Pacers, paced by Chuck Person and Vern Fleming, came charging back in the  second half. Three quick baskets to open the fourth quarter cut the lead to  100-98.  </P> <P> But Jordan came back and teamed with John Paxson to give the Bulls a  comfortable final margin. Paxson finished with 23 points.  </P> <P> Washington 109, Cleveland 89 -- Bernard King rarely has two poor games in a  row. After scoring only 16 points and missing 15 of 23 shots Friday night, he  figured to be effective at Richfield, Ohio.  </P> <P> He was. On 20 for 30 from the field and six for six from the free-throw line,  the NBA scoring leader had 46 points to lead the Bullets to their third victory  in a row and fourth in the last five.  </P> <P> The Cavaliers are 2-9 since losing Mark Price, their point guard, with a  season-ending knee injury.  </P> <P> King had 28 points in the first half and the Bullets were able to keep the  intensity going.  </P> <P> Houston 122, Phoenix 102 -- Akeem Olajuwon had 24 points and 19 rebounds and  Sleepy Floyd came off the bench to have a big night at Houston.  </P> <P> Floyd, making 10 of 16 shots, had 24 points and nine assists and did a solid  job defensing the Suns' playmaker, Kevin Johnson.  </P> <P> Johnson, who appeared to be tired after playing 42 minutes Friday night, was  two for 11 and had only four points.  </P> <P> Utah 104, Orlando 96 -- Karl Malone had 15 of his 34 points in the last quarter  at Orlando and keyed a late surge to beat the Magic.  </P> <P> The Magic, which lost four road games recently after leading in the final  minute, pulled even, 89-89, with four minutes left.  </P> <P> A three-point play by Malone put the Jazz in front to stay.  </P> <P> New York 106, New Jersey 93 -- Kiki Vandeweghe missed a driving layup at the  buzzer Friday night to cost the Knicks a tie, but he made up for it in this  one.  </P> <P> Vandeweghe scored six points in a 13-2 spurt midway through the fourth quarter  that broke open a tight game. When Charles Oakley ended the rally with a  three-point play, the Knicks led, 97-82, with 4:40 left.  </P> <P> Dallas 119, Denver 110 -- Already deprived of their leading scorer, Orlando  Woolridge, for at least the next two months, the Nuggets were struck by injury  again at Denver.  </P> <P> They were leading, 89-78, at Denver, with 10 minutes left, but lost both Todd  Lichti and Chris Jackson with ankle injuries. The Mavericks outscored the  Nuggets, 41-21, the rest of the way.  </P> <P> Seattle 121, Sacramento 93 -- Eddie Johnson scored 25 points at Seattle and the  SuperSonics routed the Kings for the second time in a row.  </P> <P> Golden State 115, Minnesota 102 -- The Warriors' Chris Mullin, Tim Hardaway and  Mitch Richmond had 36 of the Warriors' 38 points when they increased a  three-point lead to 91-77 at Oakland.

			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PROFITABILITY SHOULD DETERMINE LAND-USE  </P> <P> Walter M. McIntyre (Letters, May 27) advocates a moratorium to stop the owner  of the land under the Unocal service station and Tiny Naylor's restaurant at  Ventura and Laurel Canyon boulevards from developing the site as the owner sees  fit. I find that his position is self-contradictory and politically dangerous.  </P> <P> McIntyre's viewpoint is self-contradictory in that he asserts the thesis that  the developers are swamping our neighborhoods motivated by "greed" and the  desire for profits, and that at the same time these developers are excluding  from their consideration the "wants of the community and existing market  forces," and "the needs of its consumers."  </P> <P> The only way that the desires of consumers are made objectively knowable is  through the market process of profit and loss. Those entrepreneurs who  correctly estimate the future desires of consumers are the ones who can acquire  profits. The entrepreneurs who fail to forecast accurately the wants of  consumers sustain losses. Developers do not build houses and shopping malls for  their own amusement. They do it out of the desire for profits.  </P> <P> But it is the consumers who are willing to exchange their money with these  developers to buy or rent what the developers produce. If the consumers do not  want what the developers are offering, then these same developers will sustain  losses. Thus the idea of a free-market acquisition of profits and an utter  neglect of the wants of consumers is a self-contradiction.  </P> <P> Mr. McIntyre somehow knows that the present use of the land at Ventura  Boulevard and Laurel Canyon is "supported by the community and meets the needs  of its consumers." But the "community" does not speak with one voice, and the  only way the set of individuals who make up the community can make their  preferences known is by way of the market (i.e., profit and loss). If indeed  the development of the corner site into a "retail complex" is more profitable  than leaving it as a gas station and restaurant, then Mr. McIntyre is in fact  substituting his personal preferences over that of his neighbors. The only way  he can act on his preferences is by calling on the coercive powers of the  government.  </P> <P> I call upon City Councilman Joel Wachs to reject the pleas of Mr. McIntyre. I  ask him to oppose the idea of a moratorium on the basis of the economic facts,  as well as on the basis of the owner's inalienable right to peacefully use his  property as he determines.  </P> <P> RICHARD SHEDENHELM  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

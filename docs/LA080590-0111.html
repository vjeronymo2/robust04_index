			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OUSTED SCHOOL CHIEF'S PROBLEM -- SHE WAS GUILTY OF EXCELLENCE  </P> <P> Let the punishment fit the crime, we always say! At the Huntington Beach City  School District board meeting, there was another "victory for mediocrity" as  the school board announced the resignation of the superintendent, Diana Peters  ("Beleaguered Schools Chief Diana Peters Resigns Post," July 26).  </P> <P> And she was guilty all right -- guilty of excellence, guilty of leadership and  guilty of commitment to kids.  </P> <P> According to spokesmen for the teachers' union, "she spent too much time on  public relations." Well, from the business community's perspective, what she  did was to convince us that we shared responsibility for the quality of  education in our local schools, that we couldn't just send our kids to school  and expect the teachers and staff and the board (she always called them a team)  to do it alone, especially with the perpetual shortage of funds.  </P> <P> She implored, extolled and convinced us to care enough to contribute thousands  of dollars in much-needed sophisticated equipment, supplies and special  educational programs and thousands of hours of volunteer time -- of that, she  was definitely guilty.  </P> <P> If all this wasn't bad enough, Peters' "crimes" attracted so much public  attention! Her leadership, coupled with the efforts of the principals and  teachers in the district, resulted in the development of an innovative  "Teaching for Thinking" program that was featured on the "Today" show; its  Gifted Program was named an "exemplary program" in the state Report of School  Readiness.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Peters has been honored by the California Assn. for the Gifted with  an award for Distinctive Service, was appointed by State Schools Supt. Bill  Honig to two major state-level education task forces, and was honored by the  California Legislature as the 58th Assembly District's "1990 Woman of the  Year."  </P> <P> For those "crimes," the Huntington Beach City School District board was willing  to spend more than $150,000 to buy out the remainder of Peters' four-year  contract, which they had just renewed last September amid great fanfare and  with an outstanding performance review. Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?  </P> <P> But as we said, she was guilty of excellence, and we just can't have that in  Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> JAN SHOMAKER  </P> <P> SHIRLEY C.

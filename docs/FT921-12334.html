			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Delors seeks to calm budget fears THE European Commission president, Mr Jacques Delors, said yesterday it would be difficult for Brussels to propose a hefty increase in the Community budget while the 12 member states were facing recessionary pressures and public spending constraints. Outlining his priorities for 1992 - which could be Mr Delors' last year as Commission president - he stressed the importance of the budget measures package for the five-year period from 1993. The Commission is due to table proposals in two weeks, and these are expected to include increased assistance for the poorest members of the Community. But the possibility that the EC's overall budget might be substantially increased from this year's level of Ecu66bn (Pounds 47bn) is already worrying wealthier member states such as Britain and Germany. Mr Delors acknowledged that '(national) budgets will be tight', in part because member states are cutting public spending to meet the strict criteria for economic convergence imposed by the treaty on economic and monetary union. The need to rein in EC budget increases would also restrict Brussels' ability to respond to the growing number of aid demands coming from outside the Community, he added. He also alluded to the possibility that the EC's research and training funds could be used to support European industry, a move which would arouse the suspicions of the EC's free-market members. Mr Delors said: 'The globalisation of the economy is continuing and we have two ways (of reacting) - adapting our research policy and putting our training resources at the disposal of companies.' Budget proposals being discussed by the Commission at the moment envisage an increase in the current statutory limit of 1.2 per cent of EC gross domestic product to between 1.35 and 1.45 per cent for 1993-97.</p>

			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Risk and Reward: An unprecedented performance by the UK's fund managers IS measuring the performance of fund managers becoming as much an art as fund management itself? New figures due this week from Combined Actuarial Performance Services, the Leeds-based pension fund performance measurement service, are likely to stir the debate further. According to CAPS, the average UK fund manager outperformed the FT-A All-Share Index by a best-ever 1.8 percentage points, earning a median return of 22.4 per cent on a portfolio of UK equities against a 20.6 per cent return on the FT-A. Meanwhile, WM Company, another pension fund measurement service, calculates that the average return generated by institutional fund managers in UK equities was 20.8 per cent, although half the funds in its survey beat the index by one percentage point or more. The outperformance seen in the CAPS data is unprecedented, says Mr John Clamp, chief executive. Between 1982 and 1991, fund managers actually underperformed the FT-A Index in seven of 10 years by an average of 0.89 per cent. They outperformed in only three years, by a more modest average of 0.66 per cent. Similarly, the WM survey finds that fund managers had, for the first time in 1992, outperformed key indices in every stock market at home and abroad. So what is going on? And if rates of return can be so different, what is the appropriate benchmark against which to measure performance? These questions prove particularly troublesome to pension fund consultants who guide clients into the arms of fund managers. Mr Nick Fitzpatrick, partner at actuarial consultants Bacon and Woodrow, notes that partly because of the role of pension consultants, there has been an increasing concentration of pension funds in the hands of no more than a half-dozen fund managers with consistently good performance. Several of these - Gartmore and Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management in particular - wildly outperformed the FT-A Index in 1992 and the outperformance of the CAPS median may well reflect the concentration of CAPS clients in the hands of these managers. But others suggest that differences in actual fund size account for the variations in returns. Mr Peter Worrington, marketing manager at WM, notes that his company measures returns of 2,500 funds including several in-house managed funds of more than Pounds 1bn. Because of their size, many of these maintain an actual or de facto indexed core whose returns will be much closer to that of the FT-A Index. Any outperformance will be achieved in smaller satellite funds. In contrast, the CAPS survey covers 1,700 pension funds with an average size of Pounds 120m and only 3 per cent of which are more than Pounds 500m. These pools are more likely to eschew indexation, assigning mandates which pay performance-related fees for outperforming a benchmark. But even if the degree of outperformance varies between measurement services, why should the active managers have done far better on average than the market as a whole? Mr Clamp says that the small companies factor may be at work. Indexers, unlike 1992's most successful fund managers, would have been required to hold small companies 'and these were dogs last year,' Mr Clamp notes. But could the underweighting in small companies spell trouble for 1993? In the first two months of this year, the FT Small Capitalisation Index rose 12.1 per cent against a 2.4 per cent rise in the FT-A. Also, the consultants say, several of the biggest fund managers had particularly good stock selection. Gartmore, for instance, was said to have switched heavily into recovery stocks immediately after the UK left the ERM. Similarly, Phillips &amp;Drew, with an unusually low 48 per cent weighting in UK equities, concentrated its holdings in the very large stocks which performed best. But if indices can vary so much, how is a pension fund client to decide which should be the benchmark? Mr Clamp argues that the FT-A remains a valid benchmark for indexed funds. However, perhaps it is time for performance measurement services to devise sub-categories of their own that would allow clients to compare performances more accurately.</p>

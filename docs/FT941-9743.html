			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A husband's gift of money My husband gave me some money as a gift when independent taxation was introduced. I wish to have the interest from my account transferred to our joint account for living purposes as my husband has now retired. Will I be contravening the tax regulations in so doing? What is the position regarding interest earned on such accounts? If the money which you contribute to the joint account does no more than meet your half share of the living expenses, then there is no problem. On the other hand, if your husband's contributions to the joint account are insufficient to meet his half share of the expenses, then the tax position depends upon whether, when he gave you the money, there was an understanding it might be used to subsidise him after he retired. Ask your tax office for the (free) Inland Revenue booklet IR83 (Independent taxation: a guide for tax practitioners), and study paragraph 19 for further guidance. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (20): Fewer headaches - Communications Technology IN LESS than a decade the mobile telephone has established itself as an effective business tool and a worthy addition to the company car. But over the next few years vehicle fleet managers will face the choice between a baffling array of new voice and data telecommunications services and equipment. In Europe, liberalisation has fuelled the growth of mobile communications. Since the introduction of cellular radio services in Britain in 1985, the number of subscribers to the two national networks, Cellnet and Vodafone, has grown to around 1.4m - or almost a quarter of the total 5.8m users in Europe. Most of these subscribers are business users, and an increasing proportion of them now use hand-portable telephones, most of which can be used in company cars with the addition of a car adapter kit. Standard carphones and car adapter kits now come with 'hands-free' operation and top of the range carphones also include voice-activated dialing, allowing totally hands-free use. After the boom in new subscribers in the UK in the late 1980s, the last few years have seen slower growth. Plans for telepoint services have been curtailed while other services have so far failed to live up to expectations. Nevertheless, the mobile communications market, in the UK and elsewhere in Europe, is still a fast-moving market with a new services just around the corner. In particular, across Europe digital cellular systems based on the pan-European GSM standard are currently being launched. These premium-priced services are unlikely to replace the older analogue networks immediately. Indeed, it will be some time before full national networks are in place. However, for the business traveller in particular, they will eventually offer some key advantages. Digital services will provide clearer, more reliable connections, which will also be much more secure from eavesdropping. In addition by the mid-1990s, because it is a Europe-wide standard, international travellers will be able to use their GSM phones anywhere in Europe. In the UK both network operators have introduced new low-user tariff structures for their analogue services in the past six months and Hutchison Telecom has unveiled a one-way Telepoint service called Rabbit. In addition, customers will soon be able to opt for Mercury Personal Communications' local digital Personal Communications Network (PCN) service, due to be launched by the middle of this year alongside Vodafone's rival Micro Cell Network (MCN). Already some vehicle fleet operators are inheriting a haphazard collection of equipment, service contracts and billing systems built up over the years. Indeed, research shows that many corporate users do not know how many mobile phones they have, or how they are being used. To address this problem, Mercury Communications Mobile Services, an independent service provider, now offers corporate customers a 'free audit of mobile equipment' and then a 'consolidation service.' MCMS has come across some customers with more than 300 vehicles using 20 or more different service providers. 'We can take the headache away,' says Mr Martin Bartholomew of MCMS. Managing a consolidated fleet of mobile telephones this way can have other benefits, such as providing a single point of contact for the customer, itemised billing and monitored usage. Aside from the basic cellular mobile services, many corporate customers have also signed up for the value-added services offered by network operators, such as Vodata's Recall voice messaging service or Cellnet's direct access service which provides a link between an office switchboard and the cellular network. However, some large customers, including local government and utilities, have discovered that public access mobile radio, launched in the UK in 1988, can sometimes offer significant cost advantages over cellular. Customers share a radio infrastructure built and maintained by a network operator. Once they have bought or leased their handsets there is a subscription charge only; they do not pay any call charges. Mobile data and fax transmission is another area where customer confusion is rife. There are mobile data services offered by the cellular operators, dedicated mobile data network operators, and data over private mobile radio networks. Transmitting data over an analogue cellular system is far more difficult than over the 'fixed wire' public telephone system. One way to overcome the problem is to use a special cellular modem like the one available from Vodafone's mobile data service which claims several thousand users and 90 per cent of the UK market. This enables customers to transmit and receive error-free data over the cellular network which provides any standards conversion automatically. The alternative is to use one of the dedicated mobile data services which were licensed in the UK in 1989. Hutchison Mobile Data and Ram Mobile Data Services both provide these, as does Paknet, another Vodafone subsidiary. But an obvious disadvantage of dedicated mobile data services, including paging services, is that they can only handle data, and according to research, most corporate customers require both mobile voice and data. Another problem facing mobile data customers is the lack of a worldwide standard. But this may soon be overcome in Europe with the digital GSM standard. These systems will be able handle mobile data traffic from facsimile machines or portable computers in vehicles at high speed and with comparative ease. GSM telephones equipped with small LCD screens will also be able to receive messages - like pagers - bringing the long promised digital mobile office one step closer to reality. Mobile telecommunications can also be used to cut the costs of distribution while improving customer service, vehicle security and monitoring. Satellites are also likely to play a significant role in the future of corporate mobile communications. mIn the UK, Marconi introduced Star-Track last year to trace the position of vehicles. It can be used to detect and track stolen vehicles, monitor the state of a load or direct drivers to their destination.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Justyna Matyskiewicz, head of the Katowice  Steelworks information office, has announced that, during the  first six days of the strike, the plant suffered losses  amounting to 40.78 billion zlotys [Z]. According to her, each  subsequent day of the strike will result in further losses of  about Z10 billion.    Late last night, the strike committee began talks with the  board of the steelworks. The talks are not being conducted  face-to-face but, rather, through mediators from the Ministry  for Ownership Transformations. There are signs that an  agreement can eventually be reached.</p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Cadbury Schweppes climbs 13% - A record year despite sluggish or falling sales in some markets CADBURY SCHWEPPES, the confectionery and soft drinks manufacturer, increased pre-tax profits by 13.2 per cent to Pounds 316.4m last year, in spite of sluggish or declining sales in some important markets. Sir Graham Day, chairman, said the results marked 'a record year in every single respect.' They reflected firm cost controls and continued high levels of investment to improve efficiency and strengthen the company's brands. Mr Dominic Cadbury, chief executive, expected business conditions to remain tough this year, though he was optimistic about prospects for the important Easter season. The pre-tax results, for the year to December 28, were at the top end of market expectations and compared with Pounds 279.6m a year ago. Sales rose 2.7 per cent to Pounds 3.23bn (Pounds 3.15bn), while trading margins increased to 11.2 per cent (10.6 per cent). In the UK, trading profits rose 9.2 per cent to Pounds 162.2m on a 2 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 1.51bn. The company consolidated recent market share gains in chocolate and increased its share of sweets sales, though a decline in leisure purchases reduced beverage sales by 2.8 per cent in value and 8 per cent in volume. In continental Europe, trading profit rose 12.1 per cent to Pounds 76.2m on sales of Pounds 655.8m, up 2.8 per cent. Trading profit improved strongly at Poulain, the company's French chocolate subsidiary, while the merged Oasis and Schweppes beverage business in France performed well. Sales by the recently-formed Apollinaris-Schweppes joint venture also made a strong start in Germany and Austria. Though sales in the Americas rose 8.6 per cent to Pounds 438.3m, the biggest increase in any region, poorer beverages results reduced profits by 1.2 per cent to Pounds 42.8m. This was despite a 6.6 per cent growth in the company's US carbonated drinks volumes. Pacific Rim sales fell 0.9 per cent to Pounds 491.2m, but trading profit grew 10.1 per cent to Pounds 64.5m. Overall, operating profit on confectionery operations totalled Pounds 170.2m (Pounds 163m) on sales of Pounds 1.39bn (1.32bn). In the beverage business, operating profit was Pounds 192.3m (Pounds 170.9m) on sales of Pounds 1.84bn (Pounds 1.82bn). Positive cash flow reduced net borrowings by Pounds 31m to Pounds 333m, contributing to a drop in gearing to 39 per cent (49 per cent). Capital investment increased 9.3 per cent to Pounds 232m, while marketing spending rose 5.8 per cent to Pounds 343m. Earnings per share increased 9.6 per cent to 27.73p (25.29p). The final dividend is raised to 9.3p (8.5p), bringing the full year total to 12.5p (11.5p). See Lex</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Irina Savvateyeva article: "Chernomyrdin's Team -- the </F> Internal Political Scene"]    [Text] Sovereign Vassal on Road to Presidency    Relations between the present Cabinet of Ministers and the  president and his apparatus are fairly complex. At first, the  presidential structure rose up to dizzy heights, whereas the  government's position was one of subordination. These were the  relations of vassal and sovereign, which, however, even then  were not the relations of slave and slaveholder. A vassal had  the right to fight for his independence and autonomy, as well as  for their subsequent expansion. Which is what Viktor  Chernomyrdin became involved in when he started forming "his  own" government.    As a result, the government structure became more firmly  established. Admittedly, certain observers still give it a  subservient role, pointing out that the president controls the  activity of the "power" ministries and also has the right to  intervene in financial and economic policy if the threat of  hyperinflation arises. However, others are inclined to believe  that in terms of its power and strength of influence, the  government is not at all inferior to the president's  administration. And in terms of organization and effectiveness,  is even ahead of it.    By and large, according to certain observers, the place and  role of the Russian Government in the country's political life  are today predetermined by the future battles for the post of  president. And also by the fact that the leader of the  government is the No. 1 candidate for the post of head of state.  In short, this is a government whose main function is to help  the premier to become president.    Meanwhile, it is advantageous for the current president to  play along with future contender for the presidency.    So Yeltsin has moved aside, handed the economy to  Chernomyrdin, and is now observing what will happen next. If,  contrary to expectation, Viktor Stepanovich manages to hold the  country on the brink of hyperinflation, Boris Nikolayevich will  be interested in having him as his successor. As a man who  maintained personal loyalty.    And it is also in the premier's interests to play along with  with Yeltsin: Chernomyrdin needs Yeltsin even more than Yeltsin  needs him. If it proves possible to rescue the economy, the  premier will simply prove to be "doomed" to become president.  So that Chernomyrdin's task in the present conditions is  utterly clear: to sit out Yeltsin's tenure, trying not to make  any sharp movements, and to support Yeltsin without doing a deal  with him.  <H5>  Government-Parliament </H5>   As for relations between the government and the parliament,  these are still at the formative stage. However, confrontation  between the two bodies is already fairly discernible. The  government is trying to do all it can to deprive the Federal  Assembly of even a hint of autonomy in the question of material  wealth. Meanwhile, virtually all the parliament's material  backup is under the control of the president's administration.  And in many respects this fact determines the relations between  the legislature and the executive.    For the time being, the parliamentary opposition has been  behaving very carefully -- with the government too. The  discussion of the budget proposed by Chernomyrdin has begun  surprisingly peacefully. The lessons of October have evidently  not been forgotten. Furthermore, in the present situation it is  advantageous for the legislators to distance themselves from the  government's economy policy. And to act on the basis of the  principle: Let things happen as they happen, and we will  criticize quietly. At the same time, a number of potential  candidates for the presidency, making use of the Duma platform,  are waiting impatiently for this government to ruin the economy  and bring itself down.    However, the majority of Duma factions have a fairly loyal  attitude toward the government. Thanks to Aleksandr Zaveryukha,  Chernomyrdin has found a common language with the communists,  the agrarians and the "Women of Russia" -- he is close to them  in spirit. Boris Fedorov was profoundly wrong when he sought  Zaveryukha's dismissal: In any other circumstances the premier  would not have parted for anything with a man who allowed him to  control a significant part of the parliamentary opposition.    "Russia's Choice" and the "12 December" group will be forced  to support Chernomyrdin on the basis of gloomy considerations:  "Or else things will get even worse."    And as for the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, it --  following the elevation of both its leaders to the rank of vice  premier -- is quite simply a government party. However,  observers note: It is only the unifiers and the compromisers  who consider themselves to be Chernomyrdin's party. He just  allows them to support him, but prefers not to pay them back for  this. Unless with posts of vice premier.  <H5>  Chernomyrdin's Team: Characters and Performers </H5>   Viktor Stepanovich likes to repeat at every convenient  opportunity that the current Russian Government is a coalition  government. In actual fact there can be no question of a  coalition government. In practical terms only one team --  Chernomyrdin's team -- is on the field of play.    Chernomyrdin inherited an extremely mixed cabinet at the end  of 1992. It included Yeltsin's men: Lobov, Shumeyko, Shakhray.  And the fragments of Gaydar's team: Chubays, Pamfilova, and  also Shokhin at that time. Then Gaydar himself appeared too.  Fedorov -- a team in himself -- was also here.    At that time, Yeltsin protege Oleg Lobov presented the  greatest danger for the new premier -- he was urgently trying to  reform the Ministry of the Economy a la Gosplan and to lay his  hands on economic policy. Chernomyrdin dealt with him first.  Another first vice premier, Oleg Soskovets, who had previously  vegetated in the post of vice premier of an almost foreign  country -- Kazakhstan -- was brought in to counterbalance First  Vice Premier Lobov. Chernomyrdin almost begged Yeltsin for  permission to bring just one of his own men into the government.  The request looked entirely proper. After all, the new premier  did not bring in with him any potentially dangerous  representatives of the extremely powerful oil and gas lobby,  which would doubtless have been assessed as outright  protectionism.    At the same time, it should not be forgotten that  Soskovets's  candidacy emerged on Chubays' initiative. And at first the new  vice premier was fairly close to the representatives of those  who were called reformers in the government, and he supported  their policy. Suffice it to say that thanks primarily to  Soskovets the price of coal was deregulated. All this fully  suited Yeltsin. It was said that the president gave the new  vice premier certain signs of attention and even made certain  overtures toward him.    The premier tolerated this for a while. For him enemy No. 1  was Lobov. In the end, Yeltsin's overzealous protege in terms  of Gosplan-style reformism was nevertheless finished off. Not  without the help of the government promarket lobby and the  democratic press. Thereupon he was removed from the economy,  but entirely decorously and honorably: He was unloaded into the  Security Council.    At a different time, but also entirely decorously, Yeltsin's  remaining men were removed from the government. Shumeyko found  himself in the Federation Council, not least thanks to the  efforts of Chernomyrdin and Soskovets, who had done some good  work with the deputies. But they did not remove Shakhray, or  Shokhin either. These men simply left the teams in which they  had started their political game and became full members of  Chernomyrdin's team.    Incidentally, one story is that Shokhin was elevated so as  to  counterbalance Soskovets, who was casting glances here and there  and who was thus told: Man proposes, God disposes. That is,  the premier disposes. And by and large, the elevation of  Shokhin is a highly successful acquisition for Chernomyrdin and  Kvasov. Appointed to "Gaydar's post," that is, the post of the  person responsible for economic policy and reforms -- the  professor and doctor of economic sciences is very good for  diluting the strictly technological company of typical sector  workers. And furthermore, he symbolizes a representative of the  first draft of reformers, which is very convenient for the  premier.    And as for the so-called radical promarket lobby,  Chernomyrdin dealt with them after October 1993, once he had  perceived his own strength. Strictly speaking, no one chased  Gaydar, Fedorov, and Pamfilova out of the government. All were  offered posts. But, being young and ambitious, -- and that is  precisely the reason for what happened -- they went too far; the  posts no longer suited them, you see, and they wanted to dictate  terms.    Meanwhile, analysis of Chernomyrdin's cabinet's subsequent  economic policy brings to mind the fact that the reason for  Fedorov and Gaydar's departure was by no means fundamental  differences of opinion with the premier in terms of views of the  course of economic reforms. Judging by the  Chernomyrdin-approved expenditure in the 1994 budget, Viktor  Stepanovich turned out to be no less tough a "monetarist" than  those from whom he had distanced himself. It is just that the  premier evidently prefers to have one center in the government  from which all decisions are initiated.    As a result, the government formed by Chernomyrdin assumed a  completely organic character. It is headed by a single leader,  respected and recognized by all his subordinates. He is not  without charisma either: He knows how to say things in such a  way that people listen to him and receive things at a  psychological and emotional level. Following the memorable  speech uttered at the enlarged government session which  mentioned heads of laboratories and the racing car, Chernomyrdin  will even be forgiven for the tough budget. For the time being,  of course.    All decisions in the government are adopted exclusively by  the premier. Or more precisely, by the Chernomyrdin-Kvasov duo.  The leader of the apparatus -- the second man in the government  -- has enormous power. Not one piece of paper is placed on  Viktor Stepanovich's desk without his knowledge.    Vladimir Kvasov has worked with Chernomyrdin for many years.  He has always been a retinue figure: chief of office,  assistant, leader of the apparatus.... In short, an eminence  grise. The premier trusts Kvasov completely. And the latter  knows all the ins and outs of apparatus reshuffles and  skillfully conducts a cadre policy that is advantageous to the  premier. Whoever Kvasov recommends, that person is taken on.  The only exception has been Anatoliy Chubays.  <H5>  Foreign Body </H5>   Today Chubays is the only man in Chernomyrdin's government  who is not on Chernomyrdin's team. Appointed directly by the  president over and above the approved vice premier TO, Chubays  is in this government only until check privatization is  completed. What then?    Chernomyrdin will most likely try to get rid of him. It is  said that he has already attempted to remove two deputy chairman  of the State Committee for the Management of State Property  [Goskomimushchestvo] -- Vasilyev and Mostovoy -- and put his own  people in the posts in order to thus "neutralize" the head of  the department. This did not work out, however. Chubays proved  to be a tough nut, and Chernomyrdin and Kvasov broke their teeth  on him.    But they will scarcely tolerate him for long. The chairman  of Goskomimushchestvo is too bright a figure, he is too  promising and ambitious a politician. You need an iron grip to  hold on for two years to the process of the division of property  in the vast Russian state and to bring this division to a  logical conclusion (and it is all going that way). And so  (particularly in Chernomyrdin's eyes) Chubays is the only person  in the government after the premier who has a certain amount of  influence on the president.    Obviously, the future of the Goskomimushchestvo chairman  depends on the president's political fate. However, Chubays is  capable of standing up for himself. Today his department is  fighting with all its might to strengthen its positions in the  postprivatization process. If Goskomimushchestvo succeeds in  taking enterprise bankruptcies and economic revival under its  control, then Chubays' influential position in the government  will be secure. However, even today the Ministry of the Economy  is disputing these functions with Goskomimushchestvo. No doubt  the full might of the government apparatus will stand behind  Shokhin in this conflict.  <H5>  Lobbyists in the Government: Who Wins? </H5>   One of the most powerful lobbies -- the oil and gas lobby --  is represented in the government by the premier himself. To a  significant extent the oil and gas workers form the budget. And  what is also important is that they have their own finances  which they can use. That is probably why Chernomyrdin is  seeking to prevent his potentially influential old friends from  Gazprom getting too close.    But it is the agrarians who are the most active today in  obtaining money for themselves, because they are able to apply  pressure at all levels: in the government, in the Duma, and  through the mass media. This lobby is also strong in that it  has easy access to the premier through its protege Aleksandr  Zaveryukha.    Oleg Soskovets, who in his time has worked both at the  Karaganda Metallurgical Combine and in the post of USSR minister  of nonferrous metallurgy, represents the interests of the  "coal-metal" bloc lobbyists. The defense industry workers have  also recently slipped under the Soskovets wing, inasmuch as they  do not have a single serious figure in the government by way of  their own direct spokesman. The military-industrial complex  lobby is generally one of the weakest. The attitude toward  defense industry workers is one of sympathy, but without the due  respect. This is yet again confirmed by the fact that during  the formation of the 1994 budget the spokesmen for the  military-industrial complex failed to obtain an additional  morsel at the expense of other sectors.    Obviously, all the aforesaid lobbies, as well as their  spokesmen, are doomed to constant confrontation with each other  amid the struggle for survival.    This situation suits Chernomyrdin as a politician and as  supreme arbiter. The state of confrontation will neither allow  one specific leader to become stronger or several to cobble  together a stable anti-premier coalition. For instance, in the  fight against increased prices of fuel and energy complex output  Soskovets and Zaveryukha could constitute a fairly powerful  alliance. But this alliance would never stand the test of the  division of the budget pie.    In this context, Chernomyrdin's desire to keep Acting  Minister of Finance Sergey Dubinin in a state of suspension  seems entirely sensible. After all, the person who hands out  the money has considerable influence on the disposition of  forces in the political arena. Last year Boris Fedorov was this  man, and this could not have particularly pleased Chernomyrdin.  Now this man is indubitably the premier himself; he is in  complete control of the Ministry of Finance.    As for the regional elites, these do not have any recognized  lobbyists in Chernomyrdin's government at the moment. Maybe  some of them are still inclined to back Shakhray. But, if they  want to achieve something, the majority of local leaders resort  to pooling their own efforts. Or they quite successfully go to  the president in secret.    But the premier himself possibly monitors the moods of the  territories through his vice premier, Yuriy Yarov. Yarov has  been involved in party and soviet work for years. In  Chernomyrdin's government he is formally responsible for social  policy, but at the same time he conducts all kinds of closed  talks with the regions. Obviously, Chernomyrdin has reason to  trust this taciturn and complaisant deputy more than Sergey  Shakhray with his indefatigable political ambitions and  pro-Yeltsin past.    However, Yarov was probably appointed to the post of vice  premier not least thanks to the curious fact that he ran for  deputy from the "Russia's Choice" bloc. And thereby gave the  premier who elevated him the possibility of maintaining the  illusion of a coalition government.</p>

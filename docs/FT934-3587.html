			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Chubb Security Sir Ernest Harrison claimed throughout Williams Holdings' hostile bid for Racal that Chubb Security was worth Pounds 700m. That now looks like more than defensive bluff. Chubb's shares have out-performed the stock market by 40 per cent since it was demerged from Racal in September 1992. Its market capitalisation now stands at Pounds 1bn. While that underlines how neglected it had become prior to demerger, Chubb's management deserves full credit for subsequently getting to grips with costs. Although cost savings arising from the first phase of restructuring are impressive, progress will be more difficult from here on. The challenge now is to generate additional sales while resisting downward pressure on margins. Replacing administrative staff with salesmen and rolling out a stream of new products is an active response. If sales can be driven higher while keeping the lid on fixed costs, margins should anyway improve. Yet Chubb will have to increase sales in difficult markets almost from a standing start. Without exchange rate benefits, turnover grew by only 3 per cent in the first half. In electronic security, margins fell slightly. The cost of expanding the sales force without compensating efficiencies elsewhere is blamed for this temporary squeeze. The benefit of the sales drive should, in theory, show through in the second half. With the dividend covered almost three times by earnings and net cash in the balance sheet, Chubb has room to increase the payout if progress proves slower than expected. On a multiple of around 22 times this year's forecast earnings, though, no one is holding the shares for the yield.</p>

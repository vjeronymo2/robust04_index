			<p>BFN     [Text] Lanzhou, June 17 (XINHUA) -- People of northwest  China's Gansu Province who have suffered a lot from water loss  and soil erosion are now benefiting from a government water and  soil control project.    In the southern part of Gansu Province, which covers an area  of 3,345 square kilometers, the poverty-stricken areas have  dropped from 66 percent to 18 percent as a result of a five-year  effort in water and soil control drive.    For a long time in the past, the southern part of Gansu,  including the Qingba Mountain areas and the upper reaches of the  Chang Jiang River, was one of the four main areas in China  suffering from mud-rock flow. It now has over 800 crevasses  caused by mud- rock flows and over 200 remains of landslides.    In 1988, the Chinese State Council designated seven counties  in southern Gansu as key project areas for water and soil  control. Since then, more than 10 million yuan (about 1.2  million U.S. Dollars) has been invested in the project each year.    As part of the project, land has been terraced, trees  planted  and grass sown in a 3,345 square kilometer area. Local people  describe the project as "life engineering".    The project has brought 57 percent of water loss and soil  erosion under control.    The forest coverage in the area has increased by 4 percent.    With the improving of farming conditions, the grain output  in  the area has increased. Last year, the total grain output was  716 million kilograms, a record for the area.    Production centers for apples, oranges and Chinese prickly  ash have emerged along rivers and in mountain areas in the south  of Gansu Province.</p>

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: PNG copper/gold mine recaptured Papua New Guinea forces had recaptured the Panguna mine on Bougainville Island from secessionist rebels, Mr Paias Wingti, PNG's prime minister, said yesterday. Paguna, once one of the world's biggest copper mines, was producing about 160,000 tonnes of copper and 510,000 troy ounces of gold annually, before it was forced to close in 1989 by a landowners' revolt and a violent sabotage campaign by the so-called Bougainville Revolutionary Army. The mine is 53.6 per cent-owned and was operated by CRA of Australia, which in turn is 49 per cent-owned by RTZ Corporation of the UK. Mr Mark Rayner, Bougainville Copper's chairman, said recently it would cost up to USDollars 450m to bring the mine back into operation. Hopes that work might start soon were dimmed, however, by a BRA representative in Australia who said yesterday that secessionist forces would resume guerrilla attacks from the mountains to prevent mining re-starting. He conceded, though, that the taking of Panguna by PNG troops was a sign that the secessionist influence might be waning. Mr Wingti said troops had met little resistance.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (As at Monday's close) tonnes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Aluminium                  -16,850                   to 2,474,200 Aluminium alloy             unchgd                   at 26,480 Copper                      +1,625                   to 348,100 Lead                          -375                   to 365,050 Nickel                        +528                   to 136,656 Zinc                          -875                   to 1,223,525 Tin                           -125                   to 31,040  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

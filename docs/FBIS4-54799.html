			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 4 (CTK) -- Gaining German support  for the respect of Slovak interests in the European stability  pact, now under preparation, belongs to the goals of a two-day  visit of Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan to Bonn and  Berlin, which started today.    Before leaving Bratislava, Kukan told CTK and Slovak news  agency (TA SR) that he would meet with his German counterpart  Klaus Kinkel to discuss German support for Slovakia's efforts to  join an integrated Europe, and German investments in the  connection with the plans of the new Slovak Government to speed  up the privatization process.    Kukan said he also wanted to take up the question of  compensation for the Slovak victims of the Nazi regime.  However, he said he did not expect any definitive solution.  For the time being, Bratislava neither intends to open the  question of negotiating a new international agreement with  Germany, concluded under the Czechoslovak federation.    Kukan is also to meet with German Defense Minister Volker  Ruhe, mainly to discuss Slovakia's participation in the  Partnership for Peace plan, and its ambition to join NATO. On  Thursday [5 May], Kukan is to lecture on Slovak foreign policy  in the European Academy in Berlin.    "Slovakia is interested in participation in the stability  pact (based on a plan of French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur,  approved by the EU, and aimed mainly at preventive settlement of  the problems concerning borders and ethnic minorities in former  communist countries), but is even more interested in the pact's  respecting Slovak interests. As they are not sufficiently  expressed in the pact's draft wording, I will ask minister  Kinkel for his support," Kukan said.    Slovakia refuses the proposal to negotiate its international  agreement with Hungary under EU auspice. However, the  possibility of Slovakia's not joining the pact has not been  considered. "We believe.. the pact will be acceptable for  Slovakia as well," Kukan said.    Until the recent improvement of mutual relations, Bratislava  disputed with Budapest over the status and the rights of the  500,000 ethnic Hungarians living in Slovakia. While Budapest is  pushing for collective rights for the Hungarian minority, which  it has made the condition for the conclusion of a  Slovak-Hungarian treaty, Bratislava rejects this idea and is  promoting individual rights for minorities' members, in line  with European standards. Slovakia has been simultaneously  urging Hungary to guarantee the inviolability of the present  Slovak-Hungarian borders.    "We are interested in our relations with some countries of  the region being settled bilaterally, without sponsorship and  the oversight of somebody else," Kukan said. "We are able to  negotiate important agreements ourselves and are willing to  offer these agreements as our contribution to the stability  pact, as well as to establish certain mechanisms to control the  observance of the pact's provisions. We do not want our stands  to be pressed upon us from outside," he stressed.    Kukan confirmed that his meeting with his Czech counterpart  Josef Zieleniec is being prepared, but a suitable date has not  been found yet.</p>

			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Management: Hierarchies of the middle-up-down One of the unending puzzles for westerners about the way Japanese companies operate is the relationship between boss and subordinate. In an unusually structured society, top managers command enormous authority and respect. Yet at the same time Japanese companies tend to be remarkably participative, or at least consultative; there are few countries in which front-line and middle managers have as much influence on strategy. Some western writers have claimed that this is a sham: that Japanese workers and middle managers feed their bosses what the latter want to hear. More sophisticated writers argue to the contrary: that the innovativeness and creativity of Japanese companies, especially in knowledge-intensive industries such as electronics, rests heavily on the injection of ideas from those closest to the customer and to technological change - in other words, from the bottom or middle. In a celebrated article a few years ago, a Tokyo professor, Ikujiro Nonaka, christened this style 'middle-up-down management'. Now two western writers with a subtle grasp of both culture and organisational systems have produced an explanation which builds on Nonaka's analysis. The authors are Charles Hampden-Turner, a British academic at Cambridge best known for his pioneering work on how to thrive on ambiguity and dilemma, and Fons Trompenaars, a Franco-Dutch expert on national differences in business. In The Seven Cultures of Capitalism*, a wide-ranging and provocative book published this year - which has had an undeservedly quiet reception, partly because of its philosophical overtones - Hampden-Turner and Trompenaars concede the obvious: that the Japanese are far more deferential to authority than Americans; that they use a language indicative of the relative social standings of speakers and those spoken to; and that they are most reluctant to criticise openly anyone but close colleagues. What is less obvious is that Japanese hierarchies are very different from typical Anglo-Saxon chains of command, in which the boss sits many miles from the customer and the technical action. In Japan, they tend instead to constitute what Hampden-Turner and Trompenaars call, awkwardly, a series of 'inclusive co-ordinations'. These, they suggest, resemble inverted Chinese puzzle boxes, one inside the other (see diagram). Whereas the levels of a US hierarchy have considerable gaps and psychological distance between them, in Japan each higher level encompasses the one beneath it, the duo argues. The superior not only has his feet more on the ground, and is in closer direct contact with lower levels, but is usually also more of a co-ordinator than a leader. Hence the term 'inclusive co-ordination'. As Seven Cultures argues, most top men in Japan tend to lay down abstract values and policies, and then synthesise the innovative actions and other initiatives which flow up from those beneath him. Like the 'coaching' style much-advocated in the west, but little practised there as yet, the Japanese leader spends much of his time listening, responding, nurturing, and formulating after-the-event policy from strategies that have emerged from below. This combination of top-down management with bottom-up participation contrasts with American management theory, which has tended to pit the two against each other. Japanese hierarchy also differs from western autocracy in its tradition of benevolent leadership and minimalist control, according to Seven Cultures. Strong emotional obligations are placed on Japanese leaders by their subordinates. Moreover, unlike westerners influenced by the sociologist Max Weber, the Japanese make no distinction between Gemeinschaft, a close-knit group with voluntary affections, and Gesellschaft, a contractual association for work. As the book demonstrates, Japan's strong collectivism supports the ability of its companies to create harmony between seemingly conflicting factors. Authority is combined with empowerment, hierarchy with participation, and so on. The net result is unparalleled proficiency at the sort of complex organisational learning, corporate renewal, and competitive flexibility which every western company is struggling to emulate. What Hampden-Turner and Trompenaars do not explore sufficiently is the downside of the group commitment which underpins 'middle-up-down' decision-making in Japan: an atmosphere that most westerners find oppressive. So do some Japanese these days. But when old thinking habits are so powerful and deep-rooted, they die hard. *UK: Piatkus, Pounds 20. US: Doubleday, Dollars 25.</p>

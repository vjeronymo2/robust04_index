			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / International Company News: Linde to extend activities LINDE, the diversified German industrial company, is to extend its fork-lift truck and materials handling activities in southern Europe through acquiring control of a subsidiary of Iveco, the truck manufacturer owned by Italy's Fiat group. The German company has agreed to buy 51 per cent of Fiat OM Carrelli Elevatori, which employs 1,150 people and last year had a turnover of L242bn (Dollars 214m). Fiat OM, which also owns the Pimespo Carrelli Elevatori operation, has plants in Bari and Luzzara, near Verona. Linde said the Italian company would retain its own identity and market its own products in competition with those of the German group. Last year, Linde posted a 10 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to DM528m (Dollars 315m). Its turnover was 14 per cent higher at DM6.9bn.</p>

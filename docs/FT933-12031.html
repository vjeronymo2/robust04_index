			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Private medicine report delayed THE MONOPOLIES and Mergers Commission was yesterday given an extra three months - until December 7 - to complete a report into private medical services. Private medical fees were referred to the commission last September. In a letter to doctors earlier this month the commission said it believed that the way some National Health Service consultants set private fees close to the guidelines of the British Medical Association and private health insurers formed a complex monopoly under the Fair Trading Act. But the commission stressed that it had not reached final conclusions, or decided whether the effects of the conduct were good or bad. A challenge to the wool-buying monopoly of the British Wool Marketing Board failed yesterday when the Court of Session in Edinburgh banned wool merchants Reid and Robertson from attempting to buy wool direct from farmers. Mr John King, the company's director, said the company would continue lobbying parliament for a change in the law on wool marketing. Reid and Robertson had told the court that since the government's removal of the wool price guarantee farmers were still obliged to sell wool to the board, but at a reduced price.</p>

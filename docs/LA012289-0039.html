			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOUD AND CLEAR REPLY  </P> <P> Lawrence Christon's article "Kim, the Savant Who Came to Hollywood," Jan. 8),  while showing great knowledge of and sensitivity toward autistic people, also  shows great ignorance about and insensitivity toward toastmasters.  </P> <P> Toastmasters are members of the international, nonprofit Toastmasters  International. The steps of our program include getting over nervousness,  speaking with sincerity, varying one's voice, using body language, organizing  thoughts, working with words, persuading people, speaking with credibility and  inspiring people. None of these attributes could ever be brushed aside by  describing a toastmaster as someone with a "heavy, over-loud voice . . .  playing to a crowd."  </P> <P> IVAN S.

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report The London Commodity Exchange's robusta COFFEE market recouped most of its early losses yesterday as New York prices recovered from Tuesday night's sharp sell-off. The rally, from a low of Dollars 1,225 a tonne for the November futures position, was encouraged by confirmation that Brazilian financing for its role in the producer retention scheme was in place. Rumours of problems concerning financing, technical liquidation and a stronger dollar after news of the power struggle in Russia had all pushed US prices lower on Tuesday evening. At the close London's November price stood at Dollars 1,270 a tonne, Dollars 2 down on balance. LCE COCOA prices went from strength to strength in the morning as the market, supported by a weaker sterling, seemed content to resume the uptrend after Tuesday's downward correction. In the afternoon the December contract pushed to a new second position peak of Pounds 936 a tonne, the highest since June 1990 when the market reached Pounds 949, the next technical target. 'People are taking insurance against the market going up further. So many have run short for such a long time,' one trader said. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Foreign chip share steady The foreign share of Japan's semiconductor market was 20.7 per cent in the first quarter of 1994, unchanged from the fourth quarter of 1993 and slightly above the 20 per cent target set in the second US-Japan semiconductor trade agreement, signed in 1991, writes Louise Kehoe in San Francisco. Since the adoption of the first semiconductor trade agreement in 1986, which for the first time established market share as a measure of market access, the foreign share has risen by 8.5 per cent. However, over the past two years the foreign share data have varied significantly from quarter to quarter reaching a record high in the fourth quarter of 1993. US semiconductor industry officials called for renewed efforts. We need to 'ensure that foreign access to the Japanese market moves beyond the 20 per cent mark in order to realise the goal of a truly competitive Japanese market,' said Andrew Procassini, president of the (US) Semiconductor Industry Association. The trade agreement calls for 'gradual and steady progress' through 1996, he noted.</p>

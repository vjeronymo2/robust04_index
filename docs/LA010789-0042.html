			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NEW TOM WAITS  </P> <P> In his review of Tom Waits' New Year's Eve at the Wiltern, it seems Robert  Hilburn missed the point entirely ("Waits Backs Away From His Best," Jan. 2).  </P> <P> The piece was more an editorial than a review; more about what Hilburn feels  Waits should or should not be doing with his music.  </P> <P> By any definition, the evening was great. If I understand correctly, the tone  of the piece implied that Hilburn doesn't approve of where Waits has gone  musically in recent years, with new material. Strangely, Hilburn betrays his  obvious unfamiliarity with Waits' recent work, work that originates in growth.  This is insulting coming from a music critic.  </P> <P> The evening was the best New Year's Eve -- of any year. I'm sorry Hilburn  misrepresented the night.  </P> <P> SUZANNE TENNER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Our correspondent today met the vice premier of  Georgia, Irakli Menagharishvili.    [Begin recording] [Menagharishvili] The Georgian authorities  did everything in their power in order to establish the truth.  You know that a special investigatory group has been sent to  Samegrelo region, west Georgia, and another investigatory group  comprising the representatives of the prosecutor's office, and  the Security and Interior Ministries has left together with the  representatives of the Chechen authorities for Groznyy. They  tried there to meet the witness who, according to the Chechen  authorities, had witnessed the fact of Gamsakhurdia's death.  Unfortunately, this meeting did not take place and the witness  has not said yet where the former president is buried.    Our representatives in Chechnya learned only that Zviad  Gamsakhurdia's corpse had been buried in a mountainous zone of  Samegrelo, approximately in the rayon which is still being  controlled by one of the armed groups of his supporters,  therefore, the authorities do not yet have a possibility to  establish the truth by going to the scene.    The official version about the alleged besieging of the  former president and his suicide is doubtful to us as during the  recent weeks no combat or search operations for finding him have  taken place and accordingly, this statement raises serious  doubts.    The demands which our authorities put to the supporters of  the former president are that the supporters officially legalize  the burial place of the deceased so that the official  authorities have a possibility to establish the truth -- what  had happened, and the relevant examination be carried out  followed by a traditionally accepted routine.    Unfortunately, we have not yet received a positive answer to  all these demands and therefore, we have no possibility to tell  the public more details.    [Unidentified correspondent] If the Georgian authorities in  the long run get a positive answer to this demand, and if all  these doubts are confirmed, where will Georgia's former  president be buried?    [Menagharishvili] It has already been officially announced  that we are unanimous in thinking that the burial place of the  former president, whether he is buried in Tbilisi or somewhere  else, must be chosen solely by his family. It has always been a  tradition in our society and nobody is going to break this rule.  [end recording]    [Announcer] Based on Irakli Menagharishvili's words, we  shall  add that in case of a necessity, the Georgian authorities  undertake the responsibility of reburying the corpse, provided  that a qualified forensic examination is carried out and that  every interested party as well as foreign experts are given a  possibility to take part in the examination.</p>

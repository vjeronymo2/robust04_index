			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / UK Company News: CMW Group warns of downturn CMW Group, the USM-quoted architect and planning consultant, has warned that profits for the first half of the current year would be lower than expected. Delays on contracts and reduced fees at Covell Matthews Wheatley Architects have affected both revenue and profit in the second quarter, the company said. Action has been taken to reduce overheads, the costs of which will be provided for in the interim results to be announced shortly. These measures and new commissions will restore margins in the second half, but year-end profits will still be below expectations, the directors added.</p>

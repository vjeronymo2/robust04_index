			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Leeds down after provision A BAD debt provision of Pounds 105.3m dented profits at Leeds Permanent, the UK's fifth biggest building society, during the year to September 30. Pre-tax profits fell almost 20 per cent to Pounds 152.7m (Pounds 190.2m). The society said that the provision, up from Pounds 44.3m in 1990-91, reflected the effects of recession and rising unemployment on the housing market. A further consequence was a deduction of Pounds 38.3m (up from Pounds 13.6m in 1990-91) to reflect irrecoverable interest. However, Mr John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said he was convinced these figures would be better than average for the sector. 'The provision increase was what I expected,' he said. The Leeds was reporting on a financial year that included the difficult fourth quarter of 1991. The society said the number of repossessed properties on its books had increased from 3,000 to 4,000. The number of long-term arrears cases had grown, but short-term arrears had decreased by 22 per cent. 'I don't have to tell you that it wasn't a good year to sell mortgages,' said Mr Mike Blackburn, chief executive, 'completions were down from around 114,000 in the previous year to just under 100,000.' 'It is perfectly clear that when the market improves it will do so slowly,' he added. 'We are not optimistic that 1993 will be much better, and all our business planning has been based on very conservative assumptions of future market activity.' Nevertheless, operating profits (before provisions) increased from Pounds 234.5m to Pounds 258m over the year. Assets increased from Pounds 16.2bn to Pounds 18.3bn. The Leeds merged with the Southdown Building Society during the year, adding 37 new branches and 150,000 customers in the process.</p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Tighter banding gains political currency: Sterling's sharp rise since the election has prompted speculation that the pound may soon be placed in the narrow band of the European exchange rate mechanism - A guide to the ERM and the arguments over changing sterling's status within it What is the narrow band? The ERM is a system for keeping the main European currencies within set limits of each other. The idea of that is to promote monetary stability across Europe and to keep inflation low. In the ERM there are two approaches to tying currencies to each other, based either on narrow or broad bands. Seven of the 10 currencies in the system - including the D-Mark and the French franc - are allowed to fluctuate within narrow, 2.25 per cent bands in relation to each other. The other three - sterling, the Portuguese escudo and the Spanish peseta - have broad, 6 per cent margins. Why is the ERM important? Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has made the ERM the central feature of UK macro-economic policy. It is based on keeping the pound within set limits of the D-Mark, which is regarded as the system's core currency. That is because the German currency is still considered the least likely within the ERM to lose value over the longer term, even though the D-Mark has been under pressure during the past year due to inflation resulting from reunification. The policy boils down to keeping the pound tied in a 6 per cent band around a central point of DM2.95. The upper limit is about DM3.12 and the lower limit DM2.78. Why is Britain now in the broad band? Currencies face all sorts of pressures on financial markets, which mean they can go up or down depending on economic events. Broad bands provide greater leeway for currencies to gain or lose value against the others. When Britain entered the ERM 19 months ago it thought a narrow band would be too restrictive. Mr Lamont, however, has said that the UK will join the narrow band at some point. Why the speculation about entering the narrow band? Since the election, sterling has benefited from a surge in buying from international investors. That has pushed the pound from about DM2.85 before the election to DM2.925 at its London close last night, comfortably within what would be its margins under a narrow band. With a weakening in sterling unlikely over the next few months, it may be a good time to take the plunge. What would it mean? The new floor for the pound against the D-Mark would be about DM2.88 and the new ceiling DM3.01. If the pound looked as if it would rise or fall outside those limits, then under the system's rules central banks from the ERM nations would be forced to sell or buy pounds to keep it in place. Alternatively, Britain would have to reduce interest rates (to keep the pound from going too high) or to increase them (to stop it going too low). How would it help Britain? It would reduce the amount by which sterling can fall against the D-Mark without triggering official action. The theory is implicit support for sterling by governments at some point just above the lower limit would inhibit selling. So what? This is where we get on to interest rates. Assuming the theory worked, Britain would be able to cut interest rates, which have been held at 10.5 per cent since September, without causing international investors to sell sterling. Would a narrow band lead to lower UK rates? Not quite. A key issue is the high level of short-term German interest rates, at present 9.75 per cent. Via the ERM link, those determine borrowing rates throughout the other nations in the system. High German rates, set by the Bundesbank to damp Germany's inflationary surge, have distorted the central philosophy of the ERM, which is based on fairly low levels of inflation and borrowing costs in Germany. ERM nations will find it difficult to bring down rates unless the Bundesbank does so. Other potential problems? Sadly, yes. If the Bundesbank decided over the next few months to push its own rates still higher, a UK move to a narrow band might rebound. That is because more investors would be likely to buy D-Marks, forcing the pound lower against the German currency and possibly dangerously close to its new lower limit in the system. Would a move to a narrow band be widely welcomed? No. Some economists and Tory backbenchers think entering the ERM was a dreadful mistake because it limits flexibility on monetary policy. They would see a move to a narrow band as a further twist of the knife. How about the impact on the rest of Europe? Joining the majority of European countries in narrow bands would underscore the UK's European credentials. It would signal a positive stance on European integration. Would a move to a narrow band help UK recovery? Probably not. So what is going to happen? Mr Lamont will probably want to stay his hand on narrow bands until the summer, to get a clearer idea about the pace of any UK recovery and also about the Bundesbank's next move on German rates.</p>

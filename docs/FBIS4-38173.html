			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F> Razi Barqay; place not given -- live]    [Text] [Barqay] Before we touch upon the political issues,  I would like to refer you to the German television documentary  aired yesterday and ask you whether we know for certain that the  Syrians are involved in Ron Arad's captivity or at least know  about it.    [Peres] We issued official statements on the issue, and  there  is no need for me to repeat them.    [Barqay] If so, let us talk about political matters. When  and where will the negotiations with Jordan start?    [Peres] They are scheduled to start in mid-July on the  border.    [Barqay] On the Israeli-Jordanian border?    [Peres] Yes.    [Barqay] Will you install special trailers on the site?    [Peres] I do not know. These are technical negotiations, and  it makes no difference whether they are held in trailers,  houses, or tents.    [Barqay] At what level will the negotiations be held?    [Peres] I assume they will initially be held on the level of  professionals.    [Barqay] By officials?    [Peres] Yes.    [Barqay] When will you at long last be able to meet face to  face and openly with King Husayn?    [Peres] First of all, I met face to face and openly with the  Jordanian crown prince.    [Barqay] It is not the same.    [Peres] Is it not? All right. [laughs] We will yet get to  that high level.    [Barqay] Has the king promised to meet you and Yitzhaq Rabin  in the foreseeable future?    [Peres] The king made a general announcement you all heard.  He said the time will come when overt meetings are held, but he  did not cite a date.    [Barqay] Sir, what is the main problem between us and  Jordan?    [Peres] The main problem is Jordan. We have no problems with  Jordan. In my opinion, the disputed issues can be settled in a  reasonable manner and within a short period of time. If there  were delays, these were initiated by Jordan and not by us.    [Barqay] I would like to remind you of what you said a few  months ago, that the only thing missing was a pen.    [Peres] That is correct. Meanwhile, what I was referring to  has been signed. You know, people have very short memories. We  talked then about a declaration of principles between us and  Jordan, and such a declaration has indeed been signed.    [Barqay] To quote the prime minister's remarks before the  Knesset committee today, actually nothing is happening on the  Syrian issue. Is that true?    [Peres] There has actually been no breakthrough so far. Our  actions are based on the fundamental assumption that the Syrians  are prepared to make peace, but this assumption has not yet been  corroborated by any steps.    [Barqay] If you have received an official notice, could you  tell us when Christopher will arrive here?    [Peres] Apparently in mid-July. We are very glad he is  coming. We think he plays an important role and is a credible  man. His arrival at this time within these parameters is very  important.    [Barqay] Does his main mission lie on the Jerusalem-Damascus  axis?    [Peres] Yes, but this will not be his only mission. I assume  he will also deal with the Jordanian, Palestinian, and  multilateral issues pertaining to the peace process from the  U.S. point of view.    [Barqay] Where do the speculations about Yasir 'Arafat's  visit to Jerusalem stand?    [Peres] As far as I know, Yasir 'Arafat has at this point  not  asked to visit Jerusalem. You know, we have a talent to  complicate our lives and I see no reason for it. He has not  approached us with a request to visit Jerusalem, and I see no  reason to give answers before questions are posed.    [Barqay] Nevertheless, when he asks, what will be your  reply?    [Peres] I will give the necessary answer then.    [Barqay] Do you have a problem with such a visit?    [Peres] There is definitely a problem, but it is not a  matter  of principle. In principle, he may come to Jerusalem. However,  there are many problems involved, such as the timing and  security. This will not be a simple visit.    [Barqay] Shim'on Peres, thank you very much.</p>

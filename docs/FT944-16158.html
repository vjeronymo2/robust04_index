			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Fisher quits baked bean war Albert Fisher, the food processing and distribution group, yesterday walked away from the UK's baked bean price war, which has seen supermarkets selling own-label beans for 7p a can or less. It has sold part of Stratford-upon-Avon Foods and part of Rowats Foods to Campbell Grocery Products, a subsidiary of the US food group, for Pounds 37.1m. The businesses operate from a site in Stratford which is 80 per cent devoted to canning baked beans in catering sizes. It also cans fruit and vegetables and bottles pickles, mainly for the own label market. In the year to the end of August the businesses contributed Pounds 3.1m to pre-tax profits on turnover of Pounds 39.2m. Mr Stephen Walls, chairman, said the baked bean market had been difficult for a couple of years, and the market for pickles had been equally tough. The shares closed 4p ahead at 48p.</p>

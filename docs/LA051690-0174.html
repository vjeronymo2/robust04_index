			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FASHION;  </P> <P> MICHELE LAMY SOMEHOW KNITS IT ALL TOGETHER  </P> <P> When she was a teen-ager she performed the striptease at county fairs in  France. In time, she settled down and got a law degree.  </P> <P> He was a performance artist who had a street evangelist act, "The Great and  Glorious Reverend Rick."  </P> <P> To pair them up would be either the act of a twisted Hollywood scriptwriter or  a delicious twist of fate. In their case the fates took the upper hand. The  French country girl, Michele Lamy, has become one of the best known clothing  designers in Los Angeles. Her artist husband, Richard Newton, is now a movie  producer.  </P> <P> The unlikely couple live in Hancock Park with their 9-year-old daughter,  Scarlett Rouge, in a white clapboard Colonial house. From the flower-lined  front sidewalk it looks very American. The mailing address could be Anywhere,  U.S.A.  </P> <P> But peeking out from behind the second-story roof line is the telltale sign  that all is not as it seems. A Dijon mustard-colored stucco structure, a studio  addition by contemporary architect Frank Israel, smacks up against the Colonial  clapboards. When they are not gallivanting about town, the Lamy-Newtons hole up  inside the Israel room. That is where the large-screen television, exercise  bike, dining table capable of seating 20, kitchen and two worn sofas are  located.  </P> <P> "There were other houses we liked better, architecturally," Newton said about  his house that he described as "Beaver Cleaver-style." "But Michele wanted to  be in this location, close to everything."  </P> <P> Everything, for Lamy, is a multifaceted career and diverse family obligations.  She heads a $10-million fashion business, owns a retail store, Traction Avenue,  in the Beverly Center and more recently she opened a homey, French bistro, Cafe  des Artistes, in Hollywood.  </P> <P> While other parents keep tabs on their childrens' scout meetings, Lamy's family  obligations include keeping tabs on her daughter's performances in a rock 'n'  roll band, Visiting Kids. She is also the executive producer for Newton's first  movie.  </P> <P> Her fashion designs have bankrolled her diversification. Each season her  collections combine old favorites with new shapes. Among the recurring themes  are her most popular knitwear garments: fly-away vests, tunic tops (both short  and long) and leggings. The silhouettes of her jackets change from season to  season.  </P> <P> For the coming fall she draped web-like constructions of knitted fabric around  the shoulders and waists of her models who wore a basic under-layer of  bustiers, miniskirts and leggings. The close fitting stretchy knit separates  for women are so popular that the I. Magnin Palm Desert store is adding a  full-scale Lamy boutique.  </P> <P> "Because her things are easy fitting and unconstructed, they fit a multitude of  figures and figure problems," said Carolyn Biggs, the store's manager. With  economical price tags starting at $65 the sales associates have found it easy  to sell five or six pieces to each Lamy customer. "We always sell multiples,"  Biggs said.  </P> <P> For a while there was a Lamy men's wear line, but that was short-lived. The  Star Trek look of the clothes, with their stretchy leggings, body-hugging  jackets and the like, were futuristic by any standards -- perhaps too much so  for most men. While the line came and went in just one year's time, there is  speculation among Lamy's staff that it will resurface next year. Customers  still call the designer at her factory, asking for more.  </P> <P> But before there was any of this, there was Lamy the French lawyer. She  switched to a fashion career in 1974 when she began having philosophical  problems with the French judicial system. She says she had more of an affinity  for the people she had to defend than those involved in the legal profession.  </P> <P> When she gave up law, Lamy moved to New York City and started making plastic  jewelry. The accessories business was a logical career change since her family  owns an eyewear company in France. For one year she lived in Manhattan's  Chelsea Hotel, then the hotbed of the emerging punk scene ("the good years,"  Lamy calls them). But in 1975 she was looking for a new direction. Her brother,  who had visited Los Angeles, suggested she move here.  </P> <P> "He told me Los Angeles was like New York City and the Riviera. I came here  just to see how it looked and I stayed. I felt at home when I arrived."  </P> <P> Lamy is a petite woman with piercing eyes, given to wearing rag-tag pieces of  clothing and yarmulkes, who binds her burgundy-colored hair in twists of  fabric. She uses body language more than direct verbal responses. Her voice is  smoky with a heavy Gallic accent.  </P> <P> "I don't feel especially French. I feel like I'm from here," she said. She has  taken to Los Angeles with a vengeance and considers herself a native. It is  only when she speaks that she gives herself away.  </P> <P> Lamy does not look or act like an polished French fashion designer. "I thought  it was nice with my provincial bourgeoise background to look like this," she  said amid the clutter of her office, dressed in an knit shirt that had lost its  memory for elastic response, and a pair of leggings.  </P> <P> Even though she has a multimillion-dollar fashion business, she pointed to her  foot and said, "See? I have a hole in my sock."  </P> <P> For eight years, Lamy and Newton worked together to build the Michele Lamy line  of contemporary knitwear. Newton ran the business and Lamy did the designs.  Eighteen months ago, Newton left to pursue his film ambitions. Lamy took on a  partner, David Guez, to help with the business and to free her time so she was  able to work as executive producer on Newton's "Small White House," a  low-budget film shot in Tijuana. She found the money to produce the film, which  was recently finished. The couple is shopping for a distributor.  </P> <P> "Maybe it's just our temperaments, but Michele and I are good for each other,"  Newton confided, reflecting on their 11 years together.  </P> <P> Since their marriage, Lamy and Newton have become fixtures and catalysts of the  nighttime club scene in Los Angeles. When the trendy nightclub, Flaming  Colossus, was in business they had a special table, where they were likely to  be found on a regular basis. Now that Lamy has her restaurant they are hosting  some of the season's hot-ticket events there.  </P> <P> Several seasons ago Lamy abandoned the formatted fashion shows at the  California Mart in favor of showing at Cafe des Artistes. "The kind of shows  she wanted were more like happenings than fashion shows," remembered Yvette  Crosby who worked at the Mart during the years that Lamy participated.  </P> <P> "The kind of fashion I am doing is not meant for the runways," said Lamy. "It's  made to be lived in. The people are more important than the clothes."  </P> <P> Lamy's fashion shows are a gathering of her friends. She uses them for models,  and when the show is over they move back into the crowd of musicians, artists  and fashion folks.  </P> <P> At her last fashion week show, Anne Crawford, society editor of L.A. Style  magazine, and Barbara Leary, wife of Timothy Leary, were two of the gamboling  manikins in the back yard at Cafe des Artistes.  </P> <P> Before the show Lamy calmly greeted her guests and saw to their comfort. Her  minions dashed about looking for shoes, reseated people and cleared a path for  the models to pass through the shoulder-to-shoulder crowd. In short, it was  bedlam, but Lamy was completely unfazed. She waits until the last possible  minute to plan her shows and lets the details sort themselves out.  </P> <P> Lamy's style can wreak havoc at the office. "Everything is completely  unplanned, there is something unexpected around every corner," said Brian  Watson, one of her employees. But she is also capable of instilling a rabid  devotion from the same people who find her management style unorthodox. "If her  unpredictability is a problem, then it is a problem for us, not her," says  Watson.  </P> <P> Lamy has found her niche in Los Angeles and surrounded herself with supportive  people, who she, in turn, nurtures. "There are a lot of people I like, and I  like the way they see things. It's visual, artistic and tough," she said.  "Here, I feel comfortable in my skin."  </P></p>

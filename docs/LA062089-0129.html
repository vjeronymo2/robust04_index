			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> NEW ELECTIONS LOOM IN GREECE  </P> <P> A political crisis and new elections loomed today as conservative leader  Constantine Mitsotakis was given three days to form a government but was  rejected by a possible left-wing coalition partner.  </P> <P> Both Mitsotakis' New Democracy Party and the communist-dominated leftist  alliance, which together won nearly 60% of Sunday's vote, say a new government  first must punish those responsible for the scandals of the defeated socialist  administration of Premier Andreas Papandreou.  </P> <P> But the alliance of the pro-Soviet Greek Communist Party and the Greek Left  Party, which finished third, turned down Mitsotakis' offer to join in an  interim government that would investigate the corruption.  </P></p>

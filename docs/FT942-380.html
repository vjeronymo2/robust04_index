			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Argyll Sir Alistair Grant, chairman of Argyll, the food group, nearly doubled his remuneration last year, from Pounds 546,000 to Pounds 986,000, with the rise attributable to a Pounds 529,000 payment from a long term incentive plan covering 1991 to 1993. His basic fixed remuneration rose from Pounds 448,000 to Pounds 457,000. Argyll turned in a dull performance for the year ended April 2, with pre-tax profits falling by 13 per cent to Pounds 361.8m and earnings per share 17 per cent down at 22.6p. Many of the group's problems came from its Lo-Cost discount business which, as Sir Alistair put it 'has had to give up profit in order to maintain competitiveness'.</p>

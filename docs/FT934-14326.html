			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Reformers tread different roads to capitalism BEIJING remains distinguished by bicycles, Moscow by dour Stalinist architecture, but arrival of the market economy has produced a similar atmosphere in the capitals of the two former communist superpowers. Central streets of both cities are invariably congested with traffic, street pavements are packed with unofficial market-sellers, while all around construction teams work on sites of luxury hotels and office blocks. Governments in both capitals seem, at least at first sight, to face similar economic challenges. Both are trying to stabilise accelerating inflation by reforms which claw back power from regions. Both know reform depends on stopping the flow of central bank credits to loss-making state enterprises. But outside the two cities these similarities in economic development fade. Moscow is ahead of other cities in outward signs of transition to a market economy. Regional centres, such as Volgograd, show little sign of private entrepreneurship other than kiosks selling western cigarettes and alcohol. Beijing, by contrast, is far from being China's most dynamic city. While Shanghai and Guangzhou in the east and south make the capital look dour and dowdy, other regional centres, such as Chengdu in the west or the northern municipality of Tianjin, also rival Beijing for colour and market-oriented activity. Apparent similarities between economic tasks facing the Russian and Chinese governments fade just as fast. Russia is trying to stabilise inflation of 20 per cent a month, fuelled by credits to collapsing state industries. Chinese inflation is a little over 20 per cent a year because the non-state economy is growing too fast. The same factors which account for the different pattern of regional development explain why China cannot be a role model for Russian reform, according to two Chinese economists, Yingyi Qian and Chenggang Xu. The reason, they argue, lies in very different political and economic structures which characterised the planned economies of both countries. Economic planning in the Soviet Union was highly centralised and hierarchical. Regions specialised in particular industries, while co-ordination and control were centred in Moscow. But China's experiment with Stalinist central planning in the early 1950s was judged a failure, while Beijing had less reason than Moscow to distrust its regional governments. The result is that Chinese planning was much less centralised - by 1978, fewer than half of state enterprises were controlled by the central government. This decentralisation explains why China's relatively autonomous provinces have been the driving force behind reform. Freed from central controls, and keen to find tax revenue, local governments have encouraged emergence of new enterprises. The most dynamic growth has been in rural areas in the form of collective enterprises controlled by town and village administrations. By 1990, these enterprises accounted for a third of industrial output and almost 40 per cent of employment. This growth has enabled China's economy to grow by an average 9 per cent a year since market reforms began in 1978 without attempting to reform the state industrial sector. This sector accounts for only half of output - and is shrinking each year - compared to almost all non-agricultural production in Russia. Meanwhile, decentralisation means China's remaining state manufacturing enterprises are much smaller, averaging 145 employees in 1988 compared to 806 in Russia, and less regionally specialised. After over a decade of growth, reform and partial closure of China's remaining state enterprises look difficult but feasible. In Russia, size and regional concentration of state industry make this task more difficult. But Russia's inflation demonstrates state enterprises cannot be ignored. * Why China's Economic Reforms Differ, London School of Economics, Development Economics Research Porgramme.

countries are currently changing to a new system of compiling trade statistics. All trade figures are seasonally adjusted, except for the Italian series and the German current account. Imports can be derived by subtracting the visible trade balance from exports. Export and import data are calculated on the FOB (free on board) basis, except for German and Italian imports which use the CIF method (including carriage, insurance and freight charges). German data up to and including June 1990, shown in italics, refer to the former West Germany. The nominal effective exchange rates are period averages of Bank of England trade-weighted indices. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA from national government and central bank sources.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

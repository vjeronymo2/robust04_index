			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Management: Northumbrian takes the steam out of bargaining - The water company's controversial moves to change the role of its eight unions It is all very well for companies to deny bargaining rights to trade unions when setting up a new plant. But employers which take representational roles away from unions and give them to organisations they have set up themselves are courting serious industrial relations problems. They rarely try it. Northumbrian Water, which supplies water and treats sewage in the north-east of England, thought the potential rewards were tempting enough for it to make the attempt, although the value of doing so remains to be seen. For the moment, however, it is remarkable enough that Northumbrian has persuaded the eight unions which represent its 1,200 strong work-force that they should give up the lead role in pay negotiations - and that it has done so with remarkably little public criticism from them. The process the company and the unions have recently completed falls short of derecognition. None the less it will mean a significant diminution in power at Northumbrian for the eight unions - Nalgo, the GMB, the TGWU, Apex, Ucatt, the EETPU, the AEU and Nupe - which currently represent the company's employees. Following a recent accord, pay and other matters relating to employees will be determined at a company council consisting of 11 members, four appointed by management and seven elected (indirectly) by the workforce. Although the unions will elect a representative to advise the council, they will not control the selection of the seven employee councillors. Such a scheme strikes at the heart of trade unionism. It is hard to imagine anything like it being accepted in union strongholds like local government or large engineering companies. Yet the unions at Northumbrian, the largest part of the Northumbrian Water Group, were not an easy target. The company is, after all, based in the north-east of England, an area where union traditions are strong. Although the company says the proportion of employees in unions has slipped from a peak in 1979 of about 98 per cent, the present figure, 83 per cent, is still above that at many other organisations. The industrial relations which Northumbrian has experienced in recent years hardly provided a reason for the company's action. True, there was a 31-day strike by manual workers in 1983 but that was part of a national stoppage. National pay bargaining has since been abandoned, following withdrawal by Northumbrian and Thames Water, and at Northumbrian both unions and management believe their relationship since the 1983 strike has been cordial. What then were Northumbrian's motives? Mike Temple, regional personnel advisor and the man who developed the details of the new system, says that the company did not deliberately set out to weaken the power of the unions, even though he does not deny that that has been the effect. 'What we wanted was a better relationship with our employees.' The change in the role of the unions was not a quantum leap by the company, says Temple, but part of a gradual process of developing more teamlike, company-conscious attitudes. 'We want to get rid of the them and us attitude,' says Temple. The idea was encapsulated in rather more grand language in a recent message to employees; this said that all employees, whether manual workers or management, were in the same ''big team', with common vision, mission and values'. As part of the unifying process, staff have been taken through two-day courses, some of which is designed to inculcate values such as recognising other people's points of view and satisfying customer needs. Team briefings have been introduced to help improve internal communications; team working has been increased; and the company is gradually bringing in single status conditions by which everyone will work under the same terms of employment, including holidays, sick pay and pension benefits. Plenty of other companies have adopted similar strategies but Northumbrian saw the way the unions functioned as a barrier to creating the 'big team'. Temple says: 'Trade unions have interests other than the pure success of the company. They each have full-time officers, they each have their own history and prejudices and they each owe loyalties to the TUC and to members outside the company.' At one stage the company considered derecognising all the unions, denying them any role in the company. However, by the time it announced its plans in November, it said it was prepared to recognise one union on the grounds that employees wanted the security of a trade union to represent them. All very well, but none of the unions wanted to relinquish its members at the company. In the end a compromise was reached by which all eight agreed to act as one in a confederation. The unions thus kept their members but most employees believe union powers at the company were none the less very considerably curtailed. Since the ending of national bargaining, pay has been determined by a system in which local full-time officers negotiate with the company. Northumbrian says that in future pay will be determined through the company council, advised both by a confederation representative and a representative of an employee association being set up, in part, for non-union members. The seven company councillors who represent employees will be appointed by members of seven local employee councils who in turn have been elected by the workforce. Issues they will discuss will include health and safety, the role of the business and its performance, research and development and, of course, pay. Quite how pay will be determined is unclear. Temple says he hopes that decisions can be arrived at through members arriving at a consensus rather than voting. The decision is then likely to be put to a ballot. What is certain is that pay rises will be determined through the council, rather than through talks with full time union officers, says Temple. In spite of the changes, Don Macrae, district officer of Nalgo, with about 350 members the largest union there, says the agreement is a long way from the derecognition once feared and 'in practical terms may not make that much difference'. The unions will have representatives on a standing committee to deal with harmonisation of conditions and Macrae believes this committee could have a significant, possibly decisive, influence on pay determination, particularly in the first year. The union confederation will have a right to represent members involved in disciplinary procedures and will have safety representatives on each of the seven area councils. Macrae says that the seven company councillors representing employees are also likely to be active union members and that this has proved to be the case so far. None the less the compromise is far from what the unions would have liked. 'It is what we have got and we will make the best of it,' says Macrae. How then did Northumbrian achieve the changes so smoothly? The unions considered industrial action but it was never a serious proposition. The 1983 strike by manual workers proved that it is not easy to stop water companies doing their business; water still flows even if significant numbers of employees are missing. Northumbrian also helped itself by preparing the ground for change long in advance. As long ago as February 1988, Sir Michael Straker, the chairman, told employees that eight trade unions was too many. The creation of the company council was hinted at last May when Northumbrian set up the seven area councils. The various steps, and the reasoning behind them, have been explained through such methods as team briefing. By the time the proposals were announced there were some unlikely converts to the cause, among them Malcolm Fraser, president of the company's Nalgo branch. Fraser, a union activist for many years, has become the chairman of the employee association, which many see as a rival to the unions, but sees no conflict with that and his Nalgo position. He says the company had had problems relating to employees and creating a common purpose because there were so many different unions and bargaining groups. Union power was always fragmented because there were so many of them and management always had the upper hand in pay talks because of the lack of militancy among employees, he says. 'There was more chance of being kicked to death by a demented donkey than getting members of Nalgo out on strike.' Fraser believes the new system will give employees 'two bites of the cherry' because the employee association will also involve previously unrepresented non-union members. Among ordinary workers, both white- and blue-collar, there is concern that a loss of union power has been designed to weaken the hand of employees. One Nalgo member, who works in Northumbrian's head office in Pity Me, County Durham, says he would have preferred the company to have modified the bargaining system rather than replace it. The main worry is that the employees' lead role in pay determination will be played by ordinary workers, unskilled at dealing with management, rather than full-time union officials. 'People on the company council are not clever enough to represent us,' says Jimmy Metcalfe, a joiner and a member of the Ucatt construction union who has been with the company for 17 years. 'The union officials know all the ins and outs. I think pay could suffer.' The changes, says Metcalfe, appear to be for the company's benefit 'rather than ours.' Comments like that are typical. They demonstrate that the company has some considerable way to go before it succeeds in creating the 'big team' which it says is behind the employee representation changes. The challenge is to ensure that the employees are not alienated.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The effort to have these SDMP sites remediated and decommissioned has been hampered in part because licensees view the absence of definitive radiological criteria as an incentive to defer decommissioning pending issuance of formal NRC requirements. The General Accounting Office (GAO), which has been critical of the Commission's inability to effect timely decommissioning of these sites, has recommended that the NRC enhance its decommissioning efforts by reconsidering its radiological criteria for decommissioning. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> GAO Report to Congress, ``NRC's Decommissioning Procedures and Criteria Need to Be Strengthened,'' GAO/RCED&hyph;89&hyph;119, May 1989.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Until new criteria are in place, the Commission intends to proceed with decommissioning nuclear facilities on a site-specific basis considering existing criteria coupled with the concept that residual radioactivity be as low as is reasonably achievable (ALARA). Case and activity-specific decisions concerning decommissioning of sites will continue to be made as necessary during the pendency of this rulemaking process. Because the SDMP sites could pose unnecessary environmental and public risks or financial burdens if they are not decommissioned in a timely manner, the Commission's effort to effect timely decommissioning of these sites has been proposed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 13, 1993, (58 FR 4099). The NRC published an Action Plan to ensure timely remediation of sites listed in the SDMP in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on April 16, 1992 (57 FR 13389). The NRC does not intend to require additional remediation of sites in response to criteria established in this rulemaking, provided that the licensee or responsible party has already remediated the site or was in the process of remediating the site in full accordance with an NRC-approved decommissioning plan at the time of promulgation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Internationally, most efforts have been focused upon development of criteria for waste disposal and recycle of radioactively contaminated materials using guidance published by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Decommissioning criteria have generally been established on a case-specific basis. This approach is the same as the current approach employed in the United States pending the development of radiological criteria through formal requirements. The NRC staff is not aware of other international efforts similar to this rulemaking to define radiological criteria for decommissioning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Enhanced Participatory Rulemaking Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The normal pattern for NRC rulemaking is the development of a proposed rule by the NRC staff for Commission consideration, publication of the proposed rule for public comment, consideration of the comments by the NRC staff, and preparation of a final rule, as appropriate, for Commission approval. As directed and approved by the Commission, the NRC staff has enhanced participation in the early stages of this rulemaking process through a series of workshops for affected interests. These workshops were held from January through May 1993 in Chicago, IL; San Francisco, CA; Boston, MA; Dallas, TX; Philadelphia, PA; Atlanta, GA; and Washington, DC. The workshops elicited informed discussions of options and approaches for developing radiological criteria, and the rationale for options and approaches. While these workshops were not designed to seek ``consensus'' in the sense that there is agreement on how each issue should be resolved, the workshops were conducted at a very early stage of rulemaking to enhance participation of interested parties and the public with the following objectives:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) To ensure that the relevant issues have been identified;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) To exchange information on these issues; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) To identify underlying concerns and areas of disagreement, and, where possible, approaches for resolution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission hopes that the interactions among the participants in the workshop environment also fostered a clearer mutual understanding of the positions and concerns of all participants. These workshops provided a number of themes, such as consideration of restricted use options, increased public participation in the site decommissioning process, and a desire to return sites to levels indistinguishable from natural background, that form the basis upon which the Commission has developed the provisions of this rulemaking. Comments made at these ``Scoping Meetings,'' the workshops, and related written comments were considered by the NRC staff in its preparation of a staff draft rule as described in the paragraph below. Comments were also used, as appropriate, in developing the Draft Generic Environmental Impact Statement (GEIS) for the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission approved an additional opportunity for enhanced participation at an early stage of the rule development. Copies of the NRC staff's draft rule and summaries of comments received from workshop participants, NUREG/CR&hyph;6156, were sent to NRC Agreement States, workshop participants, and other interested parties on January 27, 1994. A notice of availability of these documents was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and the documents were placed on the electronic bulletin board on February 2, 1994 (59 FR 4868). The intent of this informal comment period in advance of a proposed rule was to provide an opportunity for interested parties to comment on the adequacy of the draft criteria and the extent to which the criteria have considered the range of viewpoints expressed during the workshops and scoping meetings. The comment period ended on March 11, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Concurrent with the NRC rulemaking on radiological criteria for decommissioning, the EPA is proceeding to develop standards and guidance for Federal agencies in the area of radiation protection, including standards for the cleanup of contaminated sites. The EPA National Advisory Council on Environmental Policy and Technology and the Subcommittee on Residual Radioactivity held public meetings in October 1993, February 1994, and May 1994 to discuss the issues associated with the EPA rulemaking. The NRC and EPA have coordinated their efforts in this area in order to ensure that effective and consistent site cleanup standards are established while minimizing duplication of effort. Accordingly, the EPA was an important participant in the NRC rulemaking workshops and is a cooperating agency in the preparation of the GEIS for the rulemaking. The NRC has also consulted extensively with EPA throughout the rulemaking process. It is anticipated that the information gathered during the workshops on the NRC standards will also be relevant and useful to the EPA efforts in the area of site cleanup standards. The objective of the NRC and EPA cooperative efforts is to attempt to reach an agreement that the NRC standards established in the enhanced participatory rulemaking are sufficient to provide adequate protection to the public health and safety for NRC-licensed sites. The EPA efforts could then focus on the site clean-up standards for non-NRC licensed sites, such as DOE and DOD facilities. This is consistent with the principles and procedures set forth in a Memorandum of Understanding between the NRC and EPA published on November 16, 1992 (57 FR 54127), to guide each agency's actions in areas of mutual regulatory concern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The next two sections of this notice summarize the comments from the workshops and the comments on the NRC staff draft rule. The purpose of these summaries is to document the public comments and the NRC response to these comments, and to show how the NRC approach to the rulemaking has evolved as a result of public participation in the rulemaking process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments From Workshops  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On December 11, 1992 (57 FR 58727), the Commission published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a notice that it was preparing to initiate rulemaking on establishing radiological criteria for the decommissioning of NRC-licensed facilities. The notice listed a schedule for seven workshops throughout the United States beginning in January 1993. The purpose of the workshops was to solicit commentary from affected interests on the fundamental approaches and issues that must be addressed in establishing radiological criteria for decommissioning. Written comments on approaches and issues also were solicited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 18, 1993 (58 FR 33570), the Commission published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a notice of intent to prepare a Generic Environmental Impact Statement (GEIS) as part of the rulemaking action on radiological criteria for decommissioning. The notice listed eight meetings throughout the United States to be held in July 1993 for the purpose of discussing and receiving public comment on what should be covered in the GEIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Overview of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Over 7,000 comments were presented at the seven Workshops, eight scoping meetings, and in related letters. The NRC staff considered these comments in the development of the NRC staff's draft rule which was sent to NRC Agreement States, workshop participants, and other interested parties on January 27, 1994. Comments were also used, as appropriate, in developing the Draft GEIS for the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

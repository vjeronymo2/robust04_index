			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed ADS report: "Yuzhuralzoloto and the British </F> RTZ Set Up a Joint Venture To Develop the Svetlinsk Gold  Deposits"]    [Text] The Chelyabinsk-based production association  Yuzhuralzoloto and the British gold-producing company RTZ have  signed a contract in London on creating a joint venture to  develop the Svetlinsk gold deposits, Nikolay Popov, chief of the  material resources department at the oblast administration's  economics committee, announced on 7 April. The deposits'  estimated reserves are 70 tonnes of gold. The decision on their  joint development under RTZ technology was made back at the end  of 1991 during a visit to London by the head of the Chelyabinsk  Oblast administration as part of a Russian Government  delegation. According to Mr. Popov, the joint venture's planned  charter fund will be 100 million rubles. RTZ's share will be not  less than 50 percent. Under the contract, the development of  the deposits will begin after RTZ has conducted a geological  survey and prepared a feasibility report. Deductions from the  state budget for the use of mineral resources will be 4 percent  of the value of the gold produced. Of this sum, 75 percent will  stay in Chelyabinsk Oblast.</p>

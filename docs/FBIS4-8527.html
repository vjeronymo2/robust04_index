			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris </F> Silajdzic by Zdravka Soldic; place and date not given: "It Has  Not Been Agreed That Zubak Will Be the Head of the Federation!"]    [Text] In Sarajevo, Mr. Haris Silajdzic, prime minister of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, is mentioned in the context of being the  future president of the federation in which the Bosniak-Muslims  and Croats will make up the majority. Silajdzic is also  interesting as a protagonist of the Washington agreement, while  we were particularly interested in the attitude of the  Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina toward the Serbian issue in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and its settlement, as well as toward the  question whether the new Yugoslavia that has been much talked  about in the recent days is possible.    In Sarajevo, Silajdzic is considered to be a politician  inclined to the West, although he studied theology in Libya. He  is esteemed by the more moderate Sarajevans, but he does not  enjoy the support of the Islamic community.    [Soldic] Mr. Silajdzic, since the Constitution of the  federation was signed in Washington, the name of Kresimir Zubak,  chairman of the presidential council of Herceg-Bosna, is being  mentioned as that of a candidate for the new president of the  Bosnian-Croatian federation. It is claimed that was agreed in  Washington. However, in Sarajevo, I hear that it is you who is  expected to be the president of the federation.  <H5>  The Media Have Brought About a Lot of Evil </H5>   [Silajdzic] Who will be the president of the federation was  not agreed in Washington. What was agreed is to be found in the  text of the Constitution. There were discussions on that topic,  but no agreements. On this occasion I have to say that the  media are heating up the situation unnecessarily, and that is  not good. The media have already brought about a lot of evil,  and as though they cannot get enough, they seem to be craving  for some more victims. Nothing has been agreed, and if they do  not believe this, let them ask the representatives of the  Croatian people, and they will confirm that. If the issue had  been agreed upon, I would have said so.    [Soldic] According to the new Constitution, the Presidency  of Bosnia-Herzegovina continues its work in the same team, while  it is the president and the vice-president of the federation who  will be elected. Does that presuppose the parallelism of  administration? Does the Constitution clearly say what the  particular authorities of those two bodies are? How are those  two bodies going to function?    [Silajdzic] The Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina remains.  The federation with the Bosniak and Croatian majority is a  single federal unit. The parallelism of administration is  inevitable. We could not leave the federation without  authorizations that are quite necessary. However, if there is  no good will, everything that has been written, everything that  has been established in detail, for instance, that there are no  parallelisms, nothing will be implemented. We wanted to agree  because we wanted that, rather than because somebody forced us  to agree. Other factors helped us to articulate the will  expressed, to surmount difficulties in very difficult  conditions. We are certainly most thankful and indebted to the  United States for all that.    [Soldic] REUTER has reported that President Izetbegovic is  expected to resign within the next month.    [Silajdzic] I do not know whether REUTER has reported, and I  also do not know whether Izetbegovic intends to resign, so the  best thing would be to ask him personally.    [Soldic] The president of the Presidency, Mr. Izetbegovic,  has been reelected as chairman of the Party of Democratic  Action. Can we take that fact as an indicator that Izetbegovic  still intends to relinquish his presidential office to somebody  else?    [Silajdzic] The president has taken up the chairmanship of  the party again, and as for his staying in or leaving the office  of the president of the Presidency, as I have already pointed  out, you should ask him. I am not familiar with that.    [Soldic] The elections for the federation bodies, as well as  the general elections on the level of cantons, have been  announced to take place in six months. How do you intend to  conduct the elections when it is well-known that a large part of  the population has been displaced, while many people are abroad  as refugees?    [Silajdzic] The first task, the most difficult and basic  one, is to ensure the return of the refugees to their homes.  That is the basic precondition for everything. We shall work on  that. I do not know how successful we shall be in it. Again,  everything depends on good will. One must have a lot of  patience and understanding for the people who really suffered so  much. The level of organization must be very high, everything  must be planned and controlled. The people are quite irritable,  one will have to take care not to provoke new clashes. All of  them have awful experiences, wounds that only time will heal.    [Soldic] If the refugees and the displaced do not return to  their homes in the next six months, will that obstruct the  elections?    [Silajdzic] Look, we do not know what will happen in the  next six months. We shall be making efforts to ensure the  return of as many refugees as possible to their homes. I do not  consider myself to be an expert in the field, but I think that  we shall not be able to have all the refugees back in their  homes. Still, I think it is necessary to find a solution, to  organize the civil authorities there, because the refugees will  not be able to return to their homes if the local authorities  are not functioning there.  <H5>  Criminals Will Not Be Forgiven </H5>   [Soldic] At the assembly there was much talk about war  crimes having been committed by both parties. How do you  comment on the statement by Nijaz Durakovic: "In order to  preserve a marriage of interest, witnesses and a good deal of  wedding guests have to be replaced"?    [Silajdzic] I am not accustomed to commenting on other  people's statements. You should ask Durakovic what he meant by  that.    [Soldic] What do you think about war crimes that both sides  committed in the conflict? Is that question going to be  discussed particularly, or has it been made ad acta by the  agreement on the federation, and forgotten?    [Silajdzic] My attitude, the attitude of this government, is  that war criminals must not be forgiven. There must be no  dilemmas about that issue, nor does anybody have a right to  pardon any of them.    [Soldic] In this particular case, will it be the  international institutions that will determine what is a crime  and what is not?    [Silajdzic] I am not a judge. The international  institutions will certainly be involved, though. Nobody has a  right to pardon a crime.    [Soldic] President Tudjman recently talked about the  accountability that the Croatian and Muslim sides share for the  conflict. The president expressed himself in percentages,  saying that the responsibility of the Croatian side for the  breakout of the conflict amounts to 30 percent, while the Muslim  share amounts to 70 percent. Do you agree with President  Tudjman's estimate?    [Silajdzic] I think that one cannot speak about that in such  a way. We deal here with the relations among the living people,  and there is no place there for mathematics. Those whose job  will be to determine the accountability for the conflict, will  estimate that. However, I think that even now everything is  clear, and if somebody still has any doubts about what happened,  he or she should ask the international community.    [Soldic] Why did it take so much time, or precisely a year  and a half, for the agreement to be signed as late as now, as if  nothing had happened? Could the course of events have been  avoided?    [Silajdzic] It could not have been avoided. Because, for  love and peace two parties are needed, while for a conflict a  single one will do. It was about an option that involved quite  definite plans. It is known who triggered the conflict and  where. So, everything is clear.    [Soldic] Who triggered the conflict and where?    [Silajdzic] I believe that is clear to anybody who wants to  know. Unfortunately, those people succeeded in generating such  an unnatural conflict. Why do I say unnatural? Because the  Bosniaks and Croats lived for centuries not only in peace, but  also in real friendship. Therefore, whose interest was supposed  to be satisfied by that conflict? What was the goal? The goal  was the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina. From this fact you can  draw all other conclusions.    [Soldic] Right now, the establishment of the joint  commander of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croatian  Defense Council [HVO] is being worked on. Are you satisfied  with the dynamics of the talks?    [Silajdzic] I know that the talks are going well. Generals  Roso and Delic are working together. As far as I am concerned,  the results achieved so far go beyond my expectations. I hope  they will continue that way. I cannot tell you the details, so  you should ask them.    [Soldic] What is your attitude toward the incident in the  Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina involving Miro Lazovic and  Jadranko Prlic, prime minister of the government of Herceg-Bosna?    [Silajdzic] Lazovic explained later that his behavior was  not right. It was he who caused the incident, so he himself  accounted for it later.    [Soldic] Can there be the federation without the  confederation? The officials of Herceg-Bosna say that if the  issue of confederation were to be called into question, then the  issue of federation would be also called into question.    [Silajdzic] First of all, why should the issue of  confederation be called into question? I do not understand  that. We have to get used to viewing the things positively, and  not always negatively. The war has brought about a terrible  thing: Everybody is looking for trickery, wherever it is  possible. Confederation is a model of cooperation between two  sovereign countries, which is what both sides need. Thereby a  model of very close economic cooperation is developed, which is  necessary for the circulation of people, goods.... In this  confederation, the two sovereign states supplement each other.  There are much more reasons for the confederation to exist,  rather than not to exist. The confederation, of course, must  not encroach upon each country's sovereignty, and I do not  understand why that confederation should not exist.    [Soldic] What was agreed upon in Washington, is the  federation conditioned by the confederation?    [Silajdzic] No, it is not conditioned, but is a matter of  interest. The confederation was not agreed upon because the  statesmen wanted it, but rather because it is in the interests  of the people, and if the people do no want it, then it will not  come about.  <H5>  Serbs Cannot "Take Out" Territory </H5>   [Soldic] Are you familiar with the U.S. intentions regarding  the Serbian side in Bosnia-Herzegovina? Will the Americans  press the Serbs to join the federation, or will they let them to  take out a part of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Silajdzic] The United States cannot allow somebody to take  out a part of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, nor can  anybody else allow that. Bosnia-Herzegovina remains within its  borders, just like Croatia. The internal reorganization of  Bosnia-Herzegovina is its internal affair. With regard to the  fact that the Serbian assembly has definitely rejected the  federation, it will most probably come to the creation of a  federal unit in Bosnia- Herzegovina, with the Serb population  making up the majority. One should know that the U.S. interest  is the cessation of the war in this region. They have many  other problems to deal with. From their point of view, all this  costs a lot of money, it is dangerous, and brings about some  unprecedented things that they cannot allow, because remedying  the consequences would cost much more than their current  engagement. Which is to say, changing the borders is  unacceptable, while genocide cannot be rewarded. It is true  that the U.S. initiative has come about quite late, but better  late than never.    [Soldic] If Karadzic's Serbs were to condition their joining  the federation by demanding confederation with Serbia, what  would the Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina do in that case?    [Silajdzic] Undoubtedly, some affiliation between the  Bosnian Serbs and Serbia will come about. What that affiliation  will be like remains to be seen. In my opinion it is normal for  Serbs to have some connection with Serbia. I personally have  nothing against it. If we want peace, then let it be so!    [Soldic] Is that a creation of a new Yugoslavia?    [Silajdzic] No, a new Yugoslavia is out of the question.  That is the past. Any of these states have to have their  sovereignty, while they will associate with one another to a  degree acceptable to each of them.    [Soldic] Do you think that, after everything that has  happened, the authorities will be able to function if Karadzic's  Serbs accept the federation? I remember the pre-war meetings of  the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina, at which, thanks to the  Serbs, it was impossible to make any decision, because they  found nothing convenient enough for them.    [Silajdzic] The authorities will have to function. We  cannot stop life. It is just like water, it always finds its  way through. The fact is that Karadzic and his aides have  largely mislead the people, they have a mighty propaganda, or  rather the way of spreading lies, but we are obtaining different  information from the field. Foreign journalists go there, in  their territory. We hear from them that people are fed up with  everything, they ask themselves what the purpose of it all is.  Pressure from above is necessary to crush the existing regime,  or else that will be achieved by some other methods.  <H5>  Sarajevo as A Civilizational Achievement </H5>   [Soldic] We can say that the opinions about the role of the  Russians in settling the crisis in the Balkans are disparate.  Some people feel that Russians are working for greater Serbia,  while the others believe that the Americans are using Russians  to put the pressure on Serbs.    [Silajdzic] Again, we have a black-white projection. The  things are different in reality, though. The Russians are doing  things for Serbs, that is unquestionable, but they are also  working together with the Americans. It is certain that many  things are solved between Washington and Moscow. Given such a  situation, we are making efforts to protect our interests. We  cannot influence the presence of Moscow in the region. The very  statement by Churkin, saying that Sarajevo will be divided, is  making us suspicious about whether, perhaps, the new, democratic  Russia stands for fascism, whether Moscow intends to build new  Berlin Walls. Is such a wall supposed to be erected in Sarajevo,  which is a model of multicultural, multiethnic life? Regardless  of whether some will like it or not, that is a fact. Sarajevo is  undoubtedly a civilizational achievement that should be  cultivated, rather than destroyed. In this town there are many  layers of civilization sediments that are proof that people are  capable of living together.</p>

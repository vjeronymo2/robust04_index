			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THERE'S NOTHING FAIR ABOUT THE AIR FARES IN CALIFORNIA'S BUSY NORTH-SOUTH  CORRIDOR  </P> <P> Misleading apologies for airline-industry practices that were articulated by  two Brookings Institution fellows in the June 17 Viewpoints ("Californians  Getting a Fair Deal on Air Travel") merit my response.  </P> <P> * The authors suggest that airline "profits amount to only about 4 cents out of  every fare dollar." But where are the profits coming from? Not the Los  Angeles-to-New York market, where fares are about 3.3 cents per seat-mile. The  profits are coming from the Los Angeles-to-San Francisco market, where fares  have been running 65 cents per mile. The fact is, California fares amount to a  de facto subsidy for out-of-state fares, and that's unfair. The Public  Utilities Commission report revealed that air fares in California, adjusted for  inflation, rose 40% from 1979 to 1988.  </P> <P> The experience of Southwest Airlines, one of the few low-cost airlines today,  exposes the fare-gouging practices of the rest of the industry. Before  Southwest entered the Burbank-to-Oakland market, fares were averaging $186.  After their entry, the unrestricted fare dropped to $59.  </P> <P> * Contrary to what the article suggests, air fares have very little to do with  what it costs to provide service. Even the airline industry itself, at a Senate  committee hearing I sponsored on April 2 at Los Angeles International Airport,  admitted that air fares are based on what "the market will bear."  </P> <P> * Mergers have had a negative impact. Over the last few years, the Department  of Transportation approved every airline merger proposal. As a result, the  eight biggest carriers control 92% of the domestic market. California was  especially hard-hit, losing not only its home-based airlines such as PSA and  AirCal, but also its principal low-fare competitors.  </P> <P> After these airlines were taken over, fares went up and ridership went down in  the north-south corridor -- the busiest in the nation -- to 8 million in 1989  from 12.5 million in 1987. Clearly, fares are having an adverse effect on the  air traveler.  </P> <P> * The authors boast that the number of viable competitors in the Los  Angeles-Sacramento market is up to 3.5 from 2.7. But how can we proclaim the  arrival of competition when all 3.5 charge a $456 unrestricted fare?  </P> <P> If the airline industry will not listen to the public, perhaps legislation to  directly improve competition stands a better chance of getting their attention.  The direction of air fares in California in the months ahead is the message  consumers are awaiting from the airlines.  </P> <P> SEN. ART TORRES  </P> <P> D-Los Angeles  </P></p>

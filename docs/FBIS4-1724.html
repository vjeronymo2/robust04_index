			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Russian Opposition Groups Demonstrate To Honor 1993 </F> October Incident" -- XINHUA headline]    [Text] Moscow, April 2 (XINHUA) -- About 5,000 people  today demonstrated outside the White House, the former  parliamentary building, to commemorate the victims of the  political incident six months ago.    The list of the dead was read aloud at the rally which was  organized by the Labor Russia Movement and other opposition  parties, the INTERFAX NEWS AGENCY said.    The demonstrators carried red banners and Soviet flags, and  laid wreaths at a symbolic grave near the White House.    At least 140 people were killed during the October 3-4  confrontation between government forces backing President Boris  Yeltsin and defenders of the old Parliament -- the Supreme  Soviet.    After Yeltsin dissolved Parliament on September 21, the  opposition leaders holed up in the White House and announced  they would form another government.    A battle started on October 3 as armed supporters of  Parliament launched attacks upon the mayor's office and the  television headquarters. The next day, Yeltsin sent tanks and  troops to force Parliament leaders to surrender.    The Parliament building, which was damaged in the battle,  has  been repaired and is now headquarters for the Russian Government.</p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Inventive managers on course for disaster Most businesses face a crisis which threatens their survival at some stage in their life but small, high-technology companies, are particularly vulnerable, writes Charles Batchelor. High-technology businesses often face strains because they are growing quickly while they operate in unstable or rapidly changing markets with new and untried products. They face similar problems to non-tech businesses but, unlike those businesses, succumb more rapidly when difficulties arise. The vulnerability of high-tech companies and the management approaches required to increase the chances of success are the main themes of Gambling on Growth: How to Manage the Small High-Tech Firm, by Stuart Slatter. A survey of small, high-tech companies showed the most common causes of crises were weak general management, poor financial controls, product competition and problems in diversifying and making acquisitions. Most of the problems of weak general management arose because the founder of the company was a master of technical detail but lacked general management skills or because he was unable to manage growth. Financial controls were most commonly poor in the areas of cash flow forecasting, costing and budgeting. Often, company information systems focused on matters which were wrongly assumed to be important to the success of the business. In a fast growing company, control systems need constant revision, writes Slatter, an associate professor at London Business School. Small, high-tech businesses compete on the basis of their product technology but they are not usually able to defend their technology by means of patents. The product life cycle may be shorter than it takes to obtain a patent; the time and costs involved may be too high for a small firm; and large competitors can often find a way round a patent. Diversification is often used by a company to reduce its dependence on a single successful product but it can lead to a loss of focus. Acquisitions can be dangerous because one ill-conceived deal can bring a small company to the point of insolvency. Published by John Wiley. 320 pages. Pounds 24.95.</p>

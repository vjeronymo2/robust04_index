			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / UK Gilts: Slope of yield curve makes a sudden reverse COGNOSCENTI of the gilt-edged market have had to blink hard in the past two weeks, and not just because of the pound's dramatic exit from the European exchange rate mechanism. Another factor making the period stand out is that the gilt yield curve, which has been downward sloping for virtually all the past 10 years, has changed suddenly to move upwards, as a result of altered expectations about interest rates and inflation. Owners of short-dated bonds have seen the value of these financial assets appreciate significantly over the past two weeks, while long maturing bonds are now priced less attractively. According to Mr Nigel Richardson at SG Warburg Securities, the trend should continue in the coming months, with the result that yields for long-dated bonds climb from around 9 per cent now to 10 per cent by autumn next year. Behind such speculation is the changed perceptions about how UK economic policy will be managed. With the pound outside the ERM - and the UK government appearing to be in no hurry to seek re-entry - the central plank of the Treasury's economic strategy has been shattered. Without a fixed exchange rate target, Britain is reasonably free to cut short-term interest rates with reference to little more than what seems justified by UK economic conditions. The chances are that base rates, which Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, cut from 10 per cent to 9 per cent last week, will come down further to 8 per cent by the end of the year and perhaps 7 per cent by mid-1993. Such changes, so many industrialists and consumers hope, could stimulate a recovery from the longest UK recession for 50 years. The reasoning about changes in base rates explains why yields on short-dated stock have come down. On Friday night the benchmark Treasury 8 3/4 per cent bond maturing in 1997 had a yield of 8.38 per cent, nearly half a percentage point lower than the previous week. Its price was quoted at 101 7/16 , more than 1 1/2 points up compared with the previous Friday. Long-dated bonds, meanwhile, saw a rise in yields of roughly 20 basis points (a fifth of a percentage point), with a corresponding decline in prices, because of worries that over the next few years inflationary impulses will be kept less in check, due to the absence of the ERM restraint. Another aspect that has changed the picture for gilt investors was the large Bank of England intervention on September 16 - Black Wednesday - in the UK's vain effort to prop up the pound. The Pounds 10bn to Pounds 15bn estimated to have been brought into the Treasury's coffers through the Bank's selling of D-Marks from its currency reserves for pounds will now count towards the public sector borrowing requirement, reducing the need to issue gilts. That means, according to gilt market estimates, that the government needs to issue only between Pounds 1bn and Pounds 5bn of gilts until the end of the financial year on March 30 in order to fully fund the PSBR, assuming this latter figure is about Pounds 33bn. The Bank's strategy for the time being seems to be to concentrate on issuing index linked gilts - it has sold Pounds 1.1bn of these bonds since the ERM suspension - because of theories that such bonds should prove attractive to investors in the event of a swelling in inflationary pressures. The good news for gilt investors is that the lack of immediate need for the Bank to issue large volumes of new gilts to fund the 1992-1993 PSBR  - although it still has to worry about the borrowing requirement for 1993-94, projected to be more than Pounds 40bn - should put a floor under gilt prices. However, on the other hand the feeling that inflation could turn out to be a problem for the UK - if not in the immediate future, then in a year or so's time - could make some investors decide that gilts are no longer such a good bet as they have appeared in the past year, and switch more of their funds into equities or non-sterling denominated bonds instead.</p>

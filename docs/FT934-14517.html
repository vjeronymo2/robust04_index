			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Senate backs Clinton on Somalia President Bill Clinton was reported to be 'delighted' with the Senate vote in the small hours of yesterday morning supporting his policies in Somalia, Jurek Martin reports from Washington. The Senate vote, 76-23, backed funding for US military involvement until March 31, the withdrawal deadline set by the president last week. On Thursday Senator Robert Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat, had withdrawn an amendment requiring an earlier withdrawal. The Senate also defeated, by 61-38, a motion advanced by Senator John McCain, the Republican from Arizona, that would have confined funding only to the withdrawal of US troops. The divisions were not on party lines. Senator Bill Bradley from New Jersey, the progressive Democrat, was as adamantly opposed to US engagement in Somalia as Senator McCain, who is very conservative.</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Odd couple's testing tiffs: David Buchan and Quentin Peel examine emerging strains in a relationship that has underpinned European unity for decades Paris and Bonn are getting on each other's nerves - badly. With an election season in full swing in Germany and getting under way in France, fits of mutual pique could develop into a more serious rift with consequences for other members of a European Union that is shortly to come under successive German and French presidencies. The German foreign ministry yesterday called in Mr Francois Scheer, France's ambassador in Bonn, to complain about his comments to German journalists that Germany had taken a heavy-handed - and in Paris's view, unhelpful - line in the negotiations to admit Nordic countries and Austria to the EU. But Mr Scheer was just echoing his masters' voice. A French minister said yesterday Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister, had 'irritated us with his dynamism' in enlargement talks. In a counter-productive bid to push enlargement along, Mr Kinkel had misled new members into thinking they could get away with partial acceptance of EU rules, and had thus 'delayed' conclusion of enlargement talks, the minister complained. This row, full of portent for the future, awkwardly coincides with two emotion-charged historical brouhahas. One concerns Germany's possible presence at the 50th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy this June. Chancellor Helmut Kohl would love to be invited, if only to show his electorate how solidly he has reconciled Germany with its former enemies. But fearful of a backlash from army veterans, older Gaullists and even some wartime allies, the French government is hanging back. It has even shelved its earlier idea of holding some kind of Franco-German commemoration on May 8, the 49th anniversary of the end of the second world war, because Mr Kohl does not want to be fobbed off with second best. For his part, Mr Kohl has turned down the request of France as well as the US and the UK to mark the final departure of their troops from Berlin this summer with a military march-past. Instead, he is planning a German torchlit parade, with perhaps questionable historical connotations. There are other pinpricks to the relationship. They include: France, awaiting further guarantees that the European Parliament will remain in Strasbourg, is blocking legislation that would, inter alia, give Germany 18 more Euro-seats for its eastern Lander. A German diplomat went to Paris recently to warn that German political parties would take it 'seriously amiss' if they did not get extra Euro-seats in time for June's European Parliament election. France's largest promised investment in eastern Germany is threatening to turn sour, with Elf-Aquitaine, the newly privatised oil company, trying to evade part of its commitment to sink DM3bn (Pounds 1.1bn) into a showcase refinery at Leuna. Worried about rising unemployment and his falling popularity in that region, Mr Kohl has complained to the French government. France's industry minister, Mr Gerard Longuet, recently complained that 'Germany has to accept there are other industrial countries in Europe', expressing frustration at the lack of Franco-German co-operation in cars, high-speed trains and energy. Many such tensions would pass unnoticed between other countries. But expectations of the Franco-German relationship are very high, precisely because of what the two countries have achieved since they signed their Elysee friendship treaty 31 years ago. Indeed, the traditional way of giving the relationship a shot in the arm is for the leaders of both countries to announce some grand new initiative. But of new ideas, there seem to be few. One exception is a French plan for a joint armaments agency with Germany. But its adoption at this summer's bilateral summit is uncertain, because Mr Kohl is preoccupied with an electorate unappreciative of military spending. The Maastricht treaty, of course, gives Paris and Bonn a long-term agenda, and the two countries have weathered a series of strains in the past year - over currencies, Bosnia and the Gatt negotiations. But their latest spat over enlargement bodes ill for the future, precisely because there will be future admissions to the EU from central Europe. Paris is not questioning whether Union membership should be increased - it accepts its inevitability  -but it is raising the question of how this should take place. The rock on which the Franco-German partnership has recently rested is the solid understanding built up by Mr Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand in their 80-odd meetings over the past decade. But, in this curiously top-down alliance, what happens when the top changes? Would it be the same if a President Jacques Chirac came to power in France next year, representing a more hard-nosed Gaullism, or if Mr Rudolf Scharping's Social Democrats were to win a share of power at this October's federal German election, bringing in an anti-militarism that could thwart France's ambitions for common European defence? For all the ministerial encounters in Franco-German summits every six months for the past 31 years, the political classes of the two countries are not close. Their institutions and parties differ too much. On the left, French and German socialists have long maintained contact, but on the right there is no unified conservative party in France to talk to Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats. However, the history of the relationship is one of trying to create links at all levels. For instance, the prospect of monetary union is pushing the National Assembly and the Bundestag closer. It was striking early this year that Mr Jean-Claude Trichet presented his first public testimony - as governor of the newly independent Bank of France - to the Bundestag in Bonn a few days before he did so to the National Assembly in Paris, and even more striking that this passed without comment in France. Greasing the often creaky wheels of the Franco-German locomotive is a network of French and German bureaucrats who have spent some time in each other's countries, civil service colleges and administrations. The French and German foreign ministries each take in two diplomats from the other country for one or two years. This exchange has operated for some seven years. Since 1947 France's Ecole Nationale d'Administration (ENA), which has no direct equivalent in Germany, has taken nearly 300 Germans into its prestigious courses. Many of them, fluent in French and often with French wives, are now high in the German administration, such as Mr Joachim Bitterlich, Mr Kohl's foreign policy adviser. They have long-standing personal contacts with their fellow enarques in all reaches of French political and business life. A far smaller number of French has passed through the Bundesakademie, the German civil service college. Similarly, military links are being forged with the creation in 1989 of the Franco-German brigade and the establishment this year of the Strasbourg headquarters of the Eurocorps despite cultural differences. The reformed postwar German military tradition of the 'citizen in uniform' is at odds with the unreconstructed authoritarianism of the French military. Germans in the brigade find French officers downright rude at times, while French find German officers long-winded in their politeness. But by far the biggest point of contact between the two countries is, of course, business. They are each other's biggest trading partner. In 1992 France took 13 per cent of Germany's exports, and Germany 17 per cent of French exports. For a long time, the relationship was largely one of trading goods across the Rhine, though the German chemical companies started to invest directly in France in the 1970s, partly to satisfy French farmers' appetite for fertiliser, while French investment in Germany only caught up a bit with the fall of the Berlin Wall. But French investment in Germany still only totals DM12.7bn, putting France in sixth place (behind the UK), while Germany has invested DM22.7bn in France, making it the second-largest investor behind the US. Because of the labour-heavy investments in eastern Germany, slightly more Germans (250,000) now work for French subsidiaries than French (220,000) do for German subsidiaries. This half-million labours under sharply contrasting management cultures and styles, though management goals of investing for the long term are increasingly similar. 'It would be hard to find two more different cultures  -France is very centralised and everything happens in Paris in a very urban environment. In Germany it is just the opposite, and the French find it hard to adapt to the very different environments of Hamburg, Munich, Berlin,' says Mr Roland Berger, a German management consultant. Mr Berger finds the French 'equally puzzled by the decentralised German corporate structure. German corporate law puts the responsibility on the company board, and German companies tend to be managed by a team of different specialities on those boards.' Mr Rene Laserre, of the Paris Institute for the Study of Contemporary Germany, echoes this. 'With us it is a monarchy, a presidential system, while German companies have a parliamentary system.' He also points to the difference between French and German labour relations. 'It is two different worlds,' says Mr Laserre. 'In Germany, mitbestimmung (co-determination) for the workers in management decisions really means that, while in France the role of the comite d'entreprise (worker's council) is purely consultative.' As a result, it is almost impossible to exchange shopfloor managers back and forth across the Rhine. Because of these differences, 'it is essential companies allow their subsidiaries a lot of freedom', says Mr Berger. In addition to the publishing group Bertelsmann, with its thriving magazines in France, examples of successful cross-Rhine management include St Gobain's relationship with Vegla, its large German subsidiary, Hoechst's relationship with Roussel-Uclaf, the French pharmaceutical company it controls, and Alcatel's relationship with SEL, its telecommunications subsidiary in Germany. But some managements, particularly on the French side, are too pushy, Mr Laserre claims. The bid by Credit Lyonnais to link up with Commerzbank was doomed to failure because the state-owned French bank wanted to rival Commerzbank in its home market, he says, while newly privatised Banque Nationale de Paris's (BNP) co-operation with Dresdner Bank is working precisely because it is limited to third countries. He claims Thomson, the French electronics group, demoralised the staff of its Telefunken acquisition by managing it from Paris. Both these setbacks concern French state-owned companies, of which German businessmen are highly suspicious. A survey by Heidrick and Struggles, the management consultant, of the top 200 companies in France and Germany showed 45 per cent of the top French managers had worked for the state, and only 8 per cent on the German side. This is why France's current privatisation programme - despite its side-effect in freeing Elf to reconsider its commercial view of the Leuna project - has a wider importance in enabling French managers to adopt the same private-sector attitudes as their German counterparts. A common culture in the broader sense is what the new Arte television station aims to foster. Set up by President Mitterrand and Mr Kohl after German reunification, it broadcasts in French or German (with subtitles in the other language). It has about 2 per cent of the audience in France and a bit less in Germany. Not much, but this corresponds, according to Mr Olivier-Rene Veillon of Arte, to the number of French and Germans who speak each other's language. It is very revealing of differing Franco-German habits and tastes. 'We find that French and Germans don't laugh at the same thing,' says Mr Veillon. 'Only Anglo-Saxon productions like Monty Python or Fawlty Towers make Germans and French laugh equally.' Arte makes a brave effort to get the two countries to face their sorry past. When it aired a documentary called War of the Screens, examining French and German government wartime propaganda use of television, Arte's audience rose to 4 per cent. Every Sunday, too, Arte runs film from both sides of the same events in the second world war. 'It is very important for countries which are so dependent on each other to know each other better,' says Mr Veillon. France and Germany face a tricky transition. Their last war is not distant enough to avoid painful anniversaries, yet too distant for new generations of leaders on both sides of the Rhine necessarily to feel the same commitment to unity. It is clearly too early to pronounce the Franco-German relationship has so deepened that it can survive unscathed any changes at the helm.</p>

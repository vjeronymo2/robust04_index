			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslaw Kebich to </F> the Defense Ministry officers staff on 25 March; place not  given: "We Should Maintain the Armed Forces"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] What does the current economic  situation look like? It is extremely dangerous. Let us look at  it objectively. The picture is ambiguous. It cannot be painted  in only one color; for example, black or white, or, moreover,  pink.    For one thing, the drop in production is continuing,  furthermore, over the last few months, this problem has sharply  exacerbated. For another thing, market supply and demand  mechanisms are gradually beginning to work. Before, for  example, workers at the Motor Vehicle or Television Set  Factories would have never thought that someone would not buy  their products. Everything that was produced by them was  centrally distributed. Currently, a key question is: Will our  television sets, motor vehicles, tractors, or other goods be  bought?    The first signs of competition are appearing. The movement  toward the market has begun, though with mighty efforts and in  low gear. However, this is not the sort of a market which we  are longing to set up and which has made people of many states  wealthy. Currently, with us, economic freedom correlates with  the economic irresponsibility of many businesses in their  relations with partners, consumers, and the state.    However, this is also caused by the lack of reliable legal  protection for our citizens and enterprises. Over the decades,  our economy, its costs, technologies, wages, and profits have  been formulated according to mechanisms other than those of the  world economy. Production was oriented toward relatively cheap  fuel and raw materials, at considerably lower transportation  costs. It is impossible to immediately integrate into the  global price system, which has a fundamentally different  structure.    What issue is the most acute today? Prices for energy  resources. The point is that nearly our entire economy is based  on energy- intensive technologies. The gap between domestic and  world prices for oil was as big as nowhere else. The cost of  oil stood at 7 percent the world price. Currently, those  proportions have abruptly altered. Up to 60 percent of prices  for energy resources approach world levels, which makes our  goods noncompetitive. [passage omitted]    Our position is as follows:    1. To keep the budget deficit at last year's level;    2. To considerably cut and gradually rescind grants and  subsidies to producers, and direct them toward consumers;    3. To increase state financial aid to the population. These  financial subsidies should be granted only to people who are in  sore need of them;    4. To minimize the issuing of bank credits on favorable  terms; to foresee the allocation of budget means to lower  interest rates for granting credits to priority branches and  businesses;    5. To reject administrative methods when setting up a state  currency fund; to use a single exchange rate for state needs and  rescind the tax on currency revenues;    6. To introduce payments in some institutions of the social  sector;    7. To reduce the number of enterprises which receive state  subsidies. A producer who is unable to organize effective  production without being financially supported by the state  should either restructure his production or close down,  according to the Law on Bankruptcy.    These main directions of the government's activities were  adopted by the Supreme Soviet and we are doing everything  possible to implement them. [passage omitted]    To resolve cadre issues, the Cabinet of Ministers adopted a  resolution to set up a military academy. All of us understand  its importance. Costs for training the senior military staff  will be decreased by five times. However, it turned out that  not all the opportunities for attracting military researchers  and setting up the academy's scientific potential -- as stemming  from the Republic's opportunities -- were sorted out.    In my opinion, it is worth recalling that we have two  excellent military colleges to train officers, as well as a  Suvorov secondary military school. It is necessary to use their  capabilities to train foreign citizens, raise the issue of more  extensive student exchanges. This could lower the cost of  training even further.    Enough time has passed in which to create the Armed Forces.  Their restructuring will have to be finished by 1 January 1995.  It is high time to raise the issue of an officer's honor and  dignity, the fulfilling of the military oath.    We consider it to be a serious failure of the Defense  Ministry that a number of officers are ready to leave their  fatherland after they have taken their oath of loyalty. Their  patriotism proved false. They are ready to leave the fatherland  and lose their citizenship for a better salary abroad. Is this  not a training problem, a result of our faulty staff policy?  This serious failure, which led to the dismissal of a range of  first class officers for the sake of preserving those who were  considered to be our future and did not live up to our  expectations.    The government realizes these dangerous processes and  understands their destructive impact on the Armed Forces. The  issue of maintaining the staff is likely to be a key one in  keeping the Army up to snuff. To improve their living  standards, the government is going to adopt a resolution to  substitute their food rations with monetary compensations and to  later increase them. We are looking for opportunities to  increase the basic allowances for military ranks in May-June.    Given the current economic situation, we cannot provide for  the introduction of contract service in our Armed Forces. This  demands that a radical staff reduction and severe expenditure  increases be introduced; and that 100 percent of all servicemen  -- from a private to a general -- receive housing facilities.  At the moment, this problem is one of the most acute and  difficult to resolve.    The government is concerned by the fact that some 15,000  servicemen have no housing. Of these soldiers, one in every  three has been transferred to the reserves. Those servicemen,  who were transferred to the reserves and listed as requiring  better housing conditions after 1 July 1992, have no right to  state housing. However, their allowances and pensions do not  allow them to engage in building their own houses or apartments.    Therefore, we take all measures to build houses and  apartments for servicemen, including those in the reserves, at  state expense. In the immediate future, these issues will be  discussed at the Presidium of the Cabinet of Ministers. During  negotiations with the United States, we agreed that $10 million  out of the $25 million which the United States will provide to  aid the conversion of our defense industry will be spent on  building housing for servicemen, and $5 million -- for the  retraining of officers in the reserves.    It is a well-known fact that under a market system, the Army  should be completely financed by the state. The ideas of some  primitive politicians that the Army could be maintained at the  expense of some commercial structures are not only  self-deceiving but, in some sense, directed at demoralizing and  undermining the defense capabilities of the Armed Forces.    A complicated economic situation engenders a desire to  immediately upgrade the economy at the expense of the defense  system, and this must absolutely be ruled out. At the same  time, the inaction of the Defense Ministry on issues related to  the rational use of existing housing facilities is also  inadmissible. For years, in big cities, empty buildings have not  been used and nobody leases them. Many agreements have been  signed with Russia, Ukraine, and other republics, however, they  are being introduced very slowly. This is another extreme  situation connected with the sluggishness and misunderstanding  of time which demands that active measures and perseverance be  used.    More and more new issues arise in both the economic and  military areas. Their resolution is impossible without  cooperating closely with other states, first and foremost, with  Russia. I will give you two examples. Belarusian enterprises  can produce only 3 percent of our required armaments and  hardware. Belarusian repair enterprises can handle only 2  percent of armaments and hardware out of 4,000 types which our  Army utilizes.    You know that the government is consistently working in the  direction of setting up a close economic union, in particular,  the financial and monetary union, with Russia. Similar work is  being conducted in the military sector. We are sure about its  positive results and that they will serve as a good basis for  the implementation of the planned military building. But we do  not exaggerate the results of this unification and do not relax  while waiting for it to happen.    As head of the Belarusian Government, I declare that the  government is undertaking, and will continue to undertake  various measures aimed at maintaining the Armed Forces. The  Defense Ministry will no longer ask other ministries and  departments for means to maintain the Army.    The entire process of military building and Army  restructuring will be based on "state orders" to ensure the  provision of the Army with hardware and armaments. According to  the Armed Forces' demands, the state buys equipment, which  cannot be produced in Belarus, abroad. We hold out hope that  cooperation in the military sphere will be of importance, as  well.    To implement these programs to reform the Armed Forces,  resolving the social issues of the officers corps, the military  budget will shortly be indexed.    However, the Defense Ministry should also learn how to earn  money. The work of the Commercial Department should be  upgraded. [passage omitted]    We all are unanimous: We must maintain the Armed Forces!  Our defense should be reliable and stable. Esteemed Officers,  you play the key part in this process. Your dignity and the  state analysis are the basis for our defense capability and the  stability of the state, lawfulness, and discipline in the troops.</p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Letter: Chancellor foregoes 'green tax' on company cars Sir, Having decided to reform the structure of company car taxation, I believe that the chancellor has missed a golden opportunity to tax company cars on a more environmental basis. While it is true that the new proposals will remove the discrimination against diesels, they do little else to promote fuel economy and through this minimise pollution. Would it not be better to tax company cars on the basis of a composite of three Department of Transport fuel consumption figures? That measure would inevitably promote fuel efficiency and reduce pollution and would also be a rather more relevant tax for the 1990s.

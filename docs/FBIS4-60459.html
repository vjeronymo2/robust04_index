			<p>BFN     [Text] Commenting on the Israeli military operation in  al-Biqa', Hizballah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah said the  kidnapping of al-Dirani has more implications than the enemy has  announced regarding the need to secure information about the  detained Israeli airman. He said the operation was designed to  achieve political objectives in Lebanon. He called for dealing  with this incident with the same importance and objectives given  it by the enemy.    Shaykh Nasrallah emphasized that this cowardly action  confirms the inability of the Zionists to face the heroes of the  resistance who are confronting the enemy's oppression and forces  in broad daylight, recalling the heroic steadfastness of the  mujahidin during the seven-day war.</p>

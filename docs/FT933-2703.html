			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Management: The sorry tale of Tom and Lisa - Tim Dickson became an extra at a training session on sexual harassment presented in the form of a drama The action takes place on a Friday afternoon near Maidenhead, England, in and around the offices of MaST, a human resources development consultancy. Running time: approximately three hours. ACT ONE (The prologue) Enter 30 personnel and training officers (potential clients), a couple of journalists and various MaST 'facilitators'. All sit, expectantly, facing the stage. The concept of business theatre - 'to challenge and stimulate people to think in new and different ways' - is explained. ACT TWO (The play within a play) Enter Tom and Lisa, sales colleagues who share an office. Tom is carrying a copy of Madonna's book Sex. He fancies himself - and Lisa. He makes a number of suggestive remarks in the course of a discussion about an important sales contract. Lisa is not amused. ('I make my living by selling our products. If you want sex, stick to Madonna.') Tom fails to take the hint, first puts his arm round her, and later runs his finger down her arm. On the strength of this she lodges a complaint. ACT THREE (The dilemma) The play is halted. The 'audience' of personnel officers and journalists is divided into two groups to assess the action so far, to explore ways of resolving the conflict between Tom and Lisa, if possible through mutual agreement or reconciliation, if necessary through the law. The two groups separately interview and counsel the actors who respond in the characters of Tom and Lisa. Each group then briefs one actor on what to do next, the hope being that the drama will end with the sales duo amicably at their desks and the legal cloud lifted. Earnestness and political correctness are in plentiful supply. No one doubts that Tom is the cad. Debate centres on how to rebuild a harmonious working relationship. Efforts to suggest to Lisa that she might just loosen up a touch and to explain why Tom might have got carried away - his previous colleague Alice was evidently a bit of a flirt - leave her unconvinced. The other group instructs Tom to go back to the office, apologise to Lisa, and lay down clear behavioural guidelines to govern their relationship in future. INTERVAL (tea and biscuits) ACT FOUR (The denouement of the play within a play in which the actors ad lib in character) A surprisingly self-satisfied Tom is just putting the telephone down as Lisa arrives for work. They begin - falteringly - to consider possible ground rules. Both seem to be going through the motions. After a minute or so, of discussion, Tom announces that their conversation is a bit academic; he has just accepted a job with one of the company's big customers. ACT FIVE (The epilogue) Enter Dianna Yach, MaST consultant and legal expert. She explains that the drama A Bit of Fun can be used as a tool for spreading awareness about sexual harassment, a training programme, or an assessment vehicle. Yach emphasises that sexual harassment poses a serious financial threat to companies, as well as being an important human issue. Attitudes towards acts of harassment, particularly sexual harassment, are hardening and industrial tribunals are more willing to mark their disapproval in enhanced awards against employers. Following a decision last month in the European Court of Justice (Marshall v Southampton and South West Hampshire Area Health Authority) the upper Pounds 11,000 limit on equality compensation in the UK has been declared unlawful. Employers are vulnerable, insists Yach, unless they can show that they have taken clear and positive steps to investigate a complaint, and taken positive action should the complaint appear justified. Tribunals are interested in the effects of behaviour, so it is not a defence to allege that the individual meant no harm. As one UK law firm discovered last year, employers can be held liable for what goes on at the office Christmas lunch.

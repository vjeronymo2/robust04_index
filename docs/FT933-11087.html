			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Banks fail to stem selling despite Pounds 27bn support operation: Future of ERM in balance THE BATTLE of wills between currency investors and European governments was unresolved last night after unprecedented intervention by central banks failed to prevent further heavy selling of weak currencies. After the Bundesbank and other European central banks spent an estimated DM50bn to DM70bn (Pounds 19bn-Pounds 27bn) buying the French and Belgian francs and Danish krone, all three currencies ended European trading on or close to their floors in the exchange rate mechanism. By comparison, an estimated Pounds 15bn was spent to support sterling last September 16, the day it was forced out of the ERM. International investors including pension funds, big companies and hedge-fund speculators stepped up their selling of weak ERM currencies, believing that the strains would soon force either a broad ERM re-alignment or a suspension of the rules keeping the system in place. The second consecutive day of hectic currency trading also forced a weakening in the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo. It largely obscured an effort by French government officials to persuade the Bundesbank to make a more substantial cut in interest rates after its largely technical move on Thursday. The French authorities are believed to be trying to force the Bonn government to choose between calling for a politically sensitive devaluation of the franc, and exerting discreet pressure on the Bundesbank to lower short-term rates. 'It is a trial of strength,' said one European monetary official. In Germany, Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, a Bundesbank council member, appeared to hold out the possibility of an escape route from the turmoil by saying the central bank would not stand in the way if money market interest rates threatened to fall below the central bank's 6.75 per cent discount rate. That was interpreted as a softening in the Bundesbank's approach. Action by the central bank on Thursday in keeping its discount rate unchanged while cutting its less important Lombard rate half a percentage point triggered the two days of tumult. The intense discussions yesterday between central bankers and finance ministry officials in Europe are likely to continue this weekend in a bid to resolve the crisis. Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister who is seeking to keep the existing franc/D-Mark parity, reacted coolly to the day of high drama, saying the ERM rules 'were working well'. He added later: 'France will not allow anything to be imposed upon it.' However, for much of yesterday's trading, the French and Belgian francs and the krone were at their floors against the D-Mark, despite huge intervention from the central banks. When official ERM trading closed at 4pm in London, after which central banks are not obliged to intervene, the French franc and krone drifted well below their permitted levels. After 4pm, the franc fell as low as FFr3.433 to the D-Mark, about a 1/4 of a centime below its permitted floor at FFr3.4305. It later recovered to close in London at FFr3.42, a fall of 0.3 centimes on the day, but eased in New York to FFr3.429. The krone finished at DKr3.9025 to the D-Mark, weaker than the permitted level of DKr3.9016. France's refusal to allow a devaluation of the franc appears part of a wider strategy aimed at pressing the Bundesbank to cut interest rates, according to European monetary officials. They said Paris had made clear it had no intention of calling for a general ERM realignment. Instead, it wished to put the onus on the German central bank to prop up the franc through intervention. Monetary officials observed that Bundesbank interventions on behalf of the franc risked an inflationary bloating of Germany's money supply, as during last September's ERM crisis which led to the forced exit of sterling and the lira. Other officials said 'all options' for saving the ERM were being discussed by monetary authorities in the EC. These included proposals for widening the bands of fluctuation between the 'strong' EC currencies, but these were not on the 'front-burner'. Mr Pedro Solbes, Spain's finance minister, said he favoured some contact between the ERM nations this weekend. He said: 'France and Germany have to come up with a solution to the situation since they're the ones who have things to resolve.' But Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, said there had been no call from any EC member state for a meeting of the monetary committee, and added that Belgium as current EC president would not take the initiative in calling one. In the UK, Mr Eddie George, the Bank of England governor, briefed Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, on the crisis. On the Paris bourse, investors pushed up share prices by 2.5 per cent to their highest level for three years, in the belief that an imminent untying of the franc from the D-Mark would allow an interest rate cut to boost growth prospects. The turbulence in the ERM led to substantial inflows into the dollar and gold. The dollar closed in London at DM1.7405, up more than half a pfennig on the day, its highest level for 23 months and closed in New York at DM1.742. Its strength may weaken the chances of a cut in German interest rates, because a weaker D-Mark would have inflationary implications for Germany. Gold closed at Dollars 406.40 an ounce, a fresh high since the Gulf War in January 1991. In London, speculation about easier borrowing conditions across Europe pushed the FT-SE 100 share index up 8.9 points to 2,926.5 for a 98.8 gain on the week. UK gilts and French government bonds closed 1 point up.

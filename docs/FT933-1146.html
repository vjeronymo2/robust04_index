			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / German cartel body to probe car makers GERMANY'S Federal Cartel Office is to investigate complaints from automotive components suppliers that they are being forced by German carmakers to bear the brunt of the drastic restructuring that is now under way in the German auto industry. The cartel office yesterday urged suppliers to submit details of alleged unfair and improper business tactics. The call came from Mr Dieter Wolf, the cartel office president, at a meeting at the office's Berlin headquarters between German suppliers and industry associations to discuss the mounting problems of the sector. Mr Rolf Kieker, the cartel office spokesman, said the call to the suppliers was not directed against any particular company or individual. All German vehicle makers are engaged in a far-reaching drive to reduce their costs and improve their competitiveness in the face of plunging sales of cars and commercial vehicles. The most highly-publicised cost-cutting effort is being mounted by the Volkswagen group, Europe's biggest vehicle producer which suffered a loss of DM1.6bn (Pounds 646m) in the first half of the year, and is being led by the group's controversial purchasing and production director Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. Volkswagen has been in the forefront of carmakers seeking big price cuts from suppliers this year. Several suppliers have publicly criticised pressure from car manufacturers. The cartel office said that companies affected had complained that they were having to carry the burden of the structural changes in the automobile industry. Complaints would be collected and evaluated, said the cartel office. The meeting agreed that there was a fundamental need to maintain an effective and innovative automotive components industry, but the cartel office said that the necessary structural adjustments must conform with market rules, and there should be no distortions of competition.</p>

			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> After 26 years as a TV series star, actor-director-producer-writer Michael  Landon says: "I don't think I want to be in a series again." Landon, 51, who  starred as Little Joe Cartwright in "Bonanza" for 14 years (1959-73), as  Charles Ingalls (Pa) in "Little House on the Prairie" for eight (1974-82) and  as Earthbound angel Jonathan Smith for four years in NBC's recently-finished  "Highway to Heaven," told The Times that he prefers to concentrate on producing  TV projects rather than starring in them in the future. Meantime, he's enjoying  "the first time off I've had in 30 years." ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

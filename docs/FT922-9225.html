			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Climate treaty sets no emission limits A DRAFT treaty on climatic change, to be signed by world leaders next month, would commit rich countries to fight global warming by restricting greenhouse-gas pollution, but would stop well short of setting limits, Reuter reports from the United Nations in New York. According to a new text of the treaty, circulated yesterday, developed countries would agree to limit emissions of gases such as carbon dioxide and to protect 'sinks', such as forests, that absorb such emissions. The text, or a slightly amended version of it, was expected to be handed to UN negotiators today for approval by tomorrow. The treaty is to be a centrepiece of the UN's Earth Summit at Rio de Janeiro next month. By way of victory for the US, which has opposed the requirement of specific emission targets, the draft treaty contains only loose goals. One section recognises that reduction of emissions 'to earlier levels' by the end of the decade would contribute to fighting climatic change; another says countries should aim to return emissions to 1990 levels. Critics charged the draft could allow signatories to comply whatever they did. Mr Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists said the UN negotiations had produced 'a toothless global warming treaty, totally inadequate to the threat posed by the continued build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.' The language of the text was vaguer than an earlier European Community proposal to require stabilisation of carbon-dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by 2000, and was a far cry from the sharp cuts environmental activists say are necessary.</p>

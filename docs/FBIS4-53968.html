			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- Simultaneous implementation  of a hike in the consumption tax and an income tax cut would  have an adverse impact on private consumption, Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata said Tuesday [24 May].    If the government were to implement a consumption tax hike  and income tax cut "without a time differential, it would only  discourage consumption," Hata told the House of Representatives  Budget Committee.    "It is utterly unthinkable to implement a tax hike alone  from  now on," Hata said in response to a query from Japanese  Communist Party interpellator Kazuo Shii, who pressed Hata to  clarify whether the government will hike the consumption tax.    The tax rate is currently 3 percent.    Hata hinted that the government will implement another tax  cut in advance of a consumption tax hike, saying that a time lag  between the two "is conceivable."    "The ratio of consumption-related taxes to total state  revenue (in Japan) is the lowest among the (24) member states of  the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development," he  said. The Japanese ratio stands at 19.2 percent, as against the  OECD average of 40.3 percent.    Japan "would not be able to cope with the needs of the aging  society" unless as many people as possible shoulder the  financial cost of welfare outlays on a broad basis, he said.    After the first coalition government of Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa fell in April, the coalition parties launched  a second coalition by inking a common policy document on April  22, including a controversial accord to boost state revenues  with a hike in indirect taxes.    Asked whether Japan could implement concerted sanctions with  the United States if China vetoed a possible U.N. Security  Council resolution to punish North Korea for its suspected  nuclear arms program, Hata hinted at his readiness to take such  concerted action.    "I understand Japan can take action even outside the  framework of the United Nations" under the coalition's common  policy document, he said.    Hata was responding to Shii's query on whether a phrase in  the coalition's common policy document implies that Japan may  take concerted sanctions with the United States, if the Security  Council failed to come up with a sanction resolution.    The phrase on Japan's policy on the Korean peninsula says,  "the government will deal with a contingency in close  cooperation and solidarity with the U.S. and South Korea, while  preparing for such a contingency under the Constitution."    However, Hata renewed a pledge to place Japan's concerted  actions with the U.S. within the boundaries of the Constitution.    The Constitution's Article 9 bans the use of military means  to solve international conflicts.    On Japan-U.S. Trade ties, Hata said Japan will not be forced  to accept a possible U.S. demand to set numerical targets to  whittle down Japan's lopsided trade imbalance with the United  States.    He suggested he would remain adamant in turning down any  demand related to numerical targets, as any talk of a target  figure could be unexpectedly interpreted by the U.S. side as a  commitment.    "A figure tends to go alone by itself," he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Four Israelis were wounded in the Jerusalem attack.  One sustained serious wounds and three sustained light injuries.  Our police affairs correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that a  17-year-old Arab from East Jerusalem got on the bus in the Neve  Ya'aqov neighborhood and attacked passengers with an ax. He was  shot by an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldier, wounded, and  captured. Our correspondent Ofra Nehmad reports that two of the  casualties were wounded by shots fired by the soldier. The  wounded were taken to Hadassah-'En Kerem Hospital. An  unidentified man called Qol Yisra'el's Arabic Department to  announce that the terrorist belonged to Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement].    Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said that there is a reasonable  chance to conclude the negotiations with the PLO within several  weeks. Rabin told a meeting of the coalition's Knesset factions  that the evacuation from Gaza and Jericho will be short and will  last two to three weeks. He stressed that Israel will not agree  to the PLO continuing in the peace talks and at the same time  reaching agreements with Hamas on attacks inside Israel. For  us, that is the red line, the prime minister said. He noted  that Israel acted in Cairo and in other places to foil such an  agreement and will judge developments by results on the ground.</p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Northumbrian Fine Foods passes final AN EXCEPTIONAL charge of Pounds 550,000, against a credit of Pounds 410,000 last time left pre-tax profits at Northumbrian Fine Foods 41 per cent lower at Pounds 155,000 in the year to March 31, compared with Pounds 264,000. After a tax credit of Pounds 119,000 (Pounds 117,000 charge) earnings per share came out at 0.97p (0.51p). It is proposed to pass the final dividend leaving the interim of 0.75p for the year compared with last year's uncovered total of 1.75p. The shares, traded on the USM, lost 6p to close at 22p, the lowest level for the year. Turnover almost doubled to Pounds 16.7m (Pounds 8.62m) following the acquisition of John J Lees, Biscuits for the Connoisseur and Cakes for the Connoisseur. Operating profit advanced to Pounds 1.13m (Pounds 279,000) and the net interest charge was little changed at Pounds 423,000 (Pounds 425,000). Mr Kevin O'Keeffe, chairman, said that prudence had dictated substantial adjustments to the Lees balance sheet and goodwill from the Connoisseur acquisitions had been written off. That had left net assets of Pounds 6.76m against net borrowings of Pounds 5.82m. He added that trading had been tough in last months of the year and the difficulties had persisted into the first quarter of the present year. However, real signs of recovery were being seen and the impact should be evident by the autumn. Mr O'Keeffe said the company was still searching for a permanent chief executive following the departure of Mr Richard Adams as chairman and chief executive in June. The exceptional charge included costs relating to Mr Adams's departure as well provisions for slow moving and obsolete stocks of packaging materials and a discount given to the purchasers of Danish Natural Foods in return for early settlement.</p>

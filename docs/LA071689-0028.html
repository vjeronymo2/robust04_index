			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN'S H-2 ROCKET PROGRAM SPUTTERING TOWARD TAKEOFF  </P> <P> The H-2 rocket, Japan's great hope for entering the international  satellite-launching market, is hurtling toward a commercial void, little able  to pose serious competition to Europe or the United States.  </P> <P> Scheduled for blastoff in early 1992, the H-2 will be Japan's first entirely  home-built rocket and will enable the nation to launch satellites in the  international market for the first time.  </P> <P> Launch costs look astronomical, and industry analysts say the rocket will be  unable to compete with U.S. and European satellite launchers for at least five  years after the 1992 launching.  </P> <P> "Unless the government subsidizes it, the H-2 satellite launches will not be  cost-competitive against the Europeans and the Americans in the medium term of  five to 10 years," said Keisuke Kasagi, aerospace analyst at brokerage W. I.  Carr (Overseas) Ltd. in Tokyo.  </P> <P> Even Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, lead contractor in the development of the  rocket, is uncertain.  </P> <P> "I have no answer at this time on whether H-2 will be more expensive to start  with than its competitors," said Toshio Masutani, general manager of the space  systems department at Mitsubishi Heavy.  </P> <P> The H-2 will be able to put into orbit satellites weighing a total of 2.2  metric tons, the same as the Ariane 4 launched by France's Arianespace and  competitive with the 2.4-ton space shuttle of the National Aeronautics and  Space Administration.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Costly Prototype  </P> <P> The government has set a target of 14.72 billion yen ($105.35 million) for the  cost of building the first H-2 rocket, according to Nippon Oils &amp; Fats, a  supplier of rocket fuel.  </P> <P> That figure includes only the manufacture and material costs of a single H-2  and is divorced from the massive funds being spent on developing a prototype.  </P> <P> Mitsubishi's Masutani said engineers are working hard to reduce the cost of  building the rocket and analysts agreed that ruthless cost-cutting may show  considerable success.  </P> <P> The stumbling block is fuel.  </P> <P> The H-2's sophisticated double-stage boosters require 99 tons of liquid  hydrogen and 118 tons of solid propellant.  </P> <P> The solid fuel will cost about 670 million yen ($4.78 million), industry  sources said. Liquid hydrogen is much more expensive.  </P> <P> A spokesman for oxygen-hydrogen supplier Toyo Sanso KK said 99 tons of liquid  fuel costs about 2.828 billion yen ($20.2 million).  </P> <P> Comparative costs for European and U.S. rockets were not available, but  analysts said the H-2 may be seen as a fuel guzzler for two reasons.  </P> <P> One is weight. Arianespace launches from an equatorial site in French Guiana so  rockets soar straight into orbit over the Equator, an optimum position for  satellites.  </P> <P> The H-2 needs an elaborate, heavy steering system to guide it from its launch  pad in Tanegashima in southern Japan to pierce the earth's atmosphere above the  Equator.  </P> <P> "We will have a 10% (efficiency) loss because we are not underneath the  Equator, but this is our national policy, so there is no way to change," said  Mitsubishi's Masutani.  </P> <P> The H-2's double-stage engine, in which the second booster roars into action  during the rocket's ascent, is also seen as a voracious fuel guzzler.  </P> <P> Japan is currently unable to launch satellites for other countries with its  existing H-1 rocket without prior permission from the United States, which  helped build it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Preoccupied' With Rocket  </P> <P> Many here view the H-2, which annually claims the lion's share of the space  budget, as a project of national pride.  </P> <P> "I am preoccupied with the H-2 rocket. This is a major project for Japan which  we must make succeed," said Yutaka Kume, president of Nissan Motor.  </P> <P> Analysts said Japan may try to corner the quality end of the market by gaining  a reputation for infallibility.  </P> <P> "I think in the future satellites will be much more expensive systems, much  bigger and much higher priced," said Mitsubishi's Masutani. "So I think  customers' first requirement will be reliability. They need a 100% successful  launch record," he added.  </P> <P> "Insurance companies are also watching very carefully which systems are the  most reliable," he said, noting that insurance for satellites is very costly.  </P> <P> In order to gain a reputation for reliability, Masutani said the H-2 will have  three or four test launches over the two and a half years after its debut in  1992.  </P></p>

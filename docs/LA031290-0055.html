			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> TWO WRONGS MAKE A RITE FOR BIG WEST  </P> <P> The Big West got cheated.  </P> <P> Again.  </P> <P> It's becoming such a regular event, the conference ought to schedule it on its  yearly calendar.  </P> <P>  Nov. 15: Basketball media day.  </P> <P>  Dec. 16: Conference season opens.  </P> <P>  March 11: NCAA rip-off.  </P> <P>  Last spring, New Mexico State was the Big West team left folded and swindled.  Neil McCarthy's Aggies went 21-11, placed second behind Nevada Las Vegas, lost  by six points to the Runnin' Rebels in the conference tournament final -- and  went nowhere.  </P> <P> This time around, Cal State Long Beach is the one pressing its nose against the  NCAA's window, with nowhere to turn except the NIT.  </P> <P> The 49ers' credentials?  </P> <P> A 22-8 record.  </P> <P> A victory over Big 10 runner-up Purdue, which qualified for the NCAA field.  </P> <P> A road victory over Texas, which qualified for the NCAA field.  </P> <P> Two victories over New Mexico State, which finally qualified for the NCAA field  but had to go 26-4 to do it.  </P> <P> An appearance in the Big West Conference final against Las Vegas, where Long  Beach lost on Sunday, 92-74.  </P> <P> "It's hard for me to believe that there are 64 teams in the nation better than  Long Beach," UNLV Coach Jerry Tarkanian said.  </P> <P> At least no one can accuse the Big West of being paranoid anymore.  </P> <P> Judging from the comments emanating from Kansas City on Sunday, the NCAA is out  to get them.  </P> <P> According to Jim Delany, chairman of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament  Selection Committee, there was "concern . . . about the lateness of the  championship games, especially in the Big Eight, Southeast Conference and Big  West. These late games are playing havoc with the selection process.  </P> <P> "The committee felt, 'Who should bear the burden?' Basically, we felt the Big  West should bear the burden."  </P> <P> In other words: We don't like you playing tournament championship games on  Sunday afternoon, so we're going to make you pay for it.  </P> <P> The NCAA's response was to make a decision about the Big West's third  representative -- Las Vegas and New Mexico State were already in -- by not  making a decision. Instead, the berth became an either/or proposition, tossed  into the unsuspecting lap of Long Beach.  </P> <P> Either Long Beach upsets Las Vegas Sunday, or UC Santa Barbara goes as the Big  West's third team.  </P> <P> "That's an easy cop-out," 49er Coach Joe Harrington said. "It comes down to us  having to beat Las Vegas, a team that could very well win the national  championship? That doesn't seem hardly fair. How about the other teams with  worse records that made it?"  </P> <P> How about it?  </P> <P> Notre Dame (16-12) made it, but then Notre Dame has Digger and, in Delany's  words, "two great wins over Syracuse and Missouri." Plus, a whopping 14 others.  </P> <P> The Big West? In the eyes and minds of the NCAA selection committee, it's still  a big joke. Pac-10 Jr. Nevada Las Vegas and the nine dwarves.  </P> <P> That minor league outpost at the end of the college basketball world couldn't  possibly have four teams worthy of consideration, could it?  </P> <P> The NCAA figures it must deserve some kind of humanitarian award for tossing  three invitations the Big West's way.  </P> <P> Yet, ultimately, it did the Big West a disservice by dividing conference  allegiance into two camps: Does Santa Barbara (20-8) deserve to go or does Long  Beach?  </P> <P> Santa Barbara has three significant victories -- one over UNLV and two very big  ones over Long Beach -- but it also lugs three significant defeats. The Gauchos  lost at home to a 5-23 UC Irvine team and lost twice to a 15-14 Pacific team,  including Friday night in the Big West tournament quarterfinals.  </P> <P> Long Beach, meanwhile, closed with nine victories in its last 10 games and  upset regular-season conference champion New Mexico State in Saturday's  semifinals.  </P> <P> "They didn't take care of business," Harrington said of Santa Barbara. "We did.  They didn't win a game in the tournament. They lost to a lower seed. We won two  games and beat the No. 1 seed. We took care of our business."  </P> <P> Now, the Big West must take care of business. Commissioner Jim Haney said  Sunday the conference will have to rethink its expanded tournament format,  which grew from four to five days this year to better accommodate the Big West  women's field. Sunday, the women's final was held at Long Beach Arena, two  hours before the 3 p.m. men's final.  </P> <P> The results were larger crowds for both games -- and, the wrath of the NCAA.  </P> <P> "The message sent to us this day, just by wisdom and logic alone, makes us want  to reassess where we are," Haney said.  </P> <P> "Again, I may be biased, but I clearly believed we had four teams that deserved  to be in the NCAAs. Whether or not we played on Sunday afternoon shouldn't  factor into it."  </P> <P> Of course, the Atlantic Coast Conference and Big East tournaments held their  finals Sunday, too, and they weren't penalized. It's just those darn West Coast  games. They always start so late.  </P> <P> That will read as Cal State Long Beach's 1989-90 epitaph. Punished for playing  in the wrong time zone.  </P></p>

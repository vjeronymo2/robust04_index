			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Bonn's hopes for wage restraint suffer setback HOPES for rapid progress towards wage restraint in Germany suffered a setback yesterday as construction workers presented a 6.9 per cent pay demand, and negotiations on behalf of 80,000 chemical industry workers in east Germany broke down. The construction workers in the IG Bau trade union are also demanding that equalisation of wages between east and west German workers be brought forward to April 1. Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies, leader of the powerful public sector workers' union, oTV, formally rejected any move to slow the process towards wage equalisation for her members in the east. Negotiations for a new public sector pay deal are due to restart next week, after two abortive rounds. The eastern chemical industry workers rejected an attempt by employers to negotiate a four-month pay freeze. They declared the negotiations formally broken down and called for appointment of an arbitrator. The union is demanding pay levels of 75 per cent instead of 60 per cent of the wages paid to chemical workers in the west. The German government and employers are campaigning for a slowdown in pay demands, above all in the ailing east German economy, as part of the solidarity pact being negotiated between the unions, the government, opposition and industry. So far, there is little sign of progress on that front. The gloomy wage news coincided with conflicting signals in Bonn about the solidarity pact talks themselves. On the positive side, leaders of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the main party in the ruling coalition, agreed to consider proposals for a new financing system for the massive labour market subsidies being paid to east Germany. That move could provide the key to a compromise in the talks, bogged down in differences with the opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) over cuts in social spending and over how to share the burden of financing the east. The CDU is clearly split, both on the question of how to finance unemployment benefit, retraining costs and job creation schemes in the east, and on how much money can be made available to subsidise the east German Lander. A five-hour meeting of the party leaders on Tuesday night agreed to look again at both questions, raising hopes of a compromise with the SPD.</p>

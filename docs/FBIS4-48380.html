			<p>BFN     [Text] The UN force in Rwanda is asking for planes, armored  vehicles, and trucks to deploy the extra 5,500 UN peacekeepers  announced by the United Nations.    The UN mission in Rwanda has said that a cease-fire is  essential to put an end to the genocide against the Tutsis. Let  me remind you that Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes  criticized the Security Council's decision. He would have  preferred the priority to be given to the safe areas near the  border with Tanzania and Burundi in order to protect refugees.  However, the United Nations' priority is to reopen Kigali  airport to facilitate the distribution of food in the country.</p>

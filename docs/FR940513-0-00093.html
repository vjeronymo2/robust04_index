By allowing small packets to be sent in ISAL shipments, the Postal Service is responding to customer demand to provide a way of sending these items that is more economical than regular airmail service and faster than surface mail. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Effective on May 13, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Walter J. Grandjean, (202) 268&hyph;5180. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> On October 27, 1993, the Postal Service published in the Federal Register (58 FR 57742) an interim rule and request for comment on proposed amendment to section 246 of the International Mail Manual to allow small packets to be included in ISAL shipments to foreign countries where ISAL service is available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ISAL is a bulk mailing service for international shipment of publications, advertising mail, catalogs, directories, books, and other printed matter. The service is available from designated acceptance cities to approximately 125 countries. To use ISAL, a mailer must send at least 50 pounds of printed matter at one time, sorted and sacked by destination country. ISAL mail is transported by air to the destination country. Once in the foreign country, the mail is entered into that country's surface mail system for delivery. As a result, ISAL rates are lower than those for regular airmail, while service is faster than service for regular surface mail. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many customers have requested permission to include small packets in ISAL shipments. Frequently, these requests occur because the item being mailed is classified as third-class domestically. Yet, because the item contains something that is not classified internationally as printed matter, the item may not be sent through ISAL. Moreover, since there is no service comparable to ISAL for small packets, these customers are forced to choose between regular airmail service and regular surface mail service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Postal Service invited public comment on the interim rule by November 26, 1993, and received one comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter asserts that the rates for ISAL will not cover the cost of carrying small packets and that dutiable small packets will cost the Postal Service more than printed matter, which is generally non-dutiable. The Postal Service disagrees. The Universal Postal Convention classifies printed matter and small packets as AO ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Autres Objets <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and considers them together for terminal dues purposes. In addition, all ISAL mail must be sorted and sacked by destination country when it is tendered, and the Postal Service processes ISAL sacks intact. Consequently, the Postal Service's costs to process a given weight of ISAL mail should be the same regardless of whether the sack contains printed matter, small packets, or a combination of both. The fact that a higher percentage of small packets may be dutiable does not affect the Postal Service's costs to provide the service. All U.S. origin mail entering another country is subject to customs examination whether it is subject to duty or not. This cost is absorbed by the country of destination and is not charged back to the Postal Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter also asserts that there has been no independent verification that the Postal Service's ISAL rates are adequate to cover the cost of the service and that the Postal Service should submit its international rates for oversight to a body such as the Postal Rate Commission. The Postal Service disagrees. The Postal Service alone is responsible for international mail services, and there is no legal requirement that its determinations be subject to verification by any other agency. The Postal Rate Commission, in particular, has no jurisdiction over international rates or services, so any study conducted by the Commission would have no legal significance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Postal Service has concluded that the proposed amendments, as collected, would benefit users of United States mail. No persuasive reason has been put forward why implementation should be deferred. Accordingly, the Postal Service will not defer implementation of the final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final text contains the correction of a citation which was incorrect in the original regulations. In section 246.941 of the International Mail Manual, the reference to section 244.5 for publishers' periodicals is changed to section 244.4. This reference refers to the makeup of individual pieces, not to sortation requirements for publishers' periodicals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 39 CFR Part 20 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Foreign relations, incorporation by reference, international postal services. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Postal Service adopts the following amendments to the International Mail Manual, which is incorporated by reference in the Code of Federal Regulations.

The cost is lower than that of airmail, while the service is much faster than ordinary surface mail. Customers take ISAL shipments to designated U.S. acceptance cities, where the mail is flown to the foreign destinations and entered into that country's surface mail system for delivery. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 246.2&blank;Qualifying Mail and Minimum Quantities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

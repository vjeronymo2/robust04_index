			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / International Company News: Murdoch sells his holding in Hungarian paper MR RUPERT Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, has sold his stake in the Hungarian newspaper Mai Nap to the Bank of Credit of Hungary, the paper's co-owner. Mr Murdoch bought half of Mai Nap, an evening tabloid, for Dollars 3m and had a let-out clause after three years - which he has now exercised in order to get his original investment back. It is believed News Corp pulled out because it was unable to gain control of the publishing company. The decision comes a year after the closure of Super, a daily tabloid newspaper aimed at the former East Germany, which News Corp published in a joint venture with Burda of Germany. However, News Corp emphasised yesterday that there was no lack of interest in eastern Europe.</p>

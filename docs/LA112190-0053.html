			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OFFICER REMOVED FROM TASK FORCE  </P> <P> One of the original police investigators assigned to a multi-agency task force  probing the murders of dozens of prostitutes and transients during the past  five years has been removed from the group for having a personal relationship  with someone connected with the investigation, The Times has learned.  </P> <P> Sgt. Harold E. Goudarzi, 43, with the San Diego Police Department for 21 years,  was reassigned about a month ago to the department's missing-persons division  after it was discovered he had a relationship with someone who was providing  information to the task force, said a source close to the task force.  </P> <P> The source would not disclose with whom Goudarzi was involved, but said the  person "was not a target of the investigation. It was someone connected with  the investigation. That could be a witness or a source of information."  </P> <P> "Everyone on the task force takes misconduct very seriously, given the nature  of what the task force is investigating," the source said. "I don't know what  the guy could have been thinking about."  </P> <P> Goudarzi was one of the original nine investigators assigned to the  Metropolitan Homicide Task Force, which is composed of members of the San Diego  Police Department, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department and the district  attorney's office.  </P> <P> The task force, created in August, 1988, is investigating the deaths of  prostitutes and transients killed since 1985, when prostitute and police  informant Donna Gentile was found murdered, her mouth stuffed with gravel.  Since then, 42 more prostitutes or transients have been killed.  </P> <P> In September, the task force expanded from 10 to 21 members and split into  three groups: one in charge of the Gentile murder, one in charge of the other  murders and one in charge of possible police misconduct in connection with  prostitutes because of the way Gentile was found murdered. The gravel in  Gentile's mouth was taken as a sign that she might have been killed for  testifying against police officers.  </P> <P> Goudarzi worked with the group investigating the 42 murders. Before joining the  task force, he worked in the Police Department's robbery and homicide  divisions. He also had worked in the Eastern Division, where officers dealt  with prostitutes who worked along El Cajon Boulevard. Some of the prostitutes  found murdered had also worked that street.  </P> <P> Goudarzi could not be reached for comment Tuesday. Police spokesman Bill  Robinson confirmed that Goudarzi is now assigned to the missing-persons  division.  </P> <P> Homicide task force spokeswoman Bonnie Dumanis said she would not discuss task  force personnel matters. State Deputy Atty. Gen. Gary Schons, who is leading  the branch of the investigation dealing with police corruption, also refused to  comment.  </P> <P> Assistant Police Chief Norm Stamper, who spent several months personally  reviewing the investigation at the request of Police Chief Bob Burgreen, said  he had no comment on Goudarzi.  </P> <P> "We just cannot discuss personnel matters, as a matter of law," Stamper said.  "And I will not discuss anything that would impede the progress of the task  force. It's worked so far."  </P> <P> It was not immediately clear what effect Goudarzi's reassignment might have on  the credibility of the task force, which had been criticized for having police  officers investigate members of their own department.  </P> <P> Some members of the state attorney general's office had protested the agency's  move to join the task force because the department was also involved in the  probe.  </P> <P> At least five police officers and one former officer are under scrutiny for  their possible connections to Gentile and missing prostitute Cynthia Maine, who  disappeared in February, 1986, after detailing for internal-affairs  investigators which officers were involved with prostitutes.  </P> <P> The source close to the task force said the investigation was in no way  jeopardized by Goudarzi's removal.  </P> <P> The task force "is still doing business as usual," the source said.  </P></p>

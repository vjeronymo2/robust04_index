			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> POIGNANT 'LONELY WOMAN SEEKS COMPANION'  </P> <P> Irina Kupchenko, in the moving Soviet film "Lonely Woman Seeks Life Companion"  (at the Monica 4-Plex) has a great movie face; layers and layers of emotion  seem to be rippling underneath. In "Lonely Woman," her character at first seems  drab, her expression drained and drawn. But it's a mask. Kupchenko can make  herself plain, then make that plainness radiant.  </P> <P> Here, she's playing seamstress Klavdia, an embittered woman of 43, unmarried,  living alone, driven to posting little notices around Moscow -- "Lonely woman  seeks life companion" -- in order to meet men. But Kupchenko, without  sentimentality or trickery, shows what makes Klavdia special. Like all great  actors, she unites us with her character, lets us feel and see with her.  </P> <P> The plainness is part of the story's theme; it's about two people, equally  alone, who briefly infiltrate each other lives. It's a poignant comedy of  social barriers, with an air of wistful melancholy -- though, in translation,  the pathos comes through more strongly than the humor.  </P> <P> In the film, Klavdia's plaintive ad brings an unlikely respondent: an alcoholic  ex-circus acrobat named Valentin (Alexander Zbruyev), a homeless man on a  disability pension. Despite his winsome smile and charmingly straightforward  manner, their first encounter almost ends in debacle. He tries to get money  from her purse; she bops him on the head and throws him out. Then she relents.  Beneath her brusque, weary surface -- a woman who's known too many wayward men,  been stung too many times -- is a flow of tenderness and sympathy. Valentin  seizes on this, returns to her again and again.  </P> <P> The movie is a haunting little vignette. Shot in 1986, near the dawn of  glasnost and perestroika, it reveals ideas and feelings that, to the West,  later seemed to erupt from nowhere: discontent, malaise, oppression, a feeling  that life under the old Communist rule was purposeless, empty and sad.  </P> <P> This isn't the idyllic Moscow of Stalinist cinema, of brave workers striving  for a better tomorrow. Instead, director Viacheslav Krishtofovich shows us a  gray city, lines of men at the bars and liquor stores: real, unstaged views of  Moscow, shot with a hidden camera. The blighted "romance" is clearly part of a  larger social malaise, but the movie doesn't stress this.  </P> <P> If a story like this had been made in an American studio during the '80s, it  probably would have reflected the same selfish mind-set as Klavdia's snob-boss,  who -- in an allegedly classless society -- castigates her for consorting with  riff-raff. But this movie, with its low-key realism, looks at life more evenly.  </P> <P> The obvious predecessors for Krishtofovich and writer Victor Merezhko are  Delbert Mann, Paddy Chayefsky and movies like the 1955 "Marty." Like Mann,  Krishtofovich is a first-time director from TV whose visual technique seem a  little dull, almost styleless. Yet, at its best, "Lonely Woman" unrolls so  naturally, so easily, it seems to be eavesdropping on life itself. There are  some pat and preachy nudges in the writing but Krishtofovich has the right  calm, compassionate tone throughout.  </P> <P> As Valentin, Zbruyev is a fine homeless beau. His dialect shifts and inflated  comic rhetoric aren't quite translatable, but his face is wonderfully hangdog.  And Kupchenko, who won the best-actress award at the Montreal Festival with  this film, is brilliant. She became a star early in life, in Andrei  Konchalovsky's 1969 adaptation of Turgenev's "Nest of Gentry"; by now, her  playing is effortless.  </P> <P> Like Gerard Depardieu or Marlon Brando, she seems to be inhabiting her movies  rather than acting in them, living out stories before the camera. And this  story -- of lonely people in a society that tries to ignore its "losers" --  strikes chords far from Russia. Just like Klavdia's ad, "Lonely Woman Seeks  Life Companion" (Times-rated Family, despite mature themes), is a plea for  understanding, for the connections that make life bearable. Melancholy lies  under its terseness, love under its simple lines.  </P></p>

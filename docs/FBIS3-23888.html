			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Natalya Pachegina: "Aushev Will Remain </F> President, Under the Condition Moscow Is Flexible"]    [Text] Upon the expiration of the deadline for the  nomination of candidates to the post of president of the  republic, it was learned that the short list of contenders  lacked the name of the current president of Ingushetia--Ruslan  Aushev. And if one pays attention to the circumstance that all  the other contenders, who are less well-known in Russia (for  example, the republic's assistant procurator general,  Karimsultan Kokorokhoyev, or the former sovkhoz director Magomed  Mankiyev, who gathered 20,000 voter signatures each during the  election campaign), and in Nazran they are perceived more as  "extras," then Aushev's gesture on the eve of the elections to  the republic parliament and the voting on the construction of  the Republic of Ingushetia was most likely not meant for the  Ingush people, who are bravely risking being left without a  shepherd, at all, but for Moscow. The more so since it is  offering plenty of occasion for such "gesticulation": As far as  we know Aushev's conditions--when speaking in favor of  unwavering implementation of the president's December edict on  returning refugees and forced resettlers from Prigorodnyy Rayon  to North Ossetia and demanding in this connection an immediate  replacement of the head of the temporary administration on the  territories of the Republic of South Ossetia and the Republic of  Ingushetia, Vladimir Lozovoy--are still unsatisfactory. Just as,  incidentally, a year hence a zero result also characterizes the  process of the return of the Ingush refugees to North Ossetia,  which created a wave of expectations regarding General Aushev's  election as president of Ingushetia.    Aushev's pre-election "coquetry" was thus provoked. And it  would seem that many a president could envy Aushev: Not all of  them can, like the Ingush leader, boast of such a reliable  "rear" made up of their citizens. And although the president is  saying these days that the republic leaders, including himself,  are "figures of the transitional period," and Ingushetia needs  new politicians who can adapt to new conditions, it should have  dawned on Moscow before all others (including Nazran) that the  "familiar" Aushev is more convenient than any "new adapted  politician," trying with the enthusiasm of a beginner to solve  the problems of the conflict zone. If even now it is not at all  simple to apply "federal sanctions" against one Aushev has  accused of sabotaging the president's edict--President of South  Ossetia Galazov--the head of the temporary administration could  very well become "small change," the more so since the loyalty  and stability of Ingushetia regulated by Aushev is worth  something.    According to information from Nazran, in spite of the  absence  of Aushev's name on the list of contenders for the post of  president, the gathering of signatures for him is continuing  (about 100,000 have already been gathered), and throughout the  republic--they said in the permanent mission of the Republic of  Ingushetia in Moscow--there are to be rallies at which only one  name will be on Ingush lips--Aushev.</p>

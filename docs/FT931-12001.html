			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Growing appetite for imports worries economists: Concern over the trade gap THIS WEEK'S news that imports rose to record levels in December has prompted the usual hand-wringing among economists. How can it be, they ask, that after more than two years of recession the UK has been unable to curtail its appetite for imported goods. They argue that the answer apparently lies in deep-rooted structural problems afflicting the economy. Sterling's devaluation may give a boost to exports in the short term, but is not enough to cure the country's addiction to imports in the long run. 'The UK has a chronic problem that isn't going to be solved by devaluation,' says Mr Kevin Gardiner, an economist at SG Warburg. 'If we don't produce motorbikes, vacuum cleaners and fridges in the first place, simply chopping 15 per cent off the exchange rate is not going to solve the problem.' The latest figures bear this out. In December the visible trade gap widened to Pounds 1.74bn, its highest level for 2 1/2 years. Last year the UK imported Pounds 120.55bn of foreign goods, but exported goods worth only Pounds 106.77bn. The shortfall was only partially alleviated by a surplus of Pounds 1.95bn on invisible items such as financial services, advertising, dividends and tourism, supposedly the strong point of UK exports. The volume of exports is expected to increase in the next few months as UK goods benefit from the devaluation, but the consensus among economists is that the deficit on the current account will deteriorate further this year. Historically recessions have depressed the inflow of imports as demand for foreign goods has slackened. In previous economic downturns the decline in manufacturing output has been more or less mirrored by a decline in manufacturing imports. In the third quarter of 1975, for example, manufacturing output fell by 11.1 per cent on the previous year, while manufacturing imports excluding oil and erratic items fell by 12.2 per cent. In the first quarter of 1981 output fell by 13.2 per cent and imports by 15.7 per cent. This time imports have risen even before output has stopped falling. In the first quarter of last year manufacturing output fell by 2 per cent, but manufacturing imports rose by 5 per cent. In the fourth quarter the volume of manufacturing imports rose by 9.5 per cent year-on-year while manufacturing output is estimated to have been roughly flat. Mr Gardiner believes the UK's inability to close the trade deficit is rooted in gaps in the manufactured product range of the home market. The fact that imports are rising as a percentage of GDP could reflect an 'acceleration in the rate at which UK manufacturers yield market share to foreign supply'. According to Mr Douglas McWilliams, chief executive of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, the balance of payments prospects will continue to be affected by lack of manufacturing capacity. A study carried out by the centre shows that the UK's manufacturing capacity grew by 19 per cent between 1970 and 1990, compared with growth of 43 per cent in the other three larger European economies - Germany, France and Italy - 86 per cent in the US and 129 per cent in Japan. He said: 'Although there is substantial evidence that the quality of UK manufacturing is much improved, the small size of the base means that rates of GDP growth in the mid-1990s much above 2.5 per cent would land the UK back in serious balance of payments difficulties.' Perhaps the most worrying aspect of the penchant for foreign goods is that rises in imports have occurred in almost every industrial sector. Import volumes of iron and steel, for example, have risen by about 50 per cent since 1985, while imports of electrical goods have doubled. Clothing and footwear imports have also doubled since 1985. It may be that the government is edging towards an 'industrial strategy' that could eventually improve the UK's trade performance. This week's trade figures coincided with a trip by Mr John Major, the prime minister, to India and the Middle East, which he used to drum up business. In the Autumn Statement the government increased export credit for potentially fast growing markets.</p>

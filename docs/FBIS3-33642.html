			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO Information Department Head </F> Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh in Davos, by MBC Anchorman Antoine 'Awn in  London, "few minutes ago"--recorded]    [Text] ['Abd-Rabbuh] In fact, discussions continue up to  this moment. I believe that these negotiations could reach  agreement over some points, but not all of them during this  round. Discussions revolve around the issue of the crossings,  the Jericho area, and the settlements in Gaza. There is some  slow and simple progress in these points. We are now working on  finding a joint formula on the things we have managed to agree  on. There are still some difficulties. I believe that if all  points are not addressed during this round, we could discuss  them in Cairo to finalize our agreement.    ['Awn] Mr. Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, on what level will discussions  in Cairo take place? On President 'Arafat's level?    ['Abd-Rabbuh] I do not think so. Before we reach  discussions on the level of President 'Arafat and Prime Minister  Rabin, we need to be very close to finalizing the agreement in  its broad outlines and even its essential details. Therefore,  what we agree on now will form a part of the agreement that we  must finalize at a later date.    ['Awn] Mr. Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, thank you.    ['Abd-Rabbuh] I thank you.</p>

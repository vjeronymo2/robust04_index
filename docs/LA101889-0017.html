			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNESCO  </P> <P> In response to the column "America Should Rejoin a Reformed UNESCO" (by Rep.  Esteban Torres, Op-Ed Page, Oct. 9): I completely agree. The original reasons  for which we withdrew, such as political divisiveness, program rhetoric and  poor budget plans, have all been altered by the new director general, Frederico  Mayor Zaragoza.  </P> <P> UNESCO emphasizes humanities, education, communication, science and cultural  preservation, all of which are relevant in today's society.  </P> <P> By rejoining this agency, we as a country will have an important and much  needed say in the decisions of UNESCO. Let's help bring about creativity and  cooperation.  </P> <P> KATINA ZACHARY  </P> <P> San Juan Capistrano  </P></p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: French cement group halves its net deficit Ciments Francais, the French cement and building materials company, yesterday announced a halving in net losses in 1993, to FFr685m (Dollars 119m) from FFr1.31bn. Mr Rene-Yves Nanot, the chairman, said many of the group's markets had improved, but he cautioned against predictions of a strong recovery in the current year. 'I am not sure that this year will see a strong rebound,' he said. The reduction in the company's deficit was achieved on sales of FFr13.46bn, compared with FFr14.9bn in 1992. A large part of the decline in sales, according to a spokesman for the group, was attributable to the depressed conditions in the French market and also to weak demand in Belgium. Operating profits fell more sharply than sales, declining to FFr1.05bn from FFr1.35bn. Exceptional losses were reduced to FFr335m from FFr1.13bn in 1992, however, explaining the improvement at the level of net results. According to the company, its strategy of selling non-core assets had allowed it to reduce debts by more than FFr700m to about FFr8bn. It said that further asset sales could be expected this year.</p>

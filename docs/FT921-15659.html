			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Proposal on financial reinsurance FINANCIAL reinsurance, the policies taken out to protect financial transactions, should be treated like conventional reinsurance in company accounts only if there is a transfer of risk, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has recommended in a discussion paper. Financial reinsurance is unlike conventional reinsurance because sometimes there is no transfer of risk, and the policy is often written so that it is likely claims will be made within a predetermined range. If the reinsurer assumes a proportion of exposure to the future losses of the company taking out the policy, and the underwriting margin or deficit is not fixed in advance, premiums should be charged against underwriting revenue, the institute says. Otherwise - where financial reinsurance is essentially a financing arrangement - it should be accounted for as a cash deposit and any amounts repayable treated as a liability. The paper is a response to proposals that will soon be converted into a financial reporting standard.</p>

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Arts: National Theatre - Openings Tennessee William's Sweet Bird of Youth, directed by Richard Eyre, opens on Thursday.  Eyre staged William's The Night of the Iguana at the National in 1992, and directed BBC2's 1993 account of his Suddenly Last Summer.  For Eyre, who has been recently accused of Europhobia in his choice of foreign repertory for the National, this is his second American play running; the last one, Johnny on a spot, received few compliments.  In Sweet Bird of Youth, Clare Higgins plays the film star Alexandra del Lago; Richard Pasco is the tyrannical Boss Finley.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast; passages within quotation </F> marks recorded]    [Text] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, during the  opening of the 5th National Stock Market Convention, has assured  that the incidents that have occurred in Mexico change neither  the unity nor strength of the Mexican people's undertakings    [Salinas] "We will not change our course, nor will we be  slowed down; on the contrary, in government institutions we are  more intent on joining the new times."    During the ceremony at Los Pinos, the president affirmed the  commitment to act based on law and through dialogue.    [Salinas] "When faced with criminal actions by individuals  or  gangs, the Mexican States have confirmed their willingness to  respond with the full strength of the law. Through dialogue, we  will face legitimate social claims while recognizing our growing  plurality."    The president said Mexico's economy can develop further, and  he reconfirmed the stock market's growing importance in the  state's modernization.    Manuel Robleda, Mexican Stock Exchange president, said that  under this administration, the volume of operations in the stock  exchange has increased 2.8 times, whereas the world's main stock  markets have increased only .24 times. He spotlighted  investments made by stock companies and the financing of stock  for $27 billion for the production sector, and he acknowledged  the development of the Mexican stock market must grow further.    Luis Miguel Moreno, president of the National Securities and  Exchange Commission, said that under this administration, 142  public offerings of shares have been made for more than 39  billion new pesos in Mexico and abroad, an unprecedented amount  in the stock exchange's 100 years of operation.    [Moreno] "The Mexican stock market, as an open system, has  been hurt by recent unexpected events; nevertheless, the market  has indicated that even under adverse, temporary situations its  level of maturity is greater and its institutional structure  more solid."    Moreno said that during this current temporary situation,  there will be no change of course, nor will the rules of the  game be modified to take advantage of short-term conditions or  temporary benefits.    [Moreno] "The authority of the stock market is adhering to  its main goals, market integrity, and the guarantee that its  operations take place under equal opportunities, thereby  protecting the general interest of investors."    Pedro Aspe, finance and public credit secretary, and Miguel  Mancera, governor of the Bank of Mexico, also attended the  ceremony.</p>

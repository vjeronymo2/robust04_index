The program would be limited to trucks with three axels or more and a gross  weight of more than 26,000 pounds. A rapid deployment force would also be  created to remove disabled trucks from the roadway.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Approved by City Council Transportation and Finance and Revenue committees this  spring; a bill now in state Legislature would preempt city proposal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ILLEGAL PARKING  </P> <P> Special teams of traffic control officers would impound vehicles illegally  blocking curb lanes during peak commuting hours.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Adopted by council August, 1987.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Delivery trucks would be given access to off-street parking to reduce illegal  street parking during deliveries.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Implemented administratively; no ordinance needed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fines for peak hour "no-stopping" violations would be increased from $28 to  $53, with illegally parked cars to be towed away half an hour before the rush  hour starts, at 6:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Put into effect by Municipal Court March, 1988.  </P> <P> </P> <P> STREET IMPROVEMENTS  </P> <P> Additional personnel would be hired to implement more than 100 traffic  improvement projects intended to increase capacity and safety by at least 30%;  among the improvements are additional left-turn pockets, left-turn  restrictions, reverse traffic lanes, peak-hour lanes and traffic signal timing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Adopted by council May, 1988.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CITY CREWS  </P> <P> Non-emergency work by city crews would be banned during peak hours on posted  streets.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Established by executive order December, 1987  </P> <P> </P> <P> CONTROL OFFICERS  </P> <P> The number of traffic control officers would be increased from fewer than 300  to more than 600.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Adopted in the 1988-89 budget.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TRAFFIC NEWS  </P> <P> City traffic officers, police and firefighters would relay news of traffic  troubles to broadcast stations with volunteer help from about 1,000  radio-equipped Federal Express drivers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Adopted in the city's 1989-90 budget.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TRAFFIC SIGNALS  </P> <P> A citywide Automated Traffic Surveillance and Control System would be  implemented in 10 years rather than in the 30 years originally planned; would  automatically monitor the flow of the 400,000 vehicles that go in and out of  the downtown area daily, adjust the timing of intersection lights and dispatch  emergency crews.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Adopted by council December, 1987.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BLOCKED INTERSECTIONS  </P> <P> Drivers would be banned from entering a blocked intersection, even if the light  is green; violators would be fined $53 for a first offense and up to $500 for  successive violations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Adopted by council December, 1987; now included in state law.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMMITTEES  </P> <P> Local area committees, appointed by the mayor and council, would be set up to  consider solutions to local traffic and transportation issues.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Adopted by council May, 1988.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SUBSIDY  </P> <P> Employers in the city that have at least 200 workers would be required to offer  $15 bus pass subsidies each month if they also provide subsidized parking;  businesses also would be offered up to $5,000 in transit funds to lease or  purchase vans for employee van pools.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Adopted by council February, 1989.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TELEPHONE SYSTEM  </P> <P> A toll-free number would be established for information and for lodging  complaints on all bus systems, commuter computer car and van pools, local  transit and specially equipped vehicles for the elderly and disabled.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Adopted in the 1989-1990 budget.  </P> <P> </P> <P> RTD  </P> <P> Transit services would be improved and buses would be washed inside and out by  200 high school students in the Los Angeles Pride Demonstration Project.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pending  </P> <P> </P> <P> PARKING  </P> <P> Parking fees for city employees, including elected officials, would be  increased from $5 a month to $25 at city-owned or city-leased lots.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Adopted by council September, 1988.  </P> <P> </P> <P> STAGGERED WORK HOURS  </P> <P> Work hours for city employees would be staggered and some employees would be  allowed to work part time at home.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Approved by the Transportation and Traffic Committee; expected to come before  the full council in August.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS  </P> <P> The city would encourage ride-sharing among small companies by subsidizing  car-pooling and other traffic-reduction programs.  </P></p>

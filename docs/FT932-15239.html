			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar slides on poor sales data DISAPPOINTING retail sales figures from the US imposed further pressure on an already ailing US dollar, which was weaker across the board yesterday, and suffered a sharp fall against the D-Mark, writes Peter John. Economists had expected the March sales figures to be poor but had, nevertheless, anticipated a slight rise. When the news broke that they had actually fallen by one per cent against the previous month the dollar tumbled through the DM1.5850 level. This followed last week's poorly received CPI figures and led to a wave of heavy, computer generated stop-loss selling. However, there was some comment that the reaction was overdone. Mr Nick Parsons an economist with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said: 'Everyone is worried about the US recovery but the US has a recovery rate that Europe would kill for.' Dealers said volumes were low and they expected the dollar to bounce back before being hit again and falling, according to some, as low as DM1.52. The dollar closed at DM1.5790 down from DFM1.6070 previously. The Yen was strong again, although held back by intervention from the Bank of Japan. The Japanese currency was boosted by news of a Y13.2 trillion economic stimulation package announced by the Liberal Democratic Party. The extent of package, which still has to be ratified by the government, was generally predicted and the Yen closed in London only marginally higher against the dollar at Y113.35. Meanwhile, sterling performed well in early sessions hitting DM2.4725 at best as sentiment was buoyed by a growing feeling that the economy is on the turn while Germany is heading for what could be its worst recession since the Second World War. Mr Neil MacKinnon, the chief economist at Citibank, believes the only black spot on the horizon is the worsening trade gap and, with good fundamentals in place, the pound is set to break through DM2.50 in the short-term and hit DM2.65 within the next 12 months. Sterling closed at DM2.4625, up from DM2.4500 previously. The franc was unaffected by news of a two-per cent cut in the upper limit emergency lending rate. The cut underlines growing economic confidence in France but merely brings the emergency rate in line with overnight lending. The currency strengthened to FFr3.3800 against the D-Mark from FFr3.3855. Elsewhere in Europe, the peseta and escudo were both under pressure. The Spanish currency was affected by the decision of Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, to call a general election five months early. It eased to Pta72.11 against the D-Mark, down from Pta71.61. The Bank of Portugal intervening to support the escudo which nevertheless fell to Es93.16 against the D-Mark from Es92.97.</p>

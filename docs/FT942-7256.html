			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Raising skills When the government published its white paper on competitiveness on Tuesday, it was quickly attacked for the absence of dramatic initiatives. Eschewing such grand gestures was sensible, given the history of UK industrial policy and its poor record of picking winners. A new study from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research suggests that less glamorous micro-economic policies can do more to enhance business performance than heavy-handed government action. The study analyses the skills and performance of engineering and chemical companies in Germany and the UK. In both sectors, the German companies have workforces that are better qualified than those in the UK. On the shopfloor, this is a consequence of the high level of craft qualification achieved by the German apprenticeship training system. Among supervisors, the German companies can draw on the technically-trained meister while only a handful of British supervisors have specific training. Tackling these shortcomings in the UK's skills base is rightly at the centre of the competitiveness package. But the researchers also found significant differences in the skills available at graduate and postgraduate levels. In engineering, the German companies have more than double the proportion of technical and higher degree graduates of their UK counterparts. As a result, British companies are less innovative in their products. They also find it harder to make incremental production changes to remain competitive. It is hardly surprising that their productivity trails the German plants, or that they are 'followers' in technical innovation. In the chemical industry, companies in the two countries employ similar numbers of graduates. But German companies have a much higher proportion of postgraduates which the study believes will help them cope better with the accelerating pace of innovation. Postgraduates can draw on specialist knowledge and contacts, and improve knowledge transfer from research institutes to business. Yet UK employers tend to prefer first degree graduates and regard postgraduates as over-specialised and lacking in commercial and practical skills. Raising the skills base of key industries thus involves much more than training. Encouraging business to make better use of the UK's excellent science base and to harness the skills of postgraduates is also vital. Last year's science white paper launched a series of initiatives to encourage this, including a new research master's degree. This will combine a grounding in research techniques with skills such as management, team working and communication. Policy changes such as these are unlikely to grab the headlines or win many votes in the political marketplace. But if successful, they could make a significant contribution to improving the performance of British business.</p>

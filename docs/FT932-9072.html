			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Stake sale helps The Telegraph double to Pounds 19m The Telegraph newspaper group, publisher of both the Daily and Sunday Telegraph, reported pre-tax profits doubled at Pounds 19.1m in the three months to March 31. The result was helped by a Pounds 6.5m surplus on the sale of its 13 per cent stake in the limited voting stock of Trinity International Holdings. There was also Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 400,000) from interests in associates. A higher tax rate resulted in a charge this time of Pounds 6.8m (Pounds 2.8m) leaving earnings per share of 9.1p (5p). The company said that the effective tax rate for the present year would exceed the standard rate of UK corporation tax because the rate applicable to John Fairfax Holdings in Australia was higher. The company holds a 14.7 per cent stake in Fairfax and on Thursday bought options which if exercised would raise the holding to 15.3 per cent. Turnover for the period was Pounds 62.4m (Pounds 58.6m).</p>

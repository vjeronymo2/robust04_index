			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (19): Search for growth industries - Profile of Hertfordshire ONE OF Hugh West's first acts after taking over as managing director of the Hertfordshire Development Organisation - a body set up last year to promote inward investment - was to visit the headquarters in the US of several of the big multinationals with existing UK bases in the county. His purpose was to try to ensure that when UK investment decisions are made by these companies in future, the process which has often taken place in the past - a move from the south-east of England to more distant parts of the UK, such as Wales and Scotland - is not repeated. Hertfordshire, and its neighbouring counties in the prosperous doughnut-shaped region around London, have become used to being the pool in which other regions of the UK have fished for inward investment opportunities - and to the consequent loss of jobs. In the past, while their economies were being constantly replenished by new investment, it was possible to accept this migration with a degree of equanimity. The latest recession, however, has differed from its predecessors, for the first time hitting the south-east harder than the rest of the country. In Hertfordshire, the inflow of jobs from London and the rest of the south-east has not stopped, but it has slowed down. Meanwhile, one of the main props of the local economy - defence and aerospace - has seen very large cuts. Unemployment in the county has increased faster than anywhere else in the UK, with the figure rising from 2.1 per cent in 1989 to near the national average of around 10 per cent, bringing the total out of work to more than 40,000. Included in this figure, are many of the county's com- muters who have lost their jobs as a result of cuts in the financial services sector in the City of London. The HDO, set up with financial support from the county and district authorities, the training and enterprise council (Tec), and local companies, is the county's response to the change in its fortunes. Its aim, apart from ensuring existing companies stay on and expand in the county, and not elsewhere, is to attract growth industries. It has targeted five sectors - computers, telecom- munications, office equipment, pharmaceuticals, and financial and business services. With many other regions going for similar targets, and often able to offer extensive grants and other inducements, there will be a concentration within these sectors on niche markets which can take advantage of existing expertise within the labour force, for example that gained in the aerospace industry in using very difficult and complex materials, or in high precision engineering. The county will also be seeking to avoid parts of the world where other better-funded regions make their regular calls. In the health field, where the county is already strongly represented, medical engineering is seen as an area where the skills available from sophisticated defence and electronics manufacturing can be utilised. More important, there are hopes that the 'biotech boulevard' which has developed along the A1 through the county will continue to expand. Hertfordshire already claims to be the biggest centre for pharmaceutical research and development in Europe. Four of the world's biggest drugs groups, Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham of the UK, Roche of Switzerland, and Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme of the US carry out research in the county, along with a number of smaller companies. Glaxo, which already has plants at Ware and Stevenage, is building a Pounds 500m research centre in Stevenage which will eventually employ 1,500 people. In financial and business services, further growth in back office operations  -perhaps hastened by worries over security against terrorists, and the need in consequence to split operations between different centres - is also expected, and is thought likely to be encouraged by the availability within the county of large numbers of potential clerical and managerial recruits. Over the past two years back office or headquarters functions have been opened by Perrier and Trebor Bassett at Rickmansworth, by Rhone Poulenc at Watford, and by the Cheltenham and Gloucester Building Society at Potters Bar, and the insurance company, Provident Mutual, is bringing together its headquarters functions at a Pounds 40m new site in Stevenage which will employ 850 people. A possible new area of growth could be in credit and debit card processing where there are believed to be several US banks interested in bringing new customer services to Europe. The county's inability, unlike other competing parts of the UK, to offer grants and incentives, is not seen as a significant drawback. Grants are given to compensate for other problems, such as location or the lack of trained labour, Mr West argues. 'We already have in place most of the conditions that incoming companies would wish to find, including excellent road, rail, and air communications, proximity to London, and other main markets, and a wide range of information technology, engineering, managerial and professional skills.' Many companies, too, and in particular smaller ones, are reluctant, he claims, to become involved in negotiations for grants because of the time taken and the costs involved. Grants are more likely, he believes, to be of interest to companies considering very large projects, which Hertfordshire is unlikely to win, even though it has a number of substantial sites to offer as a result of the closure of aerospace, defence and other engineering activities. These include the 57-acre site Cherry Tree Lane near the M1 in Hemel Hempstead, which is being marketed by the Commission for New Towns, the 60-acre Rolls-Royce Leavesden site and British Aerospace's 200-acre Hatfield site. The availability of such sites has, according to Brian Briscoe, Hertfordshire's chief executive, made it possible for the county to be more wel- coming towards developers than was possible during the mid-late 1980s when there was virtually full employment, and a lack of sites outside the Green Belt. 'In 1988 it was proper to say all industrial land was fully utilised. We now have the opportunity to encourage development to occur. The focus is on bringing land back into use,' he argues. The speed with which new manufacturing and services investment is attracted to Hertfordshire will depend to a large extent on the strength of other leading European economies, some of which are now moving noticeably into recession. Some analysts, too, forecast that it will be some time before those who have fallen out of work in Hertfordshire find jobs which offer the same pay and conditions as they used to enjoy, particularly if, as seems likely, many of the newcomers are smaller companies. With the locational advantages the county enjoys, however, the HDO sees itself as probably not a long-term player in the inward invest- ment marketplace, which is probably good news for Britain's more peripheral regions. 'If the economy does turn, in two or three years' time there may not be the need for a development organisation in the form we are at the moment. The better we perform the quicker we close down,' says Mr West.</p>

			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> JAIL TIME, FINES SOUGHT FOR REPORTERS ACCUSED OF DEFYING JUDGE'S GAG ORDER  </P> <P> Prosecutors said they will seek fines and jail time for two Chicago Tribune  reporters accused of defying a judge's gag order in publishing the name of a  boy accused of stabbing three classmates.  </P> <P> Circuit Judge Robert E. Byrne, who issued the gag order, declined to drop  contempt of court charges against reporters Joseph Sjostrom and Jan Crawford  during a hearing last week but said he would give the case to another judge.  </P> <P> Assistant state's Atty. Carmen Polo said he would seek fines and jail sentences  if the two are convicted.  </P> <P> Byrne had ordered news media not to identify the 14-year-old charged in the  stabbings at a high school Dec. 7. The Tribune had published the teen's name  before the judge issued the order and published it again the day after the  order.  </P> <P> The newspaper said the reporters had obtained the boy's name after interviewing  his mother and students at the school in Elmhurst.  </P> <P> "Truthful information in the public domain can't be made secret again by an  order," said Joseph P. Thornton, an attorney for the newspaper.  </P></p>

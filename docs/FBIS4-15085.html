			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by VLADIVOSTOK correspondent Sergey Bulakh: </F> "Ecological Catastrophe in Bolshoy Kamen Is Perhaps Two Months  Away"]    [Text] As we have already reported, the commission headed  by Yevgeniy Stomatyuk, chairman of the kray administration  committee for natural resources, worked in Bolshoy Kamen on  Wednesday with a group of journalists. It visited the Vostok and  Zvezda plants, where nuclear submarines are dismantled and  radioactive waste stored.    As a result of eight hours of work at the city and plant  administration offices and an examination of the facilities  where liquid radioactive waste is kept, the commission prepared  a protocol which states unequivocally that the situation in  Bolshoy Kamen is fast approaching critical. The main conclusion:  "We should expect an emergency situation involving TNT-5 to  develop in April-May."    The liquid radioactive waste problem is increasingly often  associated with the Far Eastern plant Zvezda. According to the  commission's estimate, about 2,253 cubic meters of it is kept  here, with total radioactivity exceeding 30 curies. It is all  kept in seven tankers, which are moored at the plant's piers.  Two tankers -- TNT-5 and TNT-27 -- acquired notoriety around the  world after the liquid radioactive waste dumping in October of  last year, and the third--TNT Pinega -- is just beginning  service in this capacity.    TNT-5 is currently in the most critical situation. The  vessel, built at the beginning of the 1960's and decommissioned  two years ago, now represents the main danger. Its tanks hold  794 cubic meters of liquid radioactive waste with a total  radioactivity of 0.776 curies. Over the past three months the  radiation level in the stern and engine compartments increased  threefold and now measures 1,400 microroentgen an hour. Because  of malfunctioning systems and equipment, up to 10 cubic meters  spilled from the tanks into the vessel's body over this time.  Analysis of radionuclides in the tankers and samples of soil at  the pier under the mooring area show that radioactive waste may  leak not only into the tanker's body but also into the bay's  aquatic area.    The opinion of the commission, which consisted of  representatives of various agencies, as well as those of Bolshoy  Kamen, the plant, and the Pacific Fleet administrations, is  unanimous: Tanker TNT-5 has to be urgently hauled outside  Bolshoy Kamen bay and the content of its tanks dumped.    These and many other conclusions may remain on paper,  however.    "The problem is that radioactive waste is stored on the  territory of the Zvezda plant, but does not belong to it," the  enterprise's chief engineer Yuriy Shulgan said at the meeting  with the commission. "The owner is the Pacific Fleet."    "After the Government of Russia banned liquid radioactive  waste dumping, the fleet also has been unable to resolve this  problem," emphasized the Pacific Fleet deputy commander, Rear  Admiral Nikolay Lysenko.    The facility for storage and processing of radioactive  waste,  including liquid, which existed in the 1960's at the Sysoyev  Cape was closed down temporarily by the Pacific Fleet more than  20 years ago; in the opinion of specialists, it is unlikely that  this facility could be restored.    Construction of a new facility, regardless of which design  and whose money was used, cannot be accomplished in less than  six to nine months. Meanwhile, the tanker, despite the fleet's  energetic efforts to keep it afloat, may, if not sink, at least  begin seriously leaking radioactive waste.    "Right now we are only talking about the waste stored in the  tanker, but this is only part of the problem," emphasized  Dmitriy Gichev, deputy chief of the Vladivostok consolidated  inspectorate for nuclear and radioactive safety. "Over 30 years  of active exploitation, the TNT itself has become a source of  radioactive contamination. Even if we pump the contents out of  it, there remains the equally serious problem of dismantling the  tanker itself."    The commission's protocol is as alarming as it is hopeless.  Maritime Kray is unable to solve a problem whose roots are in  Moscow. Neither the plants, nor the fleet, nor the  administration received any reply to their numerous appeals to  Moscow. Just as there is no federal financing for the program of  improving radiation safety drafted by the Government of Russia  in August last year. The issue of building a radioactive waste  processing facility in Maritime Kray was to be resolved under  the provisions of this program.    Moreover, from the faraway offices of the Moscow military  brass an order arrived at the fleet to prohibit access to  military facilities to anyone whatsoever. Therefore, the kray  commission had to go to Moscow to obtain permission to examine  the decommissioned TNT-5. Journalists were not permitted on  board this "classified military facility" (which, I repeat, was  decommissioned from the Pacific Fleet two years ago).    Compared to other enterprises (the Urals Mayak plant, for  instance, is in need of reprocessing liquid radioactive waste  with a radioactivity level of 500 million curies), Bolshoy  Kamen's 30 curies may look like a drop in the bucket, but it is  our ocean, as it is our land on which we live and the products  of which we consume. Why should we all remain hostages to a  government that is trying to maintain a good image in the eyes  of the world at the expense of our health and safety?    By the way, in the opinion of specialists, if a catastrophe  with TNT-5 does occur in Bolshoy Kamen, because of the  specificity of underwater currents the main victim will be  Vladvostok. Specialists already note a higher radioactivity of  bottom-layer sediment in Shamora and Tavaiza bays as a result of  work with nuclear submarines at the Zvezda plant.    So far the situation in Bolshoy Kamen is relatively calm.  The  plants were promised a 200,000 ruble advance for February,  provided there is enough cash. Another nuclear submarine has  arrived for repairs. On the one hand, it is work for thousands  of people; on the other, new cubic meters of radioactive water,  which may become the last drop that will cause the cup of  radioactive equilibrium to overflow -- and then we will have an  ecological catastrophe. The bureaucrats in Moscow refuse to see  this, however.</p>

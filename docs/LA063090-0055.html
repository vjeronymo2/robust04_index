			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STORE OWNER SUES CARLSBAD OVER MIGRANT CASE  </P> <P> The owner of the Country Store in Carlsbad has filed a $4-million claim against  the city, alleging that he was falsely arrested by police officers in  connection with the January abduction of a 27-year-old Mexican migrant worker.  </P> <P> Rickey Ryberg, the older brother of Randy Ryberg -- convicted earlier this  month of misdemeanor false imprisonment in the case -- also claims that he was  slandered during his arrest at another convenience store he owns.  </P> <P> Ryberg was initially arrested Jan. 3 along with his brother, a baker and food  wholesaler at the Country Store, in connection with the unlawful detainment of  Candido Gayosso Salas as he sought work in the parking lot outside the store.  </P> <P> Both men were released shortly after their arrest. The district attorney's  office subsequently declined to pursue charges against Rickey Ryberg.  </P> <P> Randy Ryberg and William Zimmerman, a self-employed meat cutter at the Country  Store, were tried in Vista Superior Court earlier this month for the incident,  in which Gayosso was handcuffed to a store railing for more than two hours,  then tied and hooded with a paper bag that read "No Mas Aqui," or No More Here.  </P> <P> Randy Ryberg, originally charged with felony false imprisonment, was convicted  of a reduced charge. Zimmerman was acquitted on all charges.  </P> <P> Rickard Borg, a Carlsbad attorney representing the Country Store, said Friday  that one $2-million claim alleges that Ryberg was arrested without probable  cause.  </P> <P> The second claim, also for $2 million, alleges that a Carlsbad police officer  entered a local convenience store also owned by Rickey Ryberg and made  slanderous statements in front of two store employees.  </P> <P> Carlsbad City Atty. Vince Biondo could not be reached for comment.  </P></p>

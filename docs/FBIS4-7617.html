			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Konrad Sadurski: "Extension of Lessening Debt </F> Burden"]    [Text] Seven state-owned banks have managed to deal  with a majority of old credits that have not been repaid and  that amount to 16 trillion zlotys [Z], the Finance Ministry  says. Throughout April, the banks must either sell the so-called  bad debts or regard them as losses.    By Thursday [31 March], the seven banks that have emerged  from the Polish National Bank in 1989, were supposed to  eliminate the so-called bad debts, which are worth approximately  Z16 trillion. These are credits that companies have stopped  repaying as early as before June 1991.    The law on lessening the debt burden allowed banks to decide  what to do about dishonest debtors: to lessen their debt burden  if the debtors' activity brings profit, to sell their debts, or  to move to have the company in question declared bankrupt or  dissolved. For banks not to get into financial trouble in the  process of lessening the debt burden, the state budget gave the  banks bonds worth Z11 trillion. At the same time, the budget  imposed an obligation on the banks to get rid of the credits by  the end of March.  <H5>  There Are No More Old Debts Anymore </H5>   According to the Finance Ministry, banks had gotten rid of a  majority of old debts by the end of February. "We will not have  complete data until mid-May, once the bank's situation is  examined by auditors," chief of the Finance Ministry Henryk  Chmielak assured his listeners during a press conference held on  Thursday.    By the end of February, banks have concluded about 50  agreements and contracts, which made it possible for them to  restructure about Z3.6 trillion old credits.    "We have received signals that many banks managed to come to  an agreement with their debtors only at the last moment.  Yesterday, the Lublin-based Savings and Credit Bank signed an  agreement with the Stalowa Wola steelworks," Minister Chmielak  said.    "If a bank initiated proceedings before the end of  February aimed at signing an agreement, it can continue with the  proceedings.. But the agreement must be signed by the end  of April," the minister warned. Banks have not yet completed  their negotiations with companies that owe the banks about Z4.4  trillion.  <H5>  Unsold Debts Mean Debts Without Value </H5>   In accordance with the law mentioned before, banks were also  empowered to sell debts by bad clients at public auctions. This  way, the seven banks wanted to get rid of financial claims worth  Z980 billion. Two-thirds of those claims were actually sold.    A derivative market for selling financial claims has only  begun its activity in March. "Banks are allowed to sell the  remaining financial claims by 24 April--that is, before auditors  initiate their control measures," employees of the Finance  Ministry say. In their view, if banks are not successful in  selling the debts of some companies, that will mean that the  debts are without value, and the given bank will have to regard  the money as a loss.  <H5>  Strategic Debts Not Wanted </H5>   Banks did not know what to do about debts by those companies  that are in trouble but that are of strategic importance to the  economy, like, for instance, arms factories. "The Finance  Ministry has made efforts to have debts by 38 companies taken  over by an Agency for Industrial Development," we were told by  Finance Ministry officials. But the agency refused to do that,  saying that the companies are hopeless cases.    These companies owed about Z1 trillion just to banks,  whereas  their total debt amounted to Z8 trillion. The ministry decided  that the banks must also sell the debts of these companies.    Banks have submitted motions to have companies declared  bankrupt or to have them dissolved. This applies to those  companies that owe the banks Z676 billion. Companies that have  not repaid the seven banks' Z1.6 trillion went bankrupt or were  eliminated. Some clients have initiated servicing debts worth  approximately Z1 trillion.  <H5>  Western Money, Clean Accounts </H5>   Banks must clean their accounts, and, in this way, they will  become more attractive to investors during privatization.    "Privatization of those banks will bring two kinds of  benefits to the state budget," Minister Chmielak argued. "First  of all, the budget will receive revenue from the banks'  privatization, and, second, the budget will not have to buy out  the bonds that the budget had given to the banks."    After the sale of a bank, money to buy out the bonds would  come from a State-Owned Fund for Bank Privatizations. The fund  has about $650 million at its disposal; it was established out  of the old Fund for Stabilization of the Zloty. A majority of  the fund's monies comes from donations by other countries.    The money is in the Federal Reserve Bank in New York, and it  earns interest. Privatization of a bank is the only precondition  for being able to use the money. First in line is the  Krakow-based Industrial-Commercial Bank, which must be  privatized by 20 January 1995.    --According to the Finance Ministry, it will not be possible  to use the money out of the Fund for Bank Privatizations to buy  out Z10 trillion worth of bonds that the General Savings  Bank-National Bank and the Food Industry Bank had received.  These banks received the bonds later, which means they must get  rid of the debts by the end of September.</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Future of Independent newspapers remains in balance The battle for the future of Newspaper Publishing, owners of The Independent and Independent on Sunday, last night appeared to be reaching a critical stage - but the final outcome was far from clear. An offer, at least in indicative terms, for just under 30 per cent of the company has been received by Mr Ian Hay Davison, Newspaper Publishing chairman, from Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers of Ireland. At the same time, talks between a consortium of existing shareholders and founders are continuing with three national newspaper groups including Mirror Group Newspapers and Mr Conrad Black's Daily Telegraph. There is a widespread view at The Independent that Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, the principal founder of the paper, which has suffered a serious circulation fall in recent months, is particularly keen to reach an agreement with MGN. In this scenario, existing shareholders El Pais and La Repubblica of Spain would increase their stake to 51 per cent, MGN would take 40 per cent. The rest would be held by founders and staff with rumours of an indicative share price of Pounds 2 - valuing the company at Pounds 40m. It is believed however that MGN, which is interested in a stake in the Independent, has not yet agreed anything, even in principle. The left-of-centre newspaper group has not seen detailed financial figures for Newspaper Publishing and has not yet submitted an indicative share offer price. If a Pounds 2 deal is done, a share price valuing the company at around half last year's revenue of Pounds 81m could become controversial. Some analysts suggest that, in spite of losing Pounds 486,000 last year, Newspaper Publishing could still be worth considerably more than half its annual revenues in a depressed year.</p>

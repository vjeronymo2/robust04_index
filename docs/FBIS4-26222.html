			<p>BFN     [Text] Harbin, June 17 (XINHUA) -- An increasing number of  potential overseas investors are turning their eyes to China's  agricultural development projects.    In the recent influx of foreign investment, the construction  of a new foreign-funded farm, the country's biggest in farm  production joined by overseas firms, has started in the vast  stretches of land under the jurisdiction of Fujin city, in  northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.    The project, covering an area of 38,000 hectares of  wasteland, was jointly financed by China and the Republic of  Korea with investments totalling 227 million yuan (26.7 million  U.S. dollars). It is expected to be completed in three years and  provide an annual grain output of 105,000 tons.    According to an official with the provincial agricultural  development department, in Heilongjiang there is a total of 8.6  million hectares of farmland and 1.8 million hectares of  cultivatable wasteland. The rich land resources are becoming a  main attraction for overseas business people who seek to invest  in China.    He said that the World Bank also has shown great interest in  the development of arable lands in this area. It has approved  loans of 120 million U.S. dollars in developing land resources  in the province.    The loans will be used in cultivation of wastelands,  improvement of low-yield lands and grasslands and processing of  sideline products. The project will start in 1997.    Also, a Thai- and Malaysian-funded project involving 10  million U.S. dollars is being built in Hulin County of the  province. When the farm is completed, all its sideline products  will be exported.    To boost the development of its agriculture, the provincial  government has implemented preferential policies for use of  wastelands.    In other parts of China, including Liaoning and Jilin  provinces also in the northeast, the local governments have also  made efforts to encourage foreign investors to invest in  agricultural projects, particularly in the processing of  sideline products.    Xiao Zhuofu, vice-governor of Liaoning, said that his  government has decided to select more farmlands for development  by foreign firms. A farm experimental center will be built near  Jinxi city to show how overseas investment has been attracted to  the province, he said.    The Chinese central government has long paid attention to  development and construction of grain production bases in  northeast China.    Toward the end of the 1970s, one farm in Heilongjiang  Province took out loans of one million U.S. dollars to import  more than 60 sets of farm machinery.    Later, the country's first modernized farm, called "Honghe  Farm," was built in this province with a loan of 110 million  yuan from the Japanese Government in the form of compensation  trade. About 20,000 hectares of wasteland were cultivated. The  loan had been paid years ago with the soybeans produced in the  farm, which is now affiliated with a new town.    So far, a number of such farms have been built in this vast  fertile plain.</p>

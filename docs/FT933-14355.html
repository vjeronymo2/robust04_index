			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / SFO to probe Gooda Walker syndicates LLOYD'S OF LONDON, hit by record losses and troubled by legal action, faced fresh controversy yesterday when the Serious Fraud Office launched a formal investigation into the insurance market's biggest loss-making syndicates. The investigation into the affairs of insurance syndicates formerly managed by the Gooda Walker agency at Lloyd's presents the market with further difficulties just as it is trying to attract corporate investors. Gooda Walker syndicates lost more than Pounds 900m between 1987 and 1990, nearly a sixth of the market's overall losses of more than Pounds 6bn in the past six years. The SFO decision to investigate follows its review of a report into the four Gooda Walker syndicates by Mr Ken Randall, a director of the insurance agency now managing their affairs. The Randall report, handed to the SFO in April, alleged that Gooda Walker syndicates artificially inflated their profits during the 1980s by improper use of 'time and distance' policies. These are reinsurance policies that allow Lloyd's syndicates to manage their reserves against so-called 'long-tail' claims more effectively. Long-tail claims come many years after the start of policies. Mr Randall is examining other areas of the syndicates' business, in particular other reinsurance transactions. Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, said he had decided to publicise the investigation which he said ran parallel to Lloyd's own inquiries. 'I was determined to get it into the public arena. We want to deal with this rigorously.' Mr Rowland, however, conceded that the announcement could damage confidence in the market and make it more difficult to attract corporate capital. Although Lloyd's new leadership has made considerable progress in improving the market's efficiency and its image in recent months, some would-be investors have been affected by recent publicity over loss-making Names - the individuals whose assets support the market. The investigation also looks certain to lead to a deterioration in relations between Lloyd's and Gooda Walker Names. Following news of the investigation the Names are pressing Lloyd's to suspend moves to draw down their assets. Some 4,500 Gooda Names are expecting to pay cash calls totalling some Pounds 157m at the end of this month, which represents an average burden of about Pounds 35,000 for each of the Gooda Names. 'Many Names are near destitution and any further cash demands on them against a background of fraud investigation would be wholly wrong and offend natural justice,' said Mr Tom Benyon, vice-chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group. Mr Rowland insisted that Lloyd's would go ahead with its plans to issue cash calls and draw down the deposits of Gooda Walker Names. 'We have a duty to pay claims,' he said. Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the action group, said despite support for efforts to achieve an out-of-court settlement the Gooda Walker Names intended to press ahead with their legal action alleging negligence by their agents. The case could come to court in the first half of next year. Names reverse Norman conquest, Page 6</p>

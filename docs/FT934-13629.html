			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / US drug policy aims to reduce hard-core use THE Clinton administration yesterday unveiled a new drug control policy that it said would concentrate the government's efforts on reducing hard-core drug use, instead of curbing casual use. Mr Lee Brown, director of the White House's office of national drug control policy, said hard-core users not only accounted for most of the consumption of such drugs as cocaine or heroine, but also caused most of the social disruption and violence linked to drugs. The policy would also aim, Mr Brown said, more at the treatment of drug use as a medical problem, and not just on law enforcement. 'We must be prepared to focus as never before on solutions to the problems of heavy drug use from both the criminal justice and public health perspectives,' he told the Senate judiciary committee yesterday in presenting his new interim strategy. Nevertheless, Mr Brown firmly rebuffed those who have called for the legalisation of some drugs as a better way of tackling the drug problem. 'The administration is, without any reservation, opposed to the legalisation, decriminalisation or medicalisation of illegal drugs,' he said. The new policies have already come under fire from both sides of the debate. Senator Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican, accused Mr Clinton of a 'tragic abdication of leadership' and 'slipping inexorably into the old permissiveness.' But Mr Kevin Zeese of the Drug Policy Foundation, an institute advocating drugs reform, complained that the administration might talk about increasing the emphasis on treatment, but was still devoting most money to law enforcement. 'This so-called strategy still gives law enforcement a two to one advantage in funding. That is not change,' Mr Zeese said. The US has spent Dollars 38.5bn on the 'war on drugs' over the past four years but the drug use statistics suggest that this money has done little either to control supplies of narcotics coming into the country or to curb demand among drug users. The administration has found it hard to persuade Congress to shift money away from some older programmes and towards its new initiatives. Mr Brown said the new programme would expand the US's capacity to treat drug addicts and compel convicted criminals to complete treatments, with spending concentrated on inner cities. Efforts to deter first time drug use would target inner city youths, children and pregnant women, and would include underage alcohol abuse as part of the larger drug problem, Mr Brown said.</p>

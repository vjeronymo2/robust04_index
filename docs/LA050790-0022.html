			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> JOHNSON TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING;  </P> <P> TWO-SPORT STANDOUT: VENTURA COLLEGE BASEBALL AND FOOTBALL STAR IS HAVING  TROUBLE DECIDING WHERE TO FOCUS HIS TALENT.  </P> <P> Many who know John Johnson believe the two-sport standout at Ventura College  can become a major college running back or a major league baseball player. What  he can't do -- at the moment, at least -- is make a major decision: Should he  focus his considerable talent on baseball or football?  </P> <P> Johnson, who is completing his freshman year at Ventura, had a chance to play  football at the University of Arizona this past season. He also had an  opportunity to play minor league baseball in the Seattle Mariner organization.  Instead, the 1989 Channel Islands High graduate stayed home and attended  Ventura.  </P> <P> "At this time in my life, Ventura is the best place for me," said Johnson, who  in the past year saw his chance to attend a four-year school undermined by his  performance on college-entrance tests.  </P> <P> "It's giving me time to figure out what I want to do, and allowing me to get a  better feel for what is expected of me in the classroom. Right now, I'd say  people can probably expect me to be back here next year doing the same thing."  </P> <P> But a few moments later, Johnson admitted he "very well could be in a minor  league uniform by this summer." Then, shortly after that, he spoke glowingly of  his longtime dream of becoming a star running back for a major college.  </P> <P> It seems the closer Johnson gets to deciding what to do with his life, the more  confused he becomes. Although he considers himself a "kid at heart," some of  the decisions he will have to make in the near future are anything but kids'  stuff.  </P> <P> Ventura baseball Coach Gary Anglin, who played football and baseball at Ventura  from 1970-71, understands Johnson's dilemma.  </P> <P> "It's definitely a tough spot to be in," Anglin said. "When you decide to go  out for a sport on the college level, the coaches expect you to give it 110  percent. You also have to worry more about academics than you did in high  school.  </P> <P> "So when you decide to do two sports, the demands are even greater. It doesn't  leave a young man much free time."  </P> <P> Anglin has told Johnson that he would help him weigh his options but that he  wouldn't make a decision for him.  </P> <P> Former Ventura football Coach Phil Passno, who resigned at the end of the 1989  season, said: "John goes out for a sport for all of the right reasons. He wants  to help his team, he loves sports, and he's very competitive. Those are the  reasons we have athletics, and that's why John has a hard time giving any of it  up. He's having too much fun. And there's nothing wrong with that."  </P> <P> Johnson, 19, is the youngest of four brothers who had outstanding athletic  careers at Channel Islands. Bruce (who graduated in 1977), Hilria ('80) and  Steve ('83) all played football and earned all-league honors. Joel Gershon, who  is in his 16th year as Channel Islands' football coach, said everyone in  Johnson's family kept telling him John would be the best.  </P> <P> "John certainly lived up to everyone's expectations," Gershon said. "He made a  tremendous impact on our program."  </P> <P> In three years as a starting running back, Johnson rushed for 3,475 yards and  scored 42 touchdowns and 264 points. He was voted to the all-league team three  times and the all-Southern Section team twice. With Johnson in the backfield,  the Raiders won two Marmonte League titles and a Southern Section championship.  </P> <P> Johnson had his share of injuries, including severe wounds sustained in an  unprovoked shooting last November, but he has learned to play with pain. One  week after undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery midway through his senior  season, Johnson rushed for 104 yards in a victory over Huntington Park. He  missed only one game that season and finished with 1,185 yards and eight  touchdowns.  </P> <P> Prior to the knee surgery, the list of colleges trying to sign him was long.  After the setback, only UCLA and Arizona were interested. And when Johnson was  having trouble getting 700 points on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, the score  necessary to be eligible for athletics as a freshman, only Arizona maintained  contact.  </P> <P> Johnson never received the needed SAT score; Arizona officials told him to  attend a junior college, and said that if he performed well academically they  would give him a scholarship for his final two years of eligibility.  </P> <P> "If we made John Johnson a deal, then it still stands," said Bill Logan,  football recruiting coordinator at Arizona. "In fact, we have two players on  our team who play baseball, so the fact that John is a two-sport athlete  doesn't bother us a bit."  </P> <P> Upset over his dwindling prospects in football, Johnson turned to baseball and  excelled in his senior season at Channel Islands. He batted .412 in 24 games  with five home runs and 15 runs batted in. Johnson, an infielder, was selected  in the 54th round of June's amateur draft by Seattle and was promised a signing  bonus if he had an all-star season in the minors.  </P> <P> "It wasn't a total surprise to be drafted," said Johnson, 5-feet-10 1/2, 206  pounds. "But baseball had always been my second sport to football. Now I was in  a position of contemplating a career in the sport. I love baseball and  considered going right into it. But then I thought I should wait and take more  time to decide."  </P> <P> That decision led him to Ventura, for which his brother Steve was the most  valuable player in football in 1984. Initially, Johnson planned to go out only  for the baseball team to try to improve his prospects in this year's amateur  draft. But as football season approached he had a change of heart.  </P> <P> "We had already been practicing for 10 days when John came by and said he felt  he could make a contribution to the team and wanted to play," Passno said.  </P> <P> A week later, Johnson was a third-string tailback in a scrimmage against  Hancock College. The first time he touched the ball he went 60 yards for a  touchdown. He finished with 88 yards on four carries.  </P> <P> Five games into the season, Johnson was starting and rolling up yardage. He  helped the Pirates to a 7-0 record and what promised to be their best season in  years. Then came a major setback.  </P> <P> On Nov. 9, two days before a showdown against Moorpark College, Johnson was one  of five youths injured in a drive-by shooting in the parking lot of a Moorpark  shopping center. Johnson had just attended a high school game and was with some  friends when the shooting occurred. Johnson was hit by three shotgun pellets in  his left leg and took four in his right leg.  </P> <P> He missed the rest of the football season, and Ventura lost its four remaining  games. Johnson finished with 553 yards on 98 carries (a 5.6-yard average),  scored three touchdowns, and was voted to the Western State Conference first  team. He went through rigorous rehabilitation for the next three months to be  ready for baseball season, and was able to finish his fall courses and  participate in some winter baseball drills.  </P> <P> Johnson said that his right foot and shin have continued to bother him, but  that he feels "99 percent back to normal." He started at second base in 24 of  35 games for Ventura this season, batting .274 with 18 runs scored and 12 RBIs  as the Pirates finished 21-14.  </P> <P> Seattle is still interested in him but is evaluating whether it will draft him  again.  </P> <P> "We like John and are deciding where he fits and what we want to do with him,"  said Ken Compton, the Mariners' Southern California scout. "He's got potential  with a bat, but he needs to find a position. He's definitely not an infielder."  </P> <P> Even if Johnson is drafted again and receives a lucrative contract, he might  not play baseball.  </P> <P> "Right now, I have to say I'm leaning toward baseball because there's less  contact, and I envision a longer career in the sport because of that," Johnson  said. "The knee injuries really forced me to re-evaluate things. I look at the  future and wonder how long my knees will hold up.  </P> <P> "But it would be hard not to play football again. I've been playing the game  since I was 6, so it's difficult to think I'll never carry the ball again. At  this point, I guess you could say I'm still very undecided."  </P></p>

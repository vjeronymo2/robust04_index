			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Napa Valley Train Gets Nod: The California Public Utilities Commission gave its  unanimous approval to a settlement that will allow the Napa Valley Wine Train  to start passenger service through the famed wine valley in about three weeks.  NVWT President Jack McCormack immediately announced that service between Napa  and St. Helena will start Sept. 15, with twice-daily service Tuesday, Wednesday  and Thursday, and three times on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The interim  operations will not affect two court actions to be heard this year in San  Francisco and Washington on which agency has the authority to regulate the  train -- the PUC or the federal Interstate Commerce Commission.  </P></p>

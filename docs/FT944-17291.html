			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Arts: Private passions, public lives - Clement Crisp abhors the muck-raking in recent biography 'I don't care what people do, so long as they don't do it in the street and frighten the horses'. The comment was made at the time of Oscar Wilde's trial, and what an admirable rule it could still prove today, when the publisher's office is mistaken for the confessional, and rubbing the reader's nose in the dirt is the justification for a good advance on royalties. Once upon a time there was something called private life. It was no-one's business what people got up to unless they left the bedroom and the horses (and the moralists) reared up in alarm. No longer so, if stage or screen or sport - or, heaven help us, politics - is your stamping ground. The new style biography is a lubricious bore. 'Prurience pays' is the rule, and dirty linen (chiefly bed sheets) is washed and hung out for all too see. A recent cartoon in The New Yorker put it succinctly: it showed a hack at his typewriter with the muse at his elbow urging 'More sleaze'. In these dark days for life-stories, the real vice anglais is not an addiction to the whip but to the keyhole. The kiss-and-tell brigade is everywhere, though bang-and-boast is a better name. Even without the latest royal romance - whose author should perhaps have called herself Doris Pasternak - there has lately been a vulgar recounting of Pamela Harriman's life in barely-readable Time-speak, and the tasteless garrulities of Sarah Miles are now available in The Times. Muck-raking is replacing aerobics as fashionable exercise; readers are forced to be voyeurs. We live in the age of zoom-lens biography. Now come the stories of two celebrated male dancers, Rudolf Nureyev and Irek Mukhamedov, with authors eager to tell all. I am increasingly in favour of biographies that may be said to tell nothing, and keep the skeletons in the closet. (Is it not high time a lot of things were forced back into the closet from which they have emerged?). The discretion that marked Margot Fonteyn's autobiography, with no mention of intimacies, did not prevent its being a wonderful record of her life, and one which later, grubbier revelations do not diminish. It is the secrets of her artistry, not her amours, which are of public worth. Her friends knew of her loves and maintained a silence about her personal life, which says much for them, and for her own grace as a woman. Yet in Peter Watson's Nureyev, we are told of her pregnancy by Nureyev, and of an allegation that she 'took out a contract' to kill the man who had shot her philandering husband, Roberto Arias. The value  - and the credibility - of this stuff escapes me. With serious creative talents, sexual nature must bear strongly upon the products of that talent. But to be force-fed the storms and traumas of Mukhamedov's first marriage in Jeffery Taylor's biography, or to learn from Peter Watson of Nureyev's bath-house partners, seems to me both crass and unnecessary. Sexual gossip may have some passing interest as social comment, but for the most part it trivialises more than it enlightens. Does it make any difference to our understanding of Mukhamedov as a superlative dancer to learn that a 'minder' tried to climb into bed with him in Northampton, and was beaten off? Do we learn more about Nureyev by knowing that in Hollywood's gay community he was called The Great Vaselino? Peter Watson's Nureyev (Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 20, 470 pages) is by turns fascinating and exasperating. It combines admirable research about Nureyev's Russian years - some gleaned from KGB files - with material of the flimsiest interest about such individuals as Andy Warhol, at which moment it becomes a narrative auditioning for the front page of the cheapest tabloid. Nureyev was a promiscuous homosexual, haunting bars and bath-houses. His later years, fighting against disease and the decline of his physical powers, are tragically set against the Aids plague. His sexual identity was significant, but it was only one aspect of a driven personality that lived most truly on stage. Performance and applause were his drugs, and everything came second to them, even the wild round of his passing conquests. Apart from the classic dance, his greatest love was that balletic Apollo, Erik Bruhn, and their vexed relationship - Nureyev as both lover and as challenging and destructive rival - is well told. Yet there is an element of lubricity in the narrative, of gossip for discreditable gossip's sake, that I find unnecessary - not least in sections dealing with Fonteyn's life. A serious problem, too, is that Watson gives little evidence of understanding the ballet world in which his subject was so central. The book should have been edited by someone competent in dance matters to remove the abundant errors in name and fact. I must also note that Watson's account of Nureyev's last appearance on the stage of the Paris Opera, after the first night of his Bayadere, minimises the dignity of his behaviour, which I saw. He was indeed supported by two of the dancers, but his final salute showed him princely still in gesture, and undefeated. His last months are best understood through the beautifully written and piercingly observed account by Rudi van Dantzig, the Dutch choreographer, who visited Nureyev in the Quai Voltaire flat where he died. It was printed in the programme book for a London gala in Nureyev's memory in March this year. The dignity and precision of its writing make this book seem meretricious, and the use of chatty captions for the photographs - 'Douce Francois, who once dressed as a man to get into Rudolf's good books' - is not without significance. I suppose it is the sort of hectic memoir Nureyev's life off-stage merited. The grander story of his art on stage has yet to be told. Whether Irek Mukhamedov should have countenanced Jeffery Taylor's 'authorised' biography (Fourth Estate Pounds 18.99, 237 pages) is also a matter where art and gossip conflict. His life, like Nureyev's, brings insights into the secretive world of Soviet ballet, and into the shaping of a superlative talent. But Mukhamedov is still in his prime, a dance-actor of astonishing power and sensitivity. His ability to move from the Bolshoi Ballet's soaring heroes (Spartacus and their ilk) to the soul-searching challenges of MacMillan's Archduke Rudolph or the Foreman in Judas Tree is testimony to his rare gifts. These will demand proper analysis - but not yet, and Taylor does not essay it. Instead we are offered a seething account of Mukhamedov's first marriage. It is of quite staggering lack of interest. We are at the keyhole again, reluctant witnesses to other people's quarrels. In the real world there is little so off-putting and tasteless; on the page it is massively tiresome. Bad behaviour is a bore, and hugely as I admire Mukhamedov the dancer, I cannot believe that these marital storms are significant when considering his artistry. What Taylor has done is to inflate a Sunday supplement article about a great Soviet dancer adjusting to the West into a narrative bloated with passion and recriminations. The book's value lies in its first-hand account of Mukhamedov growing up, with less than encouraging detail of life and political in-fighting at the Bolshoi. But it is premature as biography, and uninteresting save in placing Mukhamedov in his artistic setting. It serves this great dancer less well that his talent deserves.</p>

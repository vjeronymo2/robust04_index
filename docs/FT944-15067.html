			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Row over milk study grows The gathering controversy over licensing in Europe of a milk-boosting hormone for cows takes a new turn today with three UK scientists accusing the manufacturer of seeking to suppress research pointing to adverse effects on the health of cows. Writing in the weekly scientific journal Nature, the scientists say that Monsanto, the US biotechnology company, provided them with results of trials on the incidence of mastitis in cows treated with the hormone, but refused to let them publish their analyses of the data. European Union agriculture ministers are due to decide at the end of the year whether to lift a ban on the use of bovine somatotrophin (BST). The hormone, an artificially produced version of one that occurs naturally in cows, increases milk output by between 10 per cent and 15 per cent. It went on sale in the US in February, but has met opposition from consumer and animal welfare groups in Europe and from the European Commission, which says that milk is already in surplus. The scientists say they pooled the results of eight trials by Monsanto. They found that BST treatment produced an average 19 per cent increase in the somatic cell count - associated with an increased risk of mastitis - which was highly unlikely to be due to chance. Their request for publication in a veterinary journal was refused by Monsanto's office in Brussels in 1991 and 1992 on the basis that the raw material, and any subsequent analysis of it, was confidential, the authors say. 'Our paper simply seeks to make public results that Monsanto appears to be making little effort to publicise and that we believe are of importance to the debate over the licensing of BST,' they say. The scientists say specialists on intellectual property rights have told them they are entitled to publish their analyses provided acknowledgement of the sources is made, which they are happy to do. Mr Tom McDermott, director of biotechnology communications at Monsanto, said: 'The assertion (by the authors) that they were somehow entitled to publish their analyses of other scientists' work, without approval or acknowledgement, is indefensible.'</p>

			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> BOND RATING HIKE WILL PAY OFF FOR CITY  </P> <P> City projects will cost taxpayers less in the future, thanks to an improved  bond rating awarded to Anaheim on Thursday.  </P> <P> Moody's Investor Service in New York, one of the nation's leading bond-rating  services, upgraded the city's rating to the level of just a handful of  California cities.  </P> <P> Only Los Angeles and San Diego have better ratings than Anaheim, and Sacramento  has an equal rating.  </P> <P> The improved rating gives the Anaheim better credit, allowing the city to  borrow at lower interest ratesThe lower rates could reduce annual interest on a  $10-million bond by $100,000 to $200,000, said George Ferrone, Anaheim's  finance director.  </P> <P> "That's very good news from our standpoint," Ferrone said, "not only from the  prestige standpoint, (but) also in the millions of dollars of interest  savings."  </P> <P> Projects to be funded by bonds include the proposed $95-million sports arena  and street improvements connected to planned expansion of Disneyland.  </P> <P> "In looking down the road in terms of our future, it's certainly a good cushion  to have," said Assistant City Manager James Ruth.  </P> <P> The decision by Moody's followed a meeting in January where Ferrone asked the  company to reconsider the city's current standing.

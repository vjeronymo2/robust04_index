			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Valeriy Sevryukov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS -- "Relations between Albania  and Russia are being developed on the new principles of  partnership, cooperation and mutual advantage. They take into  account the specific features of the Russian Federation as  successor of the former USSR, as a state with a huge economic  and intellectual potential, as permanent member of the U.N.  Security Council," Albanian Ambassador to the Russian Federation  Arbet Cici told ITAR-TASS.    These are the principles," he said, "on which Albania bases  its relations with other states in the interests of the region.  They rule out political and ideological servility, which had  sometimes existed in the past".    "During the past three years," the diplomat noted, "the new  Albanian-Russian relations were backed up by a consular  agreement on mutual trips, by agreements on air traffic and  automobile service, on public health and the environment, as  well as other inter-departmental agreements in the sphere of  education, culture, and the arts.    Agreements on the protection of investments, avoidance of  double taxation, cooperation in the sphere of education,  culture, science and technology, as well as a consular  convention and several other documents are ready to be signed.    "The laid beginning appears to be promising and is expected  to open up promising vistas for cooperation between our two  countries," the ambassador said.</p>

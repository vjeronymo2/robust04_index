			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by George Jones and Christopher Lockwood: "Hopes </F> Grow for Ulster Political Framework"]    [Text] Corfu -- Efforts to achieve a political settlement  in Northern Ireland moved into a higher gear last night after Mr  John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish Premier, signalled  they were on course to produce a new document on the way forward  next month.    Their hour-long talks during a break at the Corfu EC summit  were described by British officials as "productive and cordial."    The optimism raised expectations that the two will be able  to  clear remaining obstacles to the publication of a framework  agreement on a political settlement at an Anglo-Irish summit in  July.    The document is seen as essential to ending the vacuum in  Northern Ireland following December's Downing Street declaration.    Teams of officials from both governments accompanied Mr  Major  and Mr Reynolds to Corfu and got down to work last night on  resolving differences over the repeal of Dublin's constitutional  claim to Ulster and over the shape and authority of proposed  joint boards to enhance cooperation.    The framework document will cover relations between London  and Dublin, cross-border co-operation and outline plans for a  new assembly in Northern Ireland. It is intended as the basis  for restarting talks between the constitutional parties. The  most controversial element is the proposal for new north-south  institutions in Ireland, which is expected to arouse opposition  from Ulster Unionists who will see it as a further surrender of  sovereignty.    Mr Major is prepared to have cross-border executive boards  to  oversee a common approach to areas such as transport, energy,  agriculture and tourism provided it is balanced by Dublin's  agreement to repeal legislation giving it a constitutional claim  to the province.    Richard Savill, Irish Correspondent, writes: Earlier it was  disclosed that Mr Reynolds considered a united Ireland "by  agreement and consent" would provide the best solution for the  problems of Ulster -- an objective rejected by Unionists.    His comment is contained in a letter to the hardline Ulster  Democratic Party which sought clarification of his  interpretation of the Downing Street declaration.    Last night Mr Jim Wilson the Ulster Unionist general  secretary, accused Mr Reynolds of "pouring petrol on the fire"  at a time when the province was "volatile."    In Dublin, more than a third of the submissions to a Sinn  Fein peace commission which took soundings from republicans and  nationalists after the declaration have urged the IRA to call a  unilateral ceasefire.</p>

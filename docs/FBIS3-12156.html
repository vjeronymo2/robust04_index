Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that  initial reports indicate that IDF soldiers shot at an Israeli  truck which drove through the roadblock they were manning. The  truck's two passengers were wounded. One of the passengers was  seriously wounded while the second man sustained light to  moderate injuries. After being treated at the scene by IDF  medical teams they were rushed to the hospital.    The riots in the Bedouin town of Rahat in southern Israel  are  growing worse. A short while ago, the rioters hurled firebombs  at policemen and at the Center for Bedouin Heritage. Our  correspondent Nisim Qeynan reports that the police commissioner  is currently meeting with local notables in an attempt to defuse  tensions but apparently no agreement has been reached on a  reduction of police forces and the evacuation of the police  station. The roads leading to the eastern entrances to  Beersheba are still closed because of rioting and stone throwing  incidents.    Following consultations with the police commissioner, Roni  Milo, the mayor of Tel Aviv and Yafo, this evening announced  that all the women and the youths arrested in the course of the  past two days of rioting in Yafo would be released this evening.  The mayor promised that if things remained quiet, the rest of  the detainees would be released. Our correspondent Dani  Gur-Arye reports that the mayor was speaking at a mourning  ceremony at the Muslim Club in Yafo. At the ceremony, many  people complained that the police had employed excessive  violence. Councilman Khalid Habub asserted that the Arab  residents of Yafo would accede to the mayor's request to show  restraint if all the detainees were released.    A firebomb was hurled tonight on Me'ir Naqar Street, in  Jerusalem's Armon Hanetziv neighborhood. No one was hurt and no  damage was caused. A child was lightly injured by glass shards  on Hizma junction, near Pisgat Ze'ev on the outskirts of  Jerusalem, when youths hurled rocks at a No. 25 bus.    In al-Tira, the police arrested eight youths this evening.  They are suspected of throwing stones at police patrol cars and  setting tires on fire. Our correspondent Yafa Glick reports  that a total of 38 youths from al-Tayyibah, Kafr Qasim, and  al-Tirah were arrested this evening by the Sharon District  police.</p>

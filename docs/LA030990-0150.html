			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VOTE ON WHO WILL POLICE LIGHT RAIL LINE POSTPONED  </P> <P> Following a protest from their own transit police, the Southern California  Rapid Transit District Board of Directors on Thursday put off for two weeks any  decision on whether to hire Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies to protect  the Long Beach-Los Angeles Light Rail Line.  </P> <P> The board had voted 9 to 2 a month ago to have its own transit police force  handle security on the 22-mile trolley line that will begin running between  downtown Los Angeles and Long Beach in July. Called the Blue Line, these  trolleys will be the first to operate in Los Angeles in 30 years.  </P> <P> The directors met Thursday to reconsider this vote after strong political  pressure from the mayor's office, the county Board of Supervisors and others  who favor use of the sheriff's deputies.  </P> <P> The board, after three hours of argument and protests from 50 RTD police  officers, decided to put the vote off until its next meeting, March 22.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission has built the $871-million  line and will turn rail operations over to the RTD this summer. Saying they  fear the RTD police could not handle security, the commission staff has tried  to force the RTD to hire the sheriff.  </P> <P> The Blue Line, which will link downtown Los Angeles to Long Beach, runs through  high-crime areas in South-Central Los Angeles that are also plagued by gangs.  Rail experts from both agencies agree that the line's success depends upon  riders feeling safe enough to board the trains.  </P> <P> After the RTD board voted Feb. 8 to give the security job to RTD police,  political pressure was applied by both Mayor Tom Bradley's office and the  supervisors to reverse the decision, several RTD board members said Thursday.  The mayor and individual supervisors appoint seven of the 11 members of the RTD  board of directors.  </P> <P> RTD board members Nick Patsaouras and Larry Gonzales -- working behind the  scenes with the Transportation Commission staff, representatives from the  mayor's office and the supervisors' staff -- fashioned a proposed two-year  contract that would give Blue Line security to the sheriff's office. At the end  of that period, the RTD could cancel the contract.  </P> <P> The $9.9-million-a-year contract called for deployment of a special force of  126 deputies, investigators and supervisors to police the line, according to  Sheriff's Lt. Jerry Schmiedeke. Cost of the contract would be paid by the  Transportation Commission.  </P> <P> Until recently, the RTD police force has been understaffed and torn by morale  problems, commission executive director Neal Peterson has said. He said an  opinion poll paid for by the commission revealed potential train riders have  more confidence in the sheriff's office.  </P> <P> However, Sharon Papa, the new RTD police chief, has assured the board that her  department can handle security on the Blue Line and at less cost. She has been  hiring and training new officers for the job. The cost, she said, would be  about $6 million, a savings of about $4 million for comparable service.  </P> <P> At noon Thursday, before the RTD board meeting, about 50 RTD officers in  uniform held a press conference to protest the proposed contract with the  sheriff's office.  </P> <P> And half a dozen officers testified during the stormy session, contending that  their small department was being squeezed out in a power grab by the sheriff's  office.  </P></p>

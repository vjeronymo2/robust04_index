			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Letter: Small company audit plans lift burden and focus responsibility Sir, I am surprised the DTI's initiative in reconsidering the need for very small companies to have an audit is not universally welcomed by the accountancy profession ('Move to cut audits attacked'). There seems to be a fear that by abolishing the small company audit directors of small companies will somehow be relieved of some of the responsibilities of limited liability in terms of financial reporting. In fact the opposite is true. The Companies Acts place responsibility fairly and squarely on the directors of all companies of whatever size to prepare annual accounts which comply with company law and accounting standards, and require these accounts to be filed with the registrar within the predetermined time limits. The absence of an audit would force directors of small companies to take these responsibilities more seriously as any legal action resulting from material mis-statements in their accounts would be directed at them rather than, as is often the case at present, at the auditors' professional indemnity insurance.

Speaking at an ANC  rally in King William's Town, he said the most recent Goldstone  report had identified senior police officers as having been  involved in the campaign of violence and death that had taken  place in South Africa for many years.    "I am certain that the ANC is going to pursue this matter no  matter how high it reaches," he said.    "It doesn't matter how high people are, it does not matter  how big their titles, it doesn't matter where they are within  the politics of South Africa.    "The terrorists must be punished."    This was a responsibility the organisation owed both to the  democratic process and to its people throughout the country. It  was a precondition to free and fair elections.    Mr Mbeki also said the commission's report gave the lie to  the belief that what had been happening in South Africa was  black-on-black violence. "What is Goldstone saying? It's not  black-on-black violence. It's people who are opposed to change,  people who like apartheid, people who want to maintain apartheid  (who were responsible).    "It was the violence of the apartheid system against our  people. It was a violence carried out over many decades to  ensure that our oppression continued."</p>

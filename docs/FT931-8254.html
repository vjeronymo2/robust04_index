			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News in Brief ARES-SERONO, the Swiss pharmaceutical company, said that it expected higher group net profits for 1992, and added that 1993 earnings should at least keep pace with 1992 growth, Reuter reports from Zurich. A company spokeswoman said the group expected 1992 group net profits to rise to more than Dollars 100m from 1991's Dollars 71.2m. The expected rise was due to the sale of its non-prescription drugs unit last March to Italy's Home Products Italiana.</p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Arts: Imaginative implication of the monumental - William Packer discusses the sculptors Eduardo Chillida and Igor Mitoraj The Catalan sculptor, Eduardo Chillida, is now at 68 firmly established as one of the great artists of the post-war period, widely and regularly exhibited on the continent and in the US over four decades. Yet in Britain one would hardly know it, until the autumn of 1990, when the South Bank Board made magnificent amends in giving him a full-dress retrospective at the Hayward. Yet even then an exhibition as physically beautiful and impressive in its installation was shamefully neglected critically and under-visited. Any Chillida show is therefore still a major and remarkable event, and this at Annely Juda, only the fourth in London in his long career, all the more to be welcomed. This present show of recent work is entirely in the character of the whole oeuvre. It includes nothing on a truly monumental scale, yet the free-standing pieces are weighty enough, and even the tiniest of the maquettes, or the most delicate of the paper reliefs, carry all the imaginative implication of the monumental. And it is all extremely beautiful. He is a carver and a modeller, never the assembler or collagist, even though much of his material may only be cut or bent by the heaviest industrial equipment. The sense is always of the object made directly under the artist's own hand. The imagery is nominally abstract and unspecific, referring to nothing outside itself, yet the carvings offer spaces to enter and inhabit in the imagination, the metal arms and fingers writhe and twist, inviting a real embrace. Human in scale, directly active and physical in their engagement, humane in all their connotations and suggestions, these things tell us that nothing that touches our experience can be truly abstract. Does this reach to the nub of the problem? To be accepted as the thoroughly modern artist in official eyes, must one stand back from the material and the making of the work and any intuitive development in favour of a coldly cerebral, theoretical engagement? But Chillida has ever been his own man, a thoroughly modern artist yet sublimely indifferent to the supposed imperatives, the ever-changing orthodoxies of avant-garde and critical fashion. Such is his strength, which is why he is so good and, in the longer term, will surely be seen to be so significant an artist of our time. Igor Mitoraj, the younger artist by 20 years, was born in Germany during the war and brought up in Poland. He now divides his time between Paris and his studio at Pietrasanta, near the marble quarries of Carrara. He too is a carver and a modeller, and his work, currently on show at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park and three London galleries, is nothing if not figurative. He derives his imagery from classical example and is particularly intrigued by the isolated and portentous, often massive fragment - the foot of some vanished colossus or perhaps the mask, the 'shattered visage' of old Ozymandias , with its 'frown, and wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command'. A head is draped and bound into anonymity: a group of heads, broken and split, gaze calmly out upon the world; a headless torso in its breastplate rises monumental on its high plinth; androgynous angels stand quietly together; a high-stepping centaur, a head peering from its belly, strides out across the hillside. This is neo-classicism revived not as principle but as romantic day-dream that frequently comes perilously close to kitsch indulgence and sentimentality. Mitoraj is no Canova, and the marble carvings especially have much of the quality of Victorian funerary statuary, more worthily competent that convincing. And yet there remains a certain imaginative potency that, in the more successful pieces, is very strong. There is much in all four shows for an English sensibility to resist, the slickness the overall air of cultural chic. But the prejudice should be resisted, for it is unfair. As a modeller, in the terracottas and the cast bronzes, Mitoraj shows himself to the greater advantage, especially so in the more intimate pieces. The touch is sure and lively, the observation acute, the realisation, for all the symbolic adaptation, distortion and fragmentation, close to the physical reality presence of the human model. It would seem that in this newest work, despite all the success of public commissions on the largest scale, Mitoraj is still growing rapidly as an artist and moving in unexpected directions. These several shows make us look forward to whatever comes next. Eduardo Chillida: Annely Juda Fine Art, 23 Dering Street W1, until November 14; Igor Mitoraj: Yorkshire Sculpture Park, West Bretton, West Yorkshire, until spring 1993; supported by The Henry Moore Foundation, Visiting Arts &amp; the European Arts Festival; also at the Academia Italiana, 24 Rutland Gate SW7, until November, supported by the Arts Council of Great Britain; the Berkeley Square Gallery, 23a Bruton Street W1, until October 14: the Economist Plaza, St James's SW1, until December.</p>

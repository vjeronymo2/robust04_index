			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Tec issues warning over pit closures CONTINUED pit closures in Nottinghamshire would have a 'devastating' effect on the economic and social life of the county, the North Nottinghamshire Training and Enterprise Council (Tec) warned the government yesterday. It called for a national energy policy based on the use of coal as a strategic fuel. This is the first political intervention by a Tec, 82 of which have been set up to bring training closer to the needs of the private sector and to foster business growth. 'Everything we do on the training and enterprise front can be negated by a rapid reduction of the (coal) industry,' said Mrs Pat Richards, chief executive of North Nottinghamshire Tec. The stand taken by the Tec reflects disquiet in the region's business, voluntary and political circles about the plans of - and for - British Coal. Nottinghamshire County Council has this week published its coalfield strategy for this year. It opposes coal imports and urges support for deep-mined coal and the development of coal-fired power stations. The county council and the Tec are to put pressure today on Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, when he visits pits at Ollerton and Rufford in the county. They will seek assurances about the future of the local mining industry under whatever organisation emerges after privatisation of British Coal. The council and the Tec are seeking a meeting with Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to urge a review of government policy on coal. British Coal, which has a representative on the Tec, supports the Tec's position. But the corporation said yesterday that it could not put forward a definite policy for the Nottinghamshire pits until prospects for supply contracts to the power generators were clear and until the terms of privatisation were settled. More than three quarters of the coal mined in Nottinghamshire pits goes to power stations along the river Trent. British Coal said that 11 of the 12 remaining pits in the county were profitable even though the selling price of Nottinghamshire coal is only marginally higher than it was in 1985. The region's pits have reserves of some 540m tonnes excluding the reserves at Asfordby, a mine under development and due to come into production next year at the rate of 2m tonnes a year. However, 12 pits in the county have been closed since 1985. During this period productivity per man shift has risen 64 per cent. The Tec fears that further mine closures would be bad for the region. Mines are the main source of employment in the area, directly providing more than 12,000 jobs, and indirectly providing a further 4,000.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Stanislaw Bagdankevich, chairman of the </F> Belarusian National Bank, by Valeriy Koribut; place and date not  given]    [Text] The upcoming unification of Russian and Belarusian  monetary systems is by some regarded with hope, and by others  with wariness. However, first hand information on the event is,  so to say, in short supply. This is why our newspaper asked the  Belarusian National Bank chairman, Stanislaw Bagdankevich, for  an interview.    [Koribut] The declaration on the monetary unification signed  by the Russian and Belarusian prime ministers last week produced  somewhat mixed feelings. On the one hand, it has said that the  sides are ready to implement the merger; and on the other hand,  the whole range of issues seem quite ambiguous...    [Bahdankevich] This document reflects in the first place a  general acceptance of the idea of common currency and the  mechanism of the merger itself. At the same time, one should  admit that we have failed to reach a consensus on several key  issues. The most important of them is the setting of domestic  prices for energy sources and basic raw materials on the  territory of Russia and Belarus. The Russian side proposed a  gradual merger, under which the prices for Belarusian  enterprises would be lower than elsewhere in the world, and  would be gradually increased for local consumers. The position  of the National Bank on this is pretty clear -- immediately  after the Republic's transition to the Russian ruble, a common  mandatory price must be set for energy sources and basic raw  materials within a common customs zone. Otherwise, the merger  does not make sense since the Belarusian enterprises will prove  uncompetitive on the Russian market.    There are disagreements concerning the rate of exchange of  the Belarusian ruble to the Russian ruble. We examined several  options: the one-to-one rate, a rate calculated on retail prices  of the "consumer basket" and on the stock exchange data. The  latter is advocated by the Russian Ministries of Economy and  Finance. The Russian Central Bank is going to bring up this  issue again at one of its board meetings. It should be stated  that we only talked about non-cash money. As for the cash, this  topic will be addressed later. I can only say that we were  considering the possibility of freezing portions of deposits for  different terms. For example, 25 percent of large deposits  could be frozen for three, six, and 12 months.    Disputes were also triggered by the mechanisms of financing  state budget deficits. It is proposed that Belarus coordinate  them with Russia based on the GDP of each state, which is quite  a normal procedure. However, the Russian Finance Ministry is  inclined to perceive credits earmarked for this purpose as the  Belarusian debt to the Russian Federation. We are absolutely  against this, seeing them as the government's debt to its  population repaid through the pricing system; in our situation  -- through inflationary mark-ups [inflatsionnaya dobavka] added  to retail prices for goods and services.    [Koribut] In our country, reforms in the credit and  financial sphere are, as a rule, accompanied by unexpected  losses for one and undeserved benefits for the others. Will the  National Bank undertake any measures intended to reduce economic  losses that might be caused by the upcoming merger?    [Bahdankevich] It is impossible to completely eliminate the  possibility of economic problems for specific enterprises --  neither through economic nor administrative measures.    One should remember, however, that as a matter of fact, we  are talking about revaluation -- increasing the value of a  currency unit -- and, consequently, about advantages of those  with cash on hand, and losses for those who took credits. As a  result of revaluation, the former will increase their assets,  while the latter will have more money to repay. This is why the  National Bank demanded quick credit repayments, the sale of  ready goods, and the reduction of raw material wastes, etc. Let  me emphasize that substantial losses might be incurred by  enterprises that converted their bank credits into hard currency  in the hope that they would be repaid by the much devaluated  Belarusian rubles.    [Koribut] Everyone knows that the National Bank has  repeatedly alerted the Supreme Soviet to the need for a gradual  and balanced approach to the monetary systems unification. Do  you think that many of those fervently advocating the move now  will later become its staunchest opponents? First of all, they  might be managers who will discover that it is not enough to  enter the zone of the ruble -- one must also earn it.    [Bahdankevich] At this point, unification displays its  positive side. In addition to facilitated and simplified  circulation of goods, payment settlements, and travel  regulations, there are also macroeconomic advantages, such as  the removal of customs duties and the adjustment of domestic  prices for raw materials. After all, Russia will remain our  prime market for a long time yet.    The negative effects include the Republic's slow pace of  market- oriented changes, one-sided dependency on Russian raw  materials, and low competitiveness of Belarusian products.  Under certain circumstances, they could become dominant, with  the present negative payment balance that we run with Russia  threatening to crash our enterprises in massive numbers. This  is why unification provides no grounds for excessive optimism.  This is a chance, but will Belarus manage to grab it?</p>

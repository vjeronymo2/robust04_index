			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Article" by Station Correspondent Tran Thien Nhien: </F> "Seventh Party Congress' Feelings at Mid-Term "]    [Text] Not long ago, a saying spread around fully  describing the fine image of the first path of our party  renovation undertaking. Based on the meanings of the Roman  numbers, it predicted that, after the Sixth Party Congress, life  would be happy. This folk saying fully reflects the people's  dream and absolute belief in the success of the renovation  undertaking initiated and lead by our party. That belief is the  foundation for our political stabilization; and political  stabilization is a prerequisite for socioeconomic stabilization  and development.    By the end of 1993, we had covered exactly half the term of  the Seventh Party Congress. What can be said about the work?    In retrospect, we remember that at the middle of the year we  used to readjust our planning so as to lower our targets. This  was in order to allow us to achieve something by the end of the  year. Now, difficulties, obstacles, and dangers still exist.  But in only three years, we have accomplished many jobs planned  for five years. Is this not a fine characteristic of the new  stage?    On hearing that the world hailed our government's good  economic management, an economist made a nice but hardly  surprising statement: The cutting down of the inflation rate  from 57.6 percent to 4 percent within a period of three years is  not an easy job for any country. He also added: As an insider,  sometimes we cannot fully realize the significance of our work.  However, outsiders can see more clearly when they compare our  achievement with the real situation in the world.    As a matter of fact, five years ago nobody in the world  thought that Vietnam would survive when the USSR and European  socialist countries collapsed. Nobody thought that Vietnam's  poor, backward agriculture, permeated with continuous natural  disasters, would become the world's third biggest rice exporter.  Nobody foresaw that the 500-kilovolt National Transmission Line  -- which foreign specialists said that would only appear in  Vietnam after the year 2000 -- would come into existence and  start operating in the early second quarter of this year.  Somebody said that if wage reform is applied when the economy  is still in crisis, chaos will follow and inflation will  increase. That prediction has been totally discredited by the  real situation of 1993. These fine things have happened against  the background of many changes in the world. Should we not be  proud of ourselves?    Life is like a difficult mathematical problem. When we do  not try to solve it, we think it impossible to solve; but when  we start doing it, especially when we have completed one  calculation, the possibility of solving the problem will appear  clearer, giving us more confidence and energy to finish it.  Another interesting thing is that not only mathematicians  understand this.    As the economist has stated, it is certain that it was not  diplomatic politeness which directed the world's two monetary  organizations to appraise Vietnam as the best economically  managed country in Asia for 1992. It is also not coincidental  that the Donors' Conference in Paris was so successful. And  recently, the Paris Credit Club of 11 developed countries,  including the United States, decided to reduce Vietnam's debts  by 50 percent and grant Vietnam extra time to repay its debts --  in 23 years' time.    We highly evaluate, treasure, and appreciate the support of  the world community for our national construction undertaking.  We also clearly realize and correctly evaluate our  achievements. Nobody is fool enough to pour money into a  bottomless pit. Nobody wants to deposit one dong to recover  just one dong. And nobody wants to invest in a country with a  chaotic political situation, where different parties and groups  are fighting for more power in parliament rather than striving  to improve the national economy.    The economic development and political stabilization in our  country in the past years have helped us to create this  opportunity. They also prove the correctness of an important  concept in our party renovation line for national construction:  that is, accumulations must be obtained mainly from our internal  economy. External factors are very important, but internal ones  are more significant in creating an economic impact.    We must strive to develop our economy while step by step  improving our people's daily life, strengthening national  defense, ensuring political security, and maintaining stability  in order to further develop. We must also strive to open our  door so as to promote relations with foreign countries and to  learn from their experiences while consistently defending our  national independence and sovereignty, and formulating correct  lines and policies in conformity with our country's conditions  and our people's aspirations. These are the great tasks that we  must satisfactorily carry out.    With this as a reality, His Excellency Lee Kuan Yew, a  renowned strategic development planner in Singapore, recently  spoke to Western newsmen about Vietnam's current development,  saying that the matter does not depend on the one party or  multiparty system but rather on the leadership's ability to  develop the national economy.    It is not too much of an exaggeration to say that one of the  Vietnamese people's significant contributions to mankind's  development in the post Cold War period is that differences in  ideology and political systems are simply not the cause of  hostility and an uncooperative atmosphere among nations.    Today Vietnam is a socialist country that enjoys relations  with 167 countries in the world. Whether we choose to adopt a  conservative or progressive stand, we are ready to join the  international community while maintaining our own political  system.    Thus far, we have completed the first half of the Seventh  Party National Congress' term. The remaining second half is  very promising, yet with immense obstables. The new era will  also bring new difficulties and ordeals. While we are seeking  investment capital for development, we must strive to map out  plans to use this capital in the most effective way. In the  past, we strove to extricate our country from encirclement and  isolation; now we are striving to open our door while  maintaining our national characteristics. In the past, we  strove to attain a firm economic foothold; we are now working  hard to maintain our economic growth. In the past, we also  experienced corruption and smuggling. These and other social  vices are now developing and becoming serious while laws and  discipline are loosely observed. In the past we worked hard to  produce enough grain for our own consumption; we now talk about  how to sell more rice at higher prices and how to narrow the gap  between peasants in the rural and mountain regions and people in  the city; how to eliminate the division between the rich and the  poor caused by the market economy; how to firmly maintain the  ideal objectives charted by our party and state; and how to cope  with hostilities carried out by reactionaries at home and  abroad. However, these difficulties and ordeals cannot be  resolved overnight.    It is necessary to say that while there are changes for the  better in society, our infrastructures are still poor and  backward. More than two million city dwellers are unemployed;  more than 200,000 prostitutes have not been reeducated; 70,000  drug addicts have not been cured; AIDS is increasing; and so  forth.    We cannot belittle this situation in our country, but we  must  stay calm while finding ways and means to step by step resolve  these issues with confidence. This is the correct attitude for  coping with difficulties.    In the upcoming Vietnamese Lunar New Year, people in Hanoi  and Haiphong as well as the Vietnamese community in Moscow will  have the chance to enjoy Tam San rice fragrant rice, the  renowned traditional rice of Nam Ha province, packed in  beautiful plastic bags -- the new product of the Hanoi  Export-Import Corporation Union, which will be put on sale at  home and abroad during the New Year. The corporation director  said that if we want to compete in the world rice market, we  must plant and sell our traditional good quality rice such as  the Tam San and Nep Tam San [fragrant sticky rice] and so forth,  which were not promoted in the recent past. To restore the  planting of these varieties of rice, we must find the markets  and invest money to produce seeds, zone off planting areas,  restore the traditional method of cultivation, and improve  processing and management in accordance with modern  technological systems so as to attain the highest economic  result.    There are currently new things in our society. However, in  daily life we sometime need the old things. If we can restore  the old things we need with the application of modern  technology, we will obtain a better result.</p>

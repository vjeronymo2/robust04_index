			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Balladur unveils plan for tighter defence network The French prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, yesterday issued detailed proposals for improved defence co-operation between members of the European Union. He also suggested they negotiate a common security doctrine with forthcoming EU members in central Europe. In a speech to France's Institute of Higher Defence Studies, Mr Balladur said a white paper on European defence could be prepared for a future EU summit to which leaders of central European states could be invited. Such a white paper would be 'a first manifestation of the new solidarity' between the EU and its eastern neighbours. But he said existing EU states should, in any case, push on with reinforcing co-operation within the Western European Union organisation, particularly in planning joint operations and in developing 'a true European system' of space-based spy satellites. As the European state with the strongest ambition in the defence field, France is now at the centre of a web of arrangements with different WEU partners. Mr Balladur cited France's joint Eurocorps with Germany, Belgium, Spain and Luxembourg, its 'rapid reaction force' project with Italy and Spain, and its 'more embryonic' discussions with Britain on joint air force planning. But, echoing the wider debate over EU integration, he suggested the time might come for a WEU summit to consolidate the organisation as 'the central core' of European defence. In the shorter term, he called on the WEU to use its new planning cell in Brussels to prepare for joint military-humanitarian operations more effectively than it had done in Rwanda. He also called for a European observation satellite system, similar to the satellite photo interpretation system the WEU had set up in Spain. France is already working on the Helios optic and infra-red satellites with Spain and Italy, but Mr Balladur said he was 'counting a lot' on getting German financial support. France by itself could not maintain military technology and hardware across the board, he told his military officers, and so greater collaboration with other Europeans was essential. There is anxiety in the French government about the UK government's imminent choice between joining the project for a new European military transport aircraft or sticking with Lockheed of the US to fulfil its military transport needs.

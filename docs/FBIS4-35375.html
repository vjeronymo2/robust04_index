			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 30 May (MENA) -- Representatives of the  states making donations to the Palestinian police met here today  under the chairmanship of Norwegian Ambassador to Cairo Per  Thelin Haugestad.    The meeting was attended by representatives of the United  States, Russia, Japan, the European Union, Israel, and the state  of Palestine.    The conferees discussed ways to provide financial and  material aid to help the Palestinian police perform their duty  in the self-rule areas of Gaza and Jericho. They also discussed  ways to make the donor states speed up the provision of the  assistance they have promised and to encourage other states to  help the Palestinian police.    Rami Sha'th, head of the Palestinian delegation to the  meeting, told MENA that the conferees also discussed the  equipment and supplies the Palestinian security forces need to  do their job.    High among these needs, he said, is money to pay the  policemen, provide transport, and buy fuel, communications  equipment, and accommodation for the force.    Mr. Rami Sha'th said that in the first year alone, the  Palestinian police force needs about $180 million to do its job.  He said the amount promised by the donor states is much less  than that needed by the force.    He said a three-phased program for the work of the  Palestinian police has been drafted. The first program, he  explained, began early this month and will continue until  mid-June. The second phase extends from mid-June to next May;  and the third begins in May 1995 and ends one year later. He  said the aim of these phases is to enable the Palestinian police  and security forces to perform all their duties in Gaza and  Jericho.    The Palestinian official said the Palestinians have so far  received 200 American vehicles and technical assistance from  Saudi Arabia in transporting soldiers from several Arab  countries to Gaza and Jericho.    It was agreed with the Germans to hold a bilateral meeting  to  discuss German assistance, which is motorbikes for the police,  Sha'th said.    He said another meeting will be held with the Spanish side,  which will donate vehicles and communications equipment. He  added that the European Union promised to provide 10 million  European Currency Units (about $12 million), 5 millions in cash  and the other 5 millions in equipment and supplies.</p>

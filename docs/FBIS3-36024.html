This was announced to Interfax by the  committee's Chief Viktor Ilyukhin (the Communist Party's  faction).    In his opinion, it was necessary to utilize the provisions  of  the former law on Constitutional Court, which did not contradict  the new Constitution adopted at the referendum on December 12,  before a new law on Constitutional Court was adopted.    He reminded that the Russian Federation's constituent  members  were energetically issuing new laws and acts which at times  failed to conform with the Russian Constitution. Ilyukhin also  qualified several decrees of the Russian president as  "non-constitutional." According to Ilyukhin, the president  exceeded his powers when signing the decree on elimination of  the Security Ministry and on establishment of the Federal  Service of Counter-Intelligence subordinated to the Russian  president.    According to the deputy, the new Russian Constitution does  not mention the right of the president to resubordinate the  ministries. Ilyukhin considers this move aimed at establishing a  second government parallel with the cabinet of Chernomyrdin.    Ilyukhin is concerned over the fact that Yeltsin may not be  satisfied with resubordination of intelligence and  counter-intelligence and that he "harbors the idea to  resubordinate the Interior Ministry and the army." According to  Ilyukhin, this is to say that these bodies will be beyond  judicial and prosecutor's control and also beyond the  parliament's control" leaving them uncontrollable as during the  Stalin era.</p>

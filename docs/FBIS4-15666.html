			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dmitriy Zhdannikov in the "Diplomacy" column: </F> Estonia Still Hopes for a Summit"]    [Text] "The incident involving the killing of a Russian  serviceman on the border with Estonia shows once again the need  to resolve questions concerned with the border regime and  ensuring provisions to border areas," Juri Kahn, Estonia's  ambassador to the Russian Federation, said in an interview with  SEGODNYA. Meanwhile, according to information in SEGODNYA's  possession, Russia is ready to go ahead with a unilateral  demarcation of its borders in the northwest.    In spite of the failure of the latest, 18th, round of talks,  when Russia finally refused to pull out its troops before 31  August 1994, stating that this time frame is unrealistic because  the question of ensuring the rights of military retirees and  pensioners has not been settled yet, Ambassador Kahn stressed  that Estonia is ready to continue the negotiations at the level  of interstate delegations but only if the Russian Federation  observes the international obligations it has assumed. "We  believe that many problems could be resolved by a summit of  Presidents Yeltsin and Meri. The Russian Foreign Affairs  Ministry, however, with a persistence we cannot understand,  rejects the idea of a summit, saying that it is possible only  after the entire package of documents has been signed."    True, Mr. Kahn noted, such meetings are becoming less and  less probable, a case in point being the refusal by Latvian  President Guntis Ulmanis to visit Moscow on 20 April in response  to President Yeltsin's decision to create military bases on the  territory of the CIS and Latvia.</p>

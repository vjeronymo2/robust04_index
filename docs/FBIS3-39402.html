Foreign  Minister Karolos Papoulias today went to Belgrade to promote  this initiative. Papoulias will meet Serbian President Slobodan  Milosevic to discuss the developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina  which are at an extremely critical point.    Before his departure from Ellinikon Airport, Foreign  Minister  Papoulias stressed: I am going to Belgrade on a very important  trip, especially because it is just a few days, a few hours,  before the expiration of NATO's ultimatum. These are the last  intensive efforts we can make to save the peace. I believe,  Papoulias added, that the talks we have will be important and  productive in the direction we all want, that is, to promote the  European Union's plan and the peace process. There is no other  way, he said, and added: The road to peace is one way and  whoever thinks that with the use of force they will manage  something better than what we have achieved thus far, I think he  does not evaluate the situation correctly.    According to REUTER, it is possible that Papoulias will not  return to Athens but will visit another capital in Europe.</p>

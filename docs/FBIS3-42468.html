			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Text] Japan is still inadequately allocating resources for  scientific research in contrast to other industrially developed  countries, despite the enormous growth of appropriations in this  sphere over the last two decades. The Ministry of Foreign Trade  and Industry, which sets the direction of the country's economic  development, highlighted this problem in the latest issue of a  White Paper, suggesting the introduction of the indicator  Technostock as a yardstick for scientific research results.    Technostock is the total amount spent on research and  development taking into consideration the obsolescence factor.  To calculate Technostock, R&amp;D expenditures are multiplied by  the  Technoflow factor, the amount of which is lower than one and  depends on the time required to introduce new technology.  Technoflow is added to Technostock for the previous year, taken  also with the obsolescence factor, and the resulting sum is the  Technostock for that year.    There are two kinds of Technostock: the first calculates  expenditures for production and profits and the  second--so-called intellectual property.    Japan has been rapidly catching up with the United States in  production-directed Technostock. For the period 1970-1988, this  indicator increased by 608% in Japan and by a total of  10.8%  in the United States, although in 1970 the United States had 31  times as much production-directed Technostock as Japan. In 1988,  the gap had narrowed to 4.8. Japan's intellectual property  indicator rose 320% and that of the U.S.--50%--for  the period  indicated. The gap between the countries narrowed from 15:1 in  favor of the United States in 1970 to 5:1 in 1988. In the  process, the gap in total GNP between Japan and the United  States has been closing even faster. In 1988, the GNP of the  United States was only 1.7 times that of Japan.    Japan lags behind not only the United States but also Great  Britain, France, and Germany in the intellectual property  indicator and in the number of published scientific papers. Only  R&amp;D expenditures and the number of patents applied for in  other  countries were growing in line with GNP.    The White Paper recommends strengthening basic scientific  research while considering the results of a poll taken among  university and public officials that suggested assigning  priority to work in the areas of the ecology and energy-saving  technologies.

According to data in SPACE NEWS,  the United States, France, Japan, and China alone are annually  spending more than $1 billion on these needs.    NASA, with an annual budget of $14.7 billion which is spent  primarily on spacecraft, surveillance satellites, and the  development of the Freedom Space Station, remains the main space  exploration center. NASA's main partner on the continent is  Canada ($292 million). Brazil annually allocates $100 million  for the launch of satellites and Argentina--$10 million for the  launch of satellites to conduct astronomical exploration.    France, which spends $1.38 billion per year, leads on the  European Continent. Italy ($973.4 million), Germany ($969  million), and Great Britain ($206.6 million) follow. According  to official data, Russia allocates $741 million per year on  space programs.    In Asia, the space budget of two countries exceeds a billion  dollars. They are Japan ($1.262 billion) and China ($1.2  billion). China spends its resources primarily on launches, for  communications satellites and for meteorological satellites.  India, Taiwan, South Korea, and Pakistan also participate in  this activity.    Australia allocates $13 million per year for space  exploration. Only the RSA [Republic of South Africa] is  represented in space from countries on the African Continent.    The European Space Agency (ESA), with a budget of $3 billion  per year consisting of contributions from 14 European states,  coordinates European space programs. Canada is an associate  member of ESA, and ESA, in turn, is participating in the  development of the Freedom Space Station with a 10% share.    Washington (AFP), 2 September 1992.  <H5>  Germany Increases Amount of Financing for Scientific Research </H5>   Germany's Ministry of Research and Technology has a 3.55  billion budget for this year, or more than a 3.8%  increase as  compared to the 1991 level. A large part of the allocated  resources is earmarked for eastern Germany. In 1993, &pound;627  million or 18% of the science budget will be invested to  build  up research on the territory of the former GDR, which signifies  an increase in appropriations of 9.8% compared to the 1992  level. Approximately &pound;100 million from this amount is being  designated for universities.    The increase in financing comes in the wake of reports by  government and private agencies that the quality of research in  eastern Germany still lags far behind.    Research into climate, ecology, and public health won the  largest increases in funding. The Ministry of Research and  Technology has allocated &pound;5.7 million for this purpose.    In its space strategy, Germany is shifting from large-scale  manned flights toward unmanned flights and the expansion of  sensing from space, and is conducting negotiations with the CIS  countries about expanding cooperation in space research.    NEW SCIENTIST, 25 July 1992, Vol. 135, No. 1831, p.  4  <H5>  Siemens and Philips Joint Ventures in Germany and China </H5>   The EEC Commission intends to conduct a study of certain  agreements between Siemens (Germany) and the German subsidiary  of the Dutch firm Philips Electronics in accordance with the law  on company mergers.    According to the Commission's data, documentation will be  studied on the transfer of Philips cable plants in Koln and  Nurnberg to its German joint venture with  Siemens--Nachrichtenkabel und Anlagen.    In December 1991, Philips reported negotiations on the  transfer of its German and Dutch cable and optical fiber  manufacturing enterprises to Siemens.    The EEC Commission task also includes studying Siemens'  plans  to repurchase from Philips half of the share in the Chinese firm  Yangtze Optical Fiber and Cable Company. The remaining  50% of  the capital belongs to Chinese organizations.    The EEC Commission intends to investigate Siemens' plans to  increase its share in the German firm Norddeutsch Zeekabelwerke,  which specializes in the production of cables and measurement  equipment.    The EEC Commission has four weeks to ascertain if the  Siemens  and Philips agreement will inflict damage on the situation in  the European Common Market. In the event serious doubts exist in  the advisability of the deal, a more thorough four-month study  of the state of affairs will be conducted. The Commission has  the right to change the terms and even block an agreement that  lessens competition.    Brussels (AP), 9 September 1992.  <H5>  South Korea Finances Leading Technology Projects </H5>   In the middle of August, South Korea's Ministry of Science  and Technology announced the first projects proposed within the  framework of government efforts directed at achieving the  technological level of Japan and the leading Western countries  by the beginning of the 21st century.    The government program, assessed at $6 billion, is known as  the G-7 project (seven is the number of countries that are at  the level which South Korea intends to achieve. Besides Japan,  they are the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and  Great Britain). The South Korean Government plans to invest more  than 2,400 billion won (790 won = $1) into the project by 2001  matched by a similar amount from the country's industry.    The announced projects encompass three of the 14 scientific  research areas (new pharmaceutical and agrochemical substances,  new materials, and new functional biomaterials) and come under  the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Science and Technology.  Other projects, covering such areas as high-definition  television, semiconductors, communications lines, and automated  manufacturing systems, will be announced shortly by other  ministries.    More than 20 government institutes, 50 universities, and 60  private companies will participate in the already announced  projects. The Korea Institute of Science and Technology [KIST]  and the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology [KRICT]  will lead the research. The industrial firms participating  include such conglomerates as Hyundai, Samsung, Daewoo, and also  several pharmaceutical companies.    In 1992, the government and industrial firms allocated 27  billion won ($34 million) to develop the three indicated  research areas. Distribution of approximately half of these  budget resources was cited in a table and more complete  information will be published in several months (the data was  expressed in millions of won).    Dozens of pharmaceutical companies and several universities  will participate in research in the sphere of new medicines and  vaccines, to which a large portion of budget resources has been  allocated. Two nonprofit government-industry consortiums--the  New Medicine Development Consortium and the Genetic Engineering  Research Consortium--have been established.    Hyundai, Samsung, and Daewoo have supported research to  develop new ceramic materials for use in the heavy industry,  automobile, and electronic sectors. But so far there is no sign  of cooperation proposals from other countries, as the South  Korean Government had hoped.    NATURE, 20 August 1992, Vol. 358, No. 6388, p. 613.  <H5>  R&amp;D Expenditures in OECD Countries </H5>   The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development  (OECD), which includes 24 industrially developed countries, has  published information on the organization's member-countries'  expenditures for the conduct of scientific-research and  experimental design work. The OECD has published this  information for the first time, which provides the opportunity  to conduct an accurate comparison of R&amp;D expenditures in the  United States, Japan, and the European Community countries.    Per capita R&amp;D expenditures in the EC countries total  $310  per year, as compared to $510 in Japan and $600 in the United  States. In the process, these expenditures account for 2%  of  Gross National Product in the EC countries, 2.9% in  Japan, and  2.8% in the United States.    However, government appropriations for R&amp;D in the EC  countries cover 17.7% of total expenditures for this work,  compared to 8% in Japan and 12.4% in the United  States.    NEW SCIENTIST, 18 July 1992, Vol. 135, No. 1830, p.  11.  <H5>  Tax on Packaging </H5>   One of the most complex issues that manufacturers,  ecological  experts, and government organizations of the world's various  countries face right now is the continuously growing amount of  packaging materials that are used.    Until recently, the adoption of stricter decrees that  provide  for the government's increased role was proposed as the solution  to this issue. These are legislative acts that oblige  manufacturers to collect and reuse used packaging materials in  increasingly large quantities and also attempt to establish  quantitative indicators of the increase of the percentage of  wastes that are reused. Decisions were also made to ban certain  methods of destroying used packaging materials, such as burning  them.    The social and economic research center in the sphere of  global ecology thinks that using market laws is the most  effective method to resolve the problem. Center experts think  that we need to create conditions so that the minimum possible  amount of material is used during the manufacture of packaging  and introduce economic incentives to intensify the collection  and processing of used packaging we must do.    The introduction of a progressive tax on packaging  materials,  the amount of which would depend on the degree of danger this  type of packaging poses for the environment, is being proposed  as the best solution. It can be levied both directly by  government agencies and also by the manufacturers themselves in  the form of an additional collection. In this case, the market  will determine the best method to package goods.    It is proposed introducing three indicators as a general  established range on which the amount of the tax will depend in  order to ensure practical implementation of the approach "let  the polluter pay." The former takes into account the ratio of  the weight of the packaging to its volume, the second--the  number of times the packaging has been used, and the third--the  cost of collecting and reprocessing used packaging. So, if the  packaging manufacturer reduces its relative weight (the ratio of  the weight of the packaging to the volume occupied by the  packaged goods), the tax will be reduced correspondingly. The  same will occur in the event of an increase of the number of  times the packaging has been used.    As a result, an "additional" portion of the cost of  packaging  must be reduced to the amount of compensation for harming the  environment which is a consequence of just the process of  manufacturing and transporting packaging materials. Questions  regarding other sources of environmental pollution, like the  process of extracting bauxites that are needed to obtain  material for aluminum cans, will be resolved separately by  government organizations. Introduction of an additional  collection to the cost of packaging to compensate for the impact  of similar sources of pollution would result in the emergence of  ineffective dual taxation.    The obvious difficulty when introducing a new tax system  will  consist of the fact that its amount will be different for  various countries and various goods. So, the cost of avoiding  the use of packaging in the United States will be much lower  than in the Netherlands. In part this can be explained by the  fact that there is a risk of obtaining a swimming pool during an  attempt to dig a garbage pit. So, new taxes must be calculated  on national and possibly even regional levels. Practical  problems of organizing tax collection and their impact on the  international trade process also arise.    Preliminary calculations of the amount of taxes for various  types of packaging have led to interesting results. So, if we  examine various types of containers used to package nonalcoholic  beverages in Great Britain, the least amount of tax is for a  cardboard container (obviously, primarily due to its low  weight), the amount of tax will be higher for plastic bottles  (made of polyethylene terephthalate), still higher for reusable  (an average of 14 times) glass bottles, and also for aluminum  cans. The tax for heavy glass disposable bottles is very high.    The listed calculations were conducted by independent  researchers using specialists of the Swedish firm Tetra Pack,  which is the largest producer of multilayer cardboard beverage  cartons in the world.

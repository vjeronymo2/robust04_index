Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) announced Thursday that he is dropping  his bill that would have required state approval for any renovation of the Los  Angeles Memorial Coliseum.  </P> <P> Torres said he made the decision after reaching agreement with Mayor Tom  Bradley, preservationist group leaders and representatives of the Coliseum's  private management firm on a plan to protect the stadium's historic qualities.  </P> <P> Standing in front of the peristyle end of the 67-year-old facility, Bradley  said a four-day design workshop will be held in November to get input from all  interested parties -- including nearby residents and merchants, elected  officials, design professionals and governmental agencies -- on ways to upgrade  the stadium while preserving its historic characteristics.  </P></p>

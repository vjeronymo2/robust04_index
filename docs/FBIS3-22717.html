			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] An inspection of our hospitals shows that they  cannot fill the needs of patients treated with blood or its  by-products. The blood donation problem has become more  distressing because of the simple fact of the danger of the  spread of AIDS, as well as the increase of accidents resulting  from the increase in the number of vehicles in our country. We  interviewed Agim Kociraj, director of the Blood Transfusion  Service, about this problem.    Unattributed reporter: Mr. Agim, how is such a  situation created?    Kociraj: As the public is aware, three cases of  HIV positive AIDS infection have been identified in Albania.  The very important role of the Blood Transfusion Service in the  spread of this infection is also known. At this very important  moment, we have managed to exert 100 percent control over the  amount of blood collected from the blood donation system with  regard to the presence of this very dangerous infection.  However, the fact that all of the blood is 100 percent  controlled does not mean that the danger is completely  eliminated. Everyone knows that the methodology used cannot  identify the presence of the infection in its first phases. It  is known that this infection can be reduced at minimum, but  cannot be eliminated. In order to reduce to a minimum the  possibility of the infection spreading through the blood, it is  necessary to include in the blood donation system blood donors  from groups that less endangered than the majority of the  population insofar as carrying this infection. The fact that in  Albania the system operates with 100 percent paid donors does  not help much in this direction. This for the very obvious fact  that a small group of paid blood donors are always one of the  most endangered groups insofar as being an AIDS virus carrier.    What is envisioned, and what is being done in this  direction?    Viewing the problem with much seriousness, the Health  Ministry, in cooperation with the Blood Transfusion Service, has  passed a new regulation that anticipates collecting blood from  less endangered groups, first from the relatives and friends of  patients who need blood in our hospitals. This has considerable  importance because family members and relatives are of the less  endangered groups insofar as carrying the AIDS virus. For this  reason, we think we should cooperate with the relatives, family  members, visitors, and friends of the sick who need blood, so  that they prove their bond with the patients, considering that  these patients not only need blood but need the best ensured  blood.    This is the short-term program. The long-term program  contains a very broad propagandistic campaign for the creation  of a completely new tradition that has not heretofore existed in  Albania -- the establishment of voluntary, unpaid blood  donation. This program includes governmental and  non-governmental institutions such as the Albanian Red Cross and  the Health Education Directorate. Enormous assistance by the  mass media is absolutely necessary in this direction. For this  reason, I take advantage of the opportunity to first thank  Albanian Television, which is showing interest in the  introduction of this program.</p>

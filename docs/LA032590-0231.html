			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RAY HITS DECK TWICE, SUFFERS SORE NECK  </P> <P> Johnny Ray suffered a sore neck and a few moments of lightheadedness Saturday  after being hit on the helmet twice during a simulated game.  </P> <P> The Angels' second baseman was hitting right-handed when a Scott Bailes  curveball sent him diving to the dirt, and was hitting left-handed when a  fastball got away from Bryan Harvey.  </P> <P> Ray's neck snapped back on the second occasion and he needed several minutes to  regain his composure, but walked off the field unaided.  </P> <P> "I kind of figured it was my day to get out of there after the second one," Ray  said. "It wasn't too bad. It's one of those things. Pitchers just lose one  sometimes."  </P> <P> Ray felt fortunate that he lost no more than his breath.  </P> <P> "It's pretty scary when you're looking at a ball coming at your head at  90-something miles per hour and feeling that you can't get out of the way," he  said. "Other than that, it was a piece of cake." HELENE ELLIOTT  </P></p>

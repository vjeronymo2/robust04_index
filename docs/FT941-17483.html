			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Price multiples The bull case for equities rests heavily on the assumption that a historic market p/e of around 22, somewhat higher than that which preceded the 1987 crash, is perfectly acceptable when inflation is low. Since that reduces investors' requirements for return, and since the quality of earnings should improve as inflation comes down, shares should naturally trade on a higher multiple. This argument is lent additional weight by the way in which historic earnings have been depressed by restructuring charges which nowadays have to be carried above the line. Strip these out and the market multiple does not look so high. Nor, given expectations of earnings growth of between 15 and 20 per cent this year, does it look particularly stretched on a prospective basis. On some other measurements too, equities look attractive. Thanks to the fall in interest rates, the yield on cash is only 1.5 times that on shares, whereas it was as high as 3.5 times at the start of the decade. At just under two times, the gilt/equity yield ratio is on the low side by recent historic standards. That suggests equities could not rise much further without a corresponding fall in gilt yields, but the relationship may also have undergone a structural change as inflation has been wrung out of the system.</p>

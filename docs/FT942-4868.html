			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / OECD Unemployment Report: A 60 point strategy for putting people back to work The OECD's jobs study has one unambiguous message: that high unemployment can only be tackled by restoring the capacity of economies and societies to adapt to change. In trying to turn this goal into a practical strategy, the Paris-based organisation has produced around 60 specific recommendations. It has set out to design policies that encourage people to work and keep to a minimum the number of people who will have to rely wholly on the dole. Not all policy ideas apply in equal measure to all countries. Most are addressed to governments, but the OECD says that in many cases action to increase employment lies with employers, trade unions and individual workers. The OECD recognises that most governments are strapped for cash. In calling for appropriate macro-economic policies, it urges them to cut budget deficits and improve the quality of public spending. To promote jobs growth, this means shifting resources from subsidising existing companies to encouraging new start-ups and moving from income support for unemployed to 'active labour market measures' to get them back to work. The specific recommendations on structural policy are given below in slightly condensed form and grouped under eight broad headings used by the OECD: To enhance the creation and diffusion of technological know-how: Invest in the creation of new knowledge through basic scientific research and help companies gain access to such knowledge. Promote and strengthen mechanisms for international co-operation to gain economies of scale and avoid duplication of R&amp;D. Reduce uncertainties that impair the creation and diffusion of new technologies. Measures could include promoting multilateral agreements on intellectual property rights and standards, introducing transparent rules on government support for strategic technologies and ensuring a sound legal framework for spreading know-how. Ease the absorption of new technologies in companies through, for example, making better use of public procurement and removing regulatory barriers to new information infrastructures. To increase working time flexibility: Remove obstacles in labour legislation that impede flexible working time arrangements. Extend part-time work to the public sector. Move from the household to the individual as the base for income tax. Reduce or remove 'non-neutral' fiscal incentives to early retirement of workers. Realign policies to give older workers more opportunities to stay in work. To nurture an entrepreneurial climate: Lower start up costs and simplify compliance rules to boost new company start-ups. Help small businesses to grow by improving information and advice on such matters as business planning, equipment and access to training and R&amp;D. Identify and cut out unwarranted regulatory impediments to small businesses gaining access to credit. To increase wage and labour cost flexibility: Reassess the role of statutory minimum wages as a method of redistributing incomes. If countries decide to keep a legal minimum wage to combat poverty, they should index it to prices rather than average earnings and ensure sufficient differentiation of wage rates by area and region to prevent minimum wages hitting youth employment or jobs in low productivity areas. Reduce non-wage labour costs, especially in Europe, by cutting taxes on labour. Reduce or remove provisions in the structure of tax and social security contributions that discourage hiring or part-time employment. Reduce direct taxes on the low-paid where this would boost demand for workers, while protecting their incomes. Refocus, as a medium-term measure, collective bargaining to cover framework agreements that would leave employers free to respond flexibly to market trends. Introduce 'opening clauses' that would allow collective agreements covering many workers to be renegotiated a lower level. Increase competition in product markets through such means as deregulation and privatisation. To reform employment security provisions: Prevent dismissals on unfair grounds but allow firings if needed on economic grounds. Loosen mandatory restrictions on dismissals in countries (such as Spain) where they hinder new hiring. Allow fixed-term contracts but keep the mandatory protection for such contracts relatively light. To expand and enhance active labour market policies: Improve public employment services by integrating placement and counselling, unemployment benefit payments and management of labour market programmes. Ensure benefit claimants stay in regular contact with employment service and eliminate employment service monopolies. Maintain training for the jobless in economic downturns, but target training programmes in line with labour market needs. Allow the labour market authorities to buy and sell training places for the unemployed and involve employers in design and execution of training programmes. Target job creation measures at groups where unemployment could do great harm, such as long-term unemployed youths. Measures could include special employment subsidies for high unemployment groups. But pay on job-creation programmes should be low and training linked to temporary employment programmes in the public sector. To improve labour force skills: Improve initial education. Measures could include provision of pre-school training for those from disadvantaged backgrounds, measures to reduce early school-leaving, greater involvement of parents in schools and better incentives to motivate teachers. Improve school-to-work transition. Measures could include greater partnership between industry and schools, new forms of apprenticeship, new national skill standards, effective career guidance at school, a better balance between academic and technical and vocational studies and a 'training wage' low enough to encourage companies to offer many training places. Improve incentives for companies and workers to invest in continued learning. Measures could include training credits for adult workers or accountancy changes that would make the value of skills clear to companies and workers. To reform unemployment and related benefit systems. Restrict unemployment insurance benefit entitlements in countries where these last a long time, to the period of intense job search. Reduce the amount of dole where it is high relative to a claimant's previous post-tax income. Restrict benefits of indefinite duration for employable people. Limit support for collective short-time working to companies in temporary difficulty. Adjust benefits to ensure low-paid workers are better off when in work, that spouses of the unemployed have an incentive to take part-time work, and that long-term unemployed only receive benefit if they take part in 'active labour market programmes'. Improve information about claimants available to the employment services. Make employers pay some of the cost of lay offs. Attack benefit fraud. Keep a local financing element in assistance benefits to discourage the view that benefits are costless to the local economy. The OECD Jobs Study.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Gisela Bel Heredia] </F>   [Text] Everything is ready for the Fourth Ibero-American  Summit that will be held in June in Cartagena de Indias,  Colombia, to promote regional integration. Everything is ready  so far as organization is concerned, and only the details need  to be finalized. This was the report given today in Havana by  Vice Foreign Minister Jorge Bolanos and Cuban Ambassador to  Colombia Jesus Martinez.    The Cuban ambassador said different versions of the summit's  main document had already been analyzed, and that the first to  receive copies were the host countries: Mexico, Spain, Brazil,  Colombia, and Argentina. The fifth summit will be held in the  last country. He added that he was here to convey the attention  being paid to the Cuban position and to make recommendations  concerning the contents of the various subjects. He said the  Cuban position has achieved consensus among these five countries.    Moreover, Bolanos referred to the previous three summits,  the  objectives concerning cooperation and integration, and the key  factor for success.    [Begin Bolanos recording] We made an assessment of the three  previous summits because the results are not in keeping with the  aspirations. Cuba has always tried to strengthen the [word  indistinct] and the integration ideas, and we will continue  working in this fourth summit toward those objectives. With this  summit, we hope to break some barriers to adopt positive  actions, not only in the cultural but in the educational areas  as well, and to discuss some problems that might be hampering  integration. [end recording]    He added that this summit will be important so far as  functioning is concerned, and that in addition to speeches by  the chiefs of delegations, which will each be seven minutes in  length, there will be panels to discuss different issues, and  that these panels will be chaired by outstanding figures from  the region. He also highlighted the position Cuba will take to  the summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia.    [Begin Bolanos recording] We are not leading preparations  for  the summit, but we are preparing proposals concerning trade  violations, certain obstacles to integration, and cooperation on  our commercial development with our economy, and investments  that I think are very important.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For long-lived, more ``K-selected'' species of birds (as listed in the proposed rule in &sect;15.32) the Service is proposing to require that the management plan (for species that breed in the country of export) include information on nesting ecology, and reproductive rates or mortality rates. Those species are defined as those not in one of 19 specified families of birds. The Service is proposing more rigorous standards for the sustainable utilization of ``K-selected'' species, based on an awareness that their sustainable utilization is very difficult, and that they are extremely sensitive to population depletion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For species included in one of the 19 families of birds specified in the proposed rule in &sect;15.32 (more ``r-selected'' species), the Service is proposing that, instead of detailed demographic information, the management plan (for species that breed in the country of export) need only include an estimation of recent reproductive success. Reproductive success may be estimated using pre-breeding and post-breeding counts, wherever that is appropriate. For all birds, when the species occurs in the country of export only during the nonbreeding season, the Service proposes to require documentation or a letter from the Convention Scientific Authority that the species does not breed there.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service has proposed, for the purposes of the WBCA, to define sustainable use as ``the use of a species in a manner and at a level such that populations of the species are maintained at optimal levels for the long term and involves a determination of the productive capacity of the species and its ecosystem, in order to ensure that utilization does not exceed those capacities or the ability of the population to reproduce and maintain itself.'' In order to determine that the management plan utilization of the species is sustainable, the Service proposes to require evidence of how levels of sustainable use were determined, including either (1) adequate long-term trends in relative abundance and take levels, or (2) population estimates, reproductive success, and estimation of the number exported from the country during the past 2 years, and the number of birds removed directly from the wild for export, domestic trade, illegal trade, subsistence use, and other purposes. The information should include the estimated number of birds to be removed from the wild from each area or region of take each year for all purposes, including age-class information for ``K-selected'' species, and a description of future plans to monitor the species in each area of take and to determine whether the number of birds taken has been sustainable. Throughout the proposed rule, area or region of take refers to the area or region within the country of export where birds will be removed from the wild; the degree of specificity used will depend on the particular situation in the country of export. If the species is abundant throughout its range, the region of take could be the entire country; a species that is locally abundant but rare elsewhere might have a more restricted area of take.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service is aware that the criteria for approval of sustainable use management plans proposed herein may appear to be rigorous, and although desirable and scientifically valid, they may be difficult for many countries. The Service proposes to give particularly positive consideration to situations wherein very conservative capture and export quotas are implemented prior to being able to obtain all of the biological information necessary for a more large-scale management plan (in effect, a ``preliminary'' approval). Thus, the more tentative the biological information is, the more conservative the capture and export quotas are expected to be; the closer the capture quotas are to the reproductive capacity of the species, the biological information is expected to be more rigorous.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) ``That a scientifically-based management plan has been developed for the species which addresses factors relevant to the conservation of the species, including illegal trade, domestic trade, subsistence use, disease, and habitat loss'' (Section 106, paragraph (c)(2)(C) of the WBCA). The proposed criteria, in fulfilling this statutory requirement, require the following information: estimation of annual mortality or loss, including natural mortality and take for subsistence use, export trade, and domestic trade (in each area or region of take); and the estimated number of birds that will be removed from the wild from each area or region of take each year for all purposes (export trade, domestic trade, illegal trade, and subsistence use), including information on the regulation of these factors within the country. When applicable, information on age-classes removed from the wild should be included. As in the previous paragraph, the Service will give particularly positive consideration to situations wherein very conservative capture and export quotas are implemented prior to being able to obtain all of the biological information necessary for a more large-scale management plan (a sort of ``preliminary'' approval).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) That the management plan is implemented and enforced (Section 106, paragraph (c)(3) of the WBCA). The proposed criteria incorporate this finding in a number of ways, including requiring: (a) Certification from the country of export's Management Authority that the country has the legal means necessary to ensure enforcement of and compliance with the requirements of the management plan and to ensure that the number of birds removed from the wild or exported will be consistent with the management plan; (b) an explanation of infrastructure and law enforcement and monitoring mechanisms that will ensure compliance with methodology in the management plan; and (c) evidence of implementing legislation. The Service expects in this context not just a copy of a country's implementing legislation, but a summary of how that legislation and the management plan is or will be put into practice. Information provided could be varied, but might include how a country's wildlife department is organized, how the wildlife department will monitor implementation and enforcement of the management plan, and evidence of prior enforcement actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

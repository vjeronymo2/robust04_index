PLC made a bid to acquire GPT, an electronics  company it jointly owns with GEC, citing a broken agreement between the two  companies.  </P> <P> GEC, which itself has made a $3-billion bid with West Germany's Siemens AG for  Plessey, said it will fight to keep its share of GPT, reports in The Guardian  and Financial Times said.  </P> <P> In the United States, AT&amp;T spokesman Walter Murphy declined to comment on  the reports.  </P></p>

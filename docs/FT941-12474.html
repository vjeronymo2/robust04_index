			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Where privilege still counts - A tax-saving loan intended to benefit budding entrepreneurs While mortgage interest relief dies a long and lingering death, there is another type of loan which retains its privileged tax status. In line with the government's aim of encouraging budding entrepreneurs, loans taken out to acquire shares in privately-owned companies qualify for full tax relief, with no upper limit. But failure to comply with a plethora of conditions will forfeit this attractive tax-saving opportunity. The most straightforward requirement is that the shares bought with the borrowed funds must be 'ordinary' shares; this rules out preference shares which receive the same fixed-rate dividend, irrespective of how the company performs. All the other conditions relate either to the company in which the shares are being acquired, or the link between that company and the shareholder. The company must be a 'close' company - broadly, one under the control of five or fewer individuals, or of its directors. This often is a potential problem for executives who take part in a management buy-out. Such MBO companies will usually be controlled by institutional investors and, as such, will not be close. Fortunately, the Inland Revenue accepts that if the company is close when the borrower buys his shares, the fact that it becomes 'open' will not jeopardise the interest relief. To exploit this concession, managers engaged in a buy-out should first form their own company. This will satisfy the 'close company' condition before the outside investors take control. Being the first subscribers, however, could make it more difficult for managers to clear the second hurdle, which is that the company must be a 'trading company' when they invest in it. How widely this term should be construed was the point at issue in a High Court case last year. It followed the management buy-out of a business called Microsystems from Plessey, the electrical giant. The management team set up a company called Radstone, intending to use this as its buy-out vehicle. The team took up shares in Radstone - financed by bank borrowings - several months before the purchase of Microsystems was concluded. The Revenue rejected the managers' claim for tax relief on their bank interest and claimed Radstone was not yet a trading company when they subscribed for their shares. Its hair-splitting logic was that the main purpose of a trading company must be carrying on a trade whereas, at the relevant time, Radstone's main purpose was to acquire Microsystems from Plessey. This sophistry was rejected by the judge. He ruled that if a company was established to acquire a trade, it could fairly be said that, even before the trade was acquired, the company's purpose was to carry on that trade. The acquisition of the trade was the means by which that purpose was achieved and not an end in itself. So, the managers won. Assuming the company qualifies as both close and trading, the focus will then shift to the borrower's relationship with it. There are two tests. One is that the borrower - either alone or together with his close relatives and other associates - owns more than 5 per cent of the ordinary shares. Where this threshold is not reached, the Taxes Act 1988 says relief will be available only if, during the period starting when the loan is drawn down and ending when the interest is paid, 'the individual has worked for the greater part of his time in the actual management or conduct of the company.' There has always been uncertainty as to how far up the managerial hierarchy you had to be in order to satisfy the 'management or conduct' test. The Revenue's opinion - set out last November in its Tax Bulletin - is that the individual must have a role 'in the overall running and policy-making of the company as a whole.' In the Revenue's view, it follows from this that 'managerial or technical responsibility for just one particular area' will not suffice. So, it seems that project-based rocket scientists will lose out to head office plodders. Borrowers who can pass these manifold tests will get tax relief, not only if they use the loan to buy shares but also if they lend that money on to a close trading company - provided the money is used exclusively for the purposes of that company's business.

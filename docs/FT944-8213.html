			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Soft landing back in vogue after rate rise - London Soft landing and hard landing were two of the most common phrases during the late 1980s as fund managers pondered the impact on the economy of the series of interest rate rises implemented to cool an overheating UK economy. In the event there was no soft or hard landing, more a crash landing. Now the phrase soft landing is making a comeback as the market tries to assess the likely impact of last week's move by the US Federal Reserve to raise US interest rates by 75 basis points, the sixth time the Fed has lifted its rates since February. US and European markets gave a muted response to the Fed's action but in London both gilt-edged stocks and equities built on a strong start to the week and fairly galloped ahead. As they did so another buzz word, which pops up regularly made a re-appearance. The magic word is decoupling and it was one of positive arguments still being put forward about the UK equity market. The UK is said to be lagging the US in terms of the interest rate cycle and the next moves in UK rates are perceived as upwards as the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the governor of the Bank of England demonstrate their determination to keep an iron grip on inflation. But there is no talk of a hard landing here. Most of last week's news confirmed manageable trends in the economy; underlying inflation still at its lowest level for about 27 years, wage costs under control and no evidence of an upturn in consumer spending. The economy's ability to shock came with news that UK gross domestic product expanded rapidly during the third quarter. Nevertheless, the UK equity market is still transmitting some bullish signals. Turnover, stuck in the doldrums over the past couple of months, has suddenly quickened, helped by a handful of one-off deals such as the Boots buy-back, and the Guinness stake sale. According to Derivative Securities' Technical Review, the reaction of the US bond market to the Fed's action on interest rates 'has shown some independence of spirit. This has to be good for UK equities'. In Behind the Balance Sheet, the latest strategy document on funds flow and debt risk from Credit Lyonnais Laing, the securities house describes UK plc as 'in fine fettle' and highlights record cash inflows, gearing at long-term lows and interest cover at a high level. The broker forecasts trading cash inflows of Dollars 5.5bn and asks the question 'what will UK plc do with the money?' CLL says some will go on share buy-backs, special dividends and still higher levels of capital expenditure and adds: 'The prospect of an acquisition boom remains an obvious use.'</p>

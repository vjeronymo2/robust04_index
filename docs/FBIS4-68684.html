			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Kirshina: "The Elevator Is Plunging. But </F> We Are Still Alive..."]    [Text] The picture of a broken and rapidly falling  elevator as a reflection of Russia's present condition is no  longer a novelty to anyone. When I visualize this picture, the  question that comes to mind for me personally is: Does this mean  that we will inevitably crash (after all, an elevator is not  repaired while it is falling), and only then will we be able to  begin to repair it? But is there a landing pad on which the  elevator can plop down with passengers who can still think after  the dizzying drop?..    A third of the residents of Novosibirsk Oblast are below the  poverty line--this is a statistical fact. Sociologists give  other figures: Only 9-12 percent of the respondents they polled  believe that they are living normally, and the rest, in their  personal opinion, are living in poverty. An interesting fact,  people are starting to bake bread not only in the village but  also in the city, and they are eating it now far more--alas,  they cannot afford many other food products. The residents of  Novosibirsk now consume half as much sugar and fish. But what  can be said about vegetables, fruit, and meat! Do not be upset,  food specialists console us, meat is generally harmful. In 1991,  for example, they issued this recommendation: For an adult, 20.9  kilograms of meat per year is quite enough. One would like very  much to believe them, if a year earlier these very same  specialists had not cited an entirely different figure--they  recommended that we eat 80.3 kilograms of meat in a year. How  cleverly this turns out for us--we can adjust the "scientific"  recommendation to current life. At present, however, there are  no recommendations at all about what and how much we should eat.  Obviously, there is only this advice: Whatever one can get...    It seems that not one bright spot was seen in the stream of  unpalatable information that the participants in the social  policy section passed out in their speeches at the Novosibirsk  scientific-practical conference "Strategy for Stabilization of  the Region's Economy."    But the fact itself, albeit not of a very equal partnership  of the problems being discussed--economic and social--probably  was the bright spot at a conference with a technocratically  dominant idea.    If we do not now make a decisive turn to the individual, and  if, as before, we are fixated on searching for a resolution of  the problem of "pure" economics, then within 25 years the  economic mechanism will chew up the population, rendering it  childless and sick. This is the forecast of Academician Vlail  Kaznacheyev--it is by no means just an image, it is supported by  sound calculations.    Kaznacheyev said that a person also has his own KPD  [efficiency factor]--the realization of his creative potential.  How will society claim from each of us what is embedded by  nature? In Russia, this KPD is 3-5 percent (out of 100 persons,  only three to five do the work they were meant to do). The KPD  of individuals in developed countries is four times higher. Will  we catch up to the West in this indicator some day? For the time  being, we are showing the world another phenomenon--not only a  quantitative but also a qualitative demographic shock that is  unprecedented in world history.    An understanding of the fact that the time has come to  change  priorities and to rank the individual higher than the economy  seems to be taking shape among Novosibirsk Oblast authorities--a  specific social program has been established in the oblast,  responsibility for whose implementation has been entrusted to  the first deputy governor for the economy. At the conference,  incidentally, it was proposed that the deputy governor for  social problems be given the status of first deputy. That is the  way it is in Yaroslavl, for example.. However, for the time  being the Novosibirsk governor...does not have a deputy on  social questions at all--the position is vacant.    "We came to this conference not with fresh innovations,"  Kaznacheyev explained, "they have been in preparation for many  years. About 100 practical proposals were contained in the  recommendations that our section developed. But we think that it  is necessary to make the section itself a permanent operation.  So that we will be heard at more than just conferences."    Novosibirsk Oblast has almost 600,000 families: With  children  (58 percent), and childless, two-parent, and single parent  families (10 percent). It is on the basis of family policy that  various socioeconomic problems can be resolved. But in each  sphere it is difficult to resolve them in isolation. What can  the Novosibirsk social assistance service do when for each  insufficiently provided-for person (there are 482,000 of them in  the oblast), it is able to allocate from its budget only 1,260  rubles [R] each per year, but the subsistence minimum is  R55,250. The government proposes to feed the poor exclusively at  the expense of the local budget. Maybe the law on the  subsistence minimum, the possibility of the adoption of which  was recently discussed in the State Duma, will somehow help set  priorities?    Meanwhile, the law and its normative documents on employment  are far from being completed. But what if the problems of  unemployment, migration, and social policy were all tied  together in a common program of all of the CIS republics. After  all, refugees continue to come to Siberia, but the number of  jobs is being cut here as before...    According to rumors, albeit not officially verified, as one  of the speakers at the conference recounted, a modern  Raskolnikov has appeared in Novosibirsk Oblast. He killed an  elderly woman who, it appears, made loans at high interest rates  to impoverished fellow-villagers. Village pensioners here and  there now live better than those who work in agricultural  joint-stock companies of machine operators and cattlebreeders,  whose monthly earnings fluctuate in the range of R7-12,000  rubles.    Will our elevator have to plunge downward much more? It is  time to repair it.</p>

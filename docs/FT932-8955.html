			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Arts: Open house on the Carre - A Parisian fair with a party atmosphere IT RAINED buckets but thousands turned up and some even bought art. The 140 dealers on the block of seven streets called the Carre Rive Gauche, next to Paris's Musee d'Orsay, threw open their annual spring time open house event last Tuesday evening to charm Parisian and foreign collectors with free champagne and lots of meagre-looking potted plants topped with tricoleur flags. The Carre covers every artistic speciality from Chinese porcelain to Old Master paintings and over recent years the open house events held in May (dealers put on special displays and stay open longer hours) have been as depressed as the art market itself. This year a number of galleries spared themselves the expense of joining in while others complained that too many collectors, frightened by low prices, were unwilling to part with their belongings. But the area, as well as being delightful to visit - it contains some of the most handsome town houses and courtyards in Paris - has an abundance of exceptional objects this year. Dealers report that high quality art is selling and trade in lower priced items is better than it has been for several years. Pierre and Dominique Chevalier of France's leading tapestry dealers, Galerie Chevalier on the Quai Voltaire are displaying a small and beautifully fresh 16th century tapestry of the Virgin of the Rosary, made in the Catholic area around Lucerne. It sold immediately on Tuesday evening. Pierre Chevalier said the market seemed to be shaking itself out of the slump but that collectors pushed hard bargains. Proving his confidence in the Paris market, Frankfurt furniture dealer Thomas Poller has gone into association with the Chevaliers and become the only specialist in a city in Biedermeier. Nearby, medieval art dealers Bresset are showing a very rare 1490 wood sculpture of the Annunciation by Maastricht artist Jan van Steffesweert for around Fr500,000. The Virgin sits in a garden symbolic of maidenhood with a unicorn while the Archangel Gabriel, dressed like a hunter, knocks at the door. In a different vein Lorraine Norre at 6, rue de Beaune has a carved Russian chair of the Talachkine school in the line of the English 'arts and crafts' style, similar to two others in the Musee d'Orsay. Porcelain expert Helene Fournier, at 25 rue des Saints Peres, is showing 18th century earthenware terrines resembling cabbages and melons while Jean-Pierre Gros, just down the street, has three Beauvais tapestries of 1680 in exceptional condition depicting Louis XVl in front of his Royal residences. Next door to the Carre, which continues tomorrow (Sunday) the 50 dealers in contemporary and African art of the Saint-Germain district are also staging an open house event this weekend. Before the market slumped in 1990, high prices were squeezing work by young artists out of galleries and intimidating many visitors from going inside. Nowadays more galleries are investing in lesser known talent at reasonable prices. That change is immediately obvious in Saint Germain, which has chosen an Italian theme this year. Some galleries are still showing surefire classics. The Galerie Krief at 50 rue Mazarine has minutely drawn semi abstract compositions in enamel on aluminium by Roman artist Gianfranco Baruchello. Galerie Di Meo is exhibiting mixed media on cardboard works by Pierre Pizzi Cannella, member of the circle of young Roman painters; and Galerie Protee at 38 rue de Seine is staging the first ever one-man show in France devoted to the Italian artist Bargoni.</p>

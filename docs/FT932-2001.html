			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / International Company News: Clarke Nickolls cuts losses Clarke Nickolls &amp; Coombs, the property investment and trading company, saw its pre-tax losses fall from Pounds 727,000 to Pounds 47,000 in the 1992 year. The figures were helped by an exceptional credit of Pounds 79,000 against a charge of Pounds 948,000 for the fall in property values. The accounts were produced on a going concern basis pending the resolution of talks with Banque Indosuez over loans to an offshoot. A tax credit left a net profit of Pounds 147,000 (Pounds 661,000 losses) but there was a further provision of Pounds 642,000 (Pounds 6.83m) against losses on withdrawal from property development. Earnings per share were 0.71p (losses 3.2p).</p>

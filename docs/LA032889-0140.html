			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> NWA INC. CONFIRMS LEVERAGED BUYOUT BID BY INVESTORS GROUP  </P> <P> NWA Inc., the parent company of Northwest Airlines, said today that an investor  group holding 4% of its stock is exploring the possibility of a leveraged  buyout of the company.  </P> <P> The news sent NWA's stock sharply higher. In morning trading on the New York  Stock Exchange the stock soared $8 to $68.625 a share, a gain of 13.2%.  </P> <P> NWA has been rumored as a takeover target, partly because of its holdings of  prime real estate parcels in Tokyo, the world's most valuable market for land.  </P> <P> NWA did not identify the group, but signaled that it would oppose a buyout,  saying its board has determined the company's interests are best served by  staying independent. In a leveraged buyout a company is taken private in a  transaction financed primarily by debt.  </P></p>

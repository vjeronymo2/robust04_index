			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Markets: A safety net that is full of holes - Serious Money WHO WILL regulate the regulators? The question of responsibility remains open after last week's breast-beating about the failure of any regulator to stop Robert Maxwell from raiding the pension funds of companies under his control. Neither Imro, the investment managers' self-regulating organisation, nor the Securities and Investments Board, the overall supervisory body proved effective against him. Last week Imro criticised itself, the SIB criticised Imro, and the government criticised the SIB. The SIB confirmed that there had been 'inadequacies' in Imro's regulation of the two Maxwell fund management companies. But its proposals for more experienced regulators and improvements to IMRO's admission procedures and practices hardly suggest a strong enough response. Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said the SIB's review of Imro showed there had been grave deficiencies which were of 'serious concern' to the government. However, he showed no inclination to tackle the inadequacies of trust law which allowed Maxwell to siphon off pension funds. Both the government and the SIB have admitted that self-regulation failed. Significantly, SIB's chairman, Andrew Large, announced a review of the way the watchdog oversees the four self-regulatory organisations. But Lamont's description of the Maxwell case as 'wholly exceptional' suggests the government will not be doing much about it. However, there are no any easy solutions. For consumers, the issue of security is paramount but the complexity of the regulatory system, which has developed piecemeal, leaves many unsure as to which organisation is meant to be safeguarding their interests. In its recent report, the Office of Fair Trading said: 'A consumer may suffer under the ill-founded belief that protection applies equally across the various products and services he is considering.' Indeed, the regulations are extremely complex. Although the Financial Services Act in 1986 was a welcome bill of rights for consumers it does not cover all investments. Occupational pension schemes are covered instead by trust law, deposit-based investments fall under the Banking Act of 1987 and the Building Societies Act of 1986. So, if you walk into a bank that still retains an independent financial adviser and are sold a home income plan, your investment will fall under several different regulators. 'As far as investors are concerned, it is not reasonable to expect them to be aware of and understand the distinction between investments covered by the FSA and those which fall outside its remit,' wrote Helena Wiesner, consultant to the OFT report. 'Indeed as a member of the Board of the Investors Compensation Scheme, I find that such a distinction is often not clear to us or to our advisers and extremely expensive legal advice must be taken to establish whether the investment involved does indeed fall within the remit of the scheme.' The complexities of the regulatory system are reflected in the compensation schemes available to consumers should the worst happen. The Investors Compensation Scheme, which started in 1988 covers FSA-type investments (for example, personal pensions) and pays out 100 per cent compensation of the first Pounds 30,000 lost, then 90 per cent of the next Pounds 20,000 to a maximum of Pounds 48,000. The scheme has an overall limit in any one year of Pounds 100m, which sounds reassuringly high - until you hear that more than this was lost through Barlow Clowes alone. Investors holding insurance policies are better off. They are entitled to 90 per cent of the amount guaranteed under the policy with no limit (unless the guaranteed amount is judged as 'excessive') thanks to the Policyholders Protection Act. The Banking Act limits compensation to 75 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000 deposited. The Building Societies Act is a little more generous, guaranteeing 90 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000. But as the Maxwell pensioners now know too well, there is no compensation scheme at all for occupational pensions. The OFT found it 'inequitable' that the extent to which investors are compensated should be dependent on the type of investment involved. In addition, some bodies are less able to compensate victims than others. Claims against members of Fimbra, the self-regulating organisation for investment advisers, have been so great that it has been pushed to the brink of bankruptcy. This situation has precipitated the present merger discussions with Lautro, the self regulatory organisation for life companies, which has been bailing Fimbra out. A merger is in principle a good idea so long as it is structured in a way that benefits consumers. A reduction in the number of SROs would simplify the regulatory system and make it less expensive. The OFT report endorses the recommendations of Sir Kenneth Clucas to set up a single watchdog to regulate investments offered to private investors. A body of this type, streamlining the regulatory system and providing consistency in compensation would certainly be a welcome improvement.</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of Brazil (8): Roller-coaster - The stock market When Sao Paulo brokers attribute a 10 per cent fall on the stock exchange to sadness over the death of Ayrton Senna, Brazil's much-loved racing-car driver, one knows one is dealing with a volatile market. Indeed, investors - who saw real gains of more than 100 per cent last year - have had a rough ride in 1994. Sao Paulo's Bovespa index, after climbing by a real 50 per cent in January, has since nosedived. By the second week of May, gains had been wiped out and the index was down 9 per cent on the 1993 close. Even the chairman of Bovespa, Mr Alvaro Augusto Vidigal, cannot disguise the market's roller-coaster nature. 'We will have a very volatile year. I probably shouldn't say that, but I have to be honest,' he says. An inflation rate edging above 45 per cent a month is the prime culprit, exaggerating sentiment and distorting indexes. 'When you have inflation like this, you lose the focus of the exact value of things,' says Mr Vidigal. In addition, 1994 is an election year, never a particularly stable time in Brazil, and investors - particularly foreigners - are nervous about the prospect of presidential victory for Mr Lus Inacio Lula da Silva, the left-wing front-runner. Conclusion of a Brady-style debt restructuring deal in April was not enough to calm markets, particularly as it came when US interest rates were nosing upwards. Optimism over a plan to crack inflation has been dulled by political wrangling in Congress. None of this had stemmed foreign inflows, which last year reached a record net Dollars 5.5bn, and were at Dollars 1.54bn by the end of March, the latest figures available. Foreign investors in Brazilian equities, entering under recently liberalised legislation, face no withholding tax on capital gains and no minimum repatriation period. There is a 15 per cent tax on dividends. According to Mr Vidigal, capital stays in Brazil for an average five months. Relative to the size of the economy, the stock exchange is still small with a market capitalisation of around Dollars 80bn - it had peaked at Dollars 130bn - about 18 per cent of gross domestic product. Brazilian markets have a daily turnover of more than Dollars 200m, of which 18 per cent represents foreign participation against less than 8 per cent in 1992. Sao Paulo's exchange accounts for 85-90 per cent of trading, with Rio being the second-biggest market. Three-quarters of trading in 541 listed stocks is concentrated in just 10, mainly state-controlled, stocks. Telebras, the state telephone company, accounts for nearly 40 per cent. Mr Julius Haupt Buchenrode, director of investments at Banco Chase Manhattan, expects foreign flows to continue, regardless of the outcome of elections. 'The main reason for inflows is the perception that the country will do what all the other Latin American countries have done already - restructure the economy, reduce inflation and set the preconditions for sustained growth,' he says. Mr Isaac Michaan, managing partner of Brazilian broker Vertice, is also optimistic. He points to price earnings ratios of about 12 times, much lower than most other Latin American exchanges, and to prices at an average book value of 70 per cent. Some well-managed companies are traded at only a quarter of book value, he says. Very cheap shares may provide bargains for investors, but do little to persuade new companies to come to market. 'With very high inflation and cheap prices, there have been very few new issues,' says Mr Vidigal. In any case, few companies are in need of fresh capital. A decade of economic stagnation has left idle industrial capacity of about 30 per cent, according to Mr Buchenrode. Those companies that do want cash have found it more convenient to look abroad; last year there were Dollars 7.6bn in Eurobond issues, against Dollars 4.8bn the year before. The long-term success of Brazil's equity markets depends on the crushing of inflation, according to Mr Vidigal. As well as reducing volatility, the resulting sharp drop in real interest rates would mean billions of dollars currently invested in fixed-income funds would be switched to equities. Further privatisations will also be important. Mr Vidigal says Dollars 7bn has so far been raised and he estimates there is another Dollars 40bn in potential state sell-offs, but he does not expect any 'very exciting progress' until after the elections. Presidential candidate Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso is committed to further privatisations, but Mr da Silva is far more equivocal. Even if Mr Cardoso is elected, Mr Vidigal does not foresee rapid movement on politically sensitive companies such as Telebras. Mr Buchenrode of Chase prefers to look further ahead. 'Short-term predictions are very dangerous,' he says. But, in the long-term, he is bullish. 'We are betting on restructuring. We don't know how long it will take, or when the gains will come.' When it does happen, though, he is confident that those who have weathered the storm will not regret their tenacity.</p>

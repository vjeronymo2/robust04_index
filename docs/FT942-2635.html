			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Coca-Cola returns to S Africa The Coca-Cola company yesterday announced plans to reopen its South African operations, eight years after it disinvested from the country. The group will establish a Southern African division office in Johannesburg later this year and purchase National Beverage Services, the South African company which now provides marketing, technical and other support to local Coca-Cola bottlers. The new office will have responsibility for regional marketing in Namibia, Lesotho, Swaziland and Botswana. The price of the proposed Natbev purchase has not been disclosed and is subject to final approval from the South African Reserve Bank. Coca-Cola products, currently sold through independent bottling franchises in South Africa, make up about 75 per cent of annual domestic carbonated soft drink sales of R3.5bn (Pounds 648m). However, the market has recently become more crowded, and Coca-Cola's announcement comes only a week after arch-rival PepsiCo decided to return to South Africa in a joint venture with black businessmen. Coca-Cola has said it too will try to accelerate black empowerment through affirmative action, a management development programme, encouraging black suppliers and participating in educational schemes.</p>

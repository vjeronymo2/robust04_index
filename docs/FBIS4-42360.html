			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Nusaybin, June 2 (A.A.) -- Patriotic Union of  Kurdistan leader Jalal Talabani entered Turkey, from Syria,  today on the way to northern Iraq.    The Anatolian Agency's correspondent here reports that  Talabani entered Turkey under tight security measures. He left  Nusaybin afterward by helicopter.    During a meeting on Monday [30 May] in southeastern Turkey  arranged by Turkish officials, an agreement was reached between  representatives of northern Iraqi Kurds.    Talabani and representatives of his rival Kurdistan  Democratic Party leader Mas'ud Barzani met and provided secure  passage for Talabani, to northern Iraq.    Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman said on Wednesday  that Turkey attached importance to overcoming the unstable  atmosphere in northern Iraq. [passage omitted]    Ataman said the sides did not want to fight and agreed on a  cease-fire adding that they also agreed for the passage of  Talabani to northern Iraq via Turkey but failed to set a date on  the issue.    Asked if Turkey acted as a mediator between the sides,  Ataman  said Turkey will do its best to stop the meaningless bloodshed.</p>

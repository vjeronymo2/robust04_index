			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1993 (21): Why it makes sense to farm work out - Telecottages explained / The real telecottage is a community-based project, set up to help local businesses with accountancy, planning, publicity and marketing WHEN a farm labourer loses his job, the prospects look grim. But a domestic sideline - a landscaping service, wood-turning, or even making corn dollies  -might just turn into a real income-earner, given help with promotion and administration. A telecottage is an organisation set up to provide just such facilities to local, rural businesses. Anyone can benefit: the technology of word processing, PCs, and photocopiers and so on becomes available on a pay-as-you-use basis. According to the Telecottage Association, launched in April this year, in its simplest form the telecottage is a room filled with computer and communications equipment that can be used by local people, teleworkers, business and community groups. But telecottages vary so widely that a 'typical' example does not exist. Teleworkers themselves tend to use the term very loosely to describe their own home-based workplace, be it bedroom or room above the garage. In fact this is likely to be a one-person office, part of the home, either equipped and paid for by an existing employer, or housing the tools of a freelance trade. It would be more accurate to call this a 'telebode'. The real telecottage is a community-based project, set up to help local businesses with planning, accountancy, marketing and publicity. It can be a village hall, an extension to someone's home, or a converted building made redundant by the recession or the death of a local industry. Among the economic benefits are the reduction of commuting and its environmental impact, and the introduction of well-paid employment to rural areas, where as many as 100,000 agricultural jobs are likely to disappear during the decade, according to the Rural Development Commission's estimates. The decline of rural mining industries adds to the gloomy picture and makes it imperative to introduce locally-based opportunities to the rural population, especially where public transport is limited and expensive. The development of the Telecottage Association took place under the wing of ACRE  -Action With Communities in Rural England, a voluntary organisation funded by the Rural Development Commission. Inspired by the success of similar Scandinavian projects, ACRE has already run a series of seminars on telecottages, addressing day-to-day practical problems including marketing strategies and 'image' - even how to answer the phone. Rhys Taylor of ACRE is the man responsible for getting the most recent teleworking marketing conference featured on the Radio 4 daily soap opera The Archers. 'The way telecottages develop is very flexible,' he says. 'It can start as a community project and turn into a business, or start as a business venture and become a community service. We know examples of traffic both ways.' The Telecottage Association was founded to provide background information on setting up a telecottage. It supports a training scheme for teleworkers and local centres, and helps them get over the first financial hurdle by providing computer and communications equipment on a low-cost rental basis. Besides the Rural Development Commission, which has been supporting telecottages since 1991, the Telecottage Association has an impressive array of sponsors including BT, as part of its Pounds 14m community action programme, and the Calouste Guilbenkian Foundation, which has a particular interest in helping women in isolated rural areas. Apple Computer is providing its latest Macintosh computers, printers and software on a low-cost short-term loan arrangement to participating telecottages. All the Macintosh computers have built-in networking and remote access capabilities so that teleworkers can work as part of a group or independently, regardless of location. One of the telecottages on view - literally, via BT videophones - at the Association's launch was Boon, located in Devon, about 10 miles outside Dorchester. 'We do some work on database preparation and field work on desktop publishing contracts for Dorset Health Commission,' says Boon project co-ordinator Drew Llewellyn. His centre supports 12 regular independent workers whose recent projects includes research on a community health project and creating a directory of local resources. About 60 per cent of the people who go to Boon are total novices in IT and an important function is spreading the message through training and refresher courses on technology. A sister company, Abilities, associated with the Radar rehabilitation charity, specialises in training people with disabilities. Boon approached both local and national sources for set-up funding and collected Pounds 10,000 from the Barclays Communities Enterprise scheme. 'Altogether it's a wonderful opportunity for local people who have not fulfilled their career potential,' says Llewellyn. Alan Denbigh, teleworking consultant and Telecottage Association executive director, gives advice to corporations on setting up flexible working projects, including telework. 'One of our aims is to give the telecottages a higher profile so that they can draw in work from larger companies. The experience that some already have in running such projects can now be shared through the Association.' There are nearly 60 listed telecottages in the UK. Denbigh points to Wren, one of the best funded projects, as an example of what can be achieved in just over a year. 'They secured European funding and links with the local Training and Enterprise Council, and have become something of a model.' Wren has training and meeting room facilities, offers hourly hire of its Macintosh equipment, and runs courses entitled Rural Women Back to Business, which have resulted in regular custom from trainees who subsequently set up their own enterprises. The whole point of a telecottage, says journalist and telecottager Tony Crofts, is that modern skills should bring a high income. 'Telecottages are all about revitalising the rural economy by allowing country dwellers to acquire modern skills and earn at urban rates,' he says. Chris Moller of the Home Office Partnership, consultant to the EC on teleworking, is very precise about telecottage terminology. 'The telecottage is multi-client neighbourhood office, or a business resource centre. Often it is an organisation set up to provide facilities to local business, but that can mean they can provide a passive service, for instance, for such things as bookkeeping. 'Part of our mission in terms of our EC work is to improve the rural infrastructure: to move wealth creation from the city centre down the phone line to the village. We see the telecottage movement as supply-driven. 'Our role is to promote demand, and get large corporations to realise why it makes business sense to farm work out to telecottage enterprises.'</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: US bank reorganisation plan comes into effect 'SON of Drexel' was born yesterday, as a reorganisation plan filed by the bankrupt US investment bank and already approved by the US courts, was scheduled to take effect. Under the plan, a successor organisation to Drexel Burnham Lambert, the once high-flying investment bank which pioneered junk bonds in the 1980s is created. But New Street Capital Corporation, the new company, is a pale shadow of Drexel, which collapsed into bankruptcy two years ago. With assets of Dollars 479m, it is essentially managing the former investment bank's most illiquid investments. It is owned by a liquidating trust, which is winding up Drexel's other assets and distributing them to creditors, under the arrangements set out in the plan. There are still about Dollars 3bn-worth of disputed claims against Drexel, and certain transferable 'certificates of beneficial interest' will be set aside until these are either resolved or cancelled.</p>

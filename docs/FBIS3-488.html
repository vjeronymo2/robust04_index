Local  residents of Atabong West, with Nigerian troops, told the PAN  AFRICAN NEWS AGENCY Tuesday [8 March] that the latest harassment  was on Sunday when the Cameroonians seized six fishing canoe  engines at sea. The engines were valued at 23,000 dollars  (500,000 naira). The occupants, who were left adrift at sea,  were rescued by other Nigerian fishermen, the residents said.  The 1,000 square kilometre oil-rich peninsula is claimed by  Nigeria and Cameroon. Tension in the area heightened after  reported clashes between troops of both countries on 18 and 19  February. Nigeria denied there were any clashes. The residents  claim that Atabong is a village in Nigeria's south-eastern state  of Akwa Ibom. The shanty settlement is inhabited mainly by  fishermen and traders, most of them Effik-speaking Ibos, A  Nigerian ethnic group.    Now, it is on the "frontline", where Nigerian troops on the  western part of the village are only separated by the sea from  the Cameroonian troops on the east. Both sides see each other's  gun boats and monitor detailed movements with binoculars.  According to military sources the proximity at one end of the  frontline is "as close as 1,000 metres separating the opposing  troops."    Edem Akamino, the chief of Atabong, claimed the Cameroonian  gendarmes had collected "illegal levies and taxes, beaten up  fishermen, raped women, maimed and killed Nigerians since the  end of the Nigerian civil war in 1970." The fishermen say they  are now encouraged to fish in the zone because of the presence  of Nigerian troops. "We know it is risky but is our only means  of livelihood," one of them told PANA.    Atabong is one of the string of about 30 shanty villages  comprising mainly thatched houses dotting the disputed peninsula.    Akamino, who said he has lived there since 1960, said he has  always known the place to be Nigerian.    Cameroon, which bases its claim to the island on a 1913  agreement between Germany and Britain, has taken the dispute to  the UN Security Council and informed the International Court of  Justice at The Hague and the OAU.    France has also deployed paratroopers in Cameroon under  their  defense pact.    A summit meeting between the two countries is planned for  Nigeria, while Togolese president Gnassingbe Eyadema has began  diplomatic moves to settle the dispute.</p>

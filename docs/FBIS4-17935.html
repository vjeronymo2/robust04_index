			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Maris Grinblats, leader of the Fatherland </F> and Freedom faction in the Latvian Saeima, by V. Mikhaylov;  place and date not given: "Are the Elders Leaning More to the  Right?" -- first paragraph is STRAZH BALTIKI introduction]    [Text] After Maris Grinblats was elected a deputy to the  Saeima [parliament], his powers as chairman of the Latvian  Congress of Citizens were suspended. However, the leader of the  now parliamentary opposition has not been left without work, of  course. Today, he is not only the leader of the radical  right-wing Fatherland and Freedom faction, but also head of the  "Union of 18 November." This party, as known, is a leading  force on the path toward the unification of Latvia's nationalist  forces. Thus, there is every reason to call this philosopher  from Madona a leader of the entire national radical wing of the  Latvian Republic. Excluding, of course, the Movement for  National Independence of Latvia [LNNK]. By the way, our  interview began with a question about the differences between  the LNNK faction and Fatherland and Freedom. After all, it is  beyond the comprehension of mere mortals.    [Grinblats] There are certain differences. For instance,  there were two different draft laws on citizenship. The LNNK  wanted to begin naturalization before the withdrawal of  occupation troops, whereas we opposed such an approach. True,  by now, after two months of mutual discussions, we have arrived  at a single compromise draft.    [Mikhaylov] How is it so that the positions are similar, but  the numbers of seats in the legislature are so different?    [Grinblats] The LNNK is more familiar to the people, while  our union was created only a year ago, literally on the eve of  legislative elections. Thus, the results of the elections were  not surprising.    [Mikhaylov] You are in opposition to the governing  coalition. Does this mean that all your ideas are being swept  aside by "wayfarers" and "peasants?"    [Grinblats] No, some of our ideas regarding the restoration  of laws adopted in the Latvian Republic in the 1920's and 1930's  are being accepted by Saeima. These are the laws on state  control and a referendum, both of which are being adopted  according to our conception. With regard to laws on land reform  and denationalization of housing, we have managed to make only  certain alterations here. The psychology of the ruling  coalition is as follows: The process has been activated, and no  special changes are needed.    [Mikhaylov] You have your own draft law on foreigners and  stateless people. The draft divides these people into four  groups. What are they?    [Grinblats] In the first place, the question concerns people  who are not allowed residence permits. These are people who  entered Latvia illegally, even from the point of view of Soviet  laws, and are not registered. They include criminal elements  and servicemen from the Russian Army. The second group of  people, who are allowed residence permits for one year, includes  pensioned servicemen and their families. The third group  includes the main bulk of civilians who have the right to reside  in Latvia for five years. In addition, both the second and  third categories can extend residence permits for one year and  five years respectively, if they are not acting in any way  against Latvia's independence. The fourth group, which has the  right of permanent residence, includes all Latvians and  Livonians who do not currently have Latvian citizenship;  foreigners and their families, who came to Latvia before 1940  and have residence permits dating from that time; spouses of  Latvian citizens who live in Latvia for a definite period of  time; and, possibly, former citizens of Latvia and Estonia.    [Mikhaylov] What about the system of quotas?    [Grinblats] We think that such a system is necessary,  regardless of what we might call it. Yet the extent of a quota  should be determined not by the government, but by a legal norm.  Within these quotas, naturalization can be applied only to  Latvians who have yet not been granted Latvian citizenships for  some other reason.    [Mikhaylov] How would you evaluate Latvia's participation in  the "Partnership for Peace" program?    [Grinblats] It is a positive step. The West, as it is  becoming clear by now, does not intend to interfere in our  problems too much. They are not very interested in them.  Latvia, in the end, is not oil-rich Kuwait. Thus, the  "Partnership" is an option that could not be rejected. Though,  I am more hopeful to strengthen the close ties in security  matters with Lithuania and Estonia with the support of such  countries as Denmark and Sweden. These countries are very  concerned with the illegal transit of immigrants through Baltic  states. It is a matter of vital interest for them whether our  "sieve" has holes or not.    [Mikhaylov] One last question: If your version of the law  on citizenship is not adopted and these 70,000 pensioned  servicemen with their families stay in Latvia, what will you do?  Will you accept the situation?    [Grinblats] We will seek another means to achieve our goal.    [Mikhaylov] Thank you for the interview.</p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Balladur acts to curb upheaval Mr Jose Rossi, general secretary of France's Republican party, was yesterday appointed minister for trade and industry in the country's centre-right government, replacing Mr Gerard Longuet who resigned on Friday following growing allegations of corruption. The swift appointment and the decision not to implement a broader cabinet reshuffle, reflect Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's attempt to limit the upheaval in his government with presidential elections little more than six months away. Mr Balladur is seeking to play down the effects of the corruption scandals that have rocked the administration and which have prompted the resignation of two cabinet ministers in the past three months. The appointment of Mr Rossi enables Mr Balladur to maintain the balance between the various parties in the ruling RPR-UDF coalition. The Republican party, which is still headed by Mr Longuet, is the largest element of the UDF. Mr Rossi, 50, is thought to be to the right of the Republican party and is considered a potential supporter of Mr Balladur in his undeclared contest with Gaullist rival Mr Jacques Chirac for the conservative candidacy in next year's presidential election. The new minister will inherit a broad and sensitive brief. In addition to trade and industry, the position also covers postal services and telecommunications. Mr Rossi will be presented with some important projects not completed at the time of Mr Longuet's resignation. These include the search for industrial partners for Groupe Bull, the loss-making computer manufacturer. Mr Longuet was also pushing for reform of the legal status of France Telecom, which would allow the exchange of equity investments with other international telecoms operators.</p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Norway eases S Africa sanctions NORWAY yesterday announced plans partially to lift economic and trade sanctions against South Africa, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. A ban on trade, services and investments, implemented in 1986 and 1987, would be lifted from March 15 but an embargo on sales of oil and weapons would be upheld. Norway's exports to South Africa, comprising mainly iron ore, fish, fish products and mechanical equipment, fell to NKr56.2m (Pounds 5.6m) in 1987, after sanctions were implemented, from NKr348.3m in 1986. Norway said the time had come to introduce new political instruments to promote democracy in South Africa; it had formulated a five-point programme to provide assistance during the transition. Meanwhile the Swedish government said yesterday it hoped to lift sanctions against South Africa within a few weeks, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. Mr Carl Bildt, Swedish prime minister, said: 'It is a matter of weeks', but he stressed removal of sanctions would be conditional on continuing democratic reforms in South Africa. Sweden banned investments in South Africa in 1979 and imposed a ban on trade in 1987.</p>

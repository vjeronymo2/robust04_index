			<p>BFN     [Text] Sergey Stepashin, director of the Federal  Counterintelligence Service and a member of Russia's Security  Council, is on a tour of the Far East. He has arrived in  Vladivostok from Sakhalin, where he held a news conference.  Asked by our correspondent Sergey Padenko about the activities  of special services of adjacent states, Sergey Stepashin said:    [Begin recording] [Stepashin] I will not name any names, but  representatives of the Chinese and North Korean intelligence  services have been very active recently in the Maritime Kray.  They use methods of direct recruitment and especially military  espionage. After all, Vladivostok is a military town. Narcotics  is also involved. Despite the fact that most states surrounding  the territory of the former Soviet Union have become our  partners rather than potential opponents and enemies, their  special services have become more active than before.    [Padenko] Here is his answer to the question about borders:    [Stepashin] You know the position of the Chinese side. China  is very active on the subject and has a viewpoint of its own. I  believe that our Foreign Ministry and those who are empowered to  conduct negotiations on border guard troops must take a much  tougher line. We lost our people on Damanskiy Island. We gave  away about 1,200 islands. Therefore we will be discussing this  at the Security Council.    [Padenko] And here is Sergey Stepashin's answer to the  question about interaction between the Interior Ministry and the  Federal Counterintelligence Service.    [Stepashin] Next week Interior Minister Yerin and I will be  signing an agreement enshrined in a range of judicial documents  on interaction and the demarcation of powers. Several joint  orders will also be signed. Whereas in the past there was  competition, as you know, and sometimes even confrontation  between the two departments, now Minister Yerin and I have  agreed--and we will do it, I can assure you--to put a stop to  this confrontation. Our departments will be collaborating in  the investigation of corruption among the top ranks of state  power. We will also be investigating a range of groups involved  in organized crime where we have our agents and therefore have  the opportunity to work. We will be investigating cases of  international terrorism and international drug trafficking  Jointly with the Interior Ministry. In addition, in the very  near future the president will sign an edict on setting up a  directorate and other appropriate bodies on the territory of  operations in progress. [sentence as heard] We will also have  the opportunity to take direct part in the detention, search  and, if necessary, elimination of those who are breaking the law  and encroaching on human rights and life.

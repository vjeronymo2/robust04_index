			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Netherlands To Discuss Repatriation </F> of Tamils With Sri Lanka"]    [Text] The Netherlands is to discuss with Sri Lanka the  possible repatriation of Tamils residing in the Netherlands.  One and a half weeks ago, the Foreign Ministry asked its  representative in Colombo to start discussions on the subject  with the authorities in Sri Lanka.    This move was a response by the Foreign Ministry to a  request  by Netherlands State Secretary for Justice Kosto. The Justice  Ministry believes the discussions should lead to an agreement in  principle on the return of the Tamils, in the manner of similar  agreements concluded with Sri Lanka by Switzerland and India.    If the Netherlands and Sri Lanka are able to reach such an  agreement, the repatriation will take place under UNHCR [United  Nations High Commissioner for Refugees] supervision. The  Justice Ministry believes that some 20,000 Tamils are living in  the Netherlands. The size of the group which would be liable  for compulsory repatriation is not known.    Civil war is still waging in the north of Sri Lanka where  armed Tamils are fighting for their own state. The Foreign  Ministry considers the south and center of the country to be  "safe." "The internal refugee situation has improved," a  Justice Ministry spokesman reported. The Netherlands has  previously concluded a repatriation agreement with Vietnam.</p>

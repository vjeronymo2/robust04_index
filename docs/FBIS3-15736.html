			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Kuzmin] </F>   [Text] Vienna March 9 TASS -- The international community  should take active steps in order to resolve the crisis in  Nagorno-Karabakh and stop the bloodshed in the region as soon as  possible, said Jan Eliasson, chairman of the Minsk group for  Karabakh settlement of the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).    Speaking at a news conference in Vienna on Tuesday, Eliasson  said that during his trip to the war zone he had met with  Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev and Armenian President Levon  Ter-Petrosyan. Both leaders called for the soonest possible end  to the bloodshed. However, they have different approaches  towards ways of solving the conflict, Eliasson said.    The Swedish diplomat believes the conflict cannot be solved  by military means and called for looking for a political  stage-by-stage settlement which should involve exchange of  prisoners and creating conditions for the return of refugees.  The problem of the disputed enclave's political status remains  the biggest stumbling block. Solving this problem will require  coordination of peace initiatives. Eliasson said he had had  talks with Russian officials to this end.    The Azerbaijani president said earlier today in Beijing  where  he is currently on a visit that the reconsideration of the  status of Nagorno-Karabakh was conditioned on certain terms.  Among them he named "unconditional withdrawal of Armenian armed  units from the occupied territory of Azerbaijan, territorial  integrity and inviolability of borders."    Eliasson said that the CSCE Minsk group sees its role in  sending representatives to the region to monitor ceasefire and  to help find a political solution to the conflict. The proposal  about CSCE observers is welcomed by all sides, including Russia,  the ambassador pointed out.    At the same time he said the CSCE did not yet look deep into  the question of bringing a disengagement force to the region.  "We could also assist in the withdrawal of troops, normalisation  of communications and trade, the return of refugees, and  humanitarian aid matters", he said.    Eliasson said the success of peace settlement will depend on  whether the sides involved in the conflict will manage to  overcome mutual suspiciousness between the conflicting sides,  build confidence in the military, political and humanitarian  areas, including in cooperation with the International Red Cross  Committee, and display "reasonable political will."    The ambassador pointed out that all who can influence the  situation must work together and concertedly. This is why, he  said, "We closely cooperate with Russia as a big mediator in the  region".</p>

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / The Long View: On borrowed time NEXT WEEK's auction of UK government bonds by the Bank of England will be the biggest yet at Pounds 3.5bn, which is Pounds 60 for every man, woman and child in the country. The issue will not even go very far towards covering the extra debt accumulated by the public sector in September alone of Pounds 5.9bn. Yet the bank is well ahead of the game in its borrowing programme this year. Including next Wednesday's tranche of gilts it will have financed nearly Pounds 40bn of the projected Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement for the financial year. It will not hold an auction in November and maybe not in December either. The promised holiday put the gilts market in cheerful mood this week, and yields were touching new lows even ahead of the Bundesbank's unexpected interest rate cuts. At the long end, which has seen few of the new gilt issues, the yield has now tumbled to 7.1 per cent compared with just over 9 per cent in mid-January. Bearing in mind that some City forecasters were warning at the beginning of the year that yields might have to go to 10 per cent to get rid of all the paper it has turned out remarkably easy. But it would be dangerous to become complacent. The experience of most debtors is that the transition from having money thrust upon them and then finding it impossible to obtain at any price is an unpredictable and sudden one. Right now, money is flooding the world's capital markets. Buyers are snapping up Italian bonds, Mexican bonds and, this week, Bangkok Land Eurobonds. In this context the impeccable creditworthiness of Her Britannic Majesty's government is scarcely questioned. Should it be? This week the Institute for Fiscal Studies produced its Green Budget study of the UK's finances, with much of the macroeconomic input provided by Goldman Sachs. The picture is one of violent contrasts. Although the government's debt is lower, in relation to national income, than for 200 years, it has begun rising faster than it has ever done before in peacetime. The size of this year's PSBR, at 8 per cent of GDP, is large but no bigger than was seen in the mid-1970s. On further examination, however, the picture is more disturbing. Rapid rates of inflation in the 1970s and early 1980s meant that the apparently high level of borrowing was something of an illusion, because there was a powerful inflation 'tax' on the real value of the debt in the hands of investors. Moreover a significant part of the debt was incurred in financing investment in physical assets by local authorities and nationalised industries: some of this has in fact been realised over the past ten years through Pounds 50bn of privatisations. It is very different now. With inflation low the debt sticks obstinately around: a government that wants to achieve low inflation must also be ready to run low budget deficits. The problem is that today's new borrowing is almost entirely to finance current spending, so the implications for the shape of the public sector's balance sheet and future revenues are dire. We have a year or two to get it right, but at the moment we are on the road to ruin, comforted only by the sight of Belgium, Italy and Sweden ahead of us. A look at the structural distortions in the British economy makes it very clear why this should be so. In the past few days the statistics have pointed to the familiar trends of buoyant retail spending and a worsening balance of payments. We are drifting in the direction of an unsustainable consumer-led recovery. Personal disposable income has risen sharply as a proportion of GDP during the recession and although the savings rate has risen (at least until very recently) consumers' expenditure has reached 65 per cent of GDP compared with 60 per cent during the recession of the early 1980s. The policy responses ought to be as follows: increases in personal taxes on incomes and expenditure in order to cut consumption; and reductions in company taxes in order to raise investment, which should be made more profitable through a fall in the exchange rate encouraged by lower short-term interest rates. At least the government is no longer trying to destroy industry by fixing the pound at DM2.95, but the low inflation target might have something of the same effect. The budget deficit problem also looms large. Unless the economy continues to expand at a steady rate the PSBR could balloon. But the Green Budget sets out something of a Hobson's Choice here. If economic growth runs at only 1.5 per cent a year the PSBR could rise to 9 per cent of GDP by 1996-97. But if growth is a healthy 3.5 per cent a year the balance of payments deficit will rise to 6 per cent of gdp by the same date. The trouble with running big twin deficits is that if you keep one of them under control the other one comes and hits you from behind. From Kenneth Clarke's point of view at the Treasury the economic judgment is probably that the consequences of slow growth will be worse than those of overheating. Therefore he should stimulate now and be ready to correct later. Unfortunately this does not easily mesh with the political priorities, which dictate that he should be tough now but cut taxes and interest rates in 1995 ahead of a tentative election date in the summer or autumn of 1996. The way of squaring the circle is probably through another series of phased tax increases so that he could seem to be cutting taxes in the election run-up even though the actual pre-programmed burden might still be building up. But as we have seen with VAT on domestic fuel, deferred increases have the political disadvantage in that they give disgruntled groups of protesters all the time in the world to organise their opposition. Dear loyal newspaper readers be warned, it may soon be time to get ready.</p>

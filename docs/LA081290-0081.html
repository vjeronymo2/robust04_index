			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN FLIER  </P> <P> I am working on a biography of the Hon. Mary Petrie Victor Bruce, an  American-English woman who was one of the leading women fliers in the early  '30s.  </P> <P> She died earlier this month after an eventful life.  </P> <P> She had a great deal of fun with life, which means she may also have had a  great amount of sorrow. I need any and all information regarding that life. I  appreciate copies of any stories, letters, documents relating to her. Thank  you.  </P> <P> CHLOE RYAN WINSTON  </P> <P> 3106 W.

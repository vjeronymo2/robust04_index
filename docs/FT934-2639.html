			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / The Monday People Page: Modernising a monopoly - Cedric Brown tells Lucy Kellaway that British Gas is his job and his hobby horse Joanna Lumley, the leggy actress in British Gas commercials, loves being in control. So does Cedric Brown, thecompany's chief executive. Yet control is just what he lacks: the company's future rests squarely in Michael Heseltine's hands. Any day now the trade secretary will decide whether British Gas should continue to exist in its monolithic form, and whether it deserves its monopoly of the domestic gas market. Brown is getting impatient; he wants a quick decision so that he can get back to running the company in earnest. The verdict is certain to force British Gas to become more competitive; Brown will be faced with the monumental task of turning a defensive gas monopoly into a modern, international energy group. He might seem an odd person for the job. Brown, who joined the company at 16, is steeped in the old utility culture and has little experience of the outside world. British Gas has been his life, and he makes no attempt to pretend otherwise. 'I'm not one for chit chat at cocktail parties. But if I can get the conversation on to a subject like British Gas, then I'm OK. It's rather a hobby horse of mine.' The hundreds of people with whom he must have discussed gas at parties over the years will have found him straightforward, modest and a good listener. But this pleasant blue-eyed man is not the sort of person one would expect to find leading the sixth largest company in Britain, as it faces its biggest challenge yet. So how did he get to the top? Some argue Brown was the best of an indifferent bunch. Sir Denis Rooke, the abrasive chairman during the 1970s and 1980s, did not encourage creativity and initiative among his underlings. 'Rooke was an admiral who wouldn't have any captains. When he went there were only sublieutenants left to run the ship,' says one well known energy consultant. Brown's own account of his rise is so modest that if he believes it himself he must occasionally wonder what he is doing in the executive suite at the top of Rivermill House. 'It was a mixture of things . . partly luck, being in the right place at the right time.' He admits to drive and to hard work: he leaves his Buckinghamshire home at 7 am each morning and four nights a week does not get back until after 11 pm. He says his rise all started with the death of his disciplinarian teacher father when he was 16. 'If my father had been alive he might have said I ought to take a degree.' Instead, the young Cedric joined British Gas as a trainee engineer and has never looked back. 'I've had a fantastic time, and I've ended up doing a job like this.' Yet Brown's record so far challenges those who think he is not quite big enough for the job. He has done more in his 16 months as chief executive than Bob Evans, the outgoing chairman, did in his three years of combining both roles. On the eve of taking the job Brown took the unusual step of referring British Gas to the MMC, in a final attempt to end the war of attrition with its regulator Ofgas. To the outside world this marked a strategic shift from the utility's old defensive way of responding to Ofgas' increasingly frequent and damaging attacks. Was it a carefully stage-managed initiative by the new chief executive? This would have been a golden opportunity to blow his own trumpet; he missed it. 'The timing was one of those coincidences,' he says bashfully. Brown denies that his public service background is hindering his efforts to 'create a dynamic entrepreneurial style' at British Gas. He says he has got himself 'mentally and attitudinally over a hurdle'. He now has to do the same for the company's other 70,000 employees. 'I want people to have the confidence to believe that they can make things happen. Forget looking back.' He is bringing in senior people from outside, and appears to be gently tackling the remaining dinosaurs within the company. 'I wouldn't call them dinosaurs,' he says, as ever anxious not to offend. 'It is just that some people in a company like ours may be concerned about change.' In everything he does, Brown is resolutely optimistic. Ask him about the good and the bad aspects of his job and he will list the good things twice. 'I never have nightmares,' he says. He seems to enjoy things that would keep other chief executives awake at night. He even saw something good in telling the company's employees that 20,000 could lose their jobs. 'When we made the announcement we found a lot of anger and concern in the regions. I can understand that. I decided I must get out and talk to them.' So he spent a month on the road holding mass meetings. 'The only thing to do was to tell it straight. The response from talking to people was absolutely fantastic. I enjoyed it.' Despite his popular touch, Brown has not managed to get to the top without making some enemies along the way. 'The goody-two-shoes bit is a front,' says one ex-British Gas manager who is now a senior executive in the oil industry. 'He is extremely ruthless, and always acts in his own self interest. I hardly ever knew him to contribute a new idea.' While many outsiders agree Brown is more of a doer than a thinker, they put such violent attacks on his personality down to professional jealousy. 'With Brown, what you see is what you get,' says one. If nothing else Cedric Brown is a stayer. He has been with the same company all his adult life; he has been with the same woman even longer. 'She is fantastically supportive,' he says, 'and she is very interested in British Gas.' That is just as well. Joan Brown has no career of her own - she although has raised their four children - and has been keen to help him in his. It was she, says Brown, who urged him to take the job as manager of the Morecambe Bay gas project in the 1980s, an assignment that made his career. 'If you don't do it, someone else will,' she had warned presciently. From January, Brown will be taking a smaller role in presenting British Gas to the outside world. Ultra-experienced Richard Giordano, ex-chairman of BOC, is to take over from lacklustre Bob Evans as chairman, giving British Gas a taste of the outside world. Does Brown resent it? Was it a job he wanted for himself? 'British Gas has been too in-bred,' he says. 'We needed someone with a reputation outside. It is all part of British Gas maturing.' In any case, he reflects, if he were chairman it would mean finding another chief executive. 'But I like being chief executive too much myself,' he says.

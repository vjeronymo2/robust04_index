			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / International Company News: Indonesian property company to go public CIPUTRA Development, a leading Indonesian property company, yesterday announced plans to go public next month. The company expect to raise Dollars 120m in a public offering which would value it at about Dollars 500m. Brokers say the company has a 14 per cent share in Jakarta's fast-growing residential property market, and has a 'landbank' in Java of 8.8m sq metres with a value of Rp1,474bn (Dollars 695m). The company was established in 1981 by Mr Ciputra and is currently 98 per cent owned by his family, a shareholding which will be reduced to about 75 per cent after the public offering. Mr Ciputra is also a leading shareholder in the Jaya Group and Metropolitan Group, which account for a further 41 per cent of the Jakarta residential property market. Estate agents estimate an annual demand for 100,000 new houses in Jakarta and 600,000 houses in all of Indonesia. Annual construction in Jakarta currently averages about 50,000 houses. Since 1984, Ciputra Development has been developing a 455 hectare residential site close to Jakarta's international airport. The company is beginning construction of a 500 hectare 'satellite city' at Tangerang, west Jakarta, and a 1,000 hectare residential and golf course development in Surubaya, an industrial city in West Java with a population of 2.6m. The company is also entering the retail property sector, having just completed a 50,000 sq metre shopping mall and a 338-room hotel complex in Jakarta. Brokers say funds raised at flotation will be used to finance current development projects. The company also plans to increase its landbank to 12m sq m by the end of 1996. It forecasts a gross profit of Rp88bn on revenue of Rp242bn this year, rising to a profit of Rp161bn on revenue of Rp503bn in 1994.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Recently, the Agency has become aware of substitute mixtures that are being marketed as replacements for both class I and II chemicals. In situations where these mixtures are a combination of class I and II chemicals, they may serve as transitional chemicals because they offer environmental advantages in that they have a lower combined ODP than use of a class I compound by itself. However, where EPA has identified a non-ozone depleting alternative that reduces overall risk to human health and the environment, mixtures of class I and II substances shall be unacceptable or subject to use limits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There have been a few instances in which mixtures of class I and II chemicals have been marketed as replacements for class II chemicals. Because the ODP of such alternatives is clearly higher than the class II substances, the Agency is prohibiting the use of any class I and class II mixture as a replacement for a class II chemical. Where the Agency is aware of specific mixtures falling into this category, they are listed by individual use sector below. The remainder of this section presents the initial listing decisions for each of the following end use sectors: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> D.

Refrigeration and Air Conditioning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Overview  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The refrigeration and air conditioning sector includes all uses of Class I and Class II substances to transfer heat. Most end-uses in this sector involve mechanically moving heat from a cool region to a warmer one. For example, a car's air conditioner moves heat from the cooled interior to the hot ambient air.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This sector also includes heat transfer end-uses, i.e. those uses of Class I and Class II substances to move heat from a warm region to a cool one. For example, CFC&hyph;114 is currently used to remove excess heat from a very hot uranium enrichment process to cooler ambient air. Hence, the process requires no additional energy, and does not create refrigeration by mechanical means.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mechanical systems generally use a vapor compression cycle. However, several alternative cycles have been used for decades; these and other alternatives are being re-examined in light of the phaseout of commonly used CFC-based refrigerants in 1996. Substitutes reviewed under SNAP may use alternative cycles; review is not restricted solely to applications based on replacing the working fluid in vapor compression equipment. Similarly, simple heat transfer end-uses will also be included.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The refrigeration and air conditioning sector is divided into the following end-uses:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Commercial comfort air conditioning;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Industrial process refrigeration systems;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Industrial process air conditioning; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Ice skating rinks;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Uranium isotope separation processing;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Cold storage warehouses;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Refrigerated transport;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Retail food refrigeration;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Vending machines;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Water coolers;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Commercial ice machines;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Household refrigerators;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Household freezers;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Residential dehumidifiers;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Motor vehicle air conditioning;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Residential air conditioning and heat pumps; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Heat transfer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has not necessarily reviewed substitutes in every end-use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following discussion provides some distinctions among the various end-uses in the refrigeration and air conditioning sector.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Chillers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  CFCs are used in several different types of mechanical commercial comfort air conditioning systems, known as chillers. These chillers cool water, which is then circulated through a building. They can be classified by compressor type, including centrifugal, reciprocating, scroll, screw, and rotary. The selection of a particular compressor type generally depends on the cooling capacity required. Reciprocating and scroll compressors are used in small capacity applications (less than 200 tons), screw compressors are used in medium capacity applications (50 to 400 tons), and centrifugal compressors are used in large capacity applications (greater than 300 tons). The majority of the chillers used in the United States are centrifugal chillers. Chillers have a lifetime of 23 to 40 years. EPA anticipates that over time, existing cooling capacity will be either retrofitted or replaced by systems using non-CFC refrigerants in a vapor compression cycle or by alternative technologies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Industrial process refrigeration systems. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Many industrial applications require cooling of process streams. These applications include systems designed to operate in a wide temperature range. Included within this category are industrial ice machines and ice rinks. The choice of substitute for specific applications depends on ambient and required operating temperatures and pressures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ice skating rinks. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Skating rinks frequently use secondary refrigeration loops. They are used by the general public for recreational purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Industrial process air conditioning. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Ambient temperatures near 200 degrees Fahrenheit and corrosive conditions make this application distinct from commercial and residential air conditioning. Units in this end-use provide comfort cooling for operators and protect process equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Uranium isotope separation processing.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This end-use includes operation of a heat transfer cycle to cool uranium isotope separation processing. Substitutes must meet an extremely rigorous set of criteria to be applicable in this end-use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

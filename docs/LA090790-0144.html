			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WELCH SAYS THIS SEASON IS HIS LAST;  </P> <P> PREP FOOTBALL: CANYON COACH CITES DISSATISFACTION WITH HIS TEACHING WORKLOAD AS  REASON FOR HIS RESIGNATION.  </P> <P> Canyon High football Coach Harry Welch tendered his resignation Thursday  morning, effective at the conclusion of this season, because of conflicts with  the school's administration over his teaching workload.  </P> <P> Welch, 45, said Thursday night that he is stepping down because the Canyon  administration has been unable to add a period to his schedule that would ease  the burden of both coaching and teaching.  </P> <P> Welch said he presented Principal Bill White with his resignation after he  showed up for the first day of classes Thursday and noticed he had not been  given an additional planning period.  </P> <P> Welch said he has been considering retirement for two years.  </P> <P> "I talked to (White) in the summer, and told him that the only way I would be  able to consider staying is if I was given more assigned time for football,"  Welch said. "He felt that wasn't what he could do at this time. I put in a  great deal of time and I care very much about my English class. I just do not  have enough time for both."  </P> <P> White said he is not sure what to make of Welch's resignation.  </P> <P> "My feelings are kind of mixed because I'm not sure if the seriousness is  behind it," White said. "Right now I'm not responding to it as something  serious. It's just a piece of paper."  </P> <P> Canyon opened its season with a 40-0 victory over Honolulu St. Louis in Hawaii,  ending the nation's longest high school winning streak at 55 games.  </P> <P> Welch said he was disturbed when the William S. Hart Union High School District  approved release time for athletic and activity directors.  </P> <P> "I'm at school an hour before them and six hours after they leave every day,"  Welch said. "I haven't had lunch with the faculty in seven years."  </P> <P> White said he cannot meet Welch's demands.  </P> <P> "We give all coaches the same treatment in the (school district)," White said.  "I'm not at liberty to give him any more or any less. He has been treated as  fairly as I can treat him within my jurisdiction. I'm just not mentally  prepared to respond until I get the feeling that it is final."  </P> <P> Welch, who has a 90-17-1 record, says he has no ill feelings and will continue  to teach at Canyon.  </P> <P> "There is no animosity whatsoever," he said "The school district, students and  community have been sensational to me. I truly love them."  </P> <P> Welch said he would meet with White but that he wouldn't likely change his  mind.  </P> <P> "I don't anticipate them offering me that assigned time," Welch said. "He's had  a long time to think about it and he's done what he feels is right."  </P> <P> Canyon, which moved from Southern Section Division II to Division I this  season, won three Southern Section titles in Welch's eight years. Canyon was  39-1 in Golden League play under Welch and is 1-0 this season entering  tonight's game with rival Hart.  </P> <P> Welch said he would recommend nine-year assistant Brian Stiman as his  replacement.  </P> <P> "It's probably time for me to ride into the sunset," Welch said. "I'm concerned  about my vocal cords and spending time with my family and my wife. I just think  it's time. The community and school has treated me like a king for nine years."  </P></p>

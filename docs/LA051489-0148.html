			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITYLINES: COVINA AND DANISH  </P> <P> Thirty years ago, Denmark invaded America's homes and offices with a  distinctive line of modern furniture and furnishings. Indeed, the sleek look in  time became know as "Danish," even though it was soon being produced  everywhere, Covina as well as Copenhagen.  </P> <P> Now Denmark is invading America's playgrounds with an equally distinctive line  of play equipment and structures. Imaginatively styled, brightly colored and  well constructed with an emphasis on safety, the line known as Kompan is  gaining rave reviews.  </P> <P> "It is the hottest playground design line in years," says Gilda Ongkeko, of the  Santa Monica-based school supplies and equipment firm of Three Wishes.  </P></p>

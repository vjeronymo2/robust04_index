			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Land Affairs Minister Tobie Meyer says the  government has not planned drastic action to expropriate or  redistribute land. Speaking at the congress of the South  African Agricultural Union in Port Elizabeth, Mr. Meyer said  access to the farming sector would be broadened with the  allocation of funds and introduction of measures to assist  novice farmers. Farmers, he said, would also be settled on  available state land, but under no circumstances would the  government confiscate or nationalize existing farmers' land.</p>

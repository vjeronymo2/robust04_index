			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. DOE requests from the public, industry, and other Government agencies, their suggestions and recommendations on the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  A.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Uses or applications of products or materials that use any form of depleted uranium.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Such uses or applications could be for the depleted uranium in its current chemical form, for any of its individual components, for either the uranium or fluorine in some other chemical or physical form, or products made from any form or compound of depleted UF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  including alloys, cements, or other materials. Suggested uses and applications should not be limited to those that only DOE or another Government agency might pursue. The Department is interested in all possible uses or applications for the depleted UF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , whether by the public or the private sector. With the suggestions, the Department requires as much of the following information as possible:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. A description of the use or application, including a design description and/or flow sheet; material, fabrication, product, and other specifications; and resulting wastes or effluents;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The potential annual and total usage;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The technical status of the use or application (that is,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether it is standard industrial practice; demonstrated on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bench or small scale, but not on an industrial scale; engineering, materials, or design development needed; etc.);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Facilities, equipment, other materials, and labor required;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Environmental and health and safety approvals required;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Any Government participation or funding required;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Estimated cost, including research, development and demonstration; construction; operations; decontamination; decommissioning; basis for estimates; and assumptions; product value, if any; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Proposed schedule including, research, development and demonstration; and operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Technologies that could facilitate the long-term management of the depleted uranium.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department requires as much of the following information as possible concerning the recommended technology:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The environmental, health and safety, and economic characteristics;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. A description of the technology and any processes or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment, including a design description and/or flow sheet; material, fabrication, product, and other specifications; and resulting wastes or effluents;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The status of the technology and any required research, development or demonstration;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Materials balance information and chemical composition of any wastes produced;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Labor requirements for both construction and operation;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Timing of research, development and demonstration;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction; and operation;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Factors that might limit siting choices;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Facilities, equipment, or materials required; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Estimated cost, including research, development and demonstration; construction; operations; product value, if any; decontamination; decommissioning; basis for estimates; and assumptions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. If any of the information supplied to the Department is proprietary, privileged and confidential commercial or financial information, a trade secret, or otherwise exempt from public disclosure, it should be so designated and the Department will protect this information in accordance with its standard procedures as prescribed in 10 CFR 1004.11 or other applicable law. The title page of the information should be marked with the restriction cited in the regulation. Each page to be so restricted should be marked with the following legend:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the restriction on the title page.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. A DOE Laboratory will prepare a report, based on evaluations by independent experts, on the responses to the request for recommendations. After review of the laboratory report, responses DOE considers reasonable will be included as alternatives for which environmental impacts will be assessed in the EIS. DOE will also initiate a study of the life cycle costs of each EIS alternative. That study will also be considered, along with the final EIS, when DOE selects a strategy from among these alternatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. This Request is solely for the information described above and is not for the purpose of obtaining recommendations and/or proposals for research, development, and demonstration to be funded by the Government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Except as provided in paragraph 4, the written submissions from the public, industry, and other Government agencies will be made available for public review at DOE Public Reading Room located in Room 1E&hyph;190 at 1000 Independence Avenue SW, Washington, DC 20585.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Throughout this process, opportunities for public participation will be provided to discuss technologies submitted. Comments will be requested on the criteria that the technical experts will use to evaluate responses to this Request for Recommendations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9.

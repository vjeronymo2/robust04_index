However, the size of these appropriations has increased  60 percent and stands at 130 million litai (approximately $33  million). This was announced by Prime Minister Adolfas  Slezevicius.    National Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius is sure that,  despite these meager budget appropriations, the country will be  able to establish a defense system that befits our membership of  international security structures.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / OFT to rule soon on perfume trade THE Office of Fair Trading yesterday confirmed that its response to complaints about restrictive distribution arrangements in the perfume industry was 'imminent'. 'It is one of a number of subjects which are going up to Sir Bryan (Carsberg) pretty soon and you may have noticed he arrives at decisions fairly snappily,' the OFT said, referring to its newly-appointed director general. The Superdrug chain, run by the Kingfisher group, lodged a complaint with UK and European Commission competition authorities earlier this year after several leading perfume companies refused to supply the pharmacy chain. The European Commission said the matter did not fall within its remit. If there is sufficient evidence, the OFT may recommend an investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Superdrug said the perfume companies had refused supply agreements because they did not want the retail price of perfumes to be heavily discounted. The perfumers said they would not supply Superdrug because its stores were not suitable for selling high-class perfumes. In spite of the ban Superdrug is selling a wide range of top-name perfumes at discounts of up to 30 per cent at 14 of its 668 stores. Mr Nigel Whittaker, Kingfisher corporate affairs director, said Superdrug was obtaining the perfumes - perfectly legally - from the 'grey market' in Europe and elsewhere.</p>

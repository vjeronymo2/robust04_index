			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / International Bonds: Bank of Greece makes a speedy return with DM1bn launch THE Bank of Greece returned to the international bond market for the second time in just over a week, this time with an ambitious DM1bn issue of five-year Eurobonds. The bonds, which carry a coupon of 7 3/4 per cent, had a recommended re-offer price of 99.85 to yield 7.78 per cent, or 156 points over the series 104 of medium-term German government bonds. Yesterday afternoon, the bonds were being offered at the recommended level. An official at the lead manager, Commerzbank, said the aim of the recommended re-offer price was to encourage the banks involved not to sell the bonds below this level. Demand was concentrated among co-operative and state savings banks in Germany, attracted by the zero-risk weighting of the bonds, which means that they do not have to set aside capital against these assets. However, the Commerzbank official added that it would take some time to place the entire issue. The Eurodollar sector was active as the Caisse Francaise de Developpement (CFD), a government agency previously known as CCCE, raised Dollars 330m through an issue of 12-year Eurobonds. Proceeds of the issue are intended for France's contribution to the International Monetary Fund. The bonds, which have a coupon of 6 1/4 per cent, were priced at 99.77 to yield 30 basis points over the 10-year US Treasury, or 21 basis points over the less liquid 12-year US Treasury, according to the lead manager, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. The yield spread narrowed to 28 basis points over the 10-year Treasury, reflecting broad demand for the paper. The Czech National Bank (CNB) also tapped the Eurodollar sector for its first bond issue following the creation of the new Czech Republic. It raised Dollars 300m worth of three-year notes which will be priced on or before March 10 to yield 272 to 278 basis points over comparable US Treasuries. An official at the lead manager, Nomura, said sales of the bonds were helped by CNB's recent roadshows in financial centres around the world, and that the pricing could well be brought forward as a result. CNB is not rated at present but hopes to achieve an investment grade rating. The European Investment Bank (EIB) raised SFr300m through an issue of six-year Eurobonds. An official at the lead manager, Credit Suisse, said the issue established a new benchmark with its coupon of 4 1/2 per cent. Last week, France Telecom set a coupon of 4 3/4 per cent on its SFr150m issue of five-year Eurobonds. The official acknowledged that the pricing was tight, and said it would take time to place the whole issue. Yesterday afternoon, the bonds were trading at less 1.85 bid, inside fees, to yield 4.46 per cent. The EIB also doubled the size of its CDollars 200m issue of 7 1/4 per cent five-year Eurobonds, originally launched last October. The new tranche was priced at 100.78 to yield 30 basis points over comparable Canadian government bonds. The bonds were not freed to trade by late yesterday. Two Latin American sovereign borrowers are due to tap the international bond market in the coming weeks. Chase Investment Bank has won the mandate to arrange a five-year Dollars 75m Eurobond for Uruguay, and Colombia plans a Dollars 100m Eurobond at the beginning of April, via Bankers Trust. Goldman Sachs has been appointed global co-ordinator for the privatisation of Singapore Telecom, likely to take place in the second half of this year, writes Kieran Cooke from Kuala Lumpur. The privatisation of Singapore's telecommunications utility is likely to value the company between SDollars 10bn (USDollars 6.1bn) and SDollars 15bn. A 25 per cent stake in the company is likely to be offered. A consortium of Singapore's leading banks has been appointed lead manager to handle the domestic portion of the offering. Morgan Grenfell Asia will act as co-manager with the banking consortium.</p>

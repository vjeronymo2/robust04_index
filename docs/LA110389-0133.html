			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE;  </P> <P> COUNCIL BEEFS UP VICIOUS ANIMALS LAW  </P> <P> The City Council has voted unanimously to strengthen an existing law defining  vicious animals and the responsibilities of their owners.  </P> <P> The update to a 1983 ordinance creates an appeal process for the owner of a pet  declared vicious by city animal control officers. Allowing an appeal could  prevent the city from destroying an animal that is wrongly declared vicious,  said Capt. Tom Dailey of the city Fire Department, which oversees animal  control.  </P> <P> The stronger wording also says that an animal owner can be found negligent if  the pet attacks someone while in the owner's control.  </P> <P> If an animal is declared vicious, based on previously reported attacks on other  animals or against people, it must be muzzled when taken out in public, and  must be kept in an enclosure at the owner's home. New wording adopted Wednesday  defines the enclosure as a four-walled area that the animal cannot escape.  WENDY PAULSON  </P></p>

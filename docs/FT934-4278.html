			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Bombardier deal tied to success of Channel tunnel Bombardier, a Canadian supplier of trains for the Channel tunnel, is to receive some Pounds 190m in compensation from Transmanche Link, the main contractor, to cover the cost of design changes it had to make. The boards of the two companies and of Eurotunnel, the operator of the cross-Channel link, yesterday gave their formal approval to a preliminary agreement reached at the end of last month. The agreement has been designed to link payments with the success of the project and to tie Bombardier into the start of services through the tunnel. ESC Wagons, the company set up by Bombardier to build the trains, will receive FFr700m (Pounds 80m) in phased cash payments and up to 25m new Eurotunnel shares. At the closing price of 463p, a rise of 8p, last Friday these shares would be worth Pounds 116m, making a total payment of Pounds 196m. 'This agreement ties the fortunes of Bombardier to the fortunes of Eurotunnel,' Mr Andre Benard and Sir Alastair Morton, chairmen of Eurotunnel, said in a statement. The cash payments will be phased over the period during which the trains are delivered, while Bombardier has agreed not to sell any Eurotunnel shares until all the trains which it is supplying have been commissioned.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of The Channel Tunnel (15): A French city blessed by geography - Lille hopes for an economic rebirth 'We would never have built this on the same scale, if there had been no Channel tunnel,' says Mr Jean-Paul Baietto, general manager of Euralille. The project, which occupies nearly 70 hectares in the centre of Lille, is linked intimately with the Channel Tunnel as the city, in north eastern France, will be the first continental stop for rail passengers from England. Costing FFr5.3bn, it is the biggest construction development on the European continent - apart from the rebuilding of unified Berlin. It will comprise a space-age station for the Eurostar TGV trains, a conference centre, office towers and residential blocks covering some 300,000 square metres. The Tunnel should eventually put Lille within two hours of London, and the subsequent decision to build the northern Europe TGV system means that Lille will eventually be only half an hour from Brussels, two hours from Amsterdam, and two hours ten minutes from Cologne. It is already only one hour from Paris. A spin-off of all these TGV decisions, Euralille was only started in 1991, and since then has been a 'projet a grande vitesse.' Indeed, 'if the tunnel had been on time, we would have been late,' admits Mr Baietto. As it is, the year's delay has meant that Euralille will be ready this month to receive its first Eurostar train, even though regular service will only begin later. By chance Euralille was able to take over 70 empty hectares in the city centre, which had belonged to the French army since the 17th century days, and to be able to draw lessons from other projects - 'we have tried to learn both from the Docklands' lack of transport connections and from La Defense in Paris which is busy with office workers during the day, but dead at night,' says a Euralille executive. Euralille's TGV station is being linked with the local metro, bus and tram systems. It will have two large office blocks, the Credit Lyonnais tower after the bank which is reinforcing its presence in Lille, and the Lilleurope tower. The new conference centre will be called the Lille-Grand Palais. There will also be a mixed leisure and residential centre to keep the area alive outside working hours. 'With the frequency of TGVs - up to 100 a day by 1996 - it should provide a very convenient base for anyone with constant travel around northern Europe, such as lawyers, bankers, logistics specialists,' says Mr Baietto. He has been visited by the mayors of Ashford and Dartford in Kent keen to learn how Lille is capitalising on the TGV. The Tunnel is helping the Lille region to shed its image as a grimy 19th mining and textiles centre. That is how it is seen by Mr Bruno Bonduelle, head of the world's largest vegetable canning business and president of the city's APIM development agency - 'for a long time, Lille seemed a cul-de-sac, with everything centralised on Paris. Now it is re-finding itself as a centre of trade between the north and south of Europe, the role it had in the Middle Ages,' he says. Within a 250 km radius of Lille, 'you have nearly 80m of the richest people on earth,' says Mr Bonduelle. His total includes 20m people in Greater London, 15m in the Paris region, 20m Belgians and Dutch and 20m Germans in the Ruhr. They, rather than the Tunnel alone, are the reason why the Nord-Pas de Calais region has been winning French and foreign investment. Mr Philip Ulyett, head of the Lille British Chamber of Commerce, says there is a great questionmark over how rapidly the Tunnel traffic will develop. But there are still sound commercial reasons why nearly 250 UK companies have set up, or bought into, the region, he says. Mr Michel Maton of the Nord-Pas de Calais development agency makes the same point  - 'a transport axis is an opportunity but not a guarantee of jobs and investment - a necessary but not sufficient condition.' But the region's strategic position, combined with French labour costs (pay plus social charges) that are 15-20 per cent lower than in Germany, Belgium or the Netherlands, have drawn foreign firms in; even lower labour costs in Britain are offset, for some industries, by the fact that nuclear-generated electricity ischeaper in France.' Recent arrivals include the US-Japanese joint venture of Ajinomoto and Nutrasweet at Gravelines; Haagan-Dazs ice cream (now owned by Grand Met of the UK) at Arras; Ingram Micro (a US computer maker) in Lille; Worthington-Armstrong, makers of metal grids at Valenciennes; Pittsburgh Plate Glass near Douai; and Coca-Cola at Dunkerque. A new enticement is a 22 per cent tax break for investments on sites totalling 600 hectares in the Valenciennes, Maubege, Cambrai and Bethune areas. Because of the region's good communications it is now home to 75 per cent of France's mail order business, a trend started by local textile companies but now spread to many sectors. The area also includes Euroteleport, a new satellite-based telecoms operation in Roubaix. Financed partly with European Union money as a step towards liberalising the EU's telecommunications, Euroteleport enables French companies to bypass France Telecom's existing monopoly when communicating with their subsidiaries, firstly inside France and eventually abroad. The nearer a company is to the Tunnel, the more it can benefit. For example, TIM, belonging to the German group of Fritz Meier, exports 30-35 per cent of the tractor cabins it makes at Dunkerque to the UK. 'This works alright,' says Mr Regis Verhaege, TIM's finance director, 'but using the Tunnel will mean we won't be delayed by storms or the dockers' strikes which are more frequent on the French side.' The greatest economic impact will be felt at Calais. At the French end of the Tunnel, Eurotunnel has set aside 100 hectares for its Cite de l'Europe. Some 90,000 square metres - nearly a third of the total development - will be a commercial centre, ready by next March and to be managed by Espace-Expansion which runs the Forum des Halles in Paris. With Carrefour and Tesco supermarkets, shops such as Toys 'R US and a Gaumont cinema complex, 'the idea is that the Cite de l'Europe will draw in tourists who can then go on trips to the Cote d'Opal, from Le Touquet to Dunkerque,' says Mr Georges Saury, Eurotunnel's development director. As for jobs, Eurotunnel already has 1,400 employees on the French side, with another 600 jobs in various forms of subcontract work, and a further 400 jobs for French police, customs and firemen. If the Cite de l'Europe realises Mr Saury's hopes, it will employ some 1,500 people.</p>

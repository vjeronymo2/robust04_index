			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / UK Company News: TLG valued at Pounds 205m by float price of 115p TLG, the holding company for Thorn Lighting Group, is valued at Pounds 204.8m at the flotation price of 115p, announced yesterday. About Pounds 77m will be raised for the company. As with several recent issues, TLG's value is at the lower end of the company's expectations at the time of its pathfinder prospectus two weeks ago. Institutional investors who had been approached about investing in the company suggested that the shares had originally been offered at nearer 125p. Mr Hamish Bryce, executive chairman, said yesterday: 'The pricing is realistic given institutional sentiment and the market conditions.' He added that the target for the amount of new money raised had been reached, the bulk of which would be used to repair the group's balance sheet. Gearing of 93 per cent will drop to 23.6 per cent following the float. The flotation involves the placing and public offer of 78.3m shares, raising a total of Pounds 90m. Of this, Pounds 10m goes to Investcorp, the Bahrain-based investment group, and Thorn EMI, which sold TLG to the management three years ago. Investcorp will still have a 44.8 per cent stake, and Thorn 6.5 per cent. None of the management is selling shares, leaving its interest at 7.3 per cent. Mr Bryce said the company would be pursuing growth through both organic and acquisitive means. 'There are plenty of opportunities in both areas and our cash position means we are well placed,' he said. In particular, east Asia and Germany were two of the areas which were attracting the group's attention. For the five months to the end of August, TLG achieved operating profits of Pounds 6.1m compared with Pounds 2.6m. Sales in the period were Pounds 136.5m against Pounds 131.3m. Although the directors are forsaking any share sales, the senior management team, numbering 16, are to receive a one-off bonus payment of Pounds 750,000. This will be taken as an exceptional charge for the year to next March. Trading in the shares is due to start on November 10. COMMENT Although institutional frostiness to new issues may have led TLG to lower its sights, this may not be a bad thing. With the group likely to turn in full-year pre-tax profits in excess of Pounds 20m, the prospective p/e comes in at 12.5 times. This is well below the likes of Menvier-Swain, which has a decent track record, on a prospective 17.5 times and the electrical and electronic sector's 16.2. TLG must now earn a better rating. A fragmented European lighting market gives plenty of potential for expansion, while the group has an established product range, a committed management and a solid balance sheet, giving it longer-term potential.</p>

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Money Markets: France cuts rates THERE was more rate-cut activity in the money markets yesterday after France belatedly followed up Thursday's half-point cut in the German discount rate with a  1/4 point cut in its own intervention rate, writes Rachel Johnson. As it now stands at 6.75 per cent (compared with a German floor of 6.75 per cent in its discount rate), traders expect there will be room for France to ease further over the summer. A cut in the German repurchase rate would be a useful cue for another French easing, dealers noted. As the French franc weakened against the D-Mark during the day, it is unlikely that another easing will come soon. The Bank of Spain also cut its daily intervention rate by  1/4 point to 11 per cent. Dealings in the London money market combined to suggest that the UK would, for the moment, not participate in the latest round of European-wide interest rate cuts. The Bank of England gave assistance at its established rate of 5 29/32 (just a shade below the base rate), offering Pounds 325m to relieve an estimated sizeable Pounds 1.2bn shortage in an early round. The main factors determining the liquidity shortage were the take-up of Treasury Bills and paper maturing in official hands which would drain Pounds 1.17bn from the system. After two further rounds of assistance of Pounds 331m and Pounds 95m, the shortage had not yet been taken care of by the afternoon, and the Bank was required to supply a further Pounds 420m (taking the day's assistance up to Pounds 1.17bn) in a late round. Money rates remained virtually unchanged during the day, with the three month interbank rate closing at 5 7/8 , after a previous 5 5/16 , for technical rather than fundamental reasons. But with the Government's funding programme going well, and the prospect of tax increases raised by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor, traders are still assuming that some monetary loosening might be forthcoming. German call money rates slipped after the Thursday rate cuts, to 7.65 per cent after 7.82 per cent on Thursday. Outside Europe, there was a report that Canada tried to help a further easing of monetary conditions in April; and gloom about the US economy gathered pace after the release of disappointing non-farm payroll data.</p>

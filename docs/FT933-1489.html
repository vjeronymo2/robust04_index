			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Accountancy Column: The Dollars 30bn question behind US 'litigation crisis' - Lawrence A. Weinbach warns that opportunistic legal claims are threatening the future development of the profession MUCH has been written lately about the 'litigation crisis' affecting the accounting profession. Throughout the world, but particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom, claims against the profession have risen dramatically. A staggering Dollars 30bn in claims currently faces the largest firms in the US alone. In 1992, the six largest US firms spent Dollars 598m - or 11 per cent of their revenues - in direct costs fighting such claims. Insurance recoveries provided an additional Dollars 185m in resolving claims. The transaction costs themselves are so high that 95 per cent of claims are settled out of court. As a result of these costs and settlements, the largest firms have experienced a 300 per cent increase in liability insurance premiums since 1985. Two out of every five smaller firms are going without insurance altogether. Over-exposure to litigation was a big factor in the 1990 bankruptcy of Laventhol &amp; Horwath, then the seventh-largest accounting firm in the US. Many feel that accountants have no one to blame but themselves. When a company collapses shortly after receiving a 'clean' opinion from its auditors, it is frequently alleged that this indicates the auditors failed to do their job properly. Unfortunately, such an assumption mis-states the purpose of an audit, which is a process in which past transactions are sampled to determine whether a company is following generally accepted accounting principles in reporting prior-year results. It is not designed to guard against future poor business decisions by management. In a different era, historical financial information was considered a strong indicator of financial performance; but today that has changed. The rate of change in technology and telecommunications, the increased volume of data, frequent mergers and acquisitions, and the breakdown of barriers have all made the business environment more volatile than ever. Capital is far more liquid than ever before: vast sums of money are instantly transferred, anywhere in the world, with the punch of a button; on the global exchanges, securities are bought and sold at a dizzying rate. Today, if a company has an unexpected disaster, it might incur the costs of clean-up, compensation, litigation, or consumer boycotts - factors that can be extremely difficult to estimate on a financial statement. In short, there are more ways to steer a company on to the rocks, with greater speed, than ever before. Yet the accountants, working in the engine room, receive the blame. Nevertheless, there is merit to the larger criticism that accountants have not fully met the needs of the public. If the traditional audit does not do so, it should be modified; and I have argued over the years that accountants must redefine themselves and become more relevant to properly serve the needs of the marketplace. The attest process, for example, can take greater advantage of technology to emphasise 'real-time' data, as opposed to the quarterly or annual information typical today. Using our knowledge of clients and their industries, we can develop financial profiles, analyses and comparisons of business, and develop ways to detect important changes in performance as they occur. We can also develop forecasts, which - together with financial statements prepared on an historical as well as a current-value basis - can be presented as one package, attested to by the auditor. The ultimate aim for accountants should be to broaden their role in the marketplace: to offer, in accordance with their expertise, whatever professional services are necessary to address marketplace changes, and that are relevant to meeting client, stockholder and other public needs. As the pace of change quickens and competition intensifies, accurate collection and interpretation of information can be the critical difference between a company's success or failure. More than ever, businesses and governments require the services of highly skilled accountants, consultants and other professional services providers. However, the current environment constrains us from offering many of these services, because in broadening their range we also increase our exposure. Even now, our 'deep pockets' make us a prime target for investors and other third parties looking for a scapegoat when a company fails. This is due principally to the legal doctrine of 'joint and several liability,' which holds that a convicted party can be held responsible for as much as 100 per cent of a loss, even if that party is found to have played only a minor role in the company's downfall. The doctrine has created a cottage industry of opportunists who file claims regardless of merit. They use computers to follow volatility in the price of securities, and file 'cookie-cutter' complaints right off their word processors. Many lawyers keep a roster of 'professional plaintiffs' ready and waiting to file a class-action claim at a moment's notice. These 'class representatives' may be friends or relatives of the strike lawyer, or a corporation created for the purpose of buying a few shares of stock in public companies. This has produced a chilling effect on innovation by the accounting profession. Increasingly, firms are shying away from doing audits because of the potential liability. As a result, many small businesses are having a difficult time finding an auditor; yet these are often the kinds of businesses most in need of one, in order to attract capital. Meanwhile, professional services firms are discouraged from offering new services in high demand - such as environmental auditing - because of liability concerns. One survey found that four out of five US Certified Public Accountants have reduced the number of services they offer. Even if they decide to offer such services, they may find they do not have the staff to do so. Young people are increasingly afraid to enter the profession. In the US, the demand for accounting graduates coming out of college increased by 53 per cent between 1981 and 1991, but the supply increased by only 2 per cent, while the proportion of students planning to study in this area dropped by 17 per cent. Meanwhile, at accounting firms some managers are refusing partnership. They must be thinking: 'Why work all one's life just to lose most or all of my personal assets in a judgment against the firm - especially if I was not personally involved in the particular case?' The first step must be to replace joint-and-several liability with proportionate liability; this would hold defendants financially responsible only to the extent they are found legally responsible, in those cases where fraud is not alleged. Another important provision involves fee-shifting: this allows courts to require unsuccessful litigants to pay the winners' legal fees, if the court decides the claim was frivolous. This is a modified form of a practice that has always been followed in the UK and other countries. A third provision would eliminate abuses such as the payment of bounties to representatives of class action suits. Perhaps the most important change would be a shift in society's attitude. I believe that when a party suffers a legitimate injury from an accounting firm or anyone else, compensation is rightly expected. But as a society we must step back from the dangerous tendency to believe that 'someone must pay', even when we suffer as a result of no one's fault or because the fault is our own. When that kind of thinking is allowed to flourish unchecked, we all pay; and the price is always steeper than we realise.

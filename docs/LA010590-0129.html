			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-HERALD STAFFERS FIND JOBS IN TELEVISION;  </P> <P> EMPLOYMENT: JOURNALISTS COPE WITH CHANGES. THEY PROMISE A HARDER NEWS FOCUS.  </P> <P> KTTV Channel 11 and KABC-TV Channel 7 have turned to veterans of the defunct  Los Angeles Herald Examiner to fill key positions in their news departments.  </P> <P> In the two months since the newspaper folded, KTTV has hired Rick Arthur, who  spent the past 4 1/2 years as the paper's sports editor, as managing editor;  assistant city editor Betsy Bates as planning director, and sports writer Bob  Keisser as sports editor. The trio were recommended by Mitchell Fink, the  Herald Examiner's "Page 2" columnist, who had also been delivering a video  version of his column on Channel 11's newscasts.  </P> <P> KABC-TV, meanwhile, brought aboard Linda Breakstone, the Herald Examiner's  chief political writer and columnist, as a "reporting producer" on political  and investigative stories, a position that will lead to on-air reporting.  </P> <P> Channel 11 news director Joe Barnes said that he has turned to print reporters  and editors out of a desire to "see more journalism in television news."  </P> <P> "There are good television news people, but I think good, experienced newspaper  people have a wealth of experience and judgement they can bring into a  television newsroom," Barnes said in an interview. "The people we've hired  bring a good history and knowledge of stories and contacts from this area and  that's real important to us. They also bring more and fresher ideas to  editorial meetings, and the more good ideas we have, the better our coverage  will be."  </P> <P> Arthur has been placed in charge of the station's reporters and of overseeing  the selection and placement of stories. He said he has also been promised a  role in proposed newscasts that Fox would deliver to the seven stations it  owns.  </P> <P> "The differences aren't as big as I had anticipated," Arthur said. "News is  news. The transition is easier for me than it might be for others because of  the uniqueness of the Herald Examiner. We were the closest thing to television  in print. We were big, bold, visual, dramatic and exciting."  </P> <P> Breakstone believes that working in television will be much different than  newspapers, with each medium having its advantages and disadvantages.  </P> <P> "In television, you can do a story better than in print because you are able to  show scenes, pictures and facial reactions. You can capture the story simply by  people's mannerisms," said Breakstone, who had been with the Herald Examiner  since 1978.  </P> <P> "On a newspaper you have more of a chance to investigate a story. Some stories  are really paper trails and take a long time to do. You can check a lot of  things out from sources and on television it's better to have those people on  camera.  </P> <P> "If you break a story on a newspaper, it is on a piece of paper, and you can go  back and look at it. On television, it evaporates into thin air."  </P> <P> At the Herald Examiner, Breakstone broke stories on then-Lt. Gov. Mike Curb  claiming political endorsements he didn't have, Mayor Tom Bradley's finances  and the revelation that Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) was dyeing his remaining  few strands of hair during his unsuccessful bid for the 1984 Democratic  Presidential nomination. Her only television experience before joining Channel  7 had come as a panelist on several public affairs and interview shows.  </P> <P> Keisser, who had been the Herald Examiner's sports television columnist,  admitted that he was "suspicious" of sports reporting on television.  </P> <P> "I thought it was just about showing highlights and doing soft, fluffy  coverage," he said. "Everybody is looking for something that works, and when  they find it, they stick with it. Joe (Barnes) convinced me that he really  wants to do news here, and that's important for me to be here."  </P> <P> Channel 11's hourlong 10 p.m. weeknight newscast has undergone many editorial  and anchor changes over the past two years in a consistently futile effort to  challenge KTLA Channel 5's longtime ratings dominance among the market's four  VHF independent stations. In last November's ratings "sweeps," KTTV's newscast  received a 2.5 Nielsen rating, compared to KTLA's 5.1. (Each rating point  represents 49,315 households.)  </P> <P> More "subtle" alterations are in store, Arthur said.  </P> <P> "We want to speak to the individual Angeleno who's watching us and cover what's  important in his or her city: Who owns L.A. and who runs L.A.," Arthur said.  "We want to speak conversationally, captivatingly and casually to our audience.  We want to give them the news they need to know and also give them  entertainment at the same time."  </P> <P> Keisser, who gave up a job with The National, an all-sports newspaper set to  debut this year, has some ambitious plans for Channel 11's sportscasts.  </P> <P> "I want to do some enterprise reporting, find issues and investigate them,"  Keisser said. "I want to accent news as opposed to just features. I want those  features to be news oriented, visually appealing and interesting to people  outside of sports fans."  </P></p>

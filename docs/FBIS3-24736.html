Successive surveys indicate that the ANC  [African National Congress] will win a two-thirds majority of  the vote without any serious threat from its main rival, the  National Party (NP).    Four opinion surveys conducted in recent months show ANC  support ranging from about 55 percent to more than 70 percent.  More recent surveys suggest that the organisation's support  might even surpass the 70 percent mark. This is significantly  up on the ANC's own estimates, when it said in March last year  that it was assured of 53 percent of the vote.    More recently, the Institute for Multi-party Democracy  (IMPD), in a survey done in association with the Human Sciences  Research Council (HSRC) and MarkData, estimated support for the  ANC/SACP [South African Communist Party] alliance at 70.3  percent. This includes ANC support in the Transkei,  Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei.    Surveys conducted by Markinor in May 1992 also show that  support for the ANC among black voters is unparalleled. The  survey found that only three percent of all potential black  voters rejected the ANC "completely and on principle". During  the same survey, 70 percent of blacks said they would  "definitely vote for it (the ANC) if there were an election".  Almost a year later, the same level of support is being  reflected in surveys such the one conducted by the HSRC for the  IMDP.    A Markinor survey found that when the total number of people  who indicated their preference for the ANC as a first and second  choice were combined, the movement walked away with a 76 percent  majority.    Surveys have consistently shown the National Party (NP) as  having the next highest supporting. Four surveys conducted in  the past year, estimated NP support at anything between 15.5 and  25 percent. Most recent figures put NP support at between 15.5  percent and 16.1 percent.    It remains a largely white-based party, with only five  percent of metropolitan blacks supporting it. While it enjoys  considerable support in percentage terms from among the Indian  and coloured communities, this does not translate into much in  terms of the number of votes, given the relatively small size of  these population groups.    Despite the NP's poor showing among blacks, only six percent  said they "rejected it completely and on principle". Its  overall performance among blacks, however, appeared to be  deteriorating, with support at around 10 percent according to  results of a Markinor poll released in November last year. This  was five percent less than 12 months before. Support among  whites also seemed to be on the slide. The number of voters who  saw the NP as their first choice dropped from 67 percent in May  1992 to only 43 percent a year later.    More unpopular than the NP among black voters is the Inkatha  Freedom Party (IFP). According to the May 1992 Markinor survey,  71 percent of blacks said they rejected the organisation. This  made it even more unpopular among blacks than the Conservative  Party (CP). This lack of popularity has been reflected in almost  every other survey conducted so far.    The results of a Markinor survey released in November last  year showed that only three percent of metropolitan blacks  supported the IFP. The HSRC survey put its support slightly  higher, at 3.3 percent, while one political analyst gave it  between eight and 10 percent support -- its highest ever.    Inkatha has consistently rejected the opinion poll results  and has argued that surveys did not reflect the extent of its  support in Natal, where it claims it enjoys considerable  support. But a Markinor survey in May 1993, conducted among 163  black respondents in Durban, gave the IFP only 15 percent  support, compared to the ANC's 50 percent. Interestingly, the  IFP commands more support among whites in Durban than the ANC.  While none of 100 whites polled supported ANC, 11 said they  supported the IFP.    Support for the PAC [Pan Africanist Congress] among  metropolitan blacks remained static since November 1992. Of all  potential South African voters, the PAC enjoys the support of  only 2.4 percent, according to the HSRC/IMPD survey. Another  recent survey, whose results were published earlier this month,  suggests that the PAC could count on the support of only 1.5  percent.    The Democratic Party (DP) has put up an equally dismal  showing in successive opinion polls. A SUNDAY TIMES/Markinor  survey gave the DP less than three percent support. But the  party has rejected the results and said it would aim to capture  15 percent of votes. Recent surveys suggest it is far from  achieving what clearly seems like an ambitious target.    It is against the background of this ambitious target, and  the ANC's strong showing, that the DP and the NP have committed  themselves to denying the liberation movement a two-thirds  majority. The DP has been at the forefront of the crusade to  block the ANC from winning more than 66.6 percent of the vote,  with the NP boarding the bandwagon recently.    While the ratings of political parties serve as an important  indicator of trends ahead of the elections, popularity ratings  of individual political leaders cannot be ignored. This is  especially important given that ballot papers will be marked  with images of political leaders rather than symbols.    While it is difficult to gauge popularity trends in the case  of ANC president Nelson Mandela, given the fact that few surveys  go back further than 1992, a more comprehensive picture can  easily be assembled of NP leaders. A survey to gauge opinion on  how the state president was running the country found that in  1978 only 22 percent of all blacks believed that the NP leaders  was running the country "very well or fairly well." However,  95 percent of all whites surveyed at the time found that the NP  president was doing a good job of running the country. This  support declined steadily during the next four years, dipping to  78 percent among whites in 1982. Black respondents' opinion of  the president improved during this same period. Whereas only 22  percent of black respondents felt that the head of state was  doing a reasonable job of administering the country's affairs in  1978, the figure increased to 31 percent four years later.    Support for the National Party president took a dip in 1989  following the resignation of P.W. Botha and the ascendancy in  the party leadership of F.W. de Klerk. While De Klerk might  have cost his party some white support because of reformist  noises he made after his election as leader of the party in  1989, he gained a considerable favour among black respondents.    Markinor figures show that De Klerk's approval ratings  soared  among blacks from a low of 22 percent in 1978 to 88 percent in  May 1990 compared to 70 percent among whites. This was the year  in which he unbanned the ANC.    However, by November 1992, the picture had changed markedly  with De Klerk being regarded as doing a good job by only 47  percent of all blacks surveyed compared to 69 percent of whites.  In a matter of 12 months to May last year, the number of  metropolitan blacks who felt that De Klerk was running the  country fairly well dropped from 76 percent to 35 percent. This  almost certainly has a direct bearing on the level of violence,  which since 1990 has claimed thousands of lives in Reef  townships.    Much of his support among whites came from English-speaking  respondents. Markinor figures show that in November 1992, 75  percent of English-speaking whites felt De Klerk was running the  country very well or at least fairly well compared to 64 percent  Afrikaans speaking whites. Marginal improvements in his  approval ratings were recorded in May 1993, with 76 percent of  English- speaking respondents approving of De Klerk compared to  66 percent of Afrikaners.    Mandela, by comparison, was favoured as a leader by 78  percent of metropolitan blacks, while only seven percent of  whites said they would vote for him. In fact, Mandela increased  his support among metropolitical blacks by five percent since  November 1992.    Joe Slovo, chairperson of the SACP, showed the biggest gain,  moving up from 13 to 27 percent among metropolitan blacks. This  will certainly translate into significant voting support for the  ANC, given the fact that Slovo features high up on the ANC's  list of candidates for the National Assembly elections.</p>

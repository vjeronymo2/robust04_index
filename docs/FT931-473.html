			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Technology: Inmos in chip race Inmos, the UK-based semiconductor manufacturer owned by SGS-Thomson, last week staked a claim for a place in the Guinness Book of Records as the maker of the world's fastest single chip computer. Its latest transputer, the T9000, is reckoned to carry out 200m instructions a second (mips), faster than most mainframe computers and almost twice as quick as Intel's Pentium microprocessor, formally launched in Europe last week. The only real competition in pure speed to the T9000, it seems, is Digital Equipment's Alpha chip, also capable of 200 mips, which Guinness already recognises as the world's fastest. According to Inmos, however, transputers differ from other microprocessors in that they have all the elements of a full-scale computer - processor, memory and communications links - on the chip. The T9000 has 3.3m transistors embedded in a silicon block measuring only 10mm by 20mm (the Pentium chip has 3.1m transistors). Inmos is aiming for 10m transistors in its next transputer family. In small quantities, the T9000 will cost Dollars 695 (Pounds 483); the price is expected to fall as sales volumes increase. The transputer is Europe's only home-grown reduced instruction set computing chip; its structure makes it particularly suitable to applications where many processors co-operate. Parsytec of Aachen, for example, is using the chip to build parallel supercomputers small enough to operate on a desk top. Up to 64 processors can be connected together. Superfast chips, however, are no longer a rarity; AT&amp;T, Acorn, Motorola, Sun, IBM and MIPS are all in the race. Supercomputing apart, what uses has the new chip? Transputers have principally been used as embedded processors in high-technology systems and the T9000 is expected to follow that trend. Ferranti-Thomson Sonar Systems of Stockport, for example, is using the T9000 in its active dipping sonar to be built into the Royal Navy's Merlin helicopter, where it is expected to cut processing volumes, power consumption and overall cost.</p>

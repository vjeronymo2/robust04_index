			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Survey of Kenya (3): Moi tests voters' mood - Politics, Stage set for an engrossing general election IN THE space of three weeks late last year, Kenyan politics was transformed. It began with confrontation and ended in accommodation, as President Daniel arap Moi bowed to mounting domestic and external pressure and lifted the ban on opposition parties. The stage is set for an early general election in which an opposition led by a coalition party is pitted against the ruling Kenya African National Union (Kanu), unchallenged at the polls since 1966. Recent resignations, including that of Mr Mwai Kibaki, a senior minister and former vice-president who intends to launch his own party, have seriously weakened Kanu. And if the main opposition party, the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (Ford), an alliance of veteran politicians, businessmen, lawyers and academics, can hold together, Mr Moi faces a formidable threat. However, he does have the advantage of long established party machine, control of state patronage, and an economic record which, while tarnished, is bettered by few African states. Although differences may emerge once the campaign gets off the ground, there so far appears no fundamental policy dispute between the parties. Ford, led by former vice-president Mr Oginga Odinga, 80, has not suggested it would deviate from the government's economic reform programme. However, the government will be vulnerable to charges that mismanagement and official corruption have seriously undermined these reforms. The opposition will contrast its strong human rights stance with Kanu's authoritarian history. The president has displayed an unexpected political agility. Once committed to the one-party system that has kept him in office for 13 years, Mr Moi last year began hinting at change in the offing. But the speed with which he finally moved caught the nascent opposition unprepared. In early December somewhat bemused delegates to a special congress of Kanu, who had spent the day extolling the merits of a one-party state, were effectively instructed by Mr Moi that they had to allow multi-party politics. Yet this remarkable turn-around began with a crackdown that boded ill for Kenya. In mid-November leading supporters of Ford, which at that stage stopped short of calling itself a political party, were arrested shortly before they were scheduled to address a Nairobi rally. The next day riot police used tear-gas to disperse crowds trying to defy the government's ban on the meeting, and Kenya appeared set for confrontation. The timing could not have been worse for the country's economy. A few days later Kenya's aid donors meeting in Paris announced that they would withold their response to the government's request for new aid for six months. Further help, they warned, would depend on progress in political and economic reforms. Adding to the tension were the allegations and revelations surfacing at the official inquiry into the murder in 1990 of Mr Robert Ouko, then Kenya's foreign minister and a leading member of the Luo tribe. Mr John Troon, a British detective who led a Scotland Yard team of investigators called in by the government, named Mr Nicholas Biwott, a cabinet minister seen as Mr Moi's closest ally, as a prime suspect in the murder. The motive, he suggested, was growing concern about information unearthed by Mr Ouko during his internal probe into high-level corruption, which allegedly implicated Mr Biwott and other senior officials. Mr Moi responded by sacking Mr Biwott from the cabinet. A week later, Mr Biwott was arrested after the president ended the 244-day inquiry and ordered police to act 'immediately' on the information that had been made available. Another senior government official arrested at the same time has been charged with murder. Mr Biwott, however, was subsequently released, with police explaining that there were insufficient grounds on which to hold him 'at this stage'. Events have been moving so fast in Kenya that it may be premature to draw any conclusions from this surprising development. But most observers agree, that Mr Moi will pay a price at the ballot box if quicker progress is not made in resolving the Ouko affair. The corruption issue apart, the president has no time to lose in addressing other concerns. Mr Moi has to reshuffle a cabinet and party leadership in which sycophancy has often outweighed competence. But a critical consideration for the president, a member of the minority Kalenjin clan, will be the need for his new team to reflect the ethnic arithmetic of the main four tribal groupings  -the Kikuyu, the biggest single tribe, the Luo, the Luhya and the Kamba. The first stage of the reshuffle has proved controversial. The president dismissed Mr Peter Oloo Aringo, a Luo who was minister of manpower development and national chairman of Kanu. Mr Aringo, who subsequently joined Ford, was seen as a leading member of the reformist wing of Kanu, supporting multi-party politics and critical of the often corrupt and intolerant old guard. His departure suggested that the hardline guard is still in charge. The opposition, relishing the spectacle of sackings and resignations (five ministers quit in December alone), continued to consolidate one of their main assets, a careful ethnic spread. This consideration is uppermost in the selection of the opposition's presidential candidate. Mr Odinga could prove to be a shrewd choice - assuming his current leadership status is confirmed at the party's forthcoming inaugural congress. Although a Luo, he has a national appeal, while the combination of his advancing years and the likelihood that there will be a strong cabinet - should Ford win - drawn from across tribal lines will reassure Kenyans anxious not to repeat their experiences of all-powerful presidencies with a strong ethnic bias. Under the Ford umbrella are prominent figures from the Luhya community, such as Mr Martin Shikuku, who led a short-lived breakaway movement before returning to the Ford fold, and Mr Masinde Muliro, both veterans of the independence struggle. Kikuyu representation includes by Mr Kenneth Matiba, a leading businessman, Mr Charles Rubia and Mr Manyua Waiyaki, ex-ministers, and a younger generation of politicians such as lawyers Mr Paul Muite, and Mr Gitobu Imanyara, from the closely associated Meru tribe. It is a powerful combination, but one with undercurrents of personal and tribal rivalries that Mr Moi can be expected to exploit as he wages the battle for his political life.</p>

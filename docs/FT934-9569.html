			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Arts: Today's Television If your father had been a Nazi war criminal would you agree to go to Israel to discuss the subject with the children of holocaust survivors? Some did and Timewatch was there to record the confrontation (BBC2, 8.00). ITV also offers a heavyweight subject in its two-hour drama documentary Fighting For Gemma (8.00). Gemma D'Arcy, whose father worked at the nuclear plant in Sellafield, developed leukaemia, and solicitor Martyn Day became convinced there was a causal link between the plant and a high incidence of blood cancer. Provided the other parts of The Buddha Of Suburbia are as funny and telling as the opening episode, BBC2 will have brought us something far better than 'My Beautiful Laundrette' , also written by Hanif Kureishi. This tells you more about the experience of being regarded as an alien, though born in Bromley, than half a dozen 'race' series (9.25). Political history will surely never be the same again after Thatcher: The Downing Street Years, which ends this evening with Lady T. giving her version of her departure from office (BBC1, 9.30).</p>

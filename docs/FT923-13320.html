			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Blue Arrow trial unfair court told THE FOUR City advisers convicted of fraud over the Blue Arrow scandal were denied a fair trial because of the length and complex nature of the legal proceedings and the judge's late decision to cut down the case against them, the Court of Appeal was told yesterday. Mr Jonathan Cohen, a former County NatWest chief executive, Mr David Reed, a former head of corporate finance at County and Mr Nicholas Wells, a former County director, were all given 18-month suspended sentences at the end of the trial which lasted a year and four days. Mr Martin Gibbs, a former head of corporate finance at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, received a one-year suspended sentence. All four men were convicted of conspiring to mislead the markets over the result of the 1987 Blue Arrow rights issue by secretly buying shares themselves to raise the take-up level announced to other investors. All except Mr Wells were in court yesterday to hear Mr Anthony Hooper QC open the appeals against their convictions. 'The weight, length and complexity was such that a fair trial was not possible,' he told the three appeal court judges, Lord Justice Mann, Mr Justice Buckley and Mr Justice Ognall. The decision of the trial judge, Mr Justice McKinnon, to dramatically reduce the size of the case against the four men after all the evidence had been heard, and both prosecution and defence closing speeches made, was a 'material irregularity' in the proceedings, he continued. During pre-trial hearings, defence lawyers had continually argued that the prosecution's case was too large and would result in an unmanageable trial. However, the prosecution had insisted that the case could not be cut back and that the trial would last only between four and six months, Mr Hooper, for Mr Reed, said. Half-way through the trial the judge had said the prosecution had lost sight of the limits of the jury system but that its case could not then be cut back further. Later, in his summing-up he restricted the case to just the 'late take-up' issue, telling the jury to ignore 75 per cent of the evidence. The evidence that remained had mostly been given at the start of the year-long trial, Mr Hooper said. Mr Vivian Robinson QC, for Mr Wells, said that in not cutting back the size of the trial before it began, the judge had made a fundamental error from which all other mischiefs followed. It would be naive not to think the jury would be influenced by the months of evidence they had heard but were later told to disregard, Mr Robinson said. The appeal is expected to last between one and two weeks.</p>

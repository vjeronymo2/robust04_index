This opinion is based on NATO's old stand that only a  political solution is possible in the former Yugoslav Republic  of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as it was again stressed at the two-day  summit.    This is precisely why NATO is using threats and pressure to  stimulate the three warring sides in Bosnia to lay down arms and  find political solutions to their conflicts.    The harsh threats made by NATO officials prior to the  Brussels summit were calculated to step up pressure in  expectation of a new round of peace talks on Bosnia, due to open  in Geneva on January 18, and before the talks between Croatian  President Franjo Tudjman and Bosnian Moslem leader Alija  Izetbegovic in Bonn last Sunday and Monday, the sources said.    The strongest threats were again addressed to the Bosnian  Serb side while the Croats were threatened with sanctions and  the Moslems with a withdrawal of the United Nations peacekeepers  from Bosnia.    The Brussels summit has shown that the Bosnian conflict is  indeed giving NATO a headache but that it is by no means its  main preoccupation.    No doubt, the organization finds the questions of Russia,  NATO's survival and other issues relating to its operation more  vital than the problem of Bosnia.</p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Russian debt Just as night follows day, so does the growth of Russian inter-enterprise debt follow a credit squeeze. Such soaring indebtedness has happened before, notably in 1992; it is the predictable result of attempts at stabilisation; if the government gives in to the blackmail from enterprise managers, the problem will recur. At its recently estimated level of Rbs90,000bn (Pounds 27bn), the debt enterprises have accumulated with one another is spectacular. It is not surprising that the government's resolve is crumbling, notwithstanding its agreement with the IMF last March. President Boris Yeltsin has, for example, already agreed to grant Rbs3,500bn in low-interest credits to the defence sector and heavy industry. More may follow. Regardless of privatisation, managers have not yet made the mental switch from supplying state-directed production, to satisfying paying customers. This, moreover, is the more benign aspect of the story. Enterprises without owners, operating in a society without effective laws, allow managers to privatise the gains and socialise the losses. Why not offer goods on credit, in return for bribes, leaving the company with the debt and themselves with the money? Or why not sell goods abroad, put the proceeds in a Swiss bank account, leaving suppliers unpaid? Managers confidently expect that the government will have to drop the needed cash from helicopters. Yet their enterprises, as large holders of cash, are themselves victims of inflation. Worse, the government will only have to repeat the battle, in still more disadvantageous circumstances. Targeted allocation of credits to high-priority industry is not the answer, since nobody knows which the high-priority industries actually are. Even closing insolvent enterprises may be a big mistake, since in so distorted an economy, it is difficult to know which enterprises should be closed. Nor can a mechanism for netting out inter-enterprise debt play a useful role at least until its growth has been halted. It can be halted, however, by forcing enterprise managers to manage their cash flows, as has been done in other economies in transition. The debt overhang should be left to one side, at least for the moment. Meanwhile, by refusing a bail-out, the government will create huge pressure for payment within the enterprise sector. There is money. Enterprises must simply be forced to use it. Mass unemployment is the spectre that stops this from being tried. The government needs to lay this ghost, by telling people that producing goods that are not wanted or, if wanted, are not paid for is unemployment. In addition, any money must go directly to workers, either as unemployment benefit or as payment for short-time working. It must not just be dumped on the enterprises. This crisis has arisen partly because the stabilisation lacks credibility where it counts and partly because enterprises are in limbo, subject neither to the control of the state nor to that of owners. State control cannot be restored, while ownership will take time to establish. In the meantime, enterprises must be compelled to look after their cash flows. The printing press is not the answer.</p>

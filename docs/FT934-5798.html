			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Genetic engineering red tape removed The German parliament yesterday approved a measure that removes some of the most cumbersome bureaucratic and environmental obstacles to genetic engineering research. The measure, which updates the three-year-old law regulating progress in gene technology, is intended to boost the competitiveness of German chemical industries, which have complained about unfair research conditions. It will remove some of the long and costly approval procedures which had driven many chemical enterprises to focus most of their research in laboratories abroad, in particular in the US and Japan. The move is part of the government's efforts to remove red tape and dilute some of the strictest environmental legislation in Europe, often denounced as hindering the competitiveness of German industry. 'This is also particularly important for research conducted in universities and for smaller enterprises,' Ms Christina Sehnert of Bayer, the chemical group, said. The amendment was approved after various versions were rejected by the opposition Social Democrats, who argue that research manipulating genes should be closely monitored by the authorities. While approval procedures will still be required, the amendment greatly reduces the time involved. It introduces simpler registration procedures for research classified under the law as safe for the natural and human environment.</p>

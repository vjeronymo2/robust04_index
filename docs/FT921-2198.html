			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / UK Company News: S&amp;N static at Pounds 132m in spite of underlying sales upturn SMITH &amp; NEPHEW, the international healthcare and consumer products group, yesterday reported virtually static profits of Pounds 132.4m pre-tax for 1991 in spite of a 9 per cent rise in underlying sales. The group saw particularly strong growth in its trauma and arthroscopy division and in orthopaedic implants, which grew by 31 and 29 per cent respectively. Mr John Robinson, chief executive, said Smith &amp; Nephew had continued to build its position as a world-wide healthcare group which commanded about 15 per cent of a world market worth approximately Pounds 4bn. Earnings per share slipped from 9.2p to 9p but the company is paying a final dividend of 2.69p, bringing the total for the year to 4.44p, up 2 per cent. Turnover grew 8 per cent to Pounds 792m. The result was achieved despite recession in the UK consumer market, a hit from currency translation that cost Pounds 8m and a sharp turn down in the US optical lens business, which cost another Pounds 7m. Mr Robinson said that in the long run Smith &amp; Nephew would be unaffected should a Labour government be returned as its products tended to help save money by shortening a patient's stay in hospital. The company could enjoy a short term boost after a Labour victory, he said. Gearing during the year fell from 31 per cent to 23 per cent but the tax rate rose to 27 per cent and is likely to be 29 per cent this year. COMMENT S&amp;N is in some exciting growth markets, particularly arthroscopy and non-invasive orthopaedic implants. But until now one could not avoid wondering why the company had done so little with them; after all, earnings per share since 1988 has grown by only 4 per cent. This may be about to change and boost S&amp;N's market rating. Despite recession, underlying sales grew by 9 per cent last year, management appears to be sorting out the less successful acquisitions made during the 1980s drive for international coverage and this year it should avoid the adverse effects of currency. Pre-tax profits are likely to rise to at least Pounds 146m, or earnings of 9.9p, giving a prospective multiple of under 15.</p>

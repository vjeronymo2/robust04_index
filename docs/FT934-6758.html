			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: CPFP takes CDollars 135m charge Canadian Pacific Forest Products is taking a CDollars 135m (USDollars 101m) special charge to write off its investment in the loss-making Gold River newsprint mill on Vancouver Island British Columbia. Negotiations to restructure the mill's debt have begun. Gold River cost about CDollars 250m and during three years of operation has been hit by low pulp and newsprint prices. The West Coast price of newsprint is USDollars 420 a tonne, a record low after inflation. CPFP, now independent of Canadian Pacific, owned 65 per cent of the limited partnership set up to build and own Gold River's pulping unit, a 230,000 tonnes a year newsprint operation. CPFP, as general partner, has pumped in operating funds since Gold River's start up by buying partnership notes, and its interest has now risen to 85.5 per cent. The minority is held by a publishing group. CPFP says it will continue its support until March 31, 1994. The partnership has halted interest and principal payments on CDollars 226m of long-term debt and begun debt restructuring talks with the banks with a March 31 deadline. CPFP says Gold River can be profitable with debt restructuring and a new operating plan. Productivity is improving and the newsprint market is showing signs of life, officials said. Last August, Canadian Pacific sold its 60.7 per cent interest in CPFP, saying newsprint had become too cyclical. Analysts estimated the Gold River write-off will bring CPFP's 1993 loss to more than CDollars 330m, against a loss of CDollars 248m in 1992.</p>

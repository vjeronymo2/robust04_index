"I am paying too high a price for my  firm commitment to the peace process," he asserted.    The shooting of around 50 Palestinians by a Jewish settler  in  Hebron on 25 February was like a hammer blow for the veteran  leader, weary of bloodshed and tired of seeking a peace which  persistently evades him. Caught between Israeli intransigence  and the growing opposition to his conduct in his own ranks,  'Arafat has gone on the defensive and has ceased to exude that  tremendous confidence which used to be sensed around him and  which made him more a hero than a leader of the PLO. The legend  is beginning to show his feet of clay, and to some extent he is  aware of this. Yet perhaps at the same time he increases his  human stature in this way. This eventful interview has suffered  the consequences of the instability surrounding the Palestinian  leader. When I asked him about the division in the PLO,  reflected by the fact that when he convened the Executive  Committee, only eight of its 18 members attended, 'Arafat went  wild and tried to call off the interview. Fortunately, it was  resumed later.    When I asked him about the disagreements within the PLO, the  64-year old Yasir 'Arafat went wild and demanded that I tell him  who had given me that information, which, however, he did not  deny. He said that this was not an interview but an  investigation, called off the appointment, and asked his  bodyguard to remove the tape from my recorder. Marwan Kanafani,  the man in charge of his appointments, and another adviser who  was present, were as astounded as I. When I was outside the  room, they asked me to return today, but I told them that it was  better for them to try to calm him down and for us to continue  the interview. Half an hour later, 'Arafat received me again,  but when he learned that Marwan had asked the bodyguard to  return the tape to me, he ordered him to take it away from me  again. Later, when we said goodbye, I recovered it, but erased.  Hence the first part of the interview is a reconstruction.    [Higueras] Have the talks with Israel been broken off or  postponed?    ['Arafat] We are awaiting the UN Security Council  resolution.    [Higueras] But do you believe right now that the dialogue  has been broken off?    ['Arafat] We must wait and see.    [Higueras] Will this time be used to secure greater  consensus on the peace process?    ['Arafat] The peace process has lost all its credibility,  and this is a result not only of the Hebron massacre but also of  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's tricks. He promised me  when we signed the Cairo accord (12 December last) that we would  meet within 10 days in order to set under way the process of  Israel's military withdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank.  Eighty days have elapsed, and I am still waiting, but now  nobody -- neither Palestinians, nor Israelis, nor Americans, nor  Europeans -- believes in the peace process. Moreover, the Army  is ultimately responsible for the massacre.    [Higueras] Do you hold Rabin responsible as Army chief?    ['Arafat] No, certain units.    [Higueras] 'Abbas Zaki, a member of the Standing Committee  of Fatah -- the PLO faction which you head -- stated in Amman  Monday that the truce in armed actions against Israel has been  broken. Is this true?    ['Arafat] He is speaking for himself.    [Higueras] Do you mean that the cease-fire to which you  committed yourself, although you did not officially declare it  after the Washington accord, will continue to be observed?    ['Arafat] I am saying that this is not Fatah. This is a  democracy. Everybody can say what he wishes, but they have  nobody behind them.    [Higueras] You convened the PLO Executive Committee Sunday,  but only eight out of the 18 members attended.    ['Arafat] Where did you get that information? Who told you  that? What do you know of the PLO? Tell me who told you that.  You are conducting an investigation -- not an interview. We  have finished. ['Arafat ends]    When I came in again, I tried the interview from another  approach. 'Arafat was calm but even more distant than he seemed  to me at the outset. The questions did not matter to him. As  in a refrain, he blamed Rabin again and again for blocking the  peace process, and stressed that he had been waiting for him for  80 days.    [Higueras] The Arab-Israeli talks began in Madrid and, among  other places, continued in Granada. Will the final agreement be  signed in Toledo?    ['Arafat] What must be clear to everybody is that we are  working for peace -- not just in Madrid. Before and afterward,  we have also accepted various peace initiatives, although the  Israelis were putting us in a very bad position and offering us  nothing. Rabin promised to return in 10 days -- and not only to  me but also to Egyptian President Husni Mubarak -- and he did  not do so. We have been very flexible, but what was the price?  This horrible massacre.    [Higueras] But if an agreement is finally reached, do you,  as Rabin says, want it to be signed in Toledo?    ['Arafat] The Israelis say one thing and do another. Six  months have elapsed since the Washington accord (13 September  1993), and none of what was agreed has been put into practice.  They are not serious about building peace. What they have  offered following the Hebron massacre is nothing; much less than  what is required. When Rabin telephoned me to offer me his  condolences, I explained to him that the Army is involved,  because entering the mosque with weapons is not allowed, and  Israeli troops are the one who guard the mosque.    [Higueras] Do you believe that there are many Baruch  Goldsteins in Israel?    ['Arafat] It is not only I who say so; even some members of  Rabin's government do. We all know that some of those fanatics  are real time bombs.    [Higueras] Do you believe that the Israeli Government is  strong enough to disarm the settlers?    ['Arafat] The decision is theirs -- not mine. If they have  an opposition, so do we, but we are ready to implement what we  have signed and they must do so too, especially now when the  majority of the Israelis are opposed to what has happened. Now  they have a very good opportunity to adopt strong and specific  measures in order to prevent such a thing from happening again.    [Higueras] Who do you believe is in the more difficult  position -- Rabin or yourself?    ['Arafat] I am.    [Higueras] Why?    ['Arafat] It is clear and simple; because I am struggling  for peace, and so far peace has not been achieved. Rabin is  maneuvering, not working for peace, and that is why it is I who  am paying the price of peace. I am paying too high a price.  The latest is that of the massacre. Nobody can imagine what is  happening, and it is we who are paying.    [Higueras] Since the massacre, the Palestinians have  increased their criticisms of you for committing yourself to  this peace process.    ['Arafat] And they are right. None of what was agreed has  been put into practice, but it is the Israelis' fault. The  peace process has lost its credibility worldwide.    [Higueras] Do you feel isolated?    ['Arafat] This is not the first bad situation that I have  had to face. Before Hebron, there were many other massacres,  such as the Jerusalem mosque massacre and the Sabra and Shatila  massacre. There have been other massacres, and all of them  committed by Israel.    [Higueras] But do you feel isolated?    ['Arafat] I have already answered you.    [Higueras] You are demanding international protection for  the Palestinians. Would it be enough for the Security Council  to vote in favor of sending unarmed blue helmets to Gaza and  Jericho?    ['Arafat] Unarmed civilian observers will not resolve the  problem. How will they protect themselves? Who will protect  them? We already have UN observers. What we want is something  to protect our people.    [Higueras] When do you believe you will set foot in Jericho?    ['Arafat] After what has happened, there is no answer.    [Higueras] Are you pessimistic or optimistic?    ['Arafat] I am realistic. I work with facts and realities.  ['Arafat ends]    The interview had ended, and with the tape recorder off,  'Arafat asked me again about the open secret of who attended  Sunday's and Monday's meeting. He stated that the Executive  Committee no longer has 18 members, because five have resigned,  but he did not explain that, since their number has not been  formally changed, the quorum is still nine. Nor did he mention  that four of those who did not attend the meeting live in Tunis.  He stated that he convened not the Executive Committee but the  PLO leadership, comprising the members of that committee and  another 10 leaders of the occupied territories, and perhaps it  was in his frenzy to make me understand the facts that he let it  slip that "over 13 were sitting at this very table."</p>

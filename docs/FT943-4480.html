			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / International Company News: Fall in prices undermines Japanese steel producers Japan's five main steelmakers have revised their forecasts for the first half of fiscal 1994. The new forecasts indicate the steel sector as a whole will report greater losses than in the same period a year ago, and all five will pass their interim dividends for the second consecutive year. The companies said a moderate upturn in demand and strenuous cost-cutting efforts had enabled them to put in a better performance than expected earlier in the year. However, the sharp appreciation of the yen and a fall in steel prices continue to undermine their performance, the companies noted. They warned further that the yen's rise and low capital investment by Japanese companies continued to cloud their horizons. Nippon Steel said it expected sales of Y980bn (Dollars 9.9bn), 10 per cent below the result last year. The company forecasts a pre-tax loss of Y30bn, nearly double the Y16.7bn loss it recorded in the first half of last year, on sales of Y1,060bn, but an improvement on the Y40bn it forecast earlier in the year. No sales forecast was made then. Kobe Steel expects sales of Y530bn and a pre-tax loss of Y10bn, compared with first-half sales of Y545bn and a pre-tax loss of Y8.1bn last year. It had earlier forecast sales in the first half of Y520bn to Y530bn and a pre-tax loss of Y20bn. NKK expects sales to total Y520bn and its pre-tax loss to be Y40bn, against last year's sales of Y537bn and a loss of Y1.9bn. NKK has not previously forecast its first-half results. Meanwhile, Kawasaki Steel anticipates sales in the first half of Y450bn and a pre-tax loss of Y19bn. This compares with sales of Y522bn and a pre-tax loss of Y8.3bn in the first half of 1993 and an earlier forecast of Y450bn in sales and a Y20bn pre-tax loss. Sumitomo Metal is forecasting sales of Y490bn and a pre-tax loss of Y24bn compared with sales of Y508bn and a Y9bn loss in the same period last year. This is the first forecast for the period from the company.</p>

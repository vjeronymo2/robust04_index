			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Business and the Law: UK tax rule discriminatory - European Court The European Court of Justice confirmed last week that UK corporation tax legislation that discriminates against companies with their principal place of business in another member state is prohibited by Rome Treaty rules on establishment. The Court's ruling was in response to a question referred from the English High Court in the context of a dispute between Commerzbank AG and the UK tax authorities. Commerzbank, which had its head office in Germany, made loans to US companies through a UK branch. It paid tax in the UK of Pounds 4,222,234 on the interest earned. Subsequently, it successfully reclaimed that payment from the UK tax authorities on the ground that the interest was exempt from tax in the UK pursuant to a UK/US double tax treaty. This provided that tax was only payable in the UK on interest paid by a US company to a UK company or a company resident for tax purposes in the UK. Commerzbank also claimed 'a repayment supplement' of Pounds 5,199,258, equal to the interest incurred on the overpaid tax under the same provisions. The tax authorities rejected the claim on the grounds that the company was not resident in the UK. According to the UK tax rules, the supplement was generally available only in the case of repayments of corporation tax to a company resident in the UK. The ECJ held that a national law of this kind involved unequal treatment amounting to discrimination in breach of the treaty rules on establishment. The fact that the exemption from tax which led to the refund was available only to non-resident companies could not justify a general rule withholding the benefit on such a discriminatory basis. Case C-330/911, R v Inland Revenue Commissioners ex parte: Commerzbank AG, ECJ FC, July 13 1993 Establishment official authority exception In a reference from the Belgian Raad van State, the ECJ has interpreted the official authority exception to the right of establishment very strictly in the context of the Belgian regulation of insurance commissioners appointed by the Belgian Insurance Control Office. The Insurance Control Office exercised official authority and the insurance commissioners were appointed by the office under the same regulations which governed it. However, the Court found that a 1986 amendment to the applicable regulations requiring that insurance commissioners be Belgian nationals was unjustified. Previously, any Community national qualified. Moreover, the duties of the commissioner were, in terms of financial scrutiny, no different from those of others with no official authority and, when directly linked to the powers of the Insurance Control Office, always subject to final determination by the office itself. Case C-42/92, Thijssen v Controledienst voor de verzekeringen, ECJ 5CH, July 13 1993 Employment contract jurisdiction In a reference from the Chambery Court of Appeal, the ECJ has clarified the application of the special jurisdiction provisions in the Brussels Convention relating to employment contract disputes. The Court held that, where an employee performs his contract of employment in more than one contracting state, the place where the obligation characterising the contract is performed is that where, or from which, the employee principally carries out his obligations. In deciding the place of performance, which was for the national court to determine, the relevant facts of the case had to be taken into account. Accordingly, Mr Geels, the international marketing director of UK company Mulox IBC Limited, correctly brought his claim for compensation for the termination of his employment in the French courts. His residence from which he carried out his duties was in France; and his duties, previously performed in Germany and Holland, were ultimately performed exclusively in France.

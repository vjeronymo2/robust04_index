			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Observer: Fresh voice Australia has scored another first over Britain. It has put a woman on the board of its central bank. Janet Holmes a Court, widow of the late tycoon Robert, has been made a member of the Reserve Bank of Australia board along with Lew Solomon, chairman of Coles Myer. Whilst it is always good to see a woman moving up the ladder, Janet Holmes a Court was not the most obvious female candidate to fill the vacancy. She is reckoned to have done a good job running her late husband's business empire after he died in 1990, but most of her life has been spent worrying about her family rather than big business. Similarly, Lew Solomon's elevation will raise a few eyebrows. It is a bit like putting a financial entrepreneur/retailer, such as Sir James Goldsmith, on the board. But then perhaps the Bank of England might benefit from the appointment of a few non-establishment figures to its Court. How about Lord Hanson to replace Sir Adrian Cadbury? Twenty-two years on the Bank's board is long enough for anybody.</p>

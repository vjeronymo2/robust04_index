			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Knives out at heartbreak hotel: A look at Forte's renewed effort to take full control of the Savoy group New money against old. A thrusting immigrant family takes on England's most venerable institutions. The drive for profit collides with the preservation of genteel tradition. It is not just newspapers which have discerned elemental conflicts in Forte's 13-year struggle to acquire the Savoy group, whose hotels include the Savoy, Claridge's and the Connaught. The protagonists appear to enjoy casting themselves in these roles too. They did so during the initial eight-year takeover battle, which culminated in Forte acquiring 68 per cent of Savoy's shares but only 42 per cent of the vote. They continued to do so, usually in private, during the uneasy truce after Forte's agreement in 1989 not to raise its stake for five years in return for two seats on the Savoy board. And in the days before this week's Savoy board meeting, which announced Forte was seeking allies among smaller shareholding trusts, leaders of both camps gave further insights into how they like to be seen. At a hoteliers' luncheon, Mr Rocco Forte, chairman of Forte and son of its Italian immigrant founder, said he had no difficulty passing the 'cricket test' set by Lord Tebbit, the former Conservative party chairman, sitting beside him. Italy, he said, did not play cricket. The Fortes are proud of their passionate loyalty to two countries. Italy might not play cricket, but it does play football. Lord Forte, Rocco's 85-year old father, says he would cheer Italy if they played England at Wembley and England if the game was in Rome. The leaders of the Savoy have no need of such fine distinctions, being firmly rooted in British soil. Mr Giles Shepard, Savoy's managing director, this week told a tourist gathering of his memories of picnics on the rocks of Stonehenge, before motorways and public toilets damaged this ancient English mystery. When Lord Forte said in his autobiography that the father of Sir Hugh Wontner, Savoy president until his death in 1992, was of Hungarian origin, he received an angry letter from the Savoy's lawyers. Lord Forte admitted his mistake. None of the insults traded during the takeover battle of the 1980s have been forgotten and few have been forgiven. It was not just Mr Shepard's assertion that stewardship of Savoy's hotels could not be entrusted to 'a vast combine which, among other things, runs service stations on the main arterial roads'. What rankles more was Sir Hugh's remark to Mr Forte after Forte's initial failure to win control that 'I've always thought Italians made good hotel managers.' Now, however, long-time observers of the battle believe Forte wants to reduce the acrimony. Instead of bickering, the whole Savoy board should recognise that the running of the group can be improved. Savoy made pre-tax profits of only Pounds 725,000 last year on turnover of Pounds 83m, after recording a loss of Pounds 1.4m in 1992. Mr Forte has put to one side his desire to place Forte's most exclusive hotels in a joint company with the Savoy. Despite reports that Forte wants to put the Savoy hotels into its international booking system, detailed discussions on this have not taken place. The City was wrong in its view that there was no legal reason for Savoy to make this week's announcement that Forte was seeking an alliance with minority shareholding trusts. The Savoy board's legal advice was that the statement had to be made because speculation was rife. If Forte wants to proceed on a more friendly basis, some industry observers say it has a strange way of showing it. At this week's board meeting, Mr Forte blocked the appointment of Sir Roger Gibbs, chairman of the Wellcome Trust, as Savoy chairman. He even refused to agree to have Sir Roger on the board as a non-executive director, saying no changes should take place during discussion of the group's future. Mr Forte's attempt to win over the trustees - who have enough voting shares to give him overall control - seems his best option at the moment. The 1989 peace agreement specified Forte would not increase its stake for five years and would give 12 months' notice if it wanted to do so. The 12-month notice requirement remains even after the five-year period ends this November. Giving notice would cause the share price to rise, making a purchase more expensive. With the trustees' backing, Mr Forte would win control without having to spend another penny. There have been times when Mr Forte would have been happy to sell the Savoy stake, but there have been no buyers. The Aga Khan is believed to have expressed an interest but nothing came of it. Forte has tried to buy other luxury hotel groups instead. It was the favourite to take over Ciga, the Italian chain, but was defeated earlier this year by ITT Sheraton of the US. It is currently bidding against Accor of France to buy Meridien, the French chain. Apart from the prestige Savoy would bring to Forte, there is also the satisfaction it would give to its founder. Lord Forte proposed to his wife in the Savoy and spent part of his honeymoon there. Nevertheless, in his autobiography, Lord Forte said that, while any hotel group would be proud to own such prestigious hotels, 'I don't need the Savoy Group to crown my career. I have enough already of which to be proud.' While that is certainly true, 13 years is a long time to spend chasing something one does not need. Forte is unlikely to walk away now. Whether in acrimony or at peace, the two sides appear stuck with one another for some years yet.</p>

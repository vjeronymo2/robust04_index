			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> GUIDEBOOK;  </P> <P> BALI, INDONESIA  </P> <P> Getting there: Garuda Indonesia flies from Los Angeles to Indonesia, making two  stops, one in Honolulu and the other in Biak, Indonesia, before arriving in  Jakarta. Cost is $2,146 round trip. Continental also flies to Indonesia from  Los Angeles, stopping in Honolulu and Guam before continuing on to Denpasar,  Bali. Cost is $1,177 to $1,711 round trip.  </P> <P> Where to stay: In Sanur, La Taverna (telephone 361-88497) is one of Bali's  loveliest hotels, with rooms set in a beautiful garden that opens onto a beach.  The 40 rooms cost $78 to $93 a day. The elegant Tandjung Sari (telephone  361-88441) is the favorite of jetsetters. The 25 rooms are bigger than those at  La Taverna and cost more, $135-$175 a day.  </P> <P> In the Ubud area, the Kupu Kupu Barong in Kedewatan (telephone 361-95079) has a  spectacular location overlooking a ravine, but the prices are high by Balinese  standards, $195-$225 a day. A more practical choice would be the Ananda  Cottages in Campuan at $40 a day (telephone 361-26414).  </P> <P> Where to eat: Try the marinated sate (meat barbecued over coconut husks),  gadogado (steamed vegetables smothered with spicy peanut sauce), nasi goreng  (fried rice with egg and meats), black rice pudding and bean rice wine. The  Tandjung Sari is the best restaurant in Sanur; reserve ahead for its Saturday  night rijstafel (Indonesian buffet) and legong dance ($25 per person). The Kupu  Kupu Barong is Ubud's top eating spot, though the more centrally located Lotus  Cafe and Murni's Warung are also good choices.  </P> <P> When to go: Bali is centrally located in the Indonesian archipeligo. It has two  seasons, dry (May to October) and wet, and temperatures are about 80 degrees  year-round.  </P> <P> For more information: Contact the Indonesia Tourist Promotion Board, 3457  Wilshire Blvd., Suite 105, Los Angeles 90010, (213) 387-2078.

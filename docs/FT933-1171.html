			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: Sharp rise in operating profit for Generali GENERALI, Italy's biggest insurance group, yesterday confirmed the marked improvement seen in its underwriting business in the second half of last year with a sharp rise in first-half operating profits to L315bn (Dollars 199m), compared with L186bn in the same period last year. However, a sharp fall in extraordinary items and asset sales meant the improvement was not carried through to the pre-tax level, where earnings fell sharply to L426bn from L733bn last year. Net extraordinary items or asset sales dropped to just L198bn, some L325bn less than in the same period last year. Pre-tax profits were also affected by write-downs of L66bn on the group's securities portfolio, compared with a similar sized gain on its holdings in the first six months of 1992. The upbeat trend in underwriting earnings led the group to predict that full-year profits should exceed the L675.7bn before minority interests made after tax in 1992, in spite of the fact that extraordinary earnings were unlikely to match the levels of last year. Group premiums rose by 13.7 per cent to L4,594bn. Adjusted for exchange rate movements, the increase was limited to 8 per cent. Premiums on life insurance jumped by over 17 per cent to L1,848bn, while non-life premiums rose by 11.3 per cent to L2,746bn. Generali said underwriting results on its Italian non-life business had improved significantly thanks to lower claims and a more selective policy towards new risks. Performance on the life side continued to be 'fully satisfactory'. Underwriting results outside Italy remained under pressure, though the company said there were signs of an improvement.</p>

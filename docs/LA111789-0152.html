			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S.-MEXICO FAMILY-PLANNING GROUP FORMED  </P> <P> Three years ago, Maria Erana of Tijuana was in the predicament of many Mexican  women. She was poor, unmarried and pregnant.  </P> <P> And she did as many others do. She crossed the border and had an abortion in  San Diego. The procedure is illegal in Mexico, except in certain cases, such as  after rapes or when the child is likely to be born deformed.  </P> <P> "I wasn't ready for a child," explained Erana, now in training as a lawyer in  Tijuana. "I wanted to rise above my economic circumstances, to complete my  studies. I knew that I wouldn't be able to do that while supporting a child on  my own."  </P> <P> On Thursday, Erana and pro-choice representatives from both sides of the border  announced formation of a unique binational effort dedicated to protecting and  furthering women's family-planning practices in Mexico and the United States.  Their planned campaign is in response to what they categorize as an effort to  curtail options in both nations.  </P> <P> "Women on both sides of the border stand together in solidarity in support of a  woman's right to make choices that are right for her life and the well-being of  her family," said a joint statement read by Shireen Miles, associate director  of the Federation of Feminist Women's Health Centers, a Los Angeles-based  umbrella organization representing 20 clinics throughout the United States.  </P> <P> The border, Miles noted, has long been traversed by women seeking abortions.  Before abortion was legalized in the United States, many U.S. women traveled to  Mexico to have illegal abortions.  </P> <P> Now, there is fear of increased restrictions in both nations, as well as a  reduction in federal funds to family planning clinics in U.S. border areas that  are used by Mexican women seeking abortions.  </P> <P> Among other actions, the federation has planned a conference in Tijuana on Nov.  25 to discuss tactics to counter anti-abortion efforts. There will also be an  accelerated exchange of information and expertise between women' groups in the  two nations, the federation said.  </P></p>

			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow reaches yet another record high Wall Street Although US stock markets saw early selling yesterday, the losses were relatively limited and share prices rebounded to end the day marginally higher in record territory, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.83 at 3,793.76, a new record close. The more broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended up 0.40 at 470.94, another all-time high, while the American Stock Exchange composite index finished 2.84 higher at 470.00 and the Nasdaq composite up 3.51 at 764.57. Trading volume on the NYSE was 202m shares. Sentiment remained positive as investors headed into the new year in an upbeat mood. Trading, however, was subdued because many investors were away for an extended holiday. Yesterday's early selling was to be expected, given the extent of the market's gains the previous day. On Monday, the Dow jumped 35.21 to a record high of 3,792.93, while the S &amp; P 500 put on 3.16 at 470.54, also a record high. The Amex composite firmed 1.84 to 467.16 and the Nasdaq composite added 2.36 to end at 761.06. Trading volume on Monday was 171m shares. US share prices have been pushing ahead to new peaks because of several factors. They include fresh evidence of the strengthening economy, strong overseas markets, and signs that the Federal Reserve is not yet ready to raise interest rates. Yesterday, investors received good news from the Conference Board, which reported that its closely-followed index of consumer confidence jumped to 80.2 in December, up from 71.9 in November. Sentiment was also buoyed by fresh declines in commodity prices, including oil. Among individual stocks, semiconductor issues were in demand on the news that the Clinton administration had called for emergency talks on semiconductor trade with Japan in the wake of figures showing a decline in foreign companies' share of the Japanese semiconductor market. Motorola, which was up more than Dollars 1 at one stage, rose Dollars 1/4 to Dollars 91 5/8 , Texas Instruments firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 63 1/8 , and Intel, which is traded on the Nasdaq market, added Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 64. Cyclical stocks were in mixed form. Allied-Signal fell Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 79 5/8 and International Paper eased Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 67 7/8 on profit-taking, but Caterpillar firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 90 1/4 and Bethlehem Steel put on Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 19. Auto stocks remained in good demand as investors bet that sales of new cars and trucks would stay healthy throughout early 1994. Chrysler rose Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 53 7/8 , Ford put on Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 64 3/4 and General Motors firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 56 3/4 . On the Nasdaq market, QVC Network fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 37 7/8 amid reports that if it succeeds with its Dollars 10bn bid for Paramount Communications it will be forced to take billions of dollars in goodwill charges for the next 20 to 40 years. Canada TORONTO stocks were sharply higher in quiet trading. The TSE-300 composite index rose 42.46 points, or 1.0 per cent, to 4,288.85. Advances led declines 461 to 230, volume of 35.49m shares was below Thursday's 59.9m and trading value was CDollars 313.4m compared with CDollars 523.4m. The market was closed last Friday and yesterday for the Christmas holiday.</p>

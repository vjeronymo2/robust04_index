The main contents of the move include: There will be no  tariffs levied on imported wheat and import value-added taxes  will be returned in full after they are collected. There will  be no tariffs on imported cotton and import value-added taxes  will be returned in full after they are collected. There will  be no tariffs on imported bean oil. Tariffs on imports of palm  oil and sugar will be reduced by 50 percent. There will be no  tariffs on imports of potash fertilizer, phosphate fertilizer,  and urea and import value-added taxes will be returned in full  after they are collected. If the price is still lower than the  domestic market price after the reimbursement of tax, a small  portion of the returned value-added taxes will be deducted.  There will be no tariffs on imported farm pesticides and  intermediate and import value-added taxes will be returned in  full after they are collected.</p>

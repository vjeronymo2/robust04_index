			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Senators warn on runaway spending: Federal budget will be 'swamped' by 2010 Some of Washington's wisest heads yesterday issued a solemn warning that runaway government spending was heading in a direction that will eventually swamp the federal budget. Sounding the alarm over the expansion of government entitlements, such as Social Security and Medicare benefits for the elderly, a bipartisan commission chaired by Senator Robert Kerrey, of Nebraska, called for action to address the problem before it became overwhelming. If trends continue unchecked, the commission said in a preliminary report, by the year 2010 the entire federal budget will be consumed by entitlements and by interest on the government debt. 'What we are saying is that if we continue the trend lines that we are going right now, we are going to find the federal government essentially converted into an ATM machine,' Mr Kerrey said. The commission is due to present a more detailed final report in December - after the congressional elections - with its recommendations. Yesterday's interim report was intended to raise public awareness of the extent of the problem. Although many voters favour cuts in government spending, they tend to believe that the budget deficit can be brought into line by eliminating waste, fraud and welfare payments to the unemployed. Apart from interest on the national debt, which is expected to eat up 14 per cent of government spending next year, the largest programmes in the federal budget are Social Security and Medicare, hugely popular middle class benefits which together account for one third of all government spending. While Social Security generates an annual surplus, most of its beneficiaries take out much more than they put in, and the ageing of the US population mean changes will be needed at some point. Medicare, like other health spending, continues to climb much faster than the general rate of inflation, and hopes are now dwindling that a reform of the healthcare system would be able to bring it under control. The commission was originally set up by President Bill Clinton to fulfil a promise made to Mr Kerrey in return for his vote for last year's budget. Since Mr Kerrey now says he will not vote for the healthcare reform bill at present under consideration, Mr Clinton may have to promise to do something about the commission's proposals in order to win Mr Kerrey over once again.</p>

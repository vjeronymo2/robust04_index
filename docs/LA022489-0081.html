			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ALL THAT JAZZ HARDLY PAYS FOR GROCERIES  </P> <P> Asked about making a living in San Diego, local jazz musicians don't mince  words.  </P> <P> "Short story, huh?" joked Mark Hunter, the bass player for the group  Fattburger.  </P> <P> "You can do it if you're 22 years old with no responsibilities and you live at  home where food is good and rent is cheap," said jazz pianist Shep Meyers, 52.  </P> <P> "Right now, the scene is very bad," said jazz vocalist Coral Thuet. "There  aren't any clubs to play in. The only ones for locals are Croce's and the Loft.  It's really a drag."  </P> <P> "It's getting desperate for these guys," said David Fargo, general manager at  Vic's in La Jolla, which books jazz. "I get more calls than I ever had before  about playing our restaurant."  </P> <P> The weak local scene has caused players like pianist Art Resnick and bass man  Dave Marr to leave for greener pastures in Europe and elsewhere. That probably  wouldn't include Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "On the whole, it's worse up there," said bass player Bob Magnusson. "I lived  there for a while. The reason is, you have that whole group of guys who are  fine studio players. They want to come out and play, and they aren't concerned  with money, because they make six figures in the studios. Many nights their bar  tabs at places like Donte's and the Baked Potato are more than their pay. Guys  make $28 or $32 to play for three or four hours. It's ridiculous."  </P> <P> The tendency in San Diego is to peg club owners as penny pinchers, and blame  them for the low pay. But they aren't entirely at fault. After all, they have  their own financial realities, and San Diegans just don't seem as interested in  hearing live jazz as they are in Top 40 or rock 'n' roll.  </P> <P> Some of the clubs can't afford to pay any more than they do.  </P> <P> Local 325, the musicians union, might be expected to act as a go-between,  helping to improve wages for members. The union classifies clubs as A, B or C,  according to their size and what they can afford to pay. Croce's is a B, for  example, Diego's Loft, an A. But the union doesn't seem forceful when it comes  to money.  </P> <P> "Fifty dollars for four hours is the going rate in the clubs," said Edward  Arias, the union's local business representative.  </P> <P> "The union has kind of faded here," said bass man Magnusson. "Most everyone's a  member, but the union doesn't seem able to do much."  </P> <P> The demise of key local jazz clubs, and format changes at other night spots  that previously featured jazz have made the situation worse. When Our Place in  Hillcrest closed two years ago, San Diego jazz musicians lost a good friend.  </P> <P> "That was a club that everyone could play without restrictions," Thuet said.  "It was sort of a neighborhood bar, kind of a dive, but in a good sense. That  was where all the musicians hung out. They always had great bands. Even though  the money wasn't good, they made up for it because you could play whatever you  wanted to play."  </P> <P> More recently, the Bella Via in Cardiff was sold and, under the new name  Pastels, no longer offers jazz. Musicians once viewed the Bella Via as the  prime local venue, with its second-story bar offering white-water views and a  great sound system. PAX in La Jolla, a restaurant which booked jazz, went out  of business. Presto, which replaced it, features mostly rock and reggae.  </P> <P> Actually, Croce's in downtown San Diego and Diego's Loft in Pacific Beach  aren't the only local clubs regularly booking jazz, just the most active when  it comes to "straight ahead" jazz, with its roots in the jazz of the '40s and  '50s. The Horton Grand Hotel downtown features jazz in its Palace Bar. Vic's in  La Jolla offers jazz several nights a week. The Jazz Mine record store in La  Jolla holds occasional concerts. Several clubs host KIFM's brand of "Lites Out  Jazz," hybrid music scornfully dubbed by purists as "elevator" or "Valium"  jazz.  </P> <P> And there is Elario's, which features big-name national jazz talents, often  backed by local musicians. But only a few locals get to play; the house rhythm  section generally consists of pianist Mike Wofford, drummer Jim Plank and bass  player Magnusson.  </P> <P> The pay for the "name" acts is surprisingly modest. Steve Satkowski, who does  the booking, declined to give specific figures, but said name players earn more  than $150 per night. Many earn an additional $230 if they tape a half-hour  KPBS-TV "Club Date" show when they're in town. Other sources said the pay at  Elario's has been as little as $400 per week for five nights. The local backup  musicians get $70 or $80 for a four-hour gig.  </P> <P> At least one nationally known jazz man reportedly turned down an Elario's  invitation because of the money. Other musicians, though, like playing the La  Jolla club. They view a two-week gig there, with meals and an ocean-view room,  as a vacation from the craziness of Los Angeles or New York.  </P> <P> By contrast, name acts earn thousands when they do one-night stands in San  Diego, according to San Diego Jazz Festival promoter Rob Hagey. The San Diego  Jazz Festival is a foundation set up by Hagey to offset losses when jazz dates  fail to cover expenses, as it did recently when drummer Art Blakey made an  appearance at Bacchanal in Kearney Mesa. Hagey said the show cost about $5,000.  </P> <P> Salaries for one-night dates by comparable luminaries range from $4,500 for  pianist McCoy Tyner to $12,000 to $15,000 for trumpeter Miles Davis.  </P> <P> The money for local musicians is especially slim for those who play  traditional, or "straight ahead" jazz, rather than the more lucrative, light  jazz often heard on KIFM (98.1) and KSWV-FM (102.9). Straight ahead players'  pay ranges from $30 for a three-hour afternoon gig at Croce's to $75 to $100  for four hours at Diego's Loft, where local musicians play about two-thirds of  the dates, with the rest taken by national acts.  </P> <P> Bands playing on KIFM's "Lites Out Jazz" circuit, which hits a different San  Diego club every night of the week, can make $400 to $700 a night playing such  spots as the Rusty Pelican, Humphrey's, the B St. Cafe and City Colors.  </P> <P> "The circuit is really good," said David Ochs, the guitarist in Most Valuable  Players, which appears often in the "Lites Out" clubs. Ochs, married with kids,  works as a plumber to make ends meet.  </P> <P> Chuck's Steak House, which is not a "Lites Out" participant but a place where  that kind of jazz is often heard, is reportedly one of the lowest paying rooms  in town. Sources say that bands at Chuck's Steak House get $150 plus 10% of the  bar, which can amount to about $200 total.  </P> <P> San Diego jazz musicians often turn to "casuals" to make ends meet. Such  occasions as weddings and corporate parties actually pay better than club  dates.  </P> <P> Piano man Meyers said a casual performance can easily earn him $150. Jazz  pianist Joe Azarello said the range for a three-hour casual by a solo piano  player is $75 to $250.  </P> <P> To make it financially, musicians find themselves expanding their repertoires  to meet a variety of requests -- not necessarily jazz.  </P> <P> Pianist and bass player Richard James, who plays piano three nights a week at  the U.S. Grant Hotel downtown, and three days a week inside the La Jolla  Village Square shopping mall, said that he knows between 500 and 1,000 songs,  ranging from "Hello Dolly" to obscure Delta blues numbers. He'd rather play  pure jazz, he said, but there is the matter of earning a living. Even so, he  doesn't seem bitter.  </P> <P> "What I'm doing is working on a lot of things," he said. "The notion is what I  was last year and what I am today are related. The notion of growth, of  learning, is extremely important to a musician. Trying to keep up with the  marketplace, to keep the money rolling in, forces you to be perceptive."  </P> <P> Commercial work is even more lucrative for the lucky few musicians who get the  jobs.  </P> <P> "This afternoon, I was in the studio doing jingles," Fattburger's Hunter said  recently. "We taped a theme for the 'Attitudes' show on the Lifetime channel. I  made $300 in six hours."  </P> <P> Hunter also played on radio and TV commercials for American Savings, fruitful  jobs because they offer musicians royalty payments every 90 days as long as the  commercial is in use. Royalties amount to 75% of the original fee, Hunter said.  </P> <P> No matter how they scrape a living together, life is hectic for the jazz  musicians. Meyers recently went two weeks without a day off. During a  particularly hectic week, he played as many as three gigs a day.  </P> <P> "That was the best week I ever had," Meyers said, adding that he had made $700  to $800. "You don't want to be 50 years old and playing clubs all your life.  I'm always going to play, but it would be nice just to be recognized for your  own material. I think every artist in town feels the same way. You play other  material as a springboard for your own, to show off your talent. I'm one of the  more successful musicians in town, and I can't imagine I'm living beyond the  poverty level."  </P></p>

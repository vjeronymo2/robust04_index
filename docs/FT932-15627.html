			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Tuscany's good oil WE HAVE travelled a long way since the mid-1970s when I bought my first olive oil. In those days, it came in a rather baroque-looking bottle from Boots the chemist and doubtless was intended more as a laxative than a gastronomic accessory. Now, every delicatessen and supermarket stocks half a dozen olive oils from different countries. Tuscan oils are the ones we talk about most although they differ from those originating in the more torrid parts of Italy and their peppery nature is not always to everyone's taste. But that fiery finish is typical of the region. To some extent, olive oils are like the wines which are so often their stablemates. They are the products both of climate and different varieties of fruit. In the hotter parts of Italy, Spain and Greece, the oils often are rich and buttery. The Tuscan character derives from the comparative coolness of the climate and the need to pick the olives when slightly under-ripe to avoid the winter rains and frosts. The main Tuscan olive is the Frantoio, which gives the oils those aromas of bananas, apples and avocados. The Moraiolo variety is responsible for the pepper and the Leccino provides the 'fatness.' Just as Tuscany's wine is governed by strict regulations laid down by various consortia, so also is the olive oil. Some growers, however, have gone one step further and formed their own, highly-select, consortium which makes a sort of super oil called Laudemio. This was born of the 1985 crisis when 90 per cent of Tuscany's olive trees were blighted by frost as temperatures plummeted. But the olive is a hardy plant, and many of those which seemed dead grew back from the roots. It was a slow process, though, and the trees have only come back into production in the past couple of years. During the late 1980s, much of what purported to be Tuscan oil was anything but. The Laudemio consortium was formed in 1990 with 31 estates and production was limited to approved sites in central Tuscany. All the olives must be cold-pressed before December 15 to ensure 'typicity' and great care is taken to avoid bruising. This is intended to prevent high acidity, which could lead to fermentation. The acid level in Laudemio oils is fixed at half that of normal Tuscan extra virgin, and they must be submitted to a tasting panel which meets on the ground floor of a villa in the suburbs of Florence. The tasters sit solemnly over a row of oils, looking for such qualities as their balance of fruitiness and pepper, plus any defects such as rancidity. The morning I visited, every one seemed to have passed with flying colours; but, in all fairness, it must be noted that olive oil is not as easy to get wrong as wine, and the success rate in the examination is correspondingly high. Six of these Laudemio oils are now imported into Britain in their smart, 500 cl bottles, a special feature of which is a screw-on spout which prevents your guests from being over-lavish as they pour the contents into their soup. And all six are excellent. My only complaint would be about Laudemio's insistence on filtering the oils. Many Tuscan estate-owners to whom I spoke said they preferred unfiltered oil and used it exclusively at home. But the decision was taken to avoid offending Americans who, apparently, want their olive oil bright, and because the colloids tend to blacken if the oil is not kept in a cool place. It might well be that, in the US, they are put off by such things; but, in Britain, the wonderful Nunez de Prado oil from Baena in Spain is sold unfiltered to its numerous devotees. Twenty years on, I think we are quite grown-up enough to take cloudy olive oil.

			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Yeltsin dismisses draft law to build up oil investment Ponderous Russian efforts to write a law to create a transparent legal basis for foreign investment in the oil sector received a setback yesterday when President Boris Yeltsin made clear he would oppose a draft law being prepared by parliament. Mr Yeltsin told the state duma, or lower house of parliament, that the oil and gas law due to pass through the house after the recess contravened the constitution and showed an 'anti-reform approach'. His objections - though aimed at making the law more liberal and welcoming to investment by foreign oil companies - is likely to stall the legislation. Major oil companies see a clear legal basis as critically important for their investments - and for the Russian oil industry, whose output is declining rapidly. One senior oil industry executive in Moscow said yesterday: 'We must have an oil and gas law. Individual production sharing agreements are not enough.' There are signs of Russia's energy resources being opened up to foreign companies, notably in the signing of an agreement with a US-Japanese-Anglo/Dutch consortium to prospect a block of oil and gas reserves off Sakhalin in the Far East. But adoption of a reliable framework and smoothing of bureaucratic obstacles are still fraught with problems. Different layers of government and the various oil-producing enterprises differ among themselves on the desirability of foreign investment and the terms on which it could be accepted. Mr Yeltsin's objections, backed by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, prime minister, were sent to the chairman of the duma, Mr Ivan Rybkin, a month ago. The four pages of objections amount to a rejection of the draft law as a whole. Mr Yeltsin says 'the contents of the draft law cannot be improved in quality by the adoption of certain amendments to it'. The president's letter focuses on clauses in the law which attempt to prescribe actions for, or restrict the rights of, already privatised companies in the energy field - such as the gas monopoly, Gasprom - or which interfere with the rights of the licensees, including foreign licensees. Mr Yeltsin argues that existing legislation, especially a law on subsoil, specifies rights and obligations clearly enough to make new laws redundant. Mr Yeltsin's dismissal of the draft law, and his evident reluctance to propose an alternative, suggests he would prefer this area, as others, to be regulated by his decree.</p>

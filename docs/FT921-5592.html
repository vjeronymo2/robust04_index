			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Inequality reported in acting ACTRESSES are paid less than half as much as actors, according to research into the broadcast media published yesterday. The report, which was commissioned by Equity, the actors' union, found that on average men earned Pounds 53,814 and women Pounds 26,591 per year in television, film, radio and commercials in the past three years. The research found that median pay, a more realistic guide because of the wide spread of earnings, was Pounds 15,000 for men and Pounds 8,350 a year for women. Men played two lead roles for every one played by a woman on television and three for every one on radio. Men were paid significantly more than women for comparable roles. The report also found that women's employment began to decline after the age of 30. In the age group 40 to 49 years, there are two men working for every woman. Ms Juliet Stevenson, star of the acclaimed film Truly, Madly, Deeply, said: 'There only seems to be room for a handful of women in middle age but men in middle age can sustain careers all over the place.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kostas Iordhanidhis] </F>   [Text] The U.S. State Department's positions on the  problem of Albania's Greek minority and the Turkish claims about  Kurdish "terrorists" being trained in Greece have begun shaking  the faith of a large segment of the government, and the Greek  leadership, in general on the possibility of closer cooperation  with the United States for stability in the region.    The fact that U.S. President Bill Clinton's positions  regarding the Greek minority in Albania were satisfactory and in  accordance with the principles that supposedly govern U.S.  foreign policy in regard to human rights is small consolation.  Equally irrelevant for the Greek side is whether, in practice,  the relations between the White House and State Department are  harmonious.    What matters is that, according to the Greek Government,  State Department bureaucracy is primarily interested in the  stability of Enver Hoxha's doctor and current Albanian  president, Sali Berisha, and not in the Tirana regime's  adherence to the principles of CSCE and Copenhagen regarding  respect for human rights.    This position, official sources in Athens stressed, has by  now led the Greek Government to handle its troublesome relations  with Tirana mainly at the bilateral level, regardless of any  appeals to international organizations, which it will intensify  but without expecting positive results. Confirmation of this  came from Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, who said on Friday  [27 May] that, "if the violations of the Greek minority's rights  continue, there will a conflict with Albania at the diplomatic  and political levels."    From the very beginning of its term in office, the current  Greek government, and specifically Foreign Minister Papoulias,  promoted a policy of restoring relations between Athens and  Tirana despite the high domestic cost. In his approach,  Papoulias was also supported by the U.S. State Department; but  last week it suddenly shook the current balance by adopting  Berisha's positions.    Well-informed sources stress that following the State  Department's shift, its calls for a dialogue cannot be taken  seriously in Athens because the U.S. role in relation to Albania  is no longer that of "an honest referee," as the Greek side  desired. Consequently, if the current situation with regard to  Albania continues, the Greek Government's reaction will be  "extremely severe," simply because the doctrine "Cyprus is too  far away" cannot be applied in the case of the Albanian Greeks.    The State Department's second controversial statement--that  it is examining reports about the training of Kurds in  Greece--is seen in Athens as a naive attempt to reinforce a  shaky regime which, despite the fact that for 10 years it has  been unable to impose its control in Turkey's eastern provinces  with the West's tolerance and silence, is still trying to  internationalize a domestic issue by blaming others.    There is no practical reason for the Kurds to be trained in  Greece or anywhere else, because for 10 years they have trained  under actual combat conditions in eastern Turkey. At the same  time Athens believes that the claims by the Turkish security  authorities--according to which Kurds from Frankfurt arrived in  Greece and trained for five months on explosives, then went to  Iran from whence they entered Turkey, and ended in Izmir, where  they were going to carry out sabotage--cannot even be a part of  an investigation by the services of a big power much less be  addressed in public by official remarks by the State Department  spokesman.    Of course the State Department's positions regarding  Albania's Greeks and the issue of the Kurds, as mentioned above,  reflect a sharp decline in the U.S. Administration's views of  the quality of some decisions by the Greek political leadership.    During the last couple of years, the behavior of  corresponding European Union [EU] state mechanisms was similar.  In that case, though, the possibility of frequent contacts at  the highest level--that is, once every six months at the EU  Summit--gave former Prime Minister Konstandinos Mitsotakis an  opportunity to intervene and get some understanding and  tolerance from the European political leaders.    In the case of relations with the United States though,  despite the very good personal relation established between the  U.S. President and Papandreou, the frequency of contacts in  relation to those existing in the EU framework is limited. As a  result, the State Department's role appears to be more important.    Consequently, the problem is identified as a lack of direct  "political" dialogue between Athens and Washington as it exists  within the European Union. Official sources in Athens stressed  that, due to the lack of "political" dialogue and given the  State Department's negative stance, there are doubts as to  whether the Greek political leadership can count on operational  contact with Washington for the benefit of stability in the  Balkans.</p>

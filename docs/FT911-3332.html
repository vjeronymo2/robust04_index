			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Sovereign Oil expands SOVEREIGN OIL &amp; Gas, the North Sea exploration and production company, reported an advance from Pounds 1m to Pounds 3.9m in pre-tax profits for 1990 after a strong rise in oil prices at the outset of the Gulf crisis. Mr David Biggins, managing director, said he hoped for some stability in the value of sterling against the dollar this year to provide a reasonable future for the company's business. The weakness of the dollar against the pound had produced an oil price of Pounds 8 per barrel in February which was 'sheer misery' for North Sea independent oil producers, he said. Sovereign is partly hoping to hedge its exposure to the dollar oil price by increasing its stake in the Victor gas field which sells gas to British Gas on long-term contracts priced in sterling. Sovereign increased its stake in the field from 3 to 5 per cent with a Dollars 30m purchase from Superior Oil, an affiliate of Mobil. Turnover rose to Pounds 20.4m (Pounds 12.3m). Earnings per share increased from 0.9p to 4.9p.</p>

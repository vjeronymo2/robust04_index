			<p>BFN     [Text] Anticorruption is an extremely important issue with  which the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, the  provincial party committee, and the provincial government are  much concerned. At the same time, it is an issue to the common  concern of the broad masses of the people.    Since last September, Hebei Province has launched an  extensive campaign to oppose corruption. The scale and the  achievements of this campaign have been never seen in recent  years. Yang Yuzhong, deputy secretary of the provincial  discipline inspection commission and head of the anticorruption  office under the provincial party committee, said to reporters a  few days ago: From October to November last year, more than  21,000 leading cadres at or above the county or section level of  party and government organs throughout the province took an  active part in the activities of being honest, clean, and  self-disciplined and examined themselves and corrected mistakes  in line with the 10 prohibitions set forth by the provincial  party committee. From the self-examination, a total of 11,000  cadres were found violating the five stipulations of the central  authorities and the 10 prohibitions of the provincial party  committee. Of these cadres, 786 were of the prefectural and  department levels, involving 4.82 million yuan in illicit money.  At the same time, discipline inspection and supervisory  departments also concentrated on investigating and dealing with  a number of cases of violating laws and disciplines. From  September to December last year, a total of 3,857 discipline  violation cases committed by party members and cadres were put  on file for investigation and prosecution. Of these cases, 392  involved more than 10,000 yuan in illicit money each and  involved leading cadres of the level of deputy county or section  head, including the case committed by (Liu Qingfang), secretary  of the Lingshou County Party Committee, and some other major  typical cases that have produced certain influence throughout  the province.    Yang Yuzhong pointed out: Through the anticorruption  campaign, the wanton collections of fees, fines, and  apportionments, on which the masses expressed strong comments,  have been effectively checked. The province as a whole has  stopped collecting a total of 5,050 unreasonable items of  charges, and ferreted out 110 million yuan of money collected in  violation of discipline, of which, 8.44 million yuan has already  been returned. The evil trend that party and government  organizations abuse powers to do business and earn profits has  been checked basically. A total of 1,547 cadres were found  using public funds to go abroad for tourism, more than 1.36  million yuan of illegal money have been confiscated according to  stipulations, and 88,000 yuan have been taken over from 10 units  that organized overseas tours.    With regard to this year's anticorruption work, Yang Yuzhong  pointed out: Although Hebei Province has achieved marked  results in the recent anticorruption work, it still lags far  behind the goal set by the CPC Central Committee and the State  Council for the present stage and behind the expectations of the  masses. When viewed from the efficiency of work, the  anticorruption work has been uneven in different localities and  different departments; some problems concerning leading cadres'  administrative honesty and self-discipline, that have aroused  much comments among the masses, such as party and government  organizations vying with one another in purchasing luxurious  cars, indulging in extravagant wining and dining with public  funds, and holding extravagant weddings and funerals, need to be  resolved conscientiously; some anticorruption measures have not  been carried out truly and practically; and some achievements  are not remarkable.    This year, in line with the three tasks set forth by the  party Central Committee and the State Council and with the  guiding ideology of achieving results at the present stage, we  should continue to grasp the anticorruption campaign, further  resolve various kinds of negative and corrupt phenomena, ensure  the political and social stability, and promote the province's  reform, opening up, and economic development.</p>

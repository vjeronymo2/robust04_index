			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 SISTERS ACQUITTED IN JEWELRY DISTRICT  CASE  </P> <P> A federal court jury on Monday acquitted two sisters of conspiracy and  money-laundering charges in a case involving "Operation Polar Cap," a massive  drug and currency investigation focused in the jewelry district in downtown Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> The jurors found Joyce Momjdian, 25, and Zepur Moroyan, 22, both of La  Crescenta, not guilty of 26 charges against them in a 1989 indictment.  </P> <P> The jury has now exonerated four of nine defendants in 12 days of deliberations  and is continuing deliberations on the five other defendants.  </P> <P> "I'm happy, very happy" said a smiling Moroyan, a receptionist, after the  verdicts were announced in the 7-month trial. Momjdian, a bookkeeper, said she  was scared about what the jury might do, even though "inside I knew I hadn't  done anything."  </P> <P> The two worked at Andonian Bros., a jewelry company on West 5th Street where a  huge drug-laundering ring allegedly was centered. They said they are cousins of  Nazareth Andonian, who is described by authorities as a key defendant in the  case.  </P></p>

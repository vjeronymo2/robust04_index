			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Sharp drop in jobless to 2.81m: Unemployment lowest for 15 months - FT-SE 100 surges to new high Government claims that the economy is strong enough to withstand sharp tax increases in the spring were strengthened yesterday by the unemployment figures for November which fell to their lowest level since August last year. The seasonally adjusted jobless total dropped 36,100 to 2.81m, after a revised 52,100 fall in October, bringing the rate of unemployment down to 10 per cent of the workforce. The November fall was the second biggest monthly decline for four years. The figures, coming against a backdrop of low inflation, pushed share prices to an all-time closing high as investors raised their expectations for an early cut in interest rates. The FT-SE 100 share index ended 32.4 up at 3,311.2. Sterling, after a morning fillip, closed unchanged against the D-Mark at DM2.545. Against the dollar, it was just over half a cent stronger at Dollars 1.489. Good inflation figures earlier this week, pointing to a lack of price pressures in the economy, were reinforced yesterday by average earnings growth figures which held steady at 3 per cent in the year to October. Optimism about economic prospects will be further fuelled by a Confederation of British Industry survey published today which says order books have improved in recent weeks, even though expectations of output increases have slipped. Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, said the fall in the jobless total  -the eighth monthly drop so far this year - came as a 'Christmas message of hope for unemployed people'. He added: 'Today's further fall of 36,100 in unemployment means that we are ending 1993 with more jobs and with 176,400 fewer people out of work.' But Mr John Prescott, the shadow employment secretary, said the downward trend in unemployment would be reversed by tax increases and spending cuts in the spring. 'Relatively small reductions in cyclical unemployment will have no impact on the long-term structural unemployment caused by the run-down of manufacturing, and a radical alternative programme of job creation is urgently needed,' he said. Both the level and rate of seasonally adjusted unemployment are at their lowest since August last year. The rate of 10 per cent compares with 10.6 per cent in January when the number of people out of work and claiming benefit peaked at just below 3m. The separate rates in November were 13.5 per cent for men and 5.4 per cent for women. During the month 28,000 fewer men and 8,100 fewer women were unemployed. Unadjusted, unemployment fell by 24,000 to 2.76m. The last time it was lower was in June 1992. There was an encouraging rise in vacancies, generally a reliable guide to future trends in unemployment. The stock of unfilled vacancies rose by 6,500, while new vacancies notified to Jobcentres - about one third of all vacancies in the economy - rose by 10,000 in November to the highest level for nearly 3 1/2 years. The figures also showed that in the three months to September, the workforce in employment rose by 86,000, the second successive quarterly rise. Manufacturing employment, however, fell in the third quarter, reversing two previous quarterly increases. Commenting on the figures, Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers, said: 'It appears that the trend in unemployment is clearly down.' However, he pointed out that unemployment was still at historically high levels.

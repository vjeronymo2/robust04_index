			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: Electrolux to expand Electrolux yesterday finalised a DM730m (Dollars 429m) agreement to buy Hausgerate, AEG's household appliance division. The deal enhances the Swedish group's position as the world's leading producer of household appliances, ahead of Whirlpool of the US, and strengthens its position in the European white goods market. Total annual sales of household appliances will exceed SKr70bn (Dollars 8.9bn). Electrolux will take over DM400m in debt as part of the deal, which is subject to EU regulatory approval. The purchase will lift the company's share of the European white goods market to at least 25 per cent, and take its German market share as high as 35 per cent. Electrolux acquired 10 per cent of Hausgerate in 1992 for DM80m and was offered the chance to buy the rest of the company last December as part of a shake-up at Daimler-Benz, AEG's parent. The terms announced yesterday for 100 per cent of the company are a little lower than analysts expected, reflecting the impact of the German recession. Electrolux said the acquisition would broaden its product range.</p>

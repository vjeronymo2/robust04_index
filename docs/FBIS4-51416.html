			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 26 (CNA) -- Taiwan on Thursday [26 May]  put a hold on a proposed plan for direct transportation links  with Mainland China, apparently as a result a recent spate of  incidents that have threatened fragile cross-strait ties.    In a revised position paper on Taiwan-mainland direct links,  the cabinet's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Taiwan will  not consider initiating direct air and sea links with the  mainland before its security wariness is soothed.    The paper says transportation links cannot be achieved  before  Beijing renounces its threat of force against Taiwan, lest  Taiwan be lulled into thinking the links would remove that  threat, thus sharply weakening Taiwan's ability to defend itself.    The paper said achieving direct links would be difficult  anyway, given the political, legal and security barriers that  the mainland has thrown up.    It disagreed with the proposal by the mainland that if  cross-strait transport links proceed, ships from either side  would not be allowed to hoist their national flags. It said  that doing so would not eliminate the political, legal and  security problems existing between the two sides, and in  addition would be against both the International Civil Aviation  Agreement and ROC civil aviation laws.    Underlining its much more vigilant attitude toward the  mainland, the MAC added in the paper a survey of practices  adopted by countries separated after World War II in regard to  direct transportation links. It said East and West Germany and  South and North Koreas did not begin direct transport links  before hostilities between them were officially brought to an  end.    Meanwhile, the paper asserted that Hong Kong will remain a  "special territory" in ROC jurisdictional terms after the  British colony is turned over to communist China in 1997, but  added that direct air and sea links between Taiwan and Hong Kong  will be sustained.</p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Setback for Land Rover LAND ROVER, the subsidiary of the Rover group, said yesterday there had been some 'slippage' in its plans to set up an assembly plant in Brazil, writes Stephen Fidler, Latin America Editor. The company had intended to begin producing vehicles in 1993, but a spokesman said yesterday the schedule had been set back largely by a trademark dispute, now settled in the company's favour. Mr Gilberto Mestrinho, governor of the Brazilian state of Amazonas, is due to meet officials from Land Rover today for talks about the possible siting of an 18,000-vehicle-a-year assembly plant in Manaus, the state capital. Mr Mestrinho said that a variety of tax advantages were available in the free-trade zone in Manaus. Land Rover said yesterday that several sites in Brazil were under consideration.</p>

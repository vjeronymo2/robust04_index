			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Turkish municipal workers strike More than 40,000 Turkish municipal workers in five cities went on strike yesterday after an unresolved five-month pay dispute, a union official said, Reuter reports from Ankara. The municipalities jointly offered a 57.3 per cent annual pay rise from March this year, against union demands of 116 per cent. Both figures include various fringe benefits. Turkey's annual inflation rate fell to a 12-month low of 65.8 per cent in June.</p>

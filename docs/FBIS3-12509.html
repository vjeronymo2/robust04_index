			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on an interview with Hizballah Deputy Secretary </F> General Shaykh Na'im Qasim by Nisrin Nasir-al-Din; place and  date not given]    [Text] Israeli forces continue to mass in the occupied  strip while the enemy wages a major media campaign hinting at  the possibility of a new military operation. While the United  States is highlighting this atmosphere with official and public  threats, things remain tense and the Resistance ranks are on  constant alert.    So how does Hizballah view developments in the south?    Hizballah's Deputy Secretary General Shaykh Na'im Qasim said  he expects every aggression from Israel and at any time,  regardless of whether there are any apparent or formal  justifications. He said the Israeli threats are not new,  because the tighter the situation Israel finds itself in, the  harder it tries to escape it by flexing its muscle and by trying  to use force to achieve progress in the negotiations and to  compel those involved to make concessions. Shaykh Qasim added:  We do not regard the Israeli threats as an exception but as  part of the constant threat to the south, Western al-Biqa', and  Lebanon as a whole because of the Israeli presence on our soil.    The U.S. stance is biased. It adopts the Israeli plan for  the region. It is natural for the United States to propagate  whatever Israel wants. U.S. sympathy with the threats is merely  new proof of its collusion with Israel to prevent Lebanon and  the region from having any dignity and to interfere more in  imposing its policies. Another reason for the American and  Israeli shouts is the effectiveness of the Resistance and its  effect on complicating the schemes. We place this before all  the nationalists and honest people so as to affirm the  resistance option against Zionist arrogance.    Shaykh Qasim added: Another U.S. ploy is to urge Israel to  remain calm. This is a known, sly way of distributing roles  between the United States, which claims to be concerned about  peace and security, and Israel, which violates a decision agreed  on with Washington so that the use of force can be an additional  weapon in subjugating the region. The United States should take  its hands off Lebanon and the region. Israel can do nothing  without the sponsorship of the United States, which takes care  to ensure Israel's military superiority and supports it  politically in international forums. Its pressures in the  region mean that the United States is a full partner in the  aggression and has never been a real peace partner for a single  minute.    Shaykh Qasim believes that no one can guess the extent of  the  aggression. He ruled out the idea of an invasion because such  an action needs the right conditions and developments that  cannot easily be provided right now. He added that an invasion  will cost Israel more than Lebanon because Israel would have to  invade a people, not confront a regular army.    Shaykh Na'im Qasim denied reports that there had been  contacts with Hizballah to reduce its resistance operations  during the negotiations and stressed that no one asked us to  reduce the operations during the Geneva summit between President  Clinton and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. He said: We do not  carry out our operations based on the negotiations, because we  do not believe in them. Our resistance action is a constant one  based on the principle of liberating the land. The resistance  will continue as long as the occupation exists. It might  intensify or weaken according to conditions on the ground but  not according to political circumstances.    Asked about reports of internal party arrangements in  preparation for a settlement, Shaykh Qasim pointed out that the  party is basically against a settlement. We are wagering on the  failure of that settlement, he said, adding: We believe the  settlement involves enough complications and pressure to hinder  many of its aspects. Failure is a possibility like all other  possibilities. As for our internal situation, our structure  considers every possible action under different circumstances  based on maintaining the basic principles. There are no plans  to rearrange the party and we believe there is no need to make  such changes later, he emphasized.    Shaykh Qasim believes that talks are immobile and that no  progress has been made along any of the tracks except the  Palestinian 'Arafatist track. He remarked that Israel is  confused because it believes in the need to make major  concessions in view of the capability of the Resistance, the  Syrian stance, and the position of the opposed Palestinian  factions. This can embarrass Israel into making concessions.  It is trying to avoid this because it wants to conclude  separate deals similar to Gaza and Jericho and its appendix in  the Cairo Agreement. Such deals would empty the various tracks  of their meaning. Facing difficulties, particularly on the  Syrian-Lebanese track, Israel tends to make threats of war then  cry wolf to influence the public and thus find a justification.    Shaykh Na'im Qasim continued: We believe the negotiations  are immobile. There are many obstacles and we do not know how  they will develop. Man must occasionally monitor the situation  to assess each phase in light of developments. But, he said, no  matter how easy things might be, we do not believe the  settlement will be achieved in full or that the occupation  problem will end.</p>

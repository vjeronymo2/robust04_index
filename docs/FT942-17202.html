			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Anxious faces in the queue for the market: A look at the glut of property groups seeking flotation The heavy pounding taken by property shares in recent weeks has sent a tremor through property companies lining up to join the stock market. Until recently, 1994 promised to be a record year for property flotations. Argent Group, which plans a Pounds 150m flotation in May, is the latest of nearly a dozen companies to announce an intention to join the stock market. Brokers estimate that a clutch of other flotation candidates could add several hundred million pounds to the sector's capitalisation. But enthusiasm for some of these new issues may be muted. The glut of companies joining the market, together with a fall of just over 16 per cent in property share values since the start of February, means that a successful flotation is no longer assured. The recent public offer for Capital Shopping Centres, which specialises in regional shopping centres, was only 14.4 per cent subscribed by the public. The experience of Capital Shopping Centres, which priced its shares at an ambitious 13 per cent premium to net asset value, is already to prompting flotation candidates to scale down offer prices. Capital's issue price was 230p, and yesterday the shares closed at 210p - giving it a market value of Pounds 758m. Rugby Estates reduced its new share issue by Pounds 5m, and its initial market capitalisation has fallen by one third to Pounds 20m. As a result, its biggest shareholder, Hillsdown, has decided not to sell. But these experiences may not deter the directors of private companies intent on raising new funds and realising part of their investment. Joining the stock market offers their companies greater flexibility in fund raising, enabling them to take advantage of development opportunities. The freedom of manoeuvre tends to be greater than with bank finance, which is typically restricted to relatively high quality property. Moreover, property shares are still highly valued by historic standards. Although shares are no longer trading at a premium to net asset value, the current average discount of about 3 per cent may still seem attractive when compared with the average discount of more than 20 per cent over the past 10 years. 'Property paper is worth more than two years ago. There is a feel-good factor,' says a director of one company contemplating a float. But not all those joining the market can expect to be well received. 'When there is demand for the property sector, anything goes. But there is only a limited demand for these new issues,' says one analyst. As investors become jaded by the quantity of paper being released, companies are increasingly emphasising their distinguishing features. Several of the newcomers to the market are long-established players. Capital Shopping Centres has been in existence for 25 years; London City Holdings has risen from the ashes of Randsworth Trust; Chelsfield, which joined the market in December, is run by Mr Elliott Bernerd, one of the industry's best-known figures. A few of the companies have distinguished themselves by investing heavily during the downturn: Argent Group built up assets of more than Pounds 200m during the recession. Other companies have tried to carve out a marketing niche. LCH has West End assets, Fiscal Properties has a portfolio let entirely to government tenants and Rugby Estates a management intensive approach. But even companies with a coherent strategy or a visible management record will have to contend with general malaise in the sector. Property shares have fallen further than the rest of the market, as investors wonder if they have been over-optimistic about rising property yields. Uncertainty in the bond market could slow the rise in property values, as movements in property yields have recently been closely allied to movements in bond yields. The property market's vulnerability to falls in bond values will be particularly pronounced if rental growth takes longer than expected to emerge. Many other companies will find they have to work hard to persuade investors of the quality of their management and assets. Kleinwort Benson says a number of companies likely to seek flotations have been overgeared and need shareholders' money to solve their cash flow problem. 'Their portfolios will be historical accidents and not necessarily suited to the 1990s,' it says. Investors' caution is increased by the lacklustre performance of a number of existing small quoted companies which have indifferent managements and high overheads. This poor record calls into question the value of the present rush of flotations, according to Mr Marc Gilbard of Goldman Sachs. 'The sector needed to consolidate rather than expand,' he says.</p>

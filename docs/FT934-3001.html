			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Birkby shows sharp advance to Pounds 581,000 Steady progress in its three key business areas enabled Birkby, which is involved in the provision of managed workspace, vehicle hire and instalment credit, to lift interim profits from Pounds 204,000 to Pounds 581,000 pre-tax. The results for the six months to end-September included a three months' contribution from Hill Hire, the full benefit of which will be apparent in the second half. They also took account of an exceptional provision of Pounds 525,000 relating to the disposal of New Range Systems. Turnover was Pounds 5.24m (Pounds 2.2m). The interim dividend is lifted to 1.2p (1p) from earnings of 6.6p (4.8p). Directors intend to recommend a 'substantially increased' final dividend should the current positive level of trading continue.</p>

"All this, however, is reminiscent of the corresponding  period in the history of the Ukrainian People's Republic. If  Ukraine really gives up its nuclear weapons by being promised  some mythical compensation, and not just gives them up, but  removes its weapons to Russian territory, it will be a step that  will be conducive to the liquidation of Ukraine's statehood."</p>

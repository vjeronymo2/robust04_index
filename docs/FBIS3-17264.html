			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Gromak: "Lithuanians Promise To Continue </F> Housing Construction in Kaliningrad"]    [Text] A meeting has been held in Vilnius between  Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius and Admiral  Vladimir Yegorov, commander of the Baltic Fleet, and Yuriy  Matochkin, chief of the Kaliningrad Oblast administration.    The sides examined a question of extreme important both for  the Baltic Fleet command and for the Kaliningrad Oblast  administration: the construction by the Lithuanian "Selma"  association of housing for the units which are being withdrawn  from the Baltic states. As KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has already  described, after the Lithuanian special services had arrested  "Selma" President Vladas Laurinavicius, to whom the Russian  Federation defense minister was to have presented, during a trip  to Kaliningrad, the Russian Government's directive stipulating  the terms for extinguishing our debt to the firm, the  construction has been threatened with disruption.    On the day we arrived in Vilnius the Lithuanian newspapers  published a series of articles about the scandal involving the  "Selma" president's arrest. RESPUBLIKA, for instance, published  a photograph of Laurinavicius with the following caption:  "Search among military and their business partners." LIETUVOS  RYTAS had "Russian Generals Make Strategic Withdrawals," and so  forth.    "The Lithuanian side's position is unequivocal," Prime  Minister Adolfas Slezevicius stated repeatedly at the talks.  "We shall continue the construction." As for the arrest of  "Selma's" general director, Lithuania's general prosecutor,  Arturas Paulauskas, gave the following explanation: "When  Laurinavicius' apartment was searched TNT was discovered. He  was arrested. I saw the TNT, there are little holes in which a  charge can be inserted...." Actually this explanation from the  general prosecutor made even Jonas Gyachas, deputy minister of  national defense, smile....    At the meeting Yuriy Semenovich Matochkin raised a question  which is a painful one for the oblast today -- the question of  the transit of freight transport across Lithuania. These and  other questions will be discussed in Kaliningrad 24 March when a  working group headed by Lithuanian Deputy Foreign Minister  Vladislav Domarkas will arrive here.    And here is the official assessment of the meeting.  Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius:    "`Selma' is carrying out a very large program of  construction  in Kaliningrad. The first contract concluded between the  Russian Armed Forces leadership and the Lithuanian Government  has already been fulfilled. Now a commercial contract is being  fulfilled with the `Selma' association. The arrest of `Selma's'  president worried Minister Mr. Grachev and the Kaliningrad  Oblast and Baltic Fleet leadership. That is why today's meeting  was necessary. We confirmed that the Lithuanian Government will  make every effort to ensure that the construction of residential  regions in Kaliningrad does not cease."    Yuriy Matochkin, head of the Kaliningrad Oblast  administration:    "The aim of our trip is to convince ourselves that the  incident involving the arrest of the `Selma' president should in  no way influence working relations between Kaliningrad Oblast  and the Lithuanian Republic, that the construction of the  residential region in which the inhabitants of the oblast and  the Lithuanians working on the construction site are both  interested should not stop. I note with satisfaction that here  we have encountered the understanding of Mr. prime minister."    Admiral Vladimir Yegorov, commander of the Baltic Fleet:    "`Selma' is constructing for us on credit. The fleet's debts  to the association are about 3 billion rubles. For us it is  important to retain the pace of construction and increase it in  the future. And we are very distressed that this incident  involving `Selma' President Vladas Laurinavicius has  occurred...."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marica Lalovic from Sarajevo] </F>   [Text] Lieutenant General Ratko Mladic, commander of the  army of the Sr pska republic, held talks in Lukavica today with  General Michael Rose, commander of UNPROFOR [United Nations  Protection Forces] for the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, about  strengthening the peace in Sarajevo. The two commanders also  talked about further controlling the weapons in and around  Sarajevo, particularly the Muslim weapons, as the Muslim side  has still not fully complied with the agreement on putting its  weapons under UNPROFOR's control. By the way, as Rasim Delic,  commander of the so-called Muslim army, did not show up, the  meeting of military commanders of the Serbian and Muslim armies  that should have been held in Sarajevo today did not take place.  Michael Rose tried to excuse Delic's failure to come to the  meeting with his being busy establishing peace, as he put it,  for his people in central Bosnia.</p>

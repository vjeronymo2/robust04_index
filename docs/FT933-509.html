			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Bosnian Moslems insist on land for peace LEADERS of the Bosnian Moslem community yesterday endorsed the principle of ethnic partition for Bosnia but rejected the partition map proposed under the latest peace plans, and insisted that Moslem territories seized by force should be returned. This conditional acceptance left unclear whether Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's president, would now sign the peace plan and try to negotiate for more land - or hold out for land concessions from his Serb adversaries before approving the proposal to divide Bosnia into three ethnic mini-states. Serb leaders have repeatedly refused to hand over any more land, threatening instead to rout their out-gunned Moslem opponents on the battlefield. Sarajevo radio said 218 of 349 Moslems, including writers, religious leaders and politicians, voted for conditional acceptance. Fifty-three voted to accept the plan without any preconditions, and 78 voted against. The 'qualified yes' decision of the Moslem leadership, during the first exclusively Moslem political assembly, was non-binding. But it was expected to sway the Bosnian parliament, which yesterday adjourned a meeting until today. The prominent Moslems, in raising objections to the failure of the latest version of the partition plan to restore mostly Moslem territory, set no deadline for when the 'ethnically cleansed' land should be returned. Mr Izetbegovic may be hoping that severe United Nations sanctions will prod his Serb foes into more land concessions. UN sanctions have been in force for 16 months. Western diplomats yesterday said the vote was a setback to the peace process, but suggested that the result was a face-saving solution, allowing the Moslem leaders to appease radical elements while leaving the door open for a further agreement. Although diplomats say an outright rejection by the Moslems could endanger a pledge to deploy Nato troops in Bosnia, British and French officials yesterday indicated that a 'sign now, negotiate later' solution could still pave the way for the deployment of peacekeepers. But in an ominous note for the new Bosnian state, Mr Izetbegovic earlier yesterday called on the Bosnian army to defend the integrity of Bosnia after Mr Fikret Abdic, a local powerbroker from the north-western Bihac pocket, had apparently orchestrated his 400-member assembly to declare an 'Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia'. The area, although encircled by Serbs rebels in Croatia and Bosnia, has managed to survive the war by trading with its enemies. Meanwhile, in Belgrade, the ruling Socialist party lashed out at the ultra-nationalist leader, Mr Vojislav Seselj, after he proposed a vote of no-confidence in the government of Mr Slobodan Milosevic. A party statement described Mr Seselj, once Mr Milosevic's favourite politician and a parliamentary deputy, as the 'personification of evil' who embodied primitivism. The Croatian president, Mr Franjo Tudjman, yesterday met the UN Security Council in New York to present his demand that the UN peacekeepers should either disarm the Serb rebel forces in Croatia or withdraw completely. Mr Tudjman warned the General Assembly later that Croatia would terminate the UN mission by the end of November, if its mandate was not strengthened within the next 48 hours. But UN officials insisted that the peacekeepers could not be expected to forcibly disarm the Serb rebels, who currently control about a third of Croatia's territory.</p>

			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / IBM drags itself out of the mire / Assessing Lou Gerstner's first year at the helm of computer company Twelve months after his appointment as chairman and chief executive of International Business Machines, Mr Lou Gerstner is 'increasingly confident' that the ailing computer company's problems can eventually be overcome. The tough-talking New Yorker is not, however, holding out hopes of a return to the glory days of the 'old IBM', when the company dominated the information technology industry and reaped huge profits on its flagship mainframe computers. He bluntly points to IBM's ingrained bureaucratic culture as the root cause of the company's heavy losses over the past three years. IBM is 'too pre-occupied with our own view of the world', he says, telling employees that they must change the way they work if they are to have a future with the company. Without much fanfare, Mr Gerstner has, in his first year at IBM, restructured the higher management, appointed 'outsiders' to top positions and, through attrition, reshaped the board of directors. Few of these actions have caught public attention, largely because Mr Gerstner prefers it that way. A newcomer to the computer industry, he is disconcerted by the interest that IBM attracts. 'I don't give a lot of speeches,' he says. 'My choice in everything is to say nothing and go do it.' Before a meeting with financial analysts in New York last week when he outlined his strategic plans for the company, Mr Gerstner discussed his first year at IBM. The company has been through 'an economic shock the equivalent of a Los Angeles earthquake', he said. Its gross profit margins fell from more than 55 per cent in 1990 to 38 per cent last year. 'When you multiply that drop by revenues of over Dollars 62bn (Pounds 42m), you understand what has happened to this company.' IBM 'no longer makes a lot of money on mainframe computers', he said. 'High mainframe (profit) margins are gone' - a thing of the past. 'No IBM margins are ever going to return to the levels we used to have, at least we are not planning on it.' Neither does he expect to replace mainframe profits with a new high margin product. 'We do not have as part of our game plan to create a dominant position that is built on very, very high prices relative to costs,' said Mr Gerstner. 'We are forcing ourselves to adopt a pessimistic view,' he said, declining to predict IBM's long-term financial outlook. 'We are draining a swamp here. We are not focused on the picnic grounds across the meadow.' Cutting costs was Mr Gerstner's first priority when he joined IBM and he won praise from financial analysts for moving decisively, last July, with a Dollars 8.9bn restructuring charge including the cost of 35,000 job cuts, to be completed by the end of 1995. Based on current business conditions, IBM does not anticipate further lay-offs. However, Mr Gerstner sees a 'goldmine' of other opportunities to cut IBM's costs through centralising purchasing, tighter inventory management, and eliminating duplication of effort in product development. He has formed several re-engineering task forces with the goal of reducing costs by Dollars 3bn this year and a further Dollars 1bn in 1995. The second item on Mr Gerstner's 'must do' list for his first year at IBM was to 'get closer to customers'. In this area he also wins high marks. 'I've seen a dramatic change in the way IBM sells technology. Its a big, big difference,' says Mr Bo Hedfors, senior vice-president of systems and technology at Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications and electronics group. Moves to lower prices for hardware and software have helped customer relations, Mr Gerstner acknowledges, but he takes credit for meeting with 'literally thousands and thousands of customers' over the past 12 months. These contacts prompted him to accelerate the retraining of IBM's sales team. Traditionally IBM's 'blue suits' have been generalists, selling everything from mainframe computers to printer ribbons. To compete more effectively with the likes of Sun Microsystems in the workstation market, or Compaq Computer in personal computers, IBM is now forming product specialist sales groups and consulting teams. However, two other important goals set by Mr Gerstner when he joined IBM are proving more difficult to achieve: setting strategic directions and restoring employee morale. The new IBM chairman has been widely criticised over recent months for failing to deliver a new 'vision' for IBM. He brought much of this criticism on himself by declaring in July that 'the last thing IBM needs right now is a vision'. 'That was like telling the passengers on a rudderless ship, to keep shovelling coal into the engine and not worry about the direction they are sailing in,' says Mr Bob Djurdjevic, president of Annex Research, a market research group. At the meeting with analysts, Mr Gerstner revealed only what he called the 'broad brush-strokes' of IBM's strategy. The company plans to unveil more details about its various product segments over the coming months, a senior IBM executive said. Still, many analysts were disappointed. The most important 'strategic imperative', Mr Gerstner said, was to exploit IBM's technology better than in the past. Although the company has invented many of the basic technologies used in the computer industry, it has often seen competitors take advantage of them faster. To speed technology to market, IBM will 'make bets earlier' on which technologies to develop, eliminating costly duplication and the 'great debates within IBM over alternative solutions' that have slowed product introductions in the past, he said. But this could increase IBM's risks of backing the wrong horse and eliminate some of the competitive advantages that the company has previously gained from its bigger size and resources. IBM is also expanding its efforts to license technology to other companies, rather than seeing it cloned. Royalty income from licensing agreements has doubled in the past two years to almost Dollars 500m. All of these profits can be ploughed back into research, Mr Gerstner says. He has also accelerated a 'massive redeployment of development money' away from mainframe computers towards development of technology and software for client/server computers and networks. IBM's failure to make this shift earlier 'is the single most important mistake IBM has made in the past decade', acknowledged Mr Gerstner. The company is overhauling its entire product line to meet growing demands for networked computers that stick to industry standards. Mr Gerstner must also demolish the rule-bound culture that many say prevents IBM from adapting more quickly to changes in the computer market. Over the past 12 months, Mr Gerstner has spent 'hundreds and hundreds of hours meeting with tens of thousands of employees all over the world'. A disciple of Mr Jack Welch, the chairman of General Electric, who invigorated that company's stodgy culture, Mr Gerstner has been sending shock waves through IBM with frank addresses to employees. 'We don't move fast enough in this company,' he chided on a visit to one US site. 'This is an industry in which success goes to the swift, more than to the smart. 'We've got to become more nimble, entrepreneurial, focused, customer driven. We must become a principle-based company, rather than a procedural-based company.' However, cultural changes must start at the top, says Mr John Jones, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, the US broking house. He praises Mr Gerstner's appointments of 'outsiders' to top positions, in particular the choice of Mr Jerry York, formerly of Chrysler, as chief financial officer. 'York is the kind of executive that IBM needs; somebody who will ask the tough questions and not accept the historic explanations for lack of performance.' But analysts say that Mr Gerstner needs to recruit more fresh blood. Most of Mr Gerstner's inner circle are long-time IBM executives. However, their roles within the company have been changed. Mr Jim Cannavino, long known as a maverick within the company, has been put in charge of strategy and development. Ms Ellen Hancock, who heads IBM's networking division, is also now spearheading software strategy for the whole company. IBM's executive management committee, long the centre of power within the company, has been eliminated. In its place is the new corporate executive committee, comprising Mr Gerstner and 10 other executives, which meets several times a month to discuss strategy. In addition, a worldwide management council, with about 35 members including the heads of each product division and managers of regional operations, covers operational as well as strategic issues. The IBM board of directors, loudly criticised at last year's shareholder meeting for blindly approving decisions that led the company astray, has been slimmed down over the past year. Since Mr Gerstner's appointment, 10 of the 19 board members who appointed him have retired, or will do so next month. Yet only one new board member has been added: Mr Charles Knight, chairman of Emerson Electric. 'Moulding a new board of directors is just as important as making internal changes if Gerstner's vision of tomorrow is to become reality,' says Mr Djurdjevic. IBM needs to add directors representing constituencies such as its customers outside the US, he says. 'The job is only half done.' Most analysts award Mr Gerstner a 'gentleman's B' for his first year's performance at IBM. He has started well, they say, but failed to complete all his assignments. His lack of knowledge of the computer industry and technology is still evident, but he has clearly grasped IBM's problems. The critical test will be IBM's financial performance over the next few quarters.</p>

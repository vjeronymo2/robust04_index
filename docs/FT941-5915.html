			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Philippines inflation up Inflation in the Philippines rose towards the end of 1993, partly because of the easing of state support for the central bank following a law that created a more independent monetary institution, a central bank official said, Reuter reports from Manila. The government had eased its support for the bank's liquidity management since passage of the Central Bank Act. This led to heavy withdrawals of state deposits in the bank, contributing to an expansion in money supply that fuelled inflation, the official said. The annualised inflation rate, as measured by the consumer price index, rose to 8.4 per cent in December last year after hitting a low of 6.6 per cent in June and averaging 7.6 in the same year. Inflation was 8.2 per cent in January 1993.</p>

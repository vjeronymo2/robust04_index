			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] ANC [African National Congress] supporters have  slammed the nomination of former House of Delegates Chairman  J.N. Reddy to the ANC's list of candidates to the National  Assembly. A mass meeting in Durban, called by the Natal Indian  Congress to explain the reasons behind the nomination, failed to  convince the ANC supporters. They demanded that Dr. Reddy and  former Natal MEC [Member Executive Committee], D.S. Rajah, be  removed from the list on the grounds that they had been part of  an oppressive system that had played no role in making life  better for the masses. Dr. Reddy will make an announcement on  his nomination today.</p>

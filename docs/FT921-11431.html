			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Japan's PM announces further defence review JAPAN is considering cuts in its defence forces, in response to the end of the Cold War and the reductions in US and former Soviet military forces, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, announced to the Diet late this week, Stefan Wagstyl writes from Tokyo. He said the Defence Agency had started a review of personnel and hardware, which could lead to cuts in the mid-1990s. Japan has already reduced planned increases in defence spending by delaying the introduction of new weapons and other measures. The government is proposing to raise defence spending in the financial year starting in April by just 3.8 per cent - the lowest increase in over 30 years. However, Mr Miyazawa, regarded as a dove in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, has often indicated that he would like Japan to respond more clearly to the end of the Cold War. He said in a policy speech at the opening of the Diet last week that the current 1991-95 defence programme had been decided in late 1990, but that even since then there had been major changes in the international situation, including the dissolution of the Soviet Union. On Tuesday, he said the review, the first to be carried out since Japan began a defence build-up in 1976, and slated for 1993, had already started. It will include regulations covering the size of the defence forces. The 1976 regulations specify that the army should have around 180,000 troops, the navy 60 anti-submarine ships and 16 submarines and the air force about 430 aircraft. Mr Koichi Kato, the chief cabinet secretary, said the aim of the review would be a reduction of the stipulated manpower levels. For the army, or Ground Self Defence Force, a cut in the stipulated level may have little effect since, due to recruitment difficulties, it can now muster only about 153,000 troops. Nevertheless, to consider cuts is a significant step for the Defence Agency which has until recently been supervising a build-up in Japan's defence forces. Any cuts are likely to be preceded by long arguments between the services, government ministries and politicians. The timing of Mr Miyazawa's announcement has itself as much to do with domestic Japanese politics as with the end of the Cold War. He needs the support of the centrist Komei party to smooth the passage of the budget bill through the Diet. Komei has demanded defence spending cuts. Mr Miyazawa's offer of a long-term review of spending is being seen in Tokyo as a peace offering to Komei.</p>

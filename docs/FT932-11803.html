			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (13): Manufacturers under scrutiny  -EC Pricing Debate THE investigation of carmakers' pricing policies across Europe is set to intensify over the next two years. In mid-1995, the present 10-year 'block exemption', which controversially allows car makers to use a selective dealer distribution system in contravention of European Community competition rules, is due to expire. The industry has been given due warning by the EC competition directorate, that a renewal of the block exemption will depend importantly on car manufacturers' performance in conforming with EC limits on car price differentials across Europe. The block exemption granted in 1985 was conditional in part on car prices between member states not differing by more than 12 per cent in the long-term or by more than 18 per cent for periods of less than a year. A landmark will be reached later this month, when carmakers publish for the first time comparative EC price lists for selected new cars under a plan agreed with the European Commission. Publication of the price lists is aimed at helping car buyers to shop for bargains across EC borders. The price lists, agreed while Sir Leon Brittan was still the EC competition commissioner, are aimed at increasing the pressure on manufacturers to bring car prices more into line throughout the EC and to make it more difficult for car dealers to discriminate against foreign buyers. The price lists, to be published twice a year, will contain the recommended retail prices, both including and excluding taxes, of one standard-equipment volume model in each segment of the car market. The information will contain prices for all EC member states except for Denmark and Greece which have been excluded because of their excessively high tax levels. The lists will include details on the most significant options such as air-conditioning, automatic gearbox, power steering and anti-lock braking systems, as well as for right-hand drive, and warranty conditions, delivery costs and roadside assistance. The Commission's plan for the biannual publication of price lists is not legally binding but EC officials have indicated that if carmakers do not co-operate they will risk losing their jealously-guarded right to operate the selective distribution system. Prices, published in May and November every year, will be shown both before and after tax, in Ecu and in local currency. The Commission dropped its original demand that manufacturers should supply information about all possible models and options on the grounds that it would be too time-consuming for manufacturers and confusing for consumers. During 1992, the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission and the European Commission both published reports on car prices in Europe. The reports failed to remove widespread confusion over price differences, but the EC report in particular drew attention to many specific cases where price differentials had exceeded the block exemption guidelines. According to a survey published late last year by Beuc, the European consumers' organisation, the prices of certain new models can differ by more than 40 per cent between countries. Manufacturers point out that prices are mostly within the 12 per cent band recommended by the Commission. The pricing debate has been widened beyond Europe by a report from Ludvigsen Associates, the UK-based automotive analysts, which claims that whatever the price differences within Europe, European car buyers in general are paying as much as 30 per cent more for new cars than consumers in the US and in Japan. Ludvigsen Associates, which carried out the basic research for the MMC inquiry in the UK, claims that 'the European car buyer is spending more than he should for personal transportation' both in absolute terms and in relation to household income. The report was the first co-ordinated attempt to compare car prices between Europe and the other leading world markets, the US and Japan. According to the study, the largest differences are with car prices in Japan. It claims that European car prices (net of tax) are 33 to 43 per cent higher than equivalent prices in Japan, while European prices are 15 to 45 per cent higher than in the US. On average, it takes 27 weeks of gross family income for a European to buy a car, compared with 21 weeks in America and 15 weeks in Japan. The UK is at the European average, while the Germans, French and Belgians need four weeks less. Much of the unrest over car prices has been generated in the UK, but some of the heat has been taken out of the debate by the uncomfortable combination of recession and last September's devaluation of the pound, which have contrived to bring UK prices much more into line with the rest of the EC. A report published in March by Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US, claims that new car prices in the UK are now lower than in several other European markets. The study, prepared by management consultants A. T. Kearney, renewed the motor industry's attack on earlier research undertaken by European consumer groups into pan-European car prices for failing to take into account many of the factors that influence car price variations across the European Community. GM maintains that the price variations that do exist, can be attributed mainly to: Exchange rate variations of 15 per cent or more over a 12-month period; Discount variations of up to 10 per cent of list prices between countries; Equipment specification variations of up to 17 per cent between countries; Tax rate variations ranging from rates of 15 per cent up to 213 per cent; and Differences in finance benefits that can create list price variations of up to 11 per cent between countries. Publication by Vauxhall of the new A. T. Kearney study was aimed at trying to head off action by the UK government to force car manufacturers to change some of the more controversial terms of their franchise agreements with dealers. Carmakers in the UK have rebuffed the request made to them last year by the Office of Fair Trading to change some of the more restrictive terms of their franchise agreements. The changes had been recommended in a report published early last year by the MMC following its investigation into UK car prices. The requested changes would, for example, allow a dealer to acquire competing dealerships within his existing territory. They would also remove limits on a dealer's freedom to advertise outside his territory, or to acquire dealerships from other carmakers outside his territory. Carmakers operating in the UK have been reluctant to grant the changes sought by the OFT, however, in case such a move should undermine their position when the block exemption is renegotiated with the European Commission. Franchise agreements in some other EC countries are more restrictive than in the UK.</p>

			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A BIRD IN THE LENS IS WORTH A NIGHT IN THE BLIND  </P> <P> Hunched in a makeshift photography blind, 70 feet from a roost tree, I aimed a  camera with a 200-to-500-millimeter zoom lens at a group of about 15 bald  eagles.  </P> <P> It was snowing hard, and the snow was being blown into the blind. Every few  minutes I had to turn the camera and clear snow out of the lens hood.  </P> <P> The dawn temperature was about 11 degrees and, although well-layered, I began  to shiver. Putting photography on hold, I took a swig of hot tea from a  thermos.  </P> <P> It had taken almost eight hours to drive the 360 miles from Oakland to Tule  Lake in northeastern California, and almost two hours to climb the steep,  snow-covered mile up to Sheepy Ridge in Tule Lake National Wildlife Refuge.  </P> <P> But when you enjoy wildlife photography and you've lived most of your life on  the East Coast and have never seen a bald eagle in the wild, you're motivated.  </P> <P> So I picked up a set of chains for the car, rented the camera lens for a week,  bought plenty of film and set off to see the largest concentration of wintering  bald eagles in the lower 48 states.  </P> <P> Eagles keep returning to Tule Lake because it's a funnel for huge numbers of  waterfowl on the Pacific Flyway. Many waterfowl die from natural and man-made  causes, providing easy pickings for the eagles.  </P> <P> They prefer fish, but will gladly accept an easier meal -- a scavenging trait  that caused Ben Franklin to object to making the bald eagle our national  symbol.  </P> <P> As a result, between December and March about 500 bald eagles journey annually  from Alaska to the warmer and abundant feeding grounds of northeastern  California and south-central Oregon.  </P> <P> For 10 years the Audubon Society has sponsored an annual conference on the bald  eagle that has drawn professional and amateur naturalists from throughout the  nation.  </P> <P> The 11th annual Klamath Basin Bald Eagle Conference will be held in nearby  Klamath Falls, Ore., in February. There will be workshops, a photo contest,  field trips and a banquet. (Contact the Klamath Basin Audubon Society at  503-883-5732 for registration information.)  </P> <P> I was in the blind for about four hours. It was basically a rock structure  covered with brush and canvas. Judging from its condition, it had also served  as the supply depot for every rodent in the area.  </P> <P> I had planned this photo expedition carefully, remembering film, (I prefer ASA  64 to minimize grain, while giving enough speed to allow the use of faster  shutter speeds to stop any action), an extra camera battery, a cable release, a  tripod to support the long lens, a thermos of hot water, tea bags, food and  warm gloves.  </P> <P> The other thing I took, which in some ways was more important than any of the  above, was information.  </P> <P> The day before I had met a very helpful U.S. Forest Service ranger who pointed  out the roost tree from the road that passes below Sheepy Ridge.  </P> <P> A permit is required to use any of the photo blinds at Tule Lake (get one at  the headquarters building the day before your excursion), which, in addition to  the north and south blinds on Sheepy Ridge, include two other more accessible  ones near the lake and a third area where tent blinds are permitted.  </P> <P> During December, January and February, you have to be in the blinds before 7  a.m. to minimize disturbance to the eagles.  </P> <P> The blinds on Sheepy Ridge are by far the best vantage points. You'll be hiking  in the dark, rising at least 1,000 feet on a trail you blaze yourself. Toting  30-plus pounds of pack, it was no picnic.  </P> <P> The snow was up to my knees in places and the rocks beneath could only be  guessed at.  </P> <P> It was a truly tough hike, and you should be in good physical condition before  attempting it.  </P> <P> The south blind is just right for one person, but as the refuge instruction  sheet points out: "Two people can work from this blind, but you have to be  friends."  </P> <P> It is quite dark, so you may need a flashlight to read your meter and find your  tea bags. And because the blind is nearly level with the top of the roost tree,  the eagles can be sensitive to your presence.  </P> <P> Because of this, the refuge staff advises against using a motor-drive camera  and recommends at least a 300-millimeter lens.  </P> <P> But I found that even a 500mm lens was not enough, and next time I'll try to  rent a 600mm to fill more of the 35mm film frame.  </P> <P> A fast lens with a maximum aperture of F/4 or wider is preferable but not  absolutely necessary, because the birds are flying in and out of the area all  day and the light is sufficient.  </P> <P> But in the early morning and early evening a fast lens would be great. Such a  lens would also allow you to use faster shutter speeds and slower film to catch  any action, with less grain on the final slide or print.  </P> <P> Even with the advice of the ranger, it took almost 30 minutes to find the blind  once I reached the roost tree. It's very well camouflaged and tucked under a  pine tree about 70 feet south of the tree.  </P> <P> On the third day, I tried to find the other Sheepy Ridge blind but was  unsuccessful. Again the ranger had pointed it out, but was, herself, mistaken  in its location.  </P> <P> The hike that day was particularly long and steep, and as it turned out,  extremely frustrating. So check and recheck where the blinds are before making  the climb.  </P> <P> Remember, too, that since you'll be parking your car in the dark, on the day  before you plan to photograph, mark the mileage from the refuge headquarters  building to your photo site, as well as other landmarks.  </P> <P> The blinds are just south of Hotel Rock, a monolith of crags and peaks the  eagles perch upon as they survey the feeding grounds below.  </P> <P> Whether you just drive around the refuge's auto route (where you'll also see  several species of hawks, as well as herons, egrets, ring-necked pheasants and  Canada geese, not to mention coyote and mule deer) or you make the trek up to  Sheepy Ridge, you will see, and possibly photograph, bald eagles.  </P> <P> And once you watch that magnificent bird in the wild, you may make this trip a  yearly migration of your own.  </P> <P> To get to the Tule Lake National Wildlife Refuge from Los Angeles take  Interstate 5 north past Redding and Mt. Shasta to Weed, then take California 97  north to 161 east. Drive until reaching Hill Road and the sign for the refuge  headquarters to the right.  </P> <P> Take Hill Road four miles to the headquarters on the right, just past East-West  Road. The headquarters has an excellent interpretive museum, lots of  information and a six-minute slide show.  </P> <P> As for accommodations, there are two motels in the town of Tule Lake and  several in the small city of Klamath Falls, Ore., about a 30-minute drive  north.  </P> <P> Also, there's a year-round campground in Lava Beds National Monument just south  of the wildlife refuge.  </P></p>

			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Books: A writer driven by prophetic fury - Anthony Curtis reviews a new biography of Richard Hughes RICHARD HUGHES: A BIOGRAPHY by Richard Perceval Graves Andre Deutsch Pounds 20, 491 pages After getting off to a promising start as a young writer with poems, plays, children's stories and the first ever radio drama, Richard Hughes became a celebrity in 1929 with High Wind in Jamaica. It was acclaimed by critics on both sides of the Atlantic and by fellow-novelists such as Virginia Woolf and Ford Madox Ford. In this rich biography Richard Graves implies that some of its success was owed to Clough Williams-Ellis's wife Amabel (nee Strachey) who told Hughes he must put some sex in it - which he duly did. Graves quotes a comment Hughes made recalling his next novel In Hazard. It appeared after a ten year hiatus during which Hughes did extensive research into storm conditions at sea. It is regularly compared to Conrad's Typhoon: 'I was carried along in my writing of it by a kind of prophetic fury, seeing so clearly the abyss Europe was about to be sucked down into by war, and wanting to tell people it would be fearful, but they were going to come through.' Publication of In Hazard in 1938 brought the first phase of Hughes's career to a close. Aged 40 when war broke out, he was drafted into the Admiralty for the duration. The Welsh writer became the very model of a modern civil servant whose work paved the way for the Normandy landings. Up to then Hughes had lived his life eschewing any kind of fixed employment apart from writing. After being head boy of Charterhouse, and up at Oxford in the orbit of TE Lawrence, Masefield and Robert Graves, uncle of the biographer, Hughes had retired to a primitive cottage in rural Wales to become a writer. But he did not stay there; he travelled dangerously far and wide. The biography admirably draws together the many adventurous threads that went into such a comparatively small body of work. We follow Hughes going steerage to New York and suffering the indignities of an immigrant's incarceration on Ellis Island. We see him among Croatian nationalists in the Balkans. On the personal level we observe the effect of the deaths of his father and beloved sister; his difficult relations with his possessive mother; his first great affair with Nancy Stallibrass who was to marry his friend Peter Quennell. And then his happy but not untrammelled marriage to Frances Bazley, daughter of a baronet, with whom he raised a large family. As he matured Hughes became deeply religious, committedly Welsh and a staunch defender of causes in which he believed. He settled happily into the role of 'Seigneur' of the North Wales village of Laugharne where he and his wife lived before the war. It was the Hugheses who were responsible for Dylan and Caitlin Thomas descending upon that village and ultimately giving it the tourist attraction status it now has. Hughes was as bookish as he was out-going. He accumulated a vast library relating to the Nazis and made many post-war visits to Germany for The Fox and its sequel The Wooden Shepherdess. In these novels the demoniac figure of Hitler is paired with that of a blind German nun modelled in her saintliness on St Theresa of Lisieux and observed by the Welsh aristocrat Augustine, a persona of Hughes himself. Hughes knew exactly what was to happen in the subsequent narrative but because of his perfectionism the chances of completing the work in further volumes were slim. 'It is a race with the undertaker' he joked. He died aged 76 as old as the century having sadly lost that race. Graves's excellent biography, which appears alongside new paperback editions of the novels from Harvill, should herald a revival of interest in what remains a remarkable contribution to the modern English novel.</p>

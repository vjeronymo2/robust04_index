			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Inventive ways with financing - In a Nutshell A tough fund-raising climate is forcing venture capital companies to become ever more inventive in obtaining finance. Baronsmead, a medium-sized, independent venture firm, has devised a funding programme which draws on investors' money on a deal-by-deal basis and allows investors to withdraw at any time. The Direct Equity Programme will also allow investors to choose, within reason, the companies their money is invested in. Baronsmead will take a 20 per cent stake in any capital gain and also 20 per cent of income received from investments. It expects this share in income to amount to about 2 per cent of invested funds, against the 2-2 1/2 per cent management fee normally calculated on funds under management. Two investors, the Merseyside Superannuation Fund and GRE Asset Management, have put up more than Pounds 5m, though investments of between Pounds 500,000 and Pounds 1m will be more typical. Baronsmead, which has Pounds 60m under management, initially started a conventional fund-raising drive, but switched to what it believes is a more flexible programme. Investors may withdraw before or even after their funds have been invested, though this may require Baronsmead to dispose of investments at short notice.</p>

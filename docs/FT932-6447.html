			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Bathing beauties caught for Dollars 2.5m SIR LAWRENCE Alma-Tadema's 'The Baths of Caracalla', one of the great late-Victorian genre paintings, sold for Dollars 2.5m (Pounds 1.62m) at Sotheby's in New York on Wednesday, a record price for the artist and way above estimate. Depicting three beauties against the backdrop of a scrupulous representation of the ancient baths in Rome, it was the artist's favourite painting. The sale was the highlight of a successful auction of 19th century art which totalled Dollars 9.8m, with 78 per cent sold by value. Another artist to set a record price was the Frenchman William Bouguereau, whose 1875 painting of the Virgin with the Infant Jesus and St John sold for Dollars 690,000. An auction of American pictures at Christie's brought in Dollars 10.5m, with 75 per cent sold. A bronze equestrian group by Frederic Remington of a cavalryman wounded by Indians fetched Dollars 1.98m. The growing international sweep of the art market was shown at auctions this week in London, Dublin and Geneva as well as New York, while Christie's held its first sale in Singapore, bringing in Pounds 1.3m (double the estimate) from a collection of Thai stamps. Only one of the 364 lots was unsold.</p>

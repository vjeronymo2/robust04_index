			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> 'Prelude' Not Burned Out: A New York preview performance of "Prelude to a  Kiss," starring Timothy Hutton, went on as scheduled Thursday night after an  early morning fire in the dressing rooms of the Helen Hayes Theatre destroyed  the majority of the costumes for the play, which is scheduled to make its  Broadway debut Tuesday. A production spokesman said new costumes and dressing  room arrangements were hurriedly prepared during the day, and that all the  theaters on West 44th Street, where the Hayes is located, volunteered washing  and drying machines in an attempt to save the 90 costumes used in the show. The  cause of the fire was not immediately determined. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

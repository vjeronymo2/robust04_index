			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Chretien warns Quebec Canada's prime minister Mr Jean Chretien has added his voice to a rising chorus of warnings about the risks Quebec faces if the francophone province steps up its campaign for independence. Mr Chretien has so far tried to steer clear of the separatist debate, but he has been drawn into it by the separatists' strong performance in opinion polls before a Quebec provincial election, due by year-end. The Parti Quebecois, which has promised immediately to launch a loosening of Quebec's ties with Ottawa if it wins the election, is well ahead of the ruling Liberals in the polls. The PQ's federal counterpart, the Bloc Quebecois, has lost no opportunity to press the separatist cause outside Quebec. The BQ forms the official opposition in the House of Commons in Ottawa. Mr Chretien accused the separatists this week of hurting the economy by sowing doubts in financial markets about Canada's political stability. The prime minister said he was confident that Quebec people would vote to stay in Canada if a referendum were held. The PQ plans to call one within a year if it wins the forthcoming election. Concern has grown in the federalist camp, however, that the risks of separation are not being driven home forcefully enough to Quebec voters. Mr Peter White, a business partner of publisher Mr Conrad Black and head of the Council for Canadian Unity, warned in a newspaper commentary this week that nationalist parties 'have already made tremendous strides in making independence seem natural, inevitable and practically a fait accompli.'</p>

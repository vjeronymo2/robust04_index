			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: US buy helps Whessoe to Pounds 8.3m WHESSOE, the acquisitive engineering and pipework group, yesterday announced a 13 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 8.3m, largely due to the acquisition of a US company at the beginning of the year. Mr Chris Fleetwood, chief executive, said the Pounds 11m purchase in January of Varec, a manufacturer of tank gauges and vapour control products, had been a 'reasonably significant' feature of the improved performance. Group sales rose by 38 per cent to Pounds 79.7m for the 12 months to September 30. The final dividend is increased by 0.2p to 2.2p, for a total of 8p (7.2p). Earnings per share at 26.3p were 8 per cent ahead, in spite of the Pounds 8m rights issue to fund the Varec purchase. The instrumentation division, of which Varec forms a part, improved operating profits by 46 per cent to Pounds 2.7m. Mr Fleetwood said Whessoe Varec had performed to expectations. In the year to September 30 1991 Varec had produced profits before tax and interest of Pounds 1.2m. Piping systems improved profits from Pounds 3.8m to Pounds 5.1m. This was partly due to the inclusion for a full 12 months of Connex, acquired in 1991, and also to increased busi-ness from the gas-powered energy stations being built in the UK. The group's project engineering division suffered an 11 per cent decline to Pounds 450,000. Mr Fleetwood said Whessoe aimed to sell or close this business. Contracts, and their accompanying risk, had become far too large for a company the size of Whessoe, he said. A provision of Pounds 600,000, which was expected to cover the costs of selling or closing the division, had been taken below the line.</p>

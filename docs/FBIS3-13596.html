			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice president </F> and secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party, in Aden, by  Fawzi al-Jundi, in Cairo, from the "Dialogue From Afar" program;  recorded--date not given]    [Text] [Al-Jundi] 'Ali Salim al-Bid: The Voice of the  Arabs is pleased to welcome you.    [Al-Bid] Thank you and greetings to you and the entire Arab  world.    [Al-Jundi] Let us begin this dialogue with developments in  Yemen. We will start with the ongoing efforts to contain the  Yemeni crisis and consolidate Yemen's unity. You recently  visited Egypt and several fraternal Arab states. President 'Ali  Salih also came to Egypt. The Yemeni president and the vice  president are constantly in touch with President Mubarak. Could  you tell us about the effect of the current Egyptian efforts to  contain the Yemeni crisis?    [Al-Bid] Our contacts with Egypt fall within the context of  the historic ties linking the Egyptian and Yemeni people. It is  no surprise that Egypt shows an interest in Arab affairs,  particularly in Yemen. It has been Egypt's custom to stand with  us in the most difficult circumstances. When we run into  difficulties, the first one we turn to is Egypt and its great  people. Our contacts with brother Husni Mubarak have been  fruitful. There was interest in the issue and we exchanged  views on the Yemeni, Arab, and Islamic issues. The current  circumstances in Yemen, where the unity march is stumbling,  naturally necessitate the holding of contacts with the Arab  brothers, chief among them Arab Egypt, along with our brothers  in Jordan, Oman, the Arab League, and all the people who love  good. We believe the contacts are necessary because the issue of  Yemen's unity deserves attention, since it is closely connected  with our Arab system and our unionist and democratic goal, God  willing.    [Al-Jundi] Following the signing of the Document of Pledge  and Agreement in Amman a few weeks ago, there was a sense of  optimism that the Yemeni crisis could be resolved. But the  ceremony was followed by clashes between military units from the  country's north and south. You returned to the commercial  capital, Aden, and the crisis continued.    [Al-Bid] We believe the solution lies in the Document of  Pledge and Agreement, which is a national document that gained  national consensus and provided ways out of this crisis.  Immediately after the document was signed, we should have  started the implementation and executive measures. But there  are people who do not want this. The events of 21 February, a  few hours after the document was signed in Amman, and events of  26 and 27 February are the product of those who reject the  document and the Arab consensus. These people do not want  stability for Yemen or the region. But there is a popular,  peaceful, and democratic movement that demands the  implementation of this document. We will side with this  movement and with the democratic and peaceful struggle to put  the document into effect, God willing.    [Al-Jundi] Some officials in the Yemeni Socialist Party  [YSP] have proposed a federation in Yemen, which prompted many  observers to accuse the YSP of seeking secession and separation.    [Al-Bid] We hear many such remarks and rumors. In the  circumstances and in view of the people's interest and haste,  some like to make several statements. The drive for unity is  stumbling mainly due to our failure to establish a state of  unity, a state of law and order and institutions. There are  numerous interpretations in this regard and they all seek a  solution to the main topic, namely, the state of unity. The  problem is not about unity, but about the state of the unity,  the mechanism applied in this state, and the definition of the  state. It is about whether it will be a simple or compound  state and whether it will be a state that accommodates the  changes created by unity, the democratic system, and the  peaceful and democratic struggle and that makes room for  competition and variation in views in several areas in Yemen.  So this is the difficult situation we are trying to remedy. I  believe the Document of Pledge and Agreement has touched on this  issue. This document sought to build a modern state in Yemen.  Thus, the discussion on the state of unity is a good thing and  is needed, I believe. We must not hesitate to listen to every  view. These views produced the document that we all signed,  which dealt with the state of unity. It gives a new shape to  the state of unity and represents a new social contract in the  state of unity. So the faltering march of unity is due to the  absence of the state of unity. We should not fear discussion of  such topics; we should allow dialogue to take place and listen  to all the views as long as the intention is to build the state  of unity and find the mechanism that could make room for its  progress.    [Al-Jundi] Is the situation after the signing of the Amman  document much different from what it was before it was signed,  at least practically speaking?    [Al-Bid] It is fraught with tension, which is what we  expected, because there is a refusal to implement the document.  We expected that some would be unable to honor the agreement,  particularly with regard to the first clause, namely, the need  to adopt measures against outlaws and the perpetrators of  terrorism, bombings, assassinations, and every act that disturbs  security and stability in Yemen. This clause is the stumbling  bloc. Another clause is the need to provide security and  constitutional guarantees for the implementation of the  document. So this situation is the reason for the tension.  Some people are reluctant to implement the agreement. They do  not want to be exposed to the public, whose opinion is natural,  of course. I expect the dialogue committee, the public here,  all the peaceloving people, and the majority of the people who  are committed to the implementation of the document to proceed  with it, God willing, and we will overcome the difficulties.  Narrowing the alternatives for those who are tampering with the  situation will place them in a position to accept the  implementation of the document. We have no choice but to  proceed with its implementation. The current circumstances are  the result of the refusal by some people and commitment by  others to implement the document. We welcome every effort at  home and abroad and all the efforts exerted by the Arab  brothers. I believe Yemen will be fine as long as there are  people at home and abroad who take an interest in it and show  concern for it. God willing, things will be fine.    [Al-Jundi] Thank you very much.    [Al-Bid] Thank you.</p>

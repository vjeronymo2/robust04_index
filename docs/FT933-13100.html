			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Management: A guarantee of satisfaction - Case study: ISS Belgium sees levels of new business grow The marketing potential of a quality assurance standard is well illustrated by the experience of ISS Belgium - that country's second largest contract cleaning company and part of the international, publicly quoted ISS group, writes Tim Dickson. Obtaining ISO9000 last May was one stage in a much wider quality programme which ISS Belgium's managing director Theo Dilissen claims has transformed customer perceptions and made an impact on his bottom line. It quickly became clear to Dilissen when he was appointed in July 1989 that the best way to increase turnover was to reverse the old acquisition strategy and concentrate on organic growth. 'Contract cleaning is essentially a commodity business and buyers are largely interested in price,' he explains. 'We wanted to promote a service-based culture which would distinguish us from our competitors.' Market research demonstrated the real problem was the poor image of the contract cleaning industry as a whole. 'There was a general feeling of scepticism about the services offered by us and our competitors.' Training for first line managers and cleaning staff is a key element of the ISS approach, but Dilissen was convinced right from the start that ISO9000 certification would represent a customer guarantee. 'It does not guarantee good performance in itself,' he says. 'What it does is imply that the quality standards you have agreed with your customer will be kept. It's an assurance particularly during the upheaval which happens when a customer is changing his contractor.' A survey of 500 professional buyers by ISS Belgium earlier this year demonstrated that the company's name awareness had risen to 44 per cent from 5 per cent in 1989. Its link with the ISO certification was recognised by 83 per cent of respondents and 65 per cent said the quality standard was 'a significant advantage'. Even more important, the levels of new business gained each year leaped dramatically, from BFr25m-BFr35m a year before 1989 to a projected BFr230m (Pounds 4.3m) in 1993. Operating profits rose 70 per cent in 1992 and are expected to increase a further 29 per cent this year. ISS Belgium has total turnover of BFr1.6bn and 2,200 employees. The Belgian example is seen as a model within ISS Europe, whose chief executive Waldemar Schmidt believes ISO9000 'communicates professionalism'. He says that in the UK 'we can't use it as a marketing tool because everyone else has it', but implies that the company can steal a march on competitors elsewhere in Europe.</p>

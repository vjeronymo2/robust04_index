			<p>BFN     [Text] The Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) is in  favor of a one-party government and a multi-party parliament,  LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy told students of the Moscow  State University today.    Zhirinovskiy announced that at his meeting with Premier  Viktor Chernomyrdin on May 12 he demanded that the interior and  foreign policy of Russia be altered and the government's  composition be changed.    "Currently, the government consists of people who either did  not participate in the December elections or failed at them,"  Zhirinovskiy pointed out. He added that Russia must be ruled by  a winning party meaning the LDPR. "I said all this to  Chernomyrdin. Now we only demand that representatives of our  party be included in the government," he stated.    Zhirinovskiy promised that as soon as he became president he  would primarily eliminate the national republics in Russia,  establish a East European union and order the power structures  to fight crime within three months.    He said Moscow could show how to tackle crime. Zhirinovskiy  proposed that Moscow be made a closed city for a six-month  period in order to get rid of all criminal groups. He believes  that such measures could be carried out in other Russian cities  as well so that criminals be forced from Russia to the Caucuses  and Middle Asia. "After this we will close the borders and here  is the problem of crime solved," he reassured.    Zhirinovskiy suggested that Russia must take measures in  order to lift sanctions against Iraq and Yugoslavia stating that  they "need arms and we need food they could give to us." He  stressed with regret that the present Russian foreign minister  was working for the U.S.A. which was willing to make Russia a  feeble country.    Zhirinovskiy said young people needed an idol and urged  students to make the author of the book "The Last Breakthrough  to the South" (ie. Zhirinovskiy) their idol . He emphasized  that rock was the means used by the West in order to make fools  of young people.    Zhirinovskiy called on the students to be against any  revolutions, perestroykas and reforms since they did nothing but  harm and were destroying the state. He found about 600  listeners among students of the Moscow State University.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Resistance to training is shown by survey THE prediction that almost all those in the 16-18 age bracket will be in education or training by the end of the decade will be proved wrong because of young people's desire to leave school and earn money, according to a survey, David Goodhart writes. Covering 4,800 young people in Liverpool, Swindon, Kirkcaldy and Sheffield, it shows that in spite of efforts to establish a training culture, young people want to take the quickest possible route into employment 'possibly at the expense of investment in their own training'. The survey was carried out by the Economic and Social Research Council. It shows that Youth Training is much more likely to lead to employment in Swindon because of the buoyancy of the local economy. In Sheffield 38 per cent found themselves unemployed after being on a Youth Training scheme. In Liverpool the proportion was 37 per cent and in Kirkcaldy 36 per cent. In Swindon it was only 11 per cent. More young people stayed in education after 16 in Scotland than in England. 'This could have been influenced by the fact that while it takes two years to take A-levels, a Scottish Higher can be completed in a year,' the ESRC said.</p>

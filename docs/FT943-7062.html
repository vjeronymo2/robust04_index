			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / IBM picks up the gauntlet in the PC price war: The response of rivals to Compaq's cuts is quickly gathering momentum The US personal computer market has been hit by 'Compaq Shock' as competitors scramble to match last week's action by Compaq Computer that reduced prices of many of its PCs by 11 to 22 per cent. Yesterday, IBM announced broad price cuts of up to 27 per cent, matching Compaq's new prices on most models and undercutting its rival by about 5 per cent in the important 'PC server' segment. The situation is reminiscent of the 'Compaq Shock' that hit the Japanese PC market two years ago when Compaq dropped its prices and bulldozed its way into a market formerly dominated by NEC. This time Compaq's targets are IBM and Apple Computer - for many years the leading US PC suppliers. Compaq has vowed to overtake them to become the world market leader by 1996. Armed with Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.4bn) worth of inventory which it hopes to unleash on the market over the October to year-end quarter, typically the peak PC selling season, Compaq is gearing up for battle. With gross profit margins well above those of its competitors, Compaq can afford to engage in a price war, say industry analysts. IBM has been quick to respond to Compaq's price cuts and other leading PC makers are expected to follow suit. Hewlett-Packard said yesterday that it would undercut Compaq's new prices in about two weeks, while Digital Equipment has also vowed to remain price competitive. The response of smaller PC companies is less predictable. 'My gut feeling is that some competitors will react and some will not. It depends on their overall strategy,' said Mr John Carlo Bisone, Compaq's senior vice-president of North American marketing. Compaq's attack comes at a particularly vulnerable time for its biggest competitors. IBM is in the middle of restructuring its PC business while Apple is making a transition to PowerPC microprocessor technology. The price war could prove particularly costly to IBM, which is struggling to regain momentum in the PC market. IBM's second-quarter US shipments dropped 29 per cent, as shipment volume at its four top rivals rose. In the second quarter, Compaq had a 14.3 per cent share of the US market, according to Dataquest. Apple Computer had an 11.2 per cent share; Packard Bell Electronics had 9.3 per cent and IBM trailed at 7.9 per cent. IBM's profit margins in the PC business are also well below those of Compaq, which claims to be the market's lowest-cost producer. The new price cuts will further reduce profit margins, but the company must respond to Compaq's price challenge if it is not to see its market share dwindle. Fuelling the battle in the PC industry are sharp price reductions by Intel, the leading supplier of microprocessor chips. Over the past four months Intel has lowered prices on its 486 and Pentium chips by about 40 per cent. This has given PC makers an opportunity to trim their prices, while maintaining profit margins. Another factor that is adding momentum to the PC price war is the broad availability of products. Over the past two years, PC makers have frequently been unable to keep pace with demand for their products because of component shortages. Most of these problems have now been solved and the industry has a glut of products that it is anxious to unleash on the market. The price cuts are also seen as a precursor to the introduction of new products as the market shifts toward higher performance machines based on Intel's Pentium microprocessors. Television advertising will for the first time in several years become a weapon in the looming PC marketing battle, with Compaq planning to double its spending on US television commercials over the next three months and IBM planning to return to TV advertising for the first time in years. Intel is also planning its most ambitious TV advertising campaign to date. 'A fundamental shift in the market is taking place,' said Mr Dennis Carter, Intel vice-president for marketing, adding that PC sales to home users are exploding. In the fourth quarter of 1993, US sales of PCs to consumers outstripped sales to businesses for the first time. However, while Intel is aiming its marketing campaign at home PC users, the focus of the PC pricing activities is in the corporate market, which typically includes higher performance computers that command higher prices and profit margins. IBM's price cuts are particularly aggressive on 'PC servers'. The largest IBM price drop is on a PC Server Array formerly priced at Dollars 13,090 which will now carry a list price of Dollars 9,500. This compares with Compaq's price, on an equivalent PC server, of Dollars 10,000. Lex, Page 14</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The 1994 report on foreign trade barriers,  published by the U.S. Trade Representative [USTR], gives a  positive evaluation on the overall measures taken by the  Republic of China [ROC] to open its markets. Commenting on the  USTR's report, Minister of Economic Affairs Chiang Ping-kun said  on 1 April: As the ROC's trade surplus against the United  States has been significantly reduced and tariffs on some  industrial products have been cut to the level of advanced  countries, our country should be able to avoid facing the U.S.  Super 301 action.    The minister added: The ROC's efforts at protecting  intellectual property rights [IPR] should be affirmed. Last  year the problem of imitation was not as serious as in previous  years, and exports of replicas decreased considerably. Our  country should be dropped or downgraded from the special 301  priority observation list.    The USTR report's section dealing with the ROC consists of  seven major categories, including import policy, testing  standards, government procurement, IPR protection, service  trades, and investment.    According to the Board of Foreign Trade, so far as tariffs  are concerned, the United States takes note of the ROC's  progress in lowering import duties, but still maintains that  those on farm products and automobile parts are overly high; in  IPR protection, Washington views the situation in the ROC as  having improved, but believes that serious problems remain in  implementation. Moreover, Washington regards the ROC's fourth  TV station's unauthorized relay of satellite programs as a very  serious problem; and it deems the ROC's patent reviewing system  as not yet totally open.    The USTR's report shows deep concern over the ROC's  financial  service trade, investment barriers, monopolistic measures, and  telecommunications service. Take, as examples, the U.S. Mutual  Insurance Company's inability to set up a branch office in  Taiwan, the ban on insurance companies setting up subsidiaries  in Taiwan; the restrictions on investing in domestic insurance  companies, and the ban on investing in housing and real estate.    The minister said: Taiwan's trade barriers, such as high  tariffs on certain products and restrictions on imports to  certain areas, have been included in the agenda of negotiations  with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT]; and they  will be resolved once the negotiations for GATT membership are  completed. Therefore, Taiwan should be able to avoid facing  Super 301 action.</p>

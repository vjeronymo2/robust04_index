			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> MYSTERIES R US: Doug Stumpf, senior editor at William Morrow &amp; Co. in New  York, says the county is the setting for so many mysteries because it's  "perfect" -- suburban, but with "the crime and sophistication of an urban  center." Besides, "there's something about a hotter climate and the beach and  palm trees that gives it a really sexy element you don't get if your feet are  in the snow." . . . And judging from the manuscripts Stumpf sees, "there's a  lot of talent coming out of Orange County these days."  </P></p>

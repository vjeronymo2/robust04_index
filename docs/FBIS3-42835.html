			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Oleksandr Lavrynovych, deputy head, Ukrainian </F> People's Movement (Rukh): "Privatization Is the Key to a Change  in the Behavior of Economic Factors"]    [Text] The present-day situation in Ukraine's economic life  has created a status of general dissatisfaction and--here and  there--even of despair. What lesson can we draw from the first  two years of Ukrainian state sovereignty? Nowadays it is surely  obvious to everyone that there will be no perect economic  solution to the problem of extricating ourselves from this  all-encompassing crisis.    We need to solve the problem of making a systemic transition  to a new quality of society, state administration, and economics.    One gets the impression more and more nowadays that the  situation is being pushed--whether consciously or not--in the  direction of extraordinary measures. There is a persistent  argument to the effect that the escalation of the  above-mentioned crisis is being brought about by Ukraine's  energy dependence, as well as by the constant rise in prices  spent for energy-bearing materials. But the proportion of such  energy sources in Ukraine's credit indebtedness is less than 15  percent. And what about the remainder? The rest of this  indebtedness is caused by the noncompetiveness of Ukrainian  goods in the markets of other states and by the fact that we  have a tight taxation, customs-duty, and import-export policy.  The real cause of our worsening situation lies in the absence of  reforms and consistent actions in the field of managing the  economy.    Our economy cannot be rebuilt without an all-encompassing  change in the structure of property rights. And it is groundless  to anticipate changes in the behavior of economic factors  without privatization. It has never happened anywhere and surely  never will. Having set out on the path of reform, we must  organize a rapid and mass privatization. The goal of  privatization is to find new property-owners and managers and to  channel the funds obtained into the appropriate solution of  social problems.    We are taking the initial steps of our reform policy in the  agro-industrial complex. And we are beginning with land reform.  Ukraine's agriculture requires various forms of management and  various forms of property ownership. At present the process of  privatizing land and making a total farm inventory on a  shareholding basis is urgent. We must ensure that there are  state monitoring controls on land utilization. The goal of  privatizing land and property is to reform collective farms into  full-valued cooperatives, shareholding enterprises, private-type  farms, and associations of village-owned farms.    The question of prices and price formation is  extraordinarily  important and--at the same time--painful. The present-day  government in Ukraine, having abandoned the path of direct  administrative command, has not set forth on the path of  market-type changes, but instead has chosen the path of the  absurd. What else can one call a course directed at reducing the  Gross National Product, curtailing production, and precipitously  impoverishing the population, while--at the same time--creating  the conditions for superprofits and enriching state bureaucrats  by means of bribery, extortion, and other such mercenary  behavior.    The first step in this field must be to ensure that there  are  public monitoring controls by citizens on the utilization of the  state budget. This step has to be taken in order to prevent the  budget from being plundered in the form of granting privileged  credits, subsidies, and budgetary loans.    We need to legislatively reinforce evenhanded tax conditions  for enterprises under all forms of property ownership. In order  to encourage investments and stimulate the entrepreneurial  spirit, we should introduce "flat" taxes on profits. This is a  very important step--one which could encourage, first and  foremost, the active influx of medium-sized and large-scale  international capital. In parallel fashion, we have to adopt and  apply progressive taxes for individual incomes.    While creating favorable conditions for business  activity--conditions which will enable us to realize high  profits--we must also ensure protection for sensitive social  groups by providing targeted aid and relief for them. We are  introducing into our Rukh program precise ways and means for  implementing such protective institutions.    It is a known fact that the success of the economic reform  depends--to a considerable extent--on cooperation between state  and private property owners. Pushing on forward is only possible  if we begin real privatization, including that of land. This  would enable us to put a stop to the plundering of state  property and free the state from the need to subsidize  enterprises making low profits or even operating at a loss.  Privatization would also mean the end of uncontrolled credit  issuance, inasmuch as the granting of credits to state  enterprises is the principal source of the deficit today.    In order to expand the possibilities for Ukraine's citizens  and to create evenhanded conditions in the obtaining of credits,  we must legislatively reinforce the right to grant credits to  those citizens who wish to start up their own businesses or to  acquire housing.    We also need to create favorable conditions for the  emergence  of new private enterprises and to implement programs for  supporting and developing entrepreneurship. We have such a  specific program. Each person desiring to become an  owner-manager will be allowed to participate directly in the  administration of the economic region involved. And, therefore,  we must carry out not only small-scale privatization, but also  provide for the joint-stock ownership of corporate-type  enterprises. The creation of a private sector will be  accompanied by mandatory anti-monopoly measures, which will  simultaneously provide equal rights among enterprises having  various forms of property ownership. An interest in--and concern  for--turning out competitive goods or services needed in the  marketplace will facilitate the growth of social production.  Privatization will have to cut back on the production of  energy-consuming, noncompetitive machiner and semifinished  goods; and it must expand the sphere of producing consumer  goods. We already need to tackle the structural change of energy  production in Ukraine now so as to reduce the imports of oil and  gas to a minimum.    All these measures are possible only if the problem of  government power is solved. Otherwise, the decline in the  economy will continue even more precipitously. Therefore, we are  in favor of combining our efforts with those of all Ukrainian  patriots and supporters of rapid, radical reforms. We have faith  in our success, and we anticipate that the path to it will not  be too long and painful.</p>

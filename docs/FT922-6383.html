			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Death report exaggerated REPORTS OF the death of the German economic consensus turn out to have been exaggerated. Pronouncements that the anchor role of the D-Mark can be shared with, or even assumed by, other European currencies are probably equally premature. The wage deal agreed this week in the German engineering industry - 5.8 per cent this year, followed by 3.4 per cent in 1993, along with an hour's cut in the working week - shows first, that the German consensual approach to economic policy-making is still working; second, that tough monetary policy is bringing inflationary pressures back under control; but, finally, that the road back to traditional German monetary performance will be long and hard. The consensus may have worked, but at a high price. Monetary growth ran at an annualised rate of 8.8 per cent between the fourth quarter of 1991 and April 1992 (well above the Bundesbank's target range of 3 1/2 to 5 1/2 per cent). Many question the government's ability to restore control over public finances and the German economy remains robust. All this suggests a much looser monetary policy remains a distant dream. The difficulties into which unification has dragged Germany have led others to claim that they can share in the role of providing the monetary anchor for Europe. Mr Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the Bank of France, said only this week that the French franc is just as important as the D-Mark within the European Monetary System. He is being somewhat hasty. The anchor role has been won by the Bundesbank through competition in the market place. The only way to convince the markets that one's currency is as good as the D-Mark is to show that one's central bank is at least as good as the Bundesbank. Price stability Even the Bank of France has some distance to go. Inflation of around 3 per cent looks excellent. But since it has been achieved during a period of below trend economic growth and rising unemployment, it falls well short of long-term price stability. Even with 3 per cent inflation, a currency loses 95 per cent of its value over a century. This is not price stability on any reasonable definition. The difficulties into which unification has dragged Germany have imposed a monetary policy that, however painful, is appropriate, not merely for countries like Italy, Spain and the UK, but for France as well. True, it is appropriate only if price stability is the overriding goal. That can be disputed. But it cannot be disputed by those who hope to displace a central bank which is certain that the price is not too high. Nor can it be disputed by those who intend to ratify the Maastricht treaty. For that treaty commits the EC to establishing an independent central bank 'whose primary aim shall be to maintain price stability'. Slow growth It would be possible to postpone that achievement, perhaps until the new central bank has been established. But it is precisely during a period of slow growth that the EC has the best chance of attaining its goal. More important, it is only by the performance of others that the Germans will be persuaded to take the risk of economic and monetary union. Doubts about the desirability of price stability are, in any case, somewhat beside the point. German unification is forcing it on Europe, willy nilly. The chancellor of the exchequer, for example, suggested this week that 2 per cent inflation should be the target for the UK. The UK is far from any such figure at the moment. The high interest rates imposed by Germany give the UK its best chance of achieving it. The price is unquestionably high. The UK's gross domestic product fell by another 0.6 per cent between the last quarter of 1991 and the first of 1992. Over seven successive quarters of decline, GDP has fallen by 4.2 per cent. Yet underlying inflation in the economy as a whole is still around 5 1/2 per cent. Opinion can reasonably differ, over whether this price is worth paying. But only those who convince the markets they believe it is can hope to enjoy interest rates below German levels for a sustained period. Equally, only those who share this faith have any business ratifying the treaty agreed at Maastricht.</p>

The Mexican  state, one of the most powerful in Latin America, has enough  operational and military instruments to resolve this situation  without having to resort to scorched earth or ethnic cleansing  policies, according to Chilean Juan de Dios Parra, executive  secretary of the ALDHU.    The expression scorched earth refers to the use of intense  military bombings to eliminate all traces of human, animal, and  plant life in a specific area. Ethnic cleansing refers to the  elimination of a certain race.    Parra also added that the peasant rebellion of the past six  days in Mexico is doomed to failure and that more than 500  people have been killed, most of them innocent civilians.  According to ALDHU spokesman Cesar Mosquera, the figure of 500  dead was obtained by the organization after telephone  conversations with Mexican human rights organizations. Official  figures from Mexico have only reported the killing of 102 people  even though Catholic Church sources in Mexico estimate the  number of people killed could reach 400.    Clashes between the Mexican Army and peasants from the  so-called Zapatista National Liberation Army have been going on  since 1 January.</p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL ASKED TO BAR PLANNERS FROM OWNING L.A. LAND  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Council members Joy Picus and Joel Wachs called Wednesday for  city planning commissioners to divest ownership of all their property within  city boundaries to avoid another conflict of interest like one that barred the  commission from hearing the Porter Ranch development plan.  </P> <P> The Picus-Wachs measure would force the five current commissioners to choose  between owning land in the city -- other than their homes -- or serving on the  board. The proposal joins a crowd of ethical reforms under consideration by  city officials.  </P> <P> Picus and Wachs also suggested that the city's Governmental Operations  Committee, to which their proposal was sent, study similar prohibitions for all  city commissioners, board members and the City Council itself.  </P> <P> The announcement came the same day the Board of Referred Powers, a five-member  City Council panel that takes up matters that have posed conflicts for other  city boards, gave preliminary approval to the mammoth Porter Ranch commercial  and residential plan.  </P> <P> Several board members expressed frustration that the Planning Commission did  not grapple with the complex land-use issues involved in the $2-billion,  1,300-acre development plan.  </P> <P> In a City Hall news conference Wednesday morning, Picus said her divestment  measure would reduce the chances that the Planning Commission would be bypassed  again.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, Assistant City Atty. Anthony S. Alperin determined that  Commissioner Theodore Stein Jr.'s part interest in a subdivision about a mile  away from the Porter Ranch development posed a conflict of interest because  Stein could benefit from street improvements involving the proposed  development. The decision prohibited the entire commission from hearing the  matter.  </P> <P> "When the commission is disqualified from acting, then the people of Los  Angeles lose because our system is based on having citizen input into the  decision-making process," Picus said. "Those commissioners are part of that  process."  </P> <P> The Board of Referred Powers has ruled on 12 planning cases since 1987 because  of conflicts of interest involving commissioners, according to a review of  board agendas released by Wachs. Seven of the disqualifications were the result  of property holdings by commissioners. Others were the result of business  dealings or involvement in community groups involved in matters before the  commission.  </P> <P> Planning Commission President William G. Luddy said the Picus-Wachs proposal  "is out of proportion to the perceived problem," noting that the commission has  made decisions on thousands of pieces of property.  </P> <P> Stein, an attorney, said he believes that the proposed ordinance would  illegally discriminate against a whole class of Los Angeles residents --  property owners -- by barring them from participation on citizen panels.  </P> <P> During Wednesday's Board of Referred Powers hearing, several council members  appeared reluctant to take on the Porter Ranch case and criticized the city  attorney.  </P> <P> Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said he was "flabbergasted" by the city attorney's  opinion.  </P> <P> "The whole process . . . has been turned on it head," he said. "By the same  thinking, Stein could have a financial interest in any stoplight because he  would use more gas. I don't know where it ends."  </P> <P> Councilman Marvin Braude, who also is a member of the Board of Referred Powers,  said he "was uncomfortable being thrust in this kind of position.  </P> <P> "I for one think we ought to move forward and try and change the state law or  the City Charter or whatever it takes because we can't afford the  decision-making process of this city to be handicapped in this way," Braude  said. "I think we are missing a lot by not having this go through the Planning  Commission."  </P></p>

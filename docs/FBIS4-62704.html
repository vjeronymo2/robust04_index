			<p>BFN     [Text] At the first session of the Ukrainian Supreme  Council, many deputies pointed to certain incongruities between  the legislation on people's deputies elections and the current  Ukrainian Constitution. In this regard, Central Electoral  Commission Chairman Ivan Yemets yesterday provided his  explanations to the Ukrainian Radio and Television Company.    [Begin Yemets recording] Actually, there are many such  incongruities between the Constitution and Electoral Law.  First, in four constituencies, the elections were held with the  participation of one candidate, since others had withdrawn their  candidacies. Article 89 of the Constitution says that any number  of candidates can be included in a ballot. Following is a  characteristic example. In the 147th constituency of Donetsk's  Artemivskyy rayon, two candidates -- Chuprun and Panasovskyy --  were running in the elections. Panasovskyy won 49.3 percent of  the votes, and all other candidates won less votes. Chuprun  withdrew his candidacy, and the remaining five people refused to  run, realizing that they had no chance. What should be done in  such a case? Where to find one more candidate, if there are  none in sight? Another question is the implementation of  Article 48 of the Electoral Law. Who runs in run-off elections?  As you know, run-off elections have been scheduled in 112  constituencies in Ukraine. In 92 constituencies where the  elections were held but none of candidates won the required  number of votes -- 50 percent -- those people cannot run again  in the run-off elections. However, there are 20 constituencies  in which the voters did not participate in the elections for  some reason. The question arises as to whether those people who  won in these constituencies can also participate in the run-off  elections or not. The Central Electoral Commission has  therefore asked the Supreme Council to provide its  interpretation of these articles of the Electoral Law, and  certain other articles, since there are many contradictions with  the Constitution and other laws. This is why we have asked the  Supreme Council to provide an interpretation of this law. [end  recording]</p>

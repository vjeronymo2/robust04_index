			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] combatants are  continuing with their armed fight against elements of the  Presidential Guard, as well as government soldiers who decided  to join the criminals. The fighting is centered in the capital,  where the Presidential Guard continues to massacre innocent  people, after being prompted by the pretext of President  Habyarimana's death in an plane crash.    The information broadcast this morning by several foreign  radio stations and on Kigali radio concerning truce negotiations  between the RPF and the transitional government put in place by  those who organized the massacres is baseless. (Jean-Baptiste  Kades) has this report:    [(Kades)] Yes, [words indistinct] since this morning,  several  international news media have reported that the RPF agreed to  meet the self-proclaimed authorities in Kigali, in order to  discuss a possible cease-fire. The RPF insists on informing  Rwandan and international opinion that this information is  baseless. There is no question of the RPF holding any  negotiations whatsoever with this pseudo-government while the  killers working for certain government members now based in  Gitarama continue to kill all over the country.    We repeat: There will be no dealings whatsoever between the  RPF and this government. The only consultations which have  taken place in Kigali are, to the best of our knowledge, between  the executive committees of political parties involved in the  Arusha peace agreements. The members of these executive  committees, or at least those of them who have escaped the  massacres organized by the Presidential Guards, the Coalition  for the Defense of the Republic [words indistinct] of the  Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development, met  today in Kigali to discuss the situation now prevailing in the  country. This has nothing to do with any form of cease-fire.  [passage omitted]</p>

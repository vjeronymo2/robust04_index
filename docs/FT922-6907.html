			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Survey of Turkey (10): Cities try to close gap with Europe - The quality of life in Ankara and Istanbul NEARLY 11m of Turkey's 58m inhabitants live in two cities, Ankara, the national capital, and Istanbul, Turkey's main business centre and largest city. The citizens of Ankara and Istanbul make up the overwhelming majority of Turkey's political and business class, its civil service and intelligentsia, and its growing consumer middle class. They also pay most of the country's taxes. Until the late 1980s, however, it is probably fair to say that conditions in both cities were more reminiscent of the third world than of the typical European metropolis. Migration from the countryside enlarged their populations by around 6 or 7 per cent each year. Most of the new arrivals lived in vast shanty-town districts. Services and urban infrastructure were correspondingly poor. Interruptions in water and electricity supplies were more or less routine. Public transport was limited and there was little public housing development or planning. Since the late 1980s, this picture has been changing. For a start, the pace of migration has slackened slightly, though Ankara's 2.8m inhabitants are still growing by an estimated 100,000 a year and Istanbul's 8m population rises by over 6 per cent annually. More importantly, the population of the two cities has come to expect improved services. In both Ankara and Istanbul, social democrat mayors are struggling to improve basic utilities such as water, sewerage, gas supply and transport. There have been some striking successes. The previous Motherland party administration in Istanbul under former Mayor Bedrettin Dalan (who has since switched parties and represents Istanbul for the ruling True Path party in the present parliament) installed the city's first ever sewage treatment plant and managed to improve the water supply. In Ankara, the city's council, under a joint venture with British Gas, has fitted 200,000 homes to take Siberian natural gas. A second stage is planned shortly. As a result, this winter was Ankara's first without heavy air pollution for half a century. 'My aim is to bring conditions in Ankara at least to the level of the nearest European capital cities, such as Athens, over the next three to five years. Ankara is going to be one of the best cities in the region,' says Mr Murat Karayalcin, the capital's mayor. In pursuit of this goal, Mr Karayalcin has drawn up a masterplan to take the city, until now something of a Cinderella among those in the Mediterranean basin, through to 2015 and is embarking on a range of projects, from a light rail system and metro through to a new cultural and exhibition centre. The city's annual budget of TL7 trillion (Dollars 1.2bn) includes investment spending of between TL2-3 trillion. Spending on infrastructure has overtaken that on new housing for the first time in Ankara's post-war history. Revenues come almost entirely from a central government block grant: municipalities in Turkey have very limited ability to raise cash through local taxes. The Ankara metropolitan municipality has also started tapping syndicated loans on the international market and earlier this year raised Dollars 230m in bonds and now has a credit rating in Frankfurt and Tokyo. The challenge of developing Ankara, however, is relatively modest compared with Istanbul, a city which takes in up to 500,000 rural migrants a year and which has become a vast sprawling megalopolis, part of a conurbation in which one can drive for over 50 miles without seeing the countryside. 'We would like to see the government developing new industrial centres in other parties of Turkey such as Zonguldak and Bolu and in the eastern Black Sea around Trabzon and Artvin to take some of the migrant pressure off Istanbul,' says Mr Icen Bortucene, the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality's deputy secretary-general. Istanbul's development budget this year will be around TL5.9 trillion, and it already has an international debt burden inherited from the mid-1980s, costing it around Dollars 600m a year to service. 'It is relatively small. We certainly are not fearful about further foreign borrowing for important projects,' says Mr Bortucene. Asked how the city plans to spend its cash, Mr Bortucene has a simple answer. 'We want to make life less intolerable for the ordinary citizen. Quite simple investments in transport for example could stop large numbers of our people losing up to three hours a day travelling to work and back. Transport at present is so poor that sometimes you see clerical workers hitching lifts to and from work.' Like Ankara, Istanbul is also building its own light rail mass transport. A first stage of 8km has already been completed and work is currently under way to build a 26km extension. Work on a second tramway system also starts this month, while the city's bus fleet has taken on an extra 800km capacity with the purchase of a 845 new buses. Again like Ankara, Istanbul's planners are ambitious. The city is competing with other international cities to host the Olympic games early in the next century. 'We want Istanbul to be a world metropolis, serving not only Turkey but also the world as a whole. Its international economic, trading and political importance has changed enormously since the break up of Soviet Union,' says Mr Bortucene. Shortage of cash is, however, not the only problem standing in the city's way. The sprawling megalopolis is run by an equally unwieldy administration, working more or less along Ottoman lines with paper dossiers travelling slowly between departments inside the city's vast municipal headquarters. Reliable statistics are scarce. Istanbul does not appear to have the tightly focused urban development plans which have been produced in Ankara. It also has other problems - including a powerfully entrenched local underworld or mafia - which if it exists at all in the capital is far less effective. Mr Bortucene believes some sort of administrative overhaul is long overdue, especially in management and information technology. 'We lack a good management information system, especially where specific projects are concerned,' he says. Just how swiftly such changes can be achieved remains to be seen. On the other hand, Istanbul is a genuinely powerful and rich industrial city, where average per capita income is around Dollars 10,000, much closer to the income levels of a developed country than to those of the rest of Turkey - even if income distribution is highly uneven. That fact seems to be slowly driving the city to close the gap with Europe.</p>

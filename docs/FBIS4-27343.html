			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [By Hiroshi Arai, Seoul] </F>   [Text] The decision by Samsung Electronics to buy Lux  indicates that Japanese firms have been included in the  investment targets of South Korean firms which are active in  overseas M&amp;A [mergers and acquisitions]. Since Japanese firms  have technology capability and brand power that South Korean  firms do not have, it is believed that South Korean firms will  embark on the buy-out of Japanese firms not only in home  electronics, but also auto parts, etc., in the future.    South Korean firms are losing price competitiveness along  with the rise in personnel costs, and improvement in technology  capability has become an urgent necessity. For this reason, they  have been active in M&amp;A these past few years to acquire  technology. Last year, Modern Electronics Industries, the  largest South Korean electrical equipment manufacturer, acquired  40 percent of the stock of Macstar, a major U.S. manufacturer of  hard disk devices (HDD) used in computer memory storage. Samsung  Electronics also bought Harris Microwave Semiconductor, a U.S.  compound semiconductor manufacturer, last year.    The aim of this buy-out also is the acquisition of  high-class  audio product technology capability and the prestigious brand of  Lux. The development speed of firms in advanced nations such as  Japan is fast in technology aspects, and it is not easy for  South Korean firms to catch up.    It also takes considerable time to improve brand image. A  buy-out is the quickest way to obtain that. They probably also  have judged that now is "the time to buy" Japanese firms which  have been suffering in business with the prolonged recession.    South Korean firms are expanding scale and acquiring  financial power riding on the high growth of South Korea. It is  whispered in the South Korean financial world that "there are  firms besides Samsung Electronics which aim at a buy-out of  Japanese firms or capital participation." Regarding the  management of Lux, Samsung Electronics "will make use of the  Japanese management and support the management of President  Hayakawa," and is giving care to the Japanese side. If the  buy-out by Samsung Electronics succeeds, there is a great  possibility that it will be an opportunity for South Korean  firms to undertake constructively the buy-out of Japanese firms.</p>

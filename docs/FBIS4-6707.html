			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 20 KYODO -- The Foreign Ministry said  Wednesday [20 April] it has notified the European Union (EU)  that a ministerial meeting planned for Friday and Saturday in  Tokyo will be put off till next month due to the delayed  formation of Japan's new government.    At the annual EU meeting, Japan's foreign minister and  finance minister were scheduled to talk with EU Trade  Commissioner Leon Brittan on issues such as the country's  massive trade surplus with the EU and on its deregulation  measures.    Japan's prime minister and cabinet ministers have yet to be  officially selected, however. The delay in the formation of a  new government has led to postponements of visits to Tokyo by  such dignitaries as the Egyptian president and Thai prime  minister.</p>

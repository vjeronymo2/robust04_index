			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Semenov, personal correspondent </F> (Yaroslavl): "Tea Party in the `Golden Bear,' or Why Organized  Crime Calls Yaroslavl a `Sweet City'"]    [Text] My friends advised me right away to forget the  whole thing, but I kept remembering a statement by Lt. Col. Kh.  Alyautdinov: "I find myself wondering why and for whom we are  doing all of this. Whom are we protecting? I have the sense that  no one wants this." I understood not only what he said, but also  what he chose not to say. That is why I went to the most  exclusive and ominous bar in Yaroslavl--the "Golden Bear."    The building, which is located in an neglected park, has no  external appeal whatsoever. In fact, it looks like a painted  shed, but as soon as I walked up to the door, it opened and a  young man with an athletic build asked politely from inside:  "May I help you?" After hearing that I wanted to see the  director, he stepped aside and courteously helped me remove my  coat. I entered a luxurious room, tastefully decorated with  modern furniture and the finest china and glassware, and  also...with soft and soothing music playing in the background.  An attractive long-legged waitress brought me a cup of coffee,  an orange, a glass of water, and...a check for 3,540 rubles.    According to reports received by the organized  crime-fighting  division of the Yaroslavl Oblast Internal Affairs  Administration, the main black marketeers and criminal  "authorities" were supposed to meet here for a "convention."  They were supposed to agree on the division of economic spheres  of influence and reach a consensus on certain areas of  controversy. The Moscow bosses and representatives of the  Georgian and Chechen Mafia were expected as guests. This  interregional meeting was viewed by the Yaroslavl police as an  exceptionally disturbing event. After all, the experience of  other cities, not to mention Yaroslavl itself, indicated that  "conferences" of this kind frequently culminated in bloody  confrontations.    The Yaroslavl Organized Crime-Fighting Division began  planning an operation to cut the "convention" short and arrest  the guests of the exclusive bar. The rapid-response team which  had been created specifically for the apprehension of armed  criminals in emergency situations would be part of the  operation. The detectives knew the time and place of the gang  leaders' meeting, and they were even "accompanying" the bosses  all the way from Moscow. The crime world had responded quickly  to the creation of the new subdivision fighting organized crime  and had established a reliable system of defense against the  infiltration of their top ranks by MVD personnel.    At around 1600 hours the guests began arriving at the family  tavern of Ye. Karpova. They ordered tea at first, and then cold  appetizers and meat. The family dinner began. By that time the  personnel of the special subdivision had entered the kitchen and  had dashed from there into the main dining room. Within 30 or 40  seconds they were leading the visitors out of the bar and asking  for their identification papers, filming the whole operation  with a video camera. It was a motley crew: former Komsomol  personnel, prominent athletes, and novice businessmen. In all,  32 people were detained, including 10 "chiefs" from Moscow, 12  residents of Chechnya, and 10 representatives of Yaroslavl  commercial groups and their companions.    Unfortunately, the success of the raid was minimal. Because  no one was armed (although there was a weapon in an old  Zaporozhets parked near the bar, according to some reports), no  one could be charged with a crime, and the police had to release  all of the "innocent diners." I think they did this grudgingly.  After all, they know all about the present activities and the  criminal past of many of the people who were detained. Just four  of them had spent a total of a quarter of a century behind bars.    Knowing this, however, is not the same as being able to take  action within the law. Organized crime is a complex structure  today, enveloping our whole society like a cobweb. Furthermore,  its social base is growing broader. By constantly augmenting its  covert economic relations, it has already turned into a threat  to the system of public administration. The organization of the  old crime world, which was based on concealment from society, is  undergoing rapid renovation. The strong will of the leaders of  organized crime is combined with intelligence, and they are  excellent organizers, psychologists, and economists.  Furthermore, the people behind them are absolutely respectable  gentlemen who are almost above suspicion.    That is the reason for the minimal results, and sometimes  even the outright failures, that provide the grounds for the  contradictory evaluations of police performance. The events in  the "Golden Bear" demonstrate all of the complexity and depth of  the criminals' social mimicry. "Golden Bear" proprietress Ye.  Karpova, for instance, is an expert at impersonating a victim.    "This bar belongs to my private firm `Katerina,'" she  explained. "Our clients have always been respectable. We never  let suspicious people in. Yes, our bar is frequented by local  `authorities,' and we know them, but can you name a bar they do  not frequent?..."    Of course, the proprietress of the "Golden Bear" immediately  filed a complaint with the procuracy, accusing the police of  beating her daughter, Yu. Pautova, who was working in the  kitchen at that time. The Kirovskiy Rayon Procuracy charged the  police with exceeding their authority. Deputy Chief Kh.  Alyautdinov of the Organized Crime-Fighting Division publicly  acknowledged that "the operation might have been conducted with  more finesse, but our boys in the special subdivision do not  have that much experience. All of the cafe owners' complaints  about their behavior were investigated by the heads of the  Internal Affairs Administration and the Procuracy in the manner  prescribed by law."    There is good reason for the special interest in the  exclusive bar. The owners serve a select clientele. One day they  even turned away the deputy chief of the crime-fighting  division, who had come there with his family, because he was not  one of their regular patrons. Furthermore, this is not the first  time the bar has been under investigation. How could an  establishment with only around 10 patrons a night be so  successful? High prices? Yes! But how high would they have to be  to cover expenses and provide a profit? That is what made  certain agencies suspicious....    The "Golden Bear" is closely associated with a firm in the  motion picture business. Was it a coincidence that the deputy  director of the firm was at the bar on the date of the  "convention" and was one of the men detained by the special  subdivision? Besides this, bar director Ye. Karpova was a good  friend of Mudryashov, the municipal administrator who was killed  not long ago. He was not the only one who was killed at that  time, during the struggle for spheres of influence and power.  Now the people in charge are his friends and associates, and  perhaps his conquerors, but it was Mudryashov who guaranteed the  safety of the "Golden Bear."    "It was because of him that no one bothered us," Ye. Karpova  admitted. "He told everyone that we were his friends. That was a  long time ago, and no one has bothered us up to now...."    I think the proprietors of trade and food service  establishments are well aware of the price of this protection.  Literally all of them are expected to pay outrageous fees for  it. Furthermore, it was apparently no coincidence that the  interregional meeting of the "influential" men was held in the  "Golden Bear." Incidentally, according to reports received by  the organized crime-fighting division, the decision to give one  of the Yaroslavl "authorities" the control of the purchase and  sale of weapons was made at that "conference." One of the guests  at the "family dinner" was killed in Moscow soon afterward.  Another appeared on the central television network and announced  his intention to form a new party. In this way, the  consolidation of economic influence is being accompanied by the  gradual politicizing of the crime world, reflecting its leaders'  plans to use their capital to create more favorable conditions  for their activities. The friendly gathering in the bar is  already having far-reaching consequences.    Yaroslavl's proximity to Moscow has made it an appealing  location for the investment of criminal capital in privatized  state property, the sale of real estate, and involvement in  trade and financial affairs. The money is usually invested in  spheres with a quick turnover, where there are no production  stages guaranteeing superprofits. The reason is simple:  Businesses with a quick turnover of capital are difficult to  monitor.    Is this why Yaroslavl is called the "sweet city"? The  organized crime-fighting division assured me that they have the  situation in the city under control and cited some reassuring  statistics. Last year division personnel solved 227 crimes, 76  of which were committed by organized crime gangs, including 24  with implications of corruption. The criminals had managed to  launder more than a billion rubles with the aid of fraudulent  bank documents. A large criminal gang had been discovered in the  oil business.    All of this is impressive, but reports received by the same  division indicate the rapid growth and merger of criminal gangs  in Yaroslavl. Private security firms with criminal connections  are springing up like mushrooms. Trade establishments with  respectable names are using coercive methods at privatization  auctions to buy state property and real estate at low prices.  The motor transport base with a large sports complex here, for  example, was sold for only 60 million. According to a reliable  source, a noodle shop with imported equipment was privatized for  47 million rubles.    Some commercial structures that were established as part of  state enterprises are also closely related to criminal  businesses. There are some companies with colossal assets in  Yaroslavl that are still in the shadows. Some own hotels or  gambling and trade establishments, but who is behind all of  this? The common opinion is that criminal communities cannot  exist without the help of corrupt officials, who cover their  tracks in exchange for a share of their income.    The events at the "Golden Bear" aroused some interest and  were then immediately forgotten. Only Kh. Alyautdinov took the  failure to heart. Every cloud, however, has a silver lining.  This might contribute to the realization that traditional police  methods of fighting organized crime cannot produce the desired  results. Running around in kitchens in bullet-proof vests and  masks and waving assault rifles cannot be effective in fighting  the forces that are now a visible segment of the Russian  society. This will take other methods and other skills. We still  have to learn them. From whom? From life, of course.</p>

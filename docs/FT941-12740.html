			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / UK Company News: MFI shows advance to Pounds 44.1m - Interim profits ahead of forecasts and sales improving MFI Furniture produced a double surprise yesterday with interim profits above most City forecasts and the news that sales since Boxing Day were up 14 per cent on last year. For the 28 weeks to November 6, pre-tax profits were Pounds 44.1m - including a Pounds 19.6m gain from the sale of MFI's stake in Carpetright - compared with a loss of Pounds 12m. Excluding the Carpetright gain, and exceptional flotation costs of Pounds 24.7m last time, pro-forma profits almost doubled from Pounds 12.7m to Pounds 24.5m. The shares gained 5p to 179p. Mr Derek Hunt, chairman, said trading in the January sale had been encouraging - although poor sales last year flattered the comparison - but he remained cautious. 'Two years ago we had a similar increase which disappeared by the year end,' he said. Gross margins fell from 58.5 per cent to 55.6 per cent, though wage costs fell by Pounds 5m. Group turnover was up 5.5 per cent, from Pounds 304m to Pounds 320m. Like-for-like sales, which exclude store openings and closures, were up 7.2 per cent, with virtually no sales inflation. Two new stores before the year-end - which will trade under the name Homeworks and be used to test customer reaction to new products and ideas - will take the chain to 178. Total sales in MFI's French division were up 30 per cent, with like-for-like sales up 6 per cent. Three openings should take the French chain to 51 stores by the year-end, with total sales estimated at Pounds 25m. Borrowings fell from Pounds 82.7m to Pounds 39.7m, and gearing from 78 per cent to 28 per cent. Earnings were 5p per share, including the Carpetright gain, and 2.8p excluding it, from 2.3p last year. The interim dividend is increased from 1.25p to 1.33p. COMMENT The good news from MFI provides grounds for optimism. The January sales increase led to forecasts of an 8 per cent improvement for the second half as a whole. The group should benefit from signs of a pick-up in the housing market, while the shift in the sales mix towards kitchens and bedrooms, which MFI manufactures itself, should help the gross margin. But contrasting figures from Next, Burton and M&amp;S have highlighted the patchy nature of the consumer recovery, and MFI admits it has seen false dawns before. A rejuvenated Magnet could also pose a threat. Full-year forecasts, raised from about Pounds 60m to about Pounds 72.5m yesterday, put the shares on a demanding multiple of 22, although that falls to about 18 on forecasts of Pounds 90m next year.</p>

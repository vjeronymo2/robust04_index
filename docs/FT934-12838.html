			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Entrepreneur avoids advance-fee disaster: What happened to a young businessman when he tried to raise funding for his computer company MR NAJAM Ul-Hasan Kidwai, fresh out of university, was one of the lucky ones. Like most of Turnberry Underwriter's customers he paid them a retainer to procure finance. Unlike many others, he managed to reclaim his fee. Within days of being put in contact with Turnberry, Mr Kidwai, 24, found himself embroiled in a saga which took him from the sober setting of Sunderland to Miami's flashy financial districts where businessmen hypnotised him with talk of multi-million pound loan schemes. Mr Kidwai's story begins with Cybereye, a computer development company he set up earlier this year to exploit the potential for virtual reality in the medical, education and computer-aided design fields. Cybereye needed cash to take its ideas from the drawing board to reality. With little prospect of help through conventional means - largely because of his youth and lack of a track record, according to those who turned him down for financing - Mr Kidwai turned to classified advertisements in national newspaper columns. Here he came across EFG, a New York company which acts as an agent for Turnberry. Mr Kidwai was asked to fly to Miami to discuss his business proposal with a team from Turnberry. Mr Kidwai was impressed by Turnberry's image. The plush Miami office was sited next to US investment bank Smith Barney. The next day, after examining his business plan, Turnberry offered to syndicate Dollars 8m in funding for Cybereye in return for a retainer of Dollars 100,000. The retainer, to cover Turnberry's costs, was to be held in escrow by a Florida solicitor, Mr Jerrell Breslin. It has emerged that at that time Mr Breslin was under investigation by the FBI. He has since been arrested and charged with conspiring to sell US Treasury bonds stolen from a New York savings bank. He is on bail. Mr Kidwai was told that Turnberry could provide collateral in the form of treasury bills, cash or other instruments which would allow Cybereye to raise a one-year bank loan of Dollars 8m. However, the security would not be available until the UK company had arranged a letter of credit payable to Turnberry for Dollars 1.5m - or 20 per cent of the total loan. This was to be Turnberry's return for providing the collateral. At the end of the year, if Cybereye was unable to repay the loan, the collateral would belong to the lending bank. But Cybereye's ability to repay the loan would be virtually guaranteed by a flotation of 35 per cent of the company on a Latin American stock exchange arranged through a financial company introduced by Turnberry, Les Mersky Associates. The financial company would be able to float the stock at whatever price it wished and keep anything in excess of Dollars 8m. Mr Kidwai was unaware that Mr Leslie Mersky, of Les Mersky Associates, was president of Turnberry. Nor did he know that Mr Mersky, like Mr Breslin, was under investigation for alleged fraud, this time by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Last year Mr Mersky and several others were accused of allegedly distri-buting and manipulating shares in a shell corporation, which was said to have made a fraudulent stock offering. The case is still pending. Mr Kidwai believed the deal he was being offered was flawless. For a mere Dollars 100,000 he would get a one-year bridging loan. Turnberry would get Dollars 1.6m, including the retainer, out of the Dollars 8m loan and the collateral would revert to the US company after a year. Cybereye, which only ever intended to draw down Dollars 1m of the Dollars 8m facility, would be able to repay the loan through proceeds raised by the flotation. Cybereye's bankers also had a gold-plated guarantee, since they would hold collateral provided by Turnberry worth Dollars 8m, and could foreclose after a year if the loan was not repaid from the flotation proceeds. Further comfort was taken from the fact that only Dollars 2.6m of the Dollars 8m facility would be drawn in the year. However, this was a deal which - even given an unusually extended deadline for completion of 40 days - proved impossible to complete. While Cybereye managed to find bankers prepared to issue the letter of guarantee and provide the banking loan, everything hinged on proving that the collateral was ready to be transferred. No bank would issue a letter of credit to Turnberry until it was sure the collateral was on its way. Cybereye's bank contacted the Guardian Bank and Trust (Cayman) Ltd, a private bank based in the Cayman Islands, which it had been told was Turnberry's bankers. It was informed over the phone that funds for the collateral were available. But the bank needed more precise details before releasing the letter of credit. It sought reassurance that Turnberry's collateral came from 'good, clean funds of non-criminal origin, and that this statement was issued under the penalty of perjury'. But Turnberry insisted there was 'no bank in the world . . . who can legitimately' make such a statement. Several attempts by Cybereye and its bankers to find a compromise to end the deadlock were rejected by Turnberry. It soon became apparent that no deal would be completed in the time allowed. Mr Kidwai, frustrated by repeated fruitless attempts to contact Turnberry and faced with the almost certain loss of his Dollars 100,000 retainer, contacted the authorities. He issued a letter headed 'fraud alert' containing his account of his dealings with Turnberry, Mr Breslin, Guardian Bank &amp; Trust (Cayman) Ltd, and Les Mersky. Guardian Bank &amp; Trust (Cayman) Ltd then threatened Mr Kidwai with legal action unless he retracted the statements made in the letter. Mr Kidwai demanded the return of his retainer from Turnberry who notified him he was in default of the agreement, which would result in the loss of his retainer. Mr Kidwai eventually issued a retraction and his retainer was returned. Today Mr Kidwai is still searching for a backer. The months of delay in negotiating with Turnberry have almost crippled his company, which operates out of the Industry Centre in Sunderland University. But he is determined not to give up, nor to let others get into the difficulties which he so narrowly avoided. Other companies in the US and UK have had similar experiences with Turnberry. Such difficulties have now attracted the interest of the FBI and UK authorities, who are investigating Turnberry's activities.</p>

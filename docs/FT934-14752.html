			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Canada's politics to take on a provincial hue: The rise of unashamedly regionalist parties in run-up to election IF THE opinion polls are correct, the green benches of Canada's House of Commons will be packed with a new breed of MP after the general election on October 25. As many as a third of the 295 members will not only be newcomers, but will owe their allegiance to two new parties whose policies risk tearing their country apart. Canadian politics has been dominated until now by three national parties - the Liberals, Progressive Conservatives and New Democrats - which have sought to balance the interests of disparate regions of the world's second-biggest country. The newcomers' loyalties however, will be to the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform party, two unashamedly regional groups. The Bloc Quebecois seems set, according to the polls, to win at least 35 seats, and perhaps as many as 60. Its ultimate aim is independence for the francophone province. In the meantime, it promises to measure every initiative coming out of Ottawa against the interests of Quebec alone. The Reform party, whose support is concentrated on the prairies and British Columbia, could win 50 seats or more. The typical Reform supporter opposes official bilingualism, scorns the civil servants in faraway Ottawa and complains that Quebec gets more than its fair share of the Canadian pie. Reform says that it favours keeping Canada in one piece. But its terms for reshaping the federation are unacceptable to most Quebecois. Mr Ken Norrie, an economics professor at the University of Alberta, says that the party's leader, Mr Preston Manning, 'is making a lot of the fact that Reform are the ones to stand up to Quebec'. Of the old national parties, only the Liberals can look forward to significant representation in the new parliament. It is uncertain, however, whether they will win enough seats to form a majority government. A clear majority of Liberal MPs are also likely to be from a single province, Ontario. The Conservatives, who have held office for the past nine years, have had a disastrous campaign under their inexperienced leader, Ms Kim Campbell. They will be lucky to form the official opposition. The left-leaning NDP, which has 43 seats, faces near-annihilation, hit by unpopular policies pursued by regional NDP governments. In addition, its strident opposition to free trade with the US has failed to capture voters' imaginations. Although the Liberals will almost certainly have the satisfaction of forming the next government, they face a challenge of a kind which has never before confronted a Canadian government. 'Every issue henceforth will be defined in regional terms,' says Mr Donald Savois, a professor of politics at the University of Moncton in New Brunswick. 'That's nothing new, but in the past it was done in caucus and around the cabinet table. Now we'll see it on the floor of the House of Commons.' Canada's make-up is already a recipe for regional jealousies and mistrust. Living in a country which spans 4 1/2 time zones, the typical Newfoundlander or Quebecois feels more at home on the beaches of Florida than in Toronto or Vancouver. Some Nova Scotians still speak Gaelic and on the Pacific coast the dominant foreign influence is Chinese as a result of a huge influx of immigrants and capital from Hong Kong. The economic interests of different parts of the country are often poles apart. Alberta is a big oil and gas producer. But Ontario and Quebec, the most industrialised provinces, are energy consumers. Wheat farmers in Saskatchewan and Manitoba want to break down foreign trade barriers, while dairy farmers in Quebec want to maintain protection from imports. The country is also sharply divided between the four 'rich' provinces (Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta), and the less well-off ones. The Atlantic provinces, in particular, rely heavily on transfer payments from Ottawa. Unemployment insurance and welfare are virtually the only income at present for thousands of fishermen in Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, whose industry has been devastated by the near-collapse of North Atlantic cod stocks. A panoply of laws and customs, not to mention Canadians' famed ability to compromise, has so far held these tensions in check. A federal law, for instance, requires provinces to maintain minimum standards of health care without imposing user fees. Government contracts and patronage appointments are carefully balanced to avoid any appearance of favouritism. The BQ and the Reform Party are already questioning many of these practices. Both favour a greater devolution of powers from Ottawa to the provinces. There is no shortage of regional issues waiting to explode after the election. One of the earliest could be the politically charged struggle for survival between the two biggest airlines - Air Canada, which is based in Montreal, and Canadian Airlines International, whose operations are centred in Calgary and Vancouver. The present Conservative government has resisted pressure from both camps to take sides. The new government, especially if it is a minority one, will also have its hands full preparing the next federal budget. All the bigger parties have pledged some degree of fiscal restraint in an effort to contain a spiralling national debt. But the sparks could fly when tough decisions have to be made on where the savings are to be found. Many areas of potential spending cuts, from military bases to business subsidies and unemployment insurance, have strong regional overtones. In the remaining 10 days of the campaign the Liberals and Conservatives are expected to do everything they can to stop the build-up of support for the protest parties. Some observers dismiss the view that a strong performance by the BQ and the Reform Party necessarily spells the beginning of the end of a united Canada. The optimists point out that both parties are in large measure a haven for voters who simply want a change after the tough times of the past few years. The Bloc Quebecois, in particular, has yet to demonstrate that most Quebecois favour independence. Furthermore, many of the two parties' neophyte MPs could be out of their depth in Ottawa. Some of them have virtually no political experience and, until a month or two ago, seemed to have little chance of being elected. Whether the BQ and the Reform party are able to translate their expected electoral gains into more solid support for their ideologies may depend greatly on the adroitness of Mr Jean Chretien, the Liberals' leader. Mr Chretien is a staunch federalist who this year celebrates his 30th anniversary as an MP. Few would dispute that he faces what Mr Norrie describes as 'an absolutely hellish job' to contain regional animosities if and when he becomes prime minister.

			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 6 ERRORS COST CITY ALL-STARS IN 8-2 DEFEAT  </P> <P> For the City Section All-Star baseball team, the humor in Thursday night's game  against the Orange County All-Stars could not have been accurately measured by  a laugh-o-meter.  </P> <P> The number of errors committed gave a much more precise gauge.  </P> <P> The City team made six miscues in an 8-2 loss to Orange County at USC's Dedeaux  Field. All the Orange County runs were unearned.  </P> <P> "Does that say six or eight?," City 4-A Player of the Year Gino Tagliaferri of  Kennedy High said as he looked at the right-field score board.  </P> <P> Tagliaferri, normally a shortstop, played third base and started the comedy of  errors in the second inning when a throw from Chatsworth catcher Eric Johnson  bounced off his glove and into left field, allowing Laguna Hills' Rob Milo to  score.  </P> <P> The City added three errors in the third, giving Orange County five unearned  runs and a 6-0 advantage.  </P> <P> "Take those errors away and we're better," Tagliaferri said. "We're just out  here for fun anyway."  </P> <P> The City pushed across its first run in the fifth when Taft's Jason Shapiro,  who singled and stole second base, scored on Damian Valdivia's bloop single to  left.  </P> <P> Orange County added two more runs on two City errors in the sixth to take an  8-1 lead.  </P> <P> Westchester's Victor Darenzbourg, pinch-running for Adam Zutler of Taft in the  seventh, scored on a two-out single by University's Eric Alexander to account  for the final City run.  </P> <P> Six Orange County pitchers combined for a five-hitter and struck out 10 in the  nine-inning game.  </P> <P> In addition to the hits by Shapiro, Valdivia and Alexander, Mark Flores of  Fremont and Jesse Espinoza of Banning each singled for the City.  </P> <P> Chatsworth's Derek Wallace pitched the fourth and fifth innings for the City,  allowing no runs.  </P></p>

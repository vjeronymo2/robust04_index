			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / TV channel to cover all Commons debates A TELEVISION channel offering full coverage of the Commons will be launched on Monday when MPs return after the Christmas recess. The Parliamentary Channel is the creation of nine cable television companies and will be available to more than 200,000 homes with cable throughout the UK. The channel, which will be run as a non-profit venture, is similar to C-Span in the US which has provided coverage of Congress for the past 10 years and is available in about 52m homes. Ms Miranda Curtis, general manager of The Parliamentary Channel, said: 'The idea is to provide unadorned coverage of the proceedings as they happen. We will not provide analysis or commentary because other people can do that very much better than we can.' The channel will simply distribute the 'raw' feed provided by Commons Committee Television, an independent television producer, as long as the Commons sits. The channel will be run for the nine consortium members by United Artists Programming. The nine include leading cable television operators such as Comcast, Videotron and CUC, and US telephone companies such as Pacific Telesis and Southwestern Bell. Together they are providing the Pounds 2m in loans believed to be needed to allow the channel to break even within three years. Cable operators in turn will pay Pounds 1 a year for each subscriber, who will receive The Parliamentary Channel automatically as part of the basic package of channels. This year the channel will concentrate on coverage of the Commons. It hopes to add the Lords and parliamentary committees next year. A three-hours-a-day digest of the proceedings of the European parliament in Strasbourg should be available from September. The Parliamentary Channel would like to be able to broadcast from the Marco Polo satellite system launched by British Satellite Broadcasting - in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, had a significant stake - when the channel becomes available next year for public-service broadcasting uses. Ironically, the only interruption to the flow of debate on The Parliamentary Channel will come with the calling of a general election. When politics moves outside the chamber, the channel will go off the air for the six weeks of the campaign and will only come back when the MPs return to the Commons from the hustings.</p>

			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / C&amp;G warns members not to snub Lloyds Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society is to issue a blunt statement telling its members that if they do not approve the Pounds 1.8bn cash offer from Lloyds Bank, the board intends C&amp;G to remain a building society. The statement will dismay those C&amp;G members who believe the society could command a higher price or should become a public limited company on its own. But it is likely to increase the prospect that any member who wants a share of the cash incentives will vote for this deal, instead of holding out for the possibility of a larger handout from a new offer. The Pounds 1.8bn offered by Lloyds is to be shared mainly among investing members of more than two years' standing, and depositors. C&amp;G estimates that the average total payment to an individual will be about Pounds 2,000. If C&amp;G remains a society, there will be no distribution of cash to members. The warning that only the Lloyds bid will be put to members and that the board does not mean to give them a chance to consider other options is contained in the draft transfer document. It is due to be sent to all 1m-plus C&amp;G members late in February before they vote on the plans at a special general meeting on March 31. The move must be approved by two separate resolutions, from borrowers and investors. A simple majority of borrowers taking part in the vote is enough to pass their resolution, but the investors' resolution must be passed by both 75 per cent of those voting and 50 per cent of those eligible to vote. Before the deal was announced in April, Lloyds agreed with C&amp;G that the board would not put any other offer to its members for an undisclosed length of time to preclude a rival bid. Under building society legislation, a society's board does not have to give members the opportunity to vote on a proposed offer or takeover bid unless it wants to. By far the most likely prospect is that the Lloyds deal will go ahead. However, even the faintest suggestion that if it does not C&amp;G will stay as a society is likely to surprise senior executives in other societies. Many of them regard takeover by a bank as the logical conclusion to C&amp;G's strategy of concentrating on being a low-cost provider of mortgages and savings accounts, instead of diversifying into a broader range of personal financial services as other societies have done.</p>

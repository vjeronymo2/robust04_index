			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Sport: Drivers fuel the fireworks display - Formula One / A look at tomorrow's European grand prix and the potentially explosive clash between Hill and Schumacher If the script leading up to tomorrow's European Grand Prix near Jerez, Spain's sherry capital, was a fictional work, its writers would stand accused of hatching an implausible plot after too much of the local tipple. Even the bitter, headline-grabbing rivalries of several years ago, between former world champions Alain Prost and the late Ayrton Senna, are no match for the complex interplay of passions and personalities which will make tomorrow's start one of the most exciting - and potentially hazardous - in memory. The return of the moodily aggressive Nigel Mansell from IndyCar racing to drive the last three races of the season for Williams-Renault, alongside fellow Briton Damon Hill, has already generated high tension for tomorrow's race. Mansell, at 41 and after a lacklustre season's racing in the US, has a determination to prove wrong those critics who say he should retire - notwithstanding his claims this week that he only wants to make the end of the season 'more entertaining'. At stake for Mansell is the prospect of a permanent seat with Williams for the 1995 season instead of the talented young Scot, David Coulthard. Hill was already under psychological pressure before the teams even arrived at the undulating Jerez circuit. He, too, has been smarting from media rumblings - in his case that he is not fast enough or aggressive enough to make world champion material, and that he is in the running for this year's championship solely because of the two-race ban from which the German Michael Schumacher and his Benetton-Ford have just returned. In testing at Estoril in Portugal last week, Schumacher immediately returned to form, outpacing Hill by more than half-a-second, and Benetton team-mate Jos Verstappen by more than three seconds - the latter light-years in grand prix terms, equivalent to around 200 yards per lap. Hill, just one point behind Schumacher because of the ban, was not only contemplating the prospect of a daunting fight against the young German tomorrow; he was also worrying about how to make it plain that he is capable of keeping Mansell behind him on ability, not just team orders. But Schumacher has now raised the emotional ante sharply. All his resentment over the ban, and the unsubstantiated innuendo concerning cheating which has swirled around the Benetton team for months, boiled over before yesterday's qualifying into a withering verbal attack on Hill - a 'little man', he maintained, with unrealistic ambitions. Few had suspected the depth of the grievance he was nursing against Hill, over remarks made by the Englishman that 'no one should shed tears' over Schumacher's ban (for disregarding a black flag at the British grand prix in July). Hill, Schumacher made plain, should have kept quiet, like the other leading drivers. And with a disdain that must have felt desperately wounding to Hill, he maintained that Hill had become lead driver at Williams only by the accident of Senna's death and that Hill 'never was a No 1 driver. David Coulthard was quicker than him after three races. I do not have as much respect for him as other drivers.' As many in the Jerez paddock saw it, the outburst comprised a mix of understandable frustration and an increasingly arrogant posture from the 23-year-old German. Whatever the pros and cons, it has left scores to be settled tomorrow. As the principal of one of the leading teams, for obvious morale reasons not wishing to be identified, observes: 'Schumacher has a second in his pocket over everyone else. That's why everyone will be after him when his contract with Benetton ends at the end of 1995. Let's be clear: whoever gets him has won the championship. At the moment he is unique; there is no one in his class.' The slanging matches of recent hours may have sullied the atmosphere but the will-to-win among the rivals has become palpable. 'We're in for a terrific end to the championship. The racing is tough and that's the way it should be,' observes team boss Frank Williams. For a season that began in such sombre fashion, with the deaths of Senna and Roland Ratzenberger, it is finishing on a higher note than anyone could have expected amid the shock and the welter of safety-driven rule changes ushered in after the fatalities. The changes, to make circuits safer and cars slower and more predictable in their behaviour, may have been forced through unconstitutionally, as the teams claim, by the FIA, the sport's governing body, but they are acknowledged to have resulted in safer and more driveable cars. That said, 'they are still 800 horsepower powering 515 kilogrammes. They are still a man's car; no, not really, they're rocketships', says Williams. Next year, the rockets will be slower. With smaller engines - 3 litres, not 3.5; smaller wings, less downforce and more weight. It means, says Williams, that this year's cars 'will be total scrap at the end of the season'. The teams maintain that after next year's changes, there must be a prolonged period of rules stability to contain costs and take account of resources available. With some possible exceptions, it looks like they may get it. Relations between the FIA and the teams, so turbulent in the past, are acquiring a stability which most are hopeful will endure - even though there is a feeling among the top teams that the new rules may not achieve all the safety goals to which FIA president Max Mosley aspires. Only on the subject of refuelling is there real concern. The horrendous picture of the fireball which engulfed Benetton-Ford's pit earlier this season, when the refuelling hose slipped, shocked the world. Mosley and his cohorts must search their consciences as to whether it should be rescinded. On that occasion, the fire-fighting equipment worked admirably. It is unlikely to deal with the fireworks tomorrow.</p>

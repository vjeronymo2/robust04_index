			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> SOUND MINUS VISION;  </P> <P> CONCERT: DAVID BOWIE'S IMMINENT RETIREMENT OF HIS CLASSICS ON HIS 'SOUND +  VISION' TOUR HAS ALREADY LEFT THEM LIFELESS.  </P> <P> It's hard to see where you're going when you're looking back.  </P> <P> David Bowie's "Sound + Vision" tour offers a peculiar premise for a show by a  big rock star: Nothing but old songs, and on top of that it's their final spin.  After the tour, Bowie will no longer get lost in space as Major Tom, nor  celebrate the sci-fi rock star Ziggy Stardust, nor encourage his fans to face  their ch-ch-ch-changes.  </P> <P> Is this a gimmick to drum up interest in the tour? A daring gesture to put his  future artistry on the line (the idea is that shelving his old favorites will  force Bowie to rely on his new work)? Or is it a lazy way to stage an  undemanding concert, avoiding the challenge of combining his past with his  present?  </P> <P> Whatever the slippery star's true motivation, the result on stage at the Los  Angeles Sports Arena on Wednesday night was erratic at best: occasionally  inspired, mostly flat.  </P> <P> What could be wrong with a good, uncomplicated wallow in the canon of this rock  titan?  </P> <P> Well, the lesson is that a totally retrospective show, even one loaded with  major material and built-in drama, needs the balance and forward movement that  even some token new material would provide. Nobody went to the Stones shows to  hear stuff from "Steel Wheels," but scattered in the nostalgia, those songs at  least offered a convincing illusion of vitality.  </P> <P> Bowie's performance suggested that rather than bringing a special poignancy and  edge to his classics, their imminent retirement has already left them lifeless.  The knowledge that they're on their last legs deflates them instead of  enhancing them, and they didn't even generate much of the valedictory  sentimentality that should have been the cheapest emotion at their command.  </P> <P> Definitive, committed execution would have helped, but Bowie's band --  especially the overactive guitarist Adrian Belew -- specializes in mowing down  nuance, and the singer's interest level seemed to fluctuate radically.  </P> <P> He put the most into two of his landmarks, "Life on Mars?" and "Ziggy  Stardust," but he looked as ridiculous as he's said he feels in the Stonesy  glitter-rock of "Rebel, Rebel." He offered selections for fans of most of his  incarnations, with the emphasis on the post-"Ziggy" years.  </P> <P> On a stage flanked by carved columns and decorated with medieval-looking  statuary of beasts and angels, Bowie slipped in and out of a theatrical mode.  Most of the songs were enhanced by gigantic, ghostlike images projected on a  transparent screen: an effective integration of the star in the flesh with the  star's assorted public images and private emanations.  </P> <P> On the other hand, Bowie's casual manner was doubly refreshing after his last  tour's distancing stagecraft. He seemed even looser than he did at last year's  surprise Roxy show with his stripped-down group Tin Machine.  </P> <P> Often stationed on a stage extension that jutted into the audience, he smiled  and joked, sometimes almost nervously. He opened the post-intermission segment  by strolling out strumming with Belew while the house lights were still on, and  at the encore he even teased the crowd by saying: "I know who killed Laura  Palmer."  </P> <P> If he can create the same kind of intimacy when he plays Dodger Stadium on  Saturday, Bowie will be a real magician. But with this show, there's still no  way he can avoid being a lame duck.  </P></p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / International Company News: Alcoa considers first investment in Russia Aluminum Co of America (Alcoa) is considering buying a minority stake in a Russian aluminium smelting plant in Siberia in what would be its first investment in the former Soviet Union, Reuter reports from Michigan. While the initial investment would be small, it could grow to as much as Dollars 500m over the next 10 years, said Mr Paul O'Neill, chairman and chief executive officer. Mr O'Neill said he planned to visit the plant in Krasnoyarsk after the Thanksgiving holiday and would make a final decision within a couple of months. He added that the smelter had the capacity to produce 750,000 tonnes of aluminium per year. However, the plant had numerous environmental problems and would need to be upgraded to become more efficient. He said his visit would provide first-hand evidence of the investments needed to modernise the plant. 'I'm convinced it is a sufficiently real and interesting possibility that I need to go look at it myself.' A deadline for any possible deal is 'close enough that we're going to have to make a decision to put some real shareholder money at risk'.</p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Architects unveil new blueprint for benefits The Jobseeker's Allowance reflects continuity in government's labour market policy rather than a radical move forward. The grand claims made for it yesterday by the scheme's architects, Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, and Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, may be overstated. Since 1986 steps have been taken to to stamp out false benefit claims and increase pressure on the jobless to find work. The allowance may introduce a simpler way of assisting the unemployed. The allowance will replace unemployment benefit and income support for any eligible person without work for six months or less, and dealt with through a single office - the Jobcentre. The complex system run by the employment and social security departments with different rules, locations and bureaucracies will be swept away. The allowance will not be means-tested for the first six months. At present unemployment benefit is paid automatically for the first 12 months that a person is without work. The unemployed will have to sign an agreement to receive the allowance. This will require the recipient 'to be available for any work which they can reasonably be expected to do', very much in line with the present obligation on a claimant to be actively seeking work. The employment service will - as now - be able to insist on claimants participating in programmes designed to help the jobless back to work. After six months an unemployed person with no money or only a small amount will qualify automatically for the allowance, but everybody else will be means-tested, while those with capital resources of more than Pounds 8,000 will not be eligible. The government estimates that 90,000 claimants will lose benefit entitlement in the first year of the allowance, with a further 150,000 having to switch to means-tested benefits, often at reduced rates. Mr Portillo may be keen to increase the incentive for the jobless to find work but his white paper falls short of this. At present, an unemployed person can keep just Pounds 5 a week of any money earned while receiving benefits, after which they are cut on a pound-for-pound basis of earnings. This provision has not been changed for six years nor will it be under the new allowance. The white paper says: 'Such limits on earnings are necessary to ensure people do not receive income from benefit and part-time work to the point where there is no incentive for them to move off benefit and into full-time work if the opportunity arises.' But the government is introducing a 'back-to-work bonus' for anybody unemployed for three months or more, built up as a lump-sum entitlement based on part-time earnings. As now, they can still keep the first Pounds 5 a week of any part-time earnings while a couple retains the first Pounds 10. In addition, for every pound earned over that level they will build up a 50p credit entitlement paid as a bonus only when the jobseeker secures a full-time job. But this means a jobseeker will receive no extra money immediately for part-time work, hardly an incentive. The punitive element in the new allowance also reflects a continuation of the existing policy, although the white paper recognises that only 'a small minority seek to abuse the benefit system'. The allowance will not be paid to those who fail to attend an employment service interview. Those who leave work voluntarily or through misconduct or who refuse a job will be disqualified from benefit for up to 26 weeks. How the allowance will operate depends on how the employment service administers it. There will need to be room for local discretion if hardship is to be avoided.</p>

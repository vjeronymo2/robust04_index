			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Japan raises cartel fine JAPAN's ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) have agreed that the maximum fine for violators of anti-monopoly laws should be raised from Y5m (Pounds 22,000) to Y100m, far below the Y300m earlier proposed by the FTC, writes Robert Thomson. Japanese companies had complained that the FTC's original proposal was excessive. However, the US had demanded that Japan revise the schedule of fines for violators and increase the staff at the commission. It is expected that the legislation will be presented to parliament later this month.</p>

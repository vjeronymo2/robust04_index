			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATORS SEEK INCREASE IN AID TO EAST BLOC  </P> <P> Arguing that President Bush's request for additional aid for Eastern Europe is  not enough, Senate Democrats unveiled legislation Tuesday to give an additional  $511 million to fund democratic reform movements in East Bloc countries over  the next three years.  </P> <P> The money, which the Democrats suggested could be funded by further cuts in the  defense budget, would be added to a $738-million aid package approved last  November for Poland and Hungary.  </P> <P> Announcing what amounted to the Democrats' formal response to the Bush  Administration on the East Bloc aid issue, Senate Foreign Relations Committee  Chairman Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.) said the new funds would be used to assist  democratic reform efforts in East Germany, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria  and Yugoslavia -- countries not covered under the Poland-Hungary bill.  </P> <P> The legislation, which calls for $211 million more than the Administration  requested for Eastern Europe in the budget it submitted to Congress on Monday,  logically would be financed by the so-called "peace divided," Sen. Paul Simon  (D-Ill.) said.  </P> <P> "We have spent something like 2 or 3 trillion dollars on defense since World  War II to protect us from the military threat posed by Eastern Europe," Simon  said.  </P> <P> "Now that this threat has diminished, it is extremely important for the  security of this nation that we gamble on freedom in Eastern Europe."  </P> <P> Pell's proposal would use the largest portion of the aid, $250 million, to fund  U.S. participation in the new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development  being established to help East Bloc countries move toward democracy.  </P> <P> Another $80 million is earmarked for emergency food aid for Romania while $43  million would be used to promote the development of non-communist political  parties in several East Bloc states. A portion of that latter amount -- $10  million -- would be distributed as soon as the bill becomes law in order to  help emerging political parties prepare for upcoming elections in their  countries.  </P> <P> Pell described the bill, which would also liberalize trade restrictions and  provide non-economic forms of assistance such as management training to the  Soviet Union, as a "modest start" in addressing the profound political changes  and growing economic needs of Eastern Europe. He predicted that the amount  being proposed may well increase as the bill winds its way through Congress "in  view of the profound interest" that lawmakers share in "supporting positive  developments in Eastern Europe."  </P></p>

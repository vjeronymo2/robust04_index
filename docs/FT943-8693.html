			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Arts: Musical apocalypse and a biography - David Murray reviews John Tavener's Prom commission and Mike Westbrook's modern jazz-inspired opera We had two ambitious pieces of music-theatre at the weekend, on Friday and Sunday: respectively Mike Westbrook's opera Coming Through Slaughter at the Queen Elizabeth Hall (part of the 'Now You See It' non-festival), and John Tavener's Prom commission The Apocalypse. The latter had massive, well-rehearsed forces for the Albert Hall - all over it, indeed; Westbrook's piece used just seven singers, a string quartet and a trombone, and still looked a bit starved of rehearsal time (or money, or both). Yet it was easily ten times as interesting. That was because in his devotion to Russian Orthodoxy, Tavener is more anxious than ever not to be 'interesting'. In this Apocalypse, a biblical paraphrase by his spiritual advisor Mother Thekla, the composer himself vanishes. It consists of nine 'Ikons of the Revelation', vignettes or summaries from St. John's visionary text, with a prologue and epilogue, and interludes for a string quartet playing slow chromatic glissandi. Every part of it is ritualised: the plain choral chanting or shouting, the soloists' roles (sometimes monotone declamation, more often up-and-down scalic lines ornamented with Byzantine melismata), the bursts of heavy brass or gongs and tam-tam from the top gallery. Nearly all the music is very slow. The effects are less dramatic than starkly heraldic - or 'iconic', I suppose; nothing develops. It took two-and-a-quarter hours, without an interval. In short, unearthly peace reigned while we were invited to meditate upon the devotional words. ('A wonder in Heaven] A great red dragon - Seven heads, ten horns. And he waits to eat up the child.') Tavener's work has been confined to deciding how to organise and divide the text between his performers and their prescribed manners, and to finding suitable sonorities for weighty moments and for punctuation. The composer is never heard to intervene; no personal accent is detectable, not even the self-effacing winsomeness of The Protecting Veil, his unexpected hit in the 1989 Proms. Richard Hickox conducted the City of London Sinfonia, the Sinfonia Chorus and the New London Children's Choir with loyal efficiency. Among the many soloists, Thomas Randle's tenor St. John was unflaggingly fervent, Patricia Rozario and Ruby Philogene melting (as the Woman Clothed with the Sun and the Whore of Babylon), the counter-tenors Christopher Robson and David Hurley coolly stylish. To 'review' this music as music, however, would be to review the mere scaffolding for something else. Westbrook's modern-jazz-idiom opera has nothing in common with The Apocalypse but its length (and to a lesser extent, its slow tempi). It was inspired by Michael Ondaatje's fictional biography of 'Buddy' Bolden, a jazz cornettist of such early vintage that he left no recordings, and about whom there are few established facts. After bursting a blood vessel in his last Easter Parade in New Orleans, he was declared insane and lived in a state hospital for his last 24 years, working as a barber. Ondaatje imagined the rest, and Michael Morris has drawn on the novel for a chain of 16 encapsulated scenes-from-the-life. Most of those amount to poetic solo songs, bluesy in Westbrook's modern vein (jazz-chromatic, doleful or wry); there are a few ensembles which raise the pulse. The overall effect is quite like Weill's original Mahagonny Songspiel, with the difference that where Mahagonny's characters are symbolic stereotypes, Westbrook's are treated as historical people with unseen histories. Morris's economical staging, constrained further by the singers mostly having to sing from their scores, left a lot to be taken on trust (or read up from the programme-note). One would like to see the piece more vividly set out in, say, the Donmar. It has no routine or negligible number, and the best of them are strongly inventive. The cast were first-rate: Denise Hector strong and dignified as Buddy's wife, bright Dorothy Ross as his transient mistress, monumental bass-baritone Keel Watson as the old friend who haunts his steps. Above all Wills Morgan's Buddy, a study in charismatic, angst-ridden sulkiness and bafflement, also displayed a youthful mastery of articulating his music through his words, and filling the words with sense and feeling. This is a dramatic singer of uncommon promise.</p>

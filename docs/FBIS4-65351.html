			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Albrecht Hinze: "Jens Reich, Candidate for the </F> Federal Presidency: A Challenger by Training"]    [Text] Berlin, end of April--Is the way already the goal?  Of course, Jens Reich himself does not contemplate that he could  become the next federal president, and has never done so. In the  end, at the third or fourth ballot in the federal assembly on  Whit Sunday, Johannes Rau and Roman Herzog will settle this  between themselves; in this regard the physician, scientist, and  essayist has no illusions. Nevertheless, the former GDR civil  rights supporter regards his candidacy as an independent,  lateral entrant for the succession of Richard von Weizsaecker by  no means as superfluous and unsuccessful. He perceives his  candidature as a spiritual, social, and political challenge,  which corresponds to that of German unification and could help  accomplish it. Accordingly, the way would really be more  important than the goal.    But Jens Reich explicitly does not want to be "a combat or  protest candidate of the `Ossis' [eastern Germans]." Yet this is  absolutely how many eastern Germans understand him. Differently  from the western German presidential candidates, he, so it seems  to them, brings the greatest insight to the designation and  explanation of their social and economic insecurities and  worries, their history and their self-perception. His  biography--the long hesitant perseverance in the private  niche--is also something with which many eastern Germans can  identify. That all of Reich's appeals to the former GDR citizens  to stop complaining now and to put aside inferiority complexes  are hardly being noticed is another matter. When Reich  interprets eastern German conditions in the west, he encounters,  as a rule, interested and sympathetic attention, especially  among intellectuals. In the east he frequently earns applause  from all segments of the audience, frequently standing ovations.  There would be no doubt who should hold the highest state  office. There people also accept with indulgence that Reich,  when he lets his thoughts run while speaking, does not complete  a sentence quite conclusively. Or that he quite openly admits  not to understand anything about an issue.  <H5>  The Play Dead Reflex </H5>   When Reich at the beginning of February in the National  Theater of Weimar on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the  Weimar National Assembly talked with opponents Hildegard  Hamm-Bruecher and Roman Herzog about federal presidents and  constitution, unity in Germany and Europe, and a few other  things, he would bave become federal president if the applause  could have decided it. Subsequently Reich returns to Berlin by  train traveling second class and, impressed, talks about the  witty, baroque Herzog, with whom one can brilliantly and  ingeniously discuss society and the state in Germany.    Toward the end of the 1980's, a Thomas Asperger occasionally  published articles in OSTEUROPA-FORUM or in the cultural journal  LETTRE INTERNATIONAL. Nobody knew the author. The Ministry of  State Security, too, was at a loss. The writer had to be someone  from East Germany, that is how well informed and sympathetically  he dealt with the situation and the consciousness of the GDR  people under the living conditions of real socialism. It was  Jens Georg Reich, at that time professor of medicine at Humboldt  University and scientist at the Center for Molecular Biology of  the GDR Academy of Sciences, who concealed himself behind the  pseudonym. Thomas Asperger was a school friend of Reich in  Halberstadt, who was torn apart shortly after the war by a blind  shell.    At the beginning of 1988, Reich had found his GDR niche in  the "Friday Circle," a group of scientists who got angry or  amused themselves about the conditions in the country, hardly  perceptible to the outside and without effects. The Catholic  Reich finally entered internal emigration when in 1984 he lost  his post as director of the Molecular Biology Center because he  refused to join the SED or a coalition party. Today Reich admits  that he and others, against their better judgment, had resigned  themselves too long to a helpless, opportunistic "play dead  reflex," one should have protested strongly much sooner. People  in the east now and then take offense at such a self-reproach.  It contradicts the private and collective guilt defense  mechanism built up for self-defense.    In a politically effective and visible manner the names of  the physicians Eva and Jens Reich surfaced for the first time  under the then-sensational and revolution-triggering appeal "The  Time Is Ripe," which the beginning citizen movement New Forum  was able to publish still illegally on 9 September 1989--with  unexpected success: More than 200,000 people signed the appeal  within weeks. This was not yet an appeal for an insurrection,  but rather a request to the rulers to reform socialism  democratically in a social dialogue.    Jens Reich became visible publicly on 4 November 1989. It  was  the large demonstration of perhaps 500,000 people at the  Alexander Square in Berlin, who scanned "We are the people." A  slim, tall man stepped up to the microphone, in the early  fifties, with thick glasses and short-cropped grey hair. In a  soft, almost brittle voice, but in clear, precise language,  Reich demanded from a platform on a truck "elections that  deserve this name," freedom for dissenters, the observation of  constitutional rights, which after all existed in the GDR  according to the law. In those few days before the opening of  the borders on November 9, 1989, according to Reich's  assessment, there existed the chance of a real revolution, the  immediate overthrow of the SED. Already at that time, however,  the citizens movement was disunified and indecisive. The change  possibly would not have proceeded so peacefully.    As many others in the citizens movement, Jens Reich would  have wished for the GDR, at the end still transformed into a  democracy, a longer and more self-conscious life, so that there  could have been more thorough negotiations about unification.  Reich would have preferred a confederation with the long-term  goal of state unity. Thus he voted with the People's Chamber  caucus against the accession of the GDR to the Federal Republic  already on 3 October 1990. This took place on 23 August 1990. At  that time, even the unification treaty had not yet been  concluded, which was and is criticized as ill-advised and hasty.  Today Reich says the financial and economic consequences were  foreseeable. According to him, the mental consequences, in the  west as well as in the east, proved to be much more devastating.  The foreign policy security arrangements by Kohl and Genscher,  on the other hand, he regards as nothing short of masterful.    Paradoxically, it was Federal Chancellor Kohl who provided  the impetus for the so uncomfortable candidacy of the private  person Jens Reich. Kohl deemed, it was perhaps at the beginning  of 1993, that the next federal president, in order to promote  the unity of Germany, should be an eastern German. In so doing,  however, he had hardly in mind a representative of the citizens  movement (especially not a leftist), but politicians like Berndt  Seite or Heinz Eggert, and in the end--already under  increasingly hardening political pressure from his party--the  unhappy Steffen Heitmann. Even the social democrat Richard  Schroeder would have been a possibility if the SPD had not  staked out party policy interests with the nomination of Rau.  Thereupon in June of last year the intellectuals from  "Frankfurter Einmischung" [Frankfurt Intervention] made their  appearance. The party-encompassing association, conservative in  terms of its values, whose members include politicians of all  camps, journalists, historians, and sociologists, proposed,  crosswise to the spectrum of the parties, a number of well-known  people. Ignatz Bubis refused, as did Hans Magnus Erzenberger.  Jens Reich, by contrast, did not refuse. After 2.5 years of  resignation--the experiences in and with the People's Chamber  had contradicted his ideals too strongly--he returned to  politics.    The reaction of the federal parties ranged from indifference  to intransigence. But in all of them there turned out to be  secret sympathizers. Only Alliance 90/Greens were receptive to  the idea, without, however, elevating Reich as official  candidate. Now he is a candidate for the highest state office  and in so doing can count on a great deal of sympathy, but  hardly has organization at his disposal and lacks any  traditional party policy linkage and experience. Of all the  candidates, Reich certainly has the greatest and most  far-reaching visions of citizen democracy, for which, however,  he is reproached--as naive, illusionary visions. He takes in  this reproach and turns it around: In his "belief in rational,  emotional, democratic dialogue" and in his "faith in public  discourse", he says, he likes to be naive, for everything else  appears to him as "cynical or fundamentalist."  <H5>  Fourteen Theses for the Future </H5>   His conceptions of how he would manage as federal president,  Reich has depicted in a multitude of speeches, discussions,  interviews, articles, and essays, and three books on this  subject are on the market. Moreover, he has presented 14  programmatic theses for a "Future Project Germany": The task of  the federal president "is to stimulate social developments, to  keep open suppressed topics, to promote discourse, to exert a  moderating and integrating effect, and in so doing to introduce  his own person and opinion." Moreover, Reich regards it as  appropriate and just that, after 40 years of dictatorship in the  GDR and because of the agitating consequences of unity in  eastern Germany, the next federal president should place his  center of gravity there. Quite in the tradition of the citizens  movement, he champions the idea that the Basic Law should  include social constitutional goals as well as elements of  direct democracy. With his thoughts about the responsible use of  gen-technology and the protection of Germany as a location for  science, Reich has--in the sense of the discourse advocated by  him--provided impulses for public discussions.    The registered association "Buergerpraesident [Citizens'  President] Jens Reich" in Berlin supports the candidate with a  little organization and coordination. Young socialists, young  liberals, young members of the CDU/CSU, and young Greens have  united. There people console themselves in the face of the  foreseeable failure in the Federal Assembly with the promising  consideration: Could it not be that, before the third ballot,  Rau and Herzog demonstratively forego the votes of the PDS and  the Republikaner respectively? Then candidate Reich perhaps  could get a chance to make his move. As has been said before,  the candidate himself does not believe in this.</p>

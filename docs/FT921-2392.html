			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Exporters keen for CIS deals find back-up lacking - Problems of finance are proving a brake on business with republics of the former Soviet Union THE PROSPECT of doing deals in the fast-liberalising central European countries that used to make up the Soviet Union is tantalising. The reality is more sobering, and the single most critical barrier is finance: the freezing of joint-venture bank accounts, announced early in March, is the latest contributor to chronic uncertainty. Exporters keen to do deals are anxiously awaiting agreement between the International Monetary Fund and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) on a programme to manage debt repayments, share debt responsibilities between the republics and identify sovereign guarantors. But they would be rash to expect the IMF programme to provide the transparency and security they seek. In view of already giddying levels of exposure to possible CIS default in countries such as Germany and Italy, there can at best be a cautious and selective resumption of business. To pinpoint good business in the chaotic atmosphere of the former Soviet Union is a perplexing matter. Trading and financial institutions have disappeared overnight. People experienced in foreign trade are on the move. Privatisation plans are creating turmoil in Russia. Inexperienced officials in other republics are wrestling with the awesome task of filling the void left as Moscow-led institutions have been cut adrift. Raw material supplies to factories are in jeopardy wherever they can be sold to the west for foreign exchange. Banks that can be trusted as sovereign guarantors for projects are almost totally absent outside Russia. Even government-backed loans, such as the Pounds 280m offered to Russian President Boris Yeltsin by UK Prime Minister John Major during a London visit in January, are blocked until the IMF has agreed a programme with the former Soviet republics. This would have to include identification of sovereign guarantors. Already a queue of more than 300 UK projects hopes to tap the British loan. It is clear that even the most worthy and viable of projects can expect little in the way of export credit cover. Country by country throughout the west, an uncommon unanimity exists over their unwillingness to provide export credit cover. Instead of 'caveat emptor' the watchword is 'caveat vendor'.</p>

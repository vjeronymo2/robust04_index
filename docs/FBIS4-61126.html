			<p>BFN     [Text] With 35 votes in favor and 31 against, the Riigikogu  readopted today in an unamended form the law on presidency,  which the president had failed to promulgate. In his  resolution, President Lennart Meri referred to the law on  presidency being in conflict with the Constitution because the  law on presidency allows the prime minister the right to be the  first to decide whether state requirements are urgent. The  Riigikogu first adopted the law on presidency on 23 March this  year, and the president failed to promulgate it [words  indistinct].</p>

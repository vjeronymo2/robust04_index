			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NCR WILL WOO BIG HOLDERS IN BID TO DEFEAT AT&amp;T OFFER  </P> <P> NCR Corp. said Thursday that its top executives will be meeting soon with  representatives of the firm's major institutional shareholders to build support  for their rejection of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's $6.1-billion  hostile takeover bid.  </P> <P> NCR's board also met Thursday but issued no statement.  </P> <P> Company officials said the board will respond to AT&amp;T's $90-per-share  tender offer by Dec. 19, the legal deadline.  </P> <P> NCR's aim is to get its institutional holders -- who NCR officials claim own  about 60% of the firm's stock -- to back the company's defiance of AT&amp;T's  bid and defeat any proxy fight that AT&amp;T might trigger.  </P> <P> However, analysts said, NCR has a hard sell. "To an NCR shareholder, the  AT&amp;T offer has got to look very good," said Craig Ellis, an analyst at C.  J. Lawrence Inc. in New York. "The NCR board has got to have a plan to come up  with something better if they expect their shareholders to back them."  </P></p>

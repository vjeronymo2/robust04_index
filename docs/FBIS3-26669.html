Speaking at a news conference, Kozyrev said that Russia is  taking a vigilant attitude toward the position of aid-raiding  Bosnia-Herzegovina because such a policy would distract the  international efforts for a political solution.    The minister stressed that NATO's action should be brought  into U.N. peacekeeping plan.    According to Kozyrev, U.N. Security Council will hold a  meeting on Monday [14 February] to determine NATO's tasks and  duties in Bosnia.    NATO's ultimatum to Bosnian warring factions should be  approved as a resolution of the Security Council which will  allow some countries or regional organizations to have a hand in  ending the Bosnian war, the minister added.</p>

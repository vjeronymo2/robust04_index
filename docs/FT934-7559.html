			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Miners' consortium in jeopardy THE FUTURE of Monktonhall Mineworkers, the consortium of miners who lease a British Coal pit near Edinburgh, was uncertain last night after the miners decisively rejected a takeover offer from RJB Mining, the quoted Nottinghamshire mining company. Monktonhall also dismissed Quayle Munro, the Edinburgh-based merchant bank which was the consortium's financial adviser. There were indications that the consortium was holding talks with another, unnamed, investor. RJB Mining had offered the 167 miners Pounds 1,000 each for their shares, for which each had paid Pounds 10,000. Quayle Munro had warned the miners that if they refused the offer, and in the absence of a rival bid, the company would be likely to go into liquidation. Monktonhall has net liabilities of Pounds 2m and lost Pounds 3.7m in the year ended May 1993. Although RJB Mining was approached by Quayle Munro for Monktonhall, and its offer was recommended by the consortium's board, it was seen by many of the miners as a hostile takeover. RJB, which had been guaranteeing the workers' wages since September, insisted on 90 per cent acceptance. RJB said last night it would not extend the offer. The number of acceptances was not revealed. The rejection means the mine will not get the Pounds 3m investment RJB had offered, while an offer of finance from the Department of Trade and Industry could also lapse. But Lothian regional council said last night its own package of assistance would be available 'to support any credible proposals that are acceptable to the men'. Mr Ian Jones, Quayle Munro's chief executive, said there had not been 'the necessary close liaison with the directors of Monktonhall and ourselves'.</p>

Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The rule may have moderate economic impact upon a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. The following regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Conflict of Interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Purpose.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA is strengthening its existing Organizational Conflict of Interest EPAAR Clause and adding additional coverage in the EPAAR to guard against conflicts of interest in work performed under Superfund contracts. Prime contractors, non-exempted subcontractors and consultants working under EPA Superfund contracts will be required to have employees working on requirements under contract sign confidentiality agreements. Prime contractors will be required to: notify EPA immediately of any conflicts of interest regarding contractor or subcontractor personnel working on the EPA contract; submit to EPA either a one time per site certification for work issued under a work assignment or an annual certification concerning disclosure of conflicts of interest; and seek Contracting Officer approval of other work when such work might conflict with work performed under an EPA contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Affected small entities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Small entities awarded EPA Superfund contracts or small entities serving as subcontractors or consultants under EPA Superfund contracts will be affected. Presently, approximately 75 small entities are performing such contracts and subcontracts. It is impossible to estimate the number of small businesses that ultimately will receive EPA Superfund contracts or serve as subcontractors or consultants under these contracts and, thereby, be affected by this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Description of projected reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We estimate that businesses generally maintain data on the work previously performed by the company in their normal business practices which may also be used to prevent conflicts of interest. For entities that maintain this data, there will be limited additional costs associated with reviewing, evaluating, and reporting work previously performed and future work being considered that may pose a conflict of interest. EPA does not require any special type of system to identify and report conflicts. Each contractor determines its own procedures for searching and identifying conflicts of interest, and in some cases, it may already have a process in place to identify conflicts in its commercial business. An automated system to store and retrieve information is not required in order to perform the functions associated with a conflict of interest system. We anticipate that the scope of a company's procedures would be commensurate with the company's size and complexity, and for small businesses any system should be less complex and detailed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since a significant portion of small business participation in EPA programs occurs under subcontracts for classes of work which are exempt under EPA's conflict of interest clauses, many small businesses will not be affected by the provisions of this rule. Moreover, at any time, a small business operating as either a prime contractor or a subcontractor may request waiver of clause requirements for non-discretionary work which poses a minimal risk of conflict of interest. The total impact upon small business should be significantly less than the impact upon large business.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Depending on the specific contract, contractors will either be required to certify annually that all actual or potential conflicts of interest have been reported to EPA during the preceding year of the contract or certify on a work assignment basis for work first performed at a site. The significant change to the final rule, in which certifications have been reduced from three to one, results in a substantial reduction in the total effort required to comply with the requirements of this rule. Because small businesses generally have less complex organizational structures and less data to maintain and search, the burden associated with search and certification requirements for small business should be substantially less than the burden applicable to a large business.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA anticipates that any cost increases experienced by these entities may be chargeable to Government contracts under the provisions of FAR Part 31.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to concerns about data and certification burden which have been addressed above, a comment was submitted expressing concern that responding to the questionnaire, which EPA included in a January 1990, memorandum regarding conflicts of interest, would add significantly to the contractor burden. As stated in Part B of the preamble to this rule, General Comments, this memorandum has been superseded, and the questionnaire is not required. Another commenter expressed concern that the burden associated with requests for future contracting had not been considered in the calculation of burden. In fact, the burden associated with requests for future contracting was considered in this analysis and is reflected in the calculations contained in the initial and final Information Collection Request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

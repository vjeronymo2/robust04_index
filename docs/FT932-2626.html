			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Young thug takes on old KGB man: The increasing political turmoil in Azerbaijan THE latest political crisis in oil-rich Azerbaijan, in which the president's position has been threatened, can be blamed on a simple but powerful confluence of events - the combined wrath of an old communist and a young thug. The ambitions of the two men now threaten to bring new violence to the Caspian Sea nation of 7m people. 'The old government is going to be wiped out, and we don't know what will replace it,' said a diplomat in Baku. 'It's complete chaos and anarchy here.' The main reason for pessimism in Baku is that the domestic crisis is being exploited by Azerbaijan's adversary in the disputed mountain enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. For the last two days ethnic Armenians from the enclave have taken advantage of Azerbaijan's political turmoil to attack the key town of Agdam, which may fall. If it does diplomats believe President Abulfaz Elchibey could lose his job, as have his three predecessors who suffered military failures in Nagorno-Karabakh. The old communist is Mr Heydar Aliyev, Azerbaijan's former KGB and Communist party leader who tried three years ago to return to Azeri politics, only to be snubbed and humiliated by the republic's new communist leaders. Mr Aliyev's revenge came on Tuesday when he won election as the powerful chairman of parliament. This left him second only to the beleaguered Mr Elchibey, over whom Mr Aliyev towers as a politician. Diplomats believe Mr Aliyev will now manoeuvre parliament into appointing his ideological allies to the prime minister's office and to two other key ministries, and probably also force new national elections to cement his power. Mr Aliyev has exploited the chaos caused by the young thug - Mr Surat Husseynov, the charismatic ousted commander of a 3,000-strong private army. Last month, Mr Husseynov was relieved of his command in Nagorno-Karabakh after a string of Armenian victories there. His revenge began two weeks ago, when he seized control of Azerbaijan's second-largest city, Gyanja, forcing Mr Elchibey's prime minister and parliamentary leader to resign. Now Mr Husseynov is demanding that Mr Elchibey, too, should quit. He has established a base 50 miles west of Baku. So far the government has resisted his demands for entry to the capital, but Mr Husseynov yesterday continued to capture new territory, and he now controls more than half the country. Mr Elchibey is being pressured by aides to use force if Mr Husseynov does not end his insurrection. However, the president enjoys little support in the military and it is unclear how strong a campaign the government could muster against the 35-year-old warlord. Oil company executives who have been pressing Azerbaijan to sign exploration deals have fled the republic because of Mr Husseynov's insurrection. Mr Husseynov, however, seems intent on capturing still more territory, while the Armenians battle to seize yet another Azeri town. If either succeeds, even the masterful Mr Aliyev may be able to do little for his native land.</p>

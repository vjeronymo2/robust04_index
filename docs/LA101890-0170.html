			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> D.A. LOOKS AT REPORT NAVY DUMPS WASTE  </P> <P> The district attorney's office said Wednesday it will investigate allegations  that the Navy has illegally dumped toxic and radioactive waste from its base in  Port Hueneme at an Oxnard landfill.  </P> <P> The allegations were raised in a letter sent last week to Sheriff John  Gillespie by John Cobian, a professional court interpreter who is running for  mayor in Oxnard.  </P> <P> In the Oct. 11 letter, Cobian said he was told by Navy employees that yellow  dump trucks from the base had taken radioactive soil from an Antarctica  experiment to the Bailard Landfill on Gonzales Road.  </P> <P> "It is my understanding that the placing of hazardous waste where it may  eventually contaminate the underground water supply is a crime and comes under  the jurisdiction of the Sheriff's Department," the letter said.  </P> <P> In a written statement, the Navy denied Cobian's allegations, saying it only  transports "non-hazardous solid waste, such as cardboard, wood, plastic, empty  food containers . . ." to the landfill.  </P> <P> However, the statement said crushed rock from a reactor site in Antarctica had  been used to pave an equipment storage area on the base. The rock contains  "extremely low levels of radioactivity," according to the statement.  </P> <P> A sheriff's spokesman said Cobian's allegations were turned over to the  district attorney's office because the Sheriff's Department lacks the technical  expertise to investigate such allegations.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Greg Brose, a supervisor for the county Consumer and  Environment Protection Division, said he will lead an investigation to  determine if the allegations are accurate. HUGO MARTIN  </P></p>

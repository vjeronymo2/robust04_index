			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Kalamazoo in black and resumes acquisition search KALAMAZOO, the computer services and printed systems group, returned to profit in its second half and has resumed its search for acquisitions, concentrating on the European computer services market. Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 1.8m in the year to March 31, on turnover of Pounds 56.7m, after a loss of Pounds 86,000 at halfway. The group has changed its year-end, so there is no strictly comparable period, but in the eight months to March 1992 it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 611,000 on turnover of Pounds 38.5m. The total dividend is maintained at 2.1p net per share with a final distribution of 1.85p. Earnings per share, however, were pushed down by abnormally high tax charges, coming out at 1.6p. Mr Peter Harrop, chairman, was relaxed about dipping into reserves to pay the dividend, noting that the group now had no borrowings and that the order book was picking up. In the last financial year, all the profits came from the computer services division, while the printed systems business undertook a painful readjustment to reduced markets. This meant the loss of 100 out of 480 jobs and led to exceptional costs for the period of Pounds 1.53m. There were also extraordinary debits amounting to Pounds 863,000 which related largely to the write-off of loan notes received as part of a US acquisition which was subsequently resold. During the year, Kalamazoo made two acquisitions for the computer services business. Since the year end it has acquired a Dutch company, specialising in motor dealer computerisation, the group's core sector. Now, said Mr Harrop, the group is looking for companies to buy in France and Germany, observing that, with the UK economy starting to recover and with the continental economies declining, 'we are in the right place at the right time'.</p>

			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH AIRLINE FARES OUT OF JOHN WAYNE ARE UNJUSTIFIED  </P> <P> I couldn't believe my ears. American and United Airlines want $1,159 to fly  from Orange County to Chicago and back midweek.  </P> <P> Mind you, this is for a trip in August. In March, they charged $972 to fly  round-trip midweek from Orange County to Dallas-Ft. Worth.  </P> <P> The same trip to Chicago from Los Angeles instead of (John Wayne Airport)  Orange County comes in at $786. Will someone from either American or United  Airlines tell me how you can possibly justify these fares?  </P> <P> For those of us who still think competition is a good thing, apparently it does  not exist out of Orange County. Duke, where are you when we need you?  </P> <P> LAURA B. DIETZ  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

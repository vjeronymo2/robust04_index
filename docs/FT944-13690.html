			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (4): Tumbling prices ignite market / A look at the rapid growth of the portable computer Lightweight 'notebook' personal computers and modem communications devices have made portable computing a reality for a growing number of mobile professionals in the past five years. Advances in semiconductor technology and the miniaturisation of other components such as hard disc storage devices have enabled PC manufacturers to pack most of the functions of a desktop PC into an A4-sized notebook package weighing about 6lb and priced at Pounds 1,500 or less. Colour notebook PCs using 'dual scan' technology have become more affordable and easier to use. Most machines are now powered by fast Intel 486 processors, have large 200Mb or bigger hard disks and credit-card sized PCMICA expansion slots for peripherals such as fax-modems. Battery life has been extended through the use of low-power chips, power-saving features and improved battery technology. For example, Dell Computer's new Latitude range includes a dual Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) battery option which extends battery life to a maximum 17.5 hours. Other manufacturers have developed machines for niche applications. For example, Toshiba offers a model that includes a CD-Rom drive, stereo speakers, detachable keyboard and facilities to make multimedia presentations while travelling and Cannon has machines which incorporate a bubble jet printer for those who require paper print-outs but do not want to carry a separate printer. Fujitsu is one of several manufacturers which have launched lightweight 'tablet' PCs where data is input on to a flat screen using an electronic pen pointing device instead of a keyboard. Fujitsu's Stylistic 500, launched earlier this month, weighs 2.6lb and is designed to appeal to markets such as insurance, transportation, utilities, consumer packaged goods, pharmaceuticals and health care. For engineers and others requiring the power of a workstation while away from the office, Tadpole Technology has developed a range of high performance SPARCbook 3 laptop-size portables. Target applications and markets include computer-aided design, financial services, geographic information systems, equipment test and maintenance and telecommunications. Other machines have a modular design, enabling screens and hard discs to be swapped easily and some, such as AST's range of Ascentia 900, can be easily hooked up to larger screens or office local area networks using a docking station or port replicators. Technical improvements, together with tumbling prices, have turned portable computers into the fastest-growing segment of the world computer market. According to Dataquest, the market research organisation, portable computer sales - mostly of notebook or even smaller sub-notebook machines - were worth Dollars 3.6bn last year. In volume terms notebook computer sales in Europe grew by more than 18 per cent to 1.33m with four vendors - Compaq, Toshiba, IBM and Apple - accounting for 59.5 per cent of the market. However, portable computer sales still represented only 17.4 per cent of the total European PC market. 'Although portable computing represents only a minority of the total PC market, more and more people are adopting it in one form or another, particularly in a business environment,' says Jeffrey Goldberg, a Dataquest consultant. 'The notebook computer has replaced the secretary as the ubiquitous travelling companion.' Growth of the portable PC market has flattened since the boom years of 1990 to 1992. Nevertheless, Dataquest predicts that between 1993 and 1998 portable computer sales will grow by a compound annual rate of 23.4 per cent, compared with 8.4 per cent for desktop PCs. Worldwide sales of mobile computing equipment, peripherals and services are expected to grow to almost Dollars 45bn by 1997 according to California-based Market Intelligence Research. Business use of portable computers is undoubtedly increasing. When Dataquest asked corporate computer purchasing managers across Europe whether any of their employees used portable PCs, 70 per cent replied 'yes', with the UK and Germany showing the highest uptake. The three largest groups of users were top executives and finance staff, sales and marketing and engineering and maintenance. More than 32 per cent also claimed at least some of their employees were able to use their portable PCs or data terminals for communicating with the office while travelling. Most of these employees made their connection over the public switched telephone network although a quarter said they used cellular telephone connections, 18.5 per cent used private or public mobile radio and a similar proportion said they used mobile packet data services. In the study, the most important uses listed for mobile data communications were sending and receiving electronic mail, sending and receiving facsimiles, transferring files, accessing purchase and inventory databases and accessing customer and invoicing databases. A modem (modulator/de-modulator) enables a computer to exchange digital data over an older-style analogue telephone line with another machine, typically a head office computer which is also equipped with a modem and has become another essential piece of equipment for many travelling professionals. 'Connectivity is becoming a more and more important feature of mobile computing, especially aimed at making life easier for business users who are on the move,' says Steve Crawley, AST's product marketing manager. 'The latest trend shows it will soon become commonplace to bundle communications add-ons with portable PCs.' Modems come in a number of shapes and sizes and are getting faster, smarter and cheaper. Some, usually based on proprietary designs, fit inside the machine but external modems - including some which fit into PCMCIA card slots - usually offer faster transmission speeds together with sophisticated data compression and error correction features. Most also provide the facility to send and receive faxes direct from the screen. Currently most portable modems, including PCMCIA card modems, are designed to be plugged into a wall telephone socket. However, wireless modems have begun to appear which work either with existing analogue cellular mobile telephone services or with the new breed of dedicated digital mobile packet-switched data networks such as the Ram Mobile Data network in the UK. These modems represent the ultimate in portability since they allow mobile computer users to transmit or receive data and faxes from virtually anywhere. Eventually, however, there may be no need for modems at all since, at least in theory, it should be possible to plug a digital device, including portable computers, directly into the next generation of mobile telephones operating on digital cellular networks such as the GSM networks in Europe. Eventually, the continued convergence of telephone and computer technologies is expected to lead to multi-purpose handheld digital devices which will combine the functions of data processing and voice and data telecommunications. Sales of the first generation of so-called personal digital assistants, such as Apple's Newton, did not live up to expectations, largely because they lacked sophisticated wireless telecommunications facilities. According to Dataquest, the European market for handheld computers, including pen-based machines, actually declined from an estimated 401,000 units in 1992 to 283,000 last year. 'For the future we predict that familiar keyboard-driven handhelds will comfortably outsell pen handhelds, but these will most likely be hybrid machines using a pen for drawing and pointing, and the keyboard for text entry,' says Mr Goldberg. Dataquest argues that wider acceptance of handheld PCs is highly dependent on the availability of ubiquitous and cheap connectivity, in particular wireless networking, and on a rationalisation of the many competing platforms.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 3 KYODO -- Supporters and opponents of  Japan's war-renouncing Constitution marked the 47th anniversary  of the Constitution on Tuesday [3 May] with demonstrations and  rallies. Participating in those events were civic groups and  political parties defending the Constitution and those  advocating its revision to open the way for collective defense  and a greater role in U.N. Peacekeeping operations.    Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party  (SDP), which ardently opposes any constitutional amendment  expanding the scope of Japan's Self-Defense Forces (SDF),  addressed followers in front of the main entrance of Tokyo's  Ueno Park.    "Some in the new cabinet are arguing that introducing  collective defense should be reconsidered, but we owe it to our  pacifist Constitution alone that Japan has not participated in a  war during the almost 50 years since World War II," Murayama  said.    Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary  Hiroshi Kumagai have expressed support for legislation to deal  with emergencies including possible international sanctions  against North Korea for its suspected nuclear weapons  development.    Prominent constitution experts discussed the pros and cons  of  a revision at a rally organized by an SDP-affiliated citizens  group at Hibiya public hall in the afternoon.    Pacifist citizens' groups demonstrated at several places in  Tokyo, while representatives of the Buddhist-backed Komeito  [Clean Government Party] and the Japanese Communist Party (JCP)  delivered speeches in support of the current Constitution in  front of Shinjuku Station.    Two groups supporting a greater military role for Japan held  rallies and panel discussions at different venues in Chiyoda  Ward.</p>

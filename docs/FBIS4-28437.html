			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of  the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] gave a reception Thursday on  the occasion of the 63rd birthday of Raul Castro Ruz, second  secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of  Cuba.    Addressing the reception, secretary of the C.C. [Central  Committee], WPK Hwang Chang-yop spoke about the extraordinary  contributions made to the victory of the Cuban revolution by  Raul Castro Ruz with a staunch revolutionary principle,  unfailing loyalty to the leader's cause, high organizing ability  and fighting spirit in the revolutionary struggle, and about the  great feats performed by him in building the party, state and  Armed Forces after the victory in the revolution.    "Although they are separated by the oceans and continent,  Korea and Cuba are as good as close neighbours for the deep  intimacy established between the two state leaders, for the  revolutionary principle to which they adhere, advancing under  the banner of socialism, smashing the imperialists' challenges,"  Hwang Chang-yop said, and added: "We will make every effort in  the future, too, to consolidate and develop further the  comradely relations of friendship between the two parties and  two peoples."    Cuban Ambassador to Korea Jose Ramon Rodriguez Varona said  he  extended warmest thanks to Comrade Kim Chong-il, the dear leader  of the Workers' Party and people of Korea, for arranging an  excellent function to joyfully celebrate the 63rd birthday of  respected Raul Castro.    Condemning the U.S. imperialists' reinforcement of  destructive weapons in South Korea and dangerous war exercises,  he said the Korean people's struggle is precisely a struggle of  Cuba and that the Cuban people's support to the Korean people's  cause of national reunification will always remain invariable.</p>

Four other accused Swansea supporters were freed  by the court.  </P> <P> The Greek public prosecutor said the drunken fans wrecked a restaurant, two  bars and five cars during a rampage through the luxury seaside suburb of  Glyfada near Athens.  </P> <P> Each Swansea supporter was given a chance to defend himself before the court  and all said they were innocent and had been attacked by a Greek mob.  </P> <P> Adrian Evans, 31, who was convicted, said: "We are not British hooligans.  Swansea fans have the best reputation in Britain for good behavior."  </P></p>

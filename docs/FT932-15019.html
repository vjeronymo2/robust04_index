			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Japanese surplus flows back into Euromarket JAPAN'S current account surplus has been flowing back into the global money market, with short-term funds going mainly to the Euromarket, says the Bank of Japan (BOJ), Reuter reports from Tokyo. Japan's current account surplus rose to Dollars 117.6bn in 1992, from Dollars 72.9bn in 1991. Long-term capital outlays showed a deficit of Dollars 28.5bn in 1992, against a surplus of Dollars 37.1bn the previous year. The change in long-term capital outlays was due to a change in the ratio of inward and outward investment in stocks and bonds, BOJ said. Inward and outward investment in stocks and bonds showed a Dollars 26.2bn net deficit in 1992 against a Dollars 41.0bn surplus in 1991. Capital flows such as short-term capital flows and private banking accounts had a Dollars 78.6bn deficit last year against Dollars 102.2bn in 1991.</p>

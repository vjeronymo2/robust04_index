			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Remodelling Sweden Sweden's Social Democrats will probably be returned to power in less than a month. If so, it will be because they have persuaded the electorate of two things, the first true, the second false: that they are best-placed to reform the economic model they built and that doing so can be painless. As recently as 1987, commentators were revising their obituaries of the Swedish social democratic model. Though leftists had been forced into retreat elsewhere in Europe, the Social Democrat government in Sweden seemed to have bucked the trend. They had adapted the country's tried and tested economic remedies to global competitive pressures without, it seemed, losing the kinder face that Sweden's capitalism had always displayed. A steep devaluation of the krona in 1982, followed by fiscal 'austerity' in the mid-1980s, had delivered a balanced current account, unemployment below 2 per cent, and a budget surplus of over 4 per cent of GDP. Yet this was only a brief reprieve from the structural reforms on which Sweden's economic future now depends. As the country emerges from its deepest recession since the 1930s, its old remedy, a large devaluation in November 1992, has brought a recovery in the tradeable sector. But it can no longer carry the rest of the economy on its shoulders. Market scepticism The general government deficit is expected to be 11.5 per cent of GDP in 1994, while the stock of public debt, now 93 per cent of GDP, is on an explosive path. With government spending currently 67 per cent of GDP, fiscal retrenchment on a large scale is the only way out of Sweden's difficulties. Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the Social Democrats' leader, claims to understand this. Investors do not believe him. Last week they put enough pressure on the krona to trigger a surprise increase in interest rates from the central bank and, at last, a meagre SKr61bn (Pounds 5.1bn) - 4 per cent of GDP - deficit reduction package from Mr Carlsson. There are good reasons to share the markets' scepticism about his likely resolve if he comes to power after the September 18 election. With unemployment approaching 15 per cent of the labour force, Mr Carlsson knows that the electorate is in no mood for further austerity. Until last Friday, the Social Democrats had conspicuously avoided specific commitments to public spending cuts for precisely this reason. Even the new proposals are short on expenditure reductions, with the majority of savings to be gained by a combination of higher taxes and, less credibly, about Skr10bn in projected reductions in future debt interest payments. Spending cuts Lower interest rates are a fanciful expectation as long as Sweden lacks a government that can credibly promise to do more than nibble at public spending. Indeed, without such a promise, the economy will be trapped in a vicious spiral of rising long-term interest rates, followed by rises in short-term rates to defend the currency. This will add to the effects of fiscal tightening on domestic demand. But higher interest rates will also make tightening more urgent, by pushing the debt burden closer to breaking point. If Mr Carlsson proves as protective of his public sector constituents in office as he has been on the campaign trail, the markets' fears can only be proved right. Yet the Social Democrats have foiled sceptics in the past: in 1982, it was a Social Democrat government which reversed the deficit spending of the preceding anti-socialist coalition, and later in the decade introduced sensible tax reforms and significant economic deregulation. They were able to do this, in part, because the population felt that the ethos of the Swedish model was safe in their hands, if not the detail. A similar feeling lies behind the party's longstanding lead in the opinion polls. The population's trust would be well-founded if an incoming Social Democrat government used its mandate to explain why the public sector must be smaller and push through the measures needed to achieve this. In the hands of Mr Carlsson, such measures might, just might, come without abandoning the egalitarian spirit of Sweden's past, or its active approach to the labour market. But come they most certainly must.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Fran Visnar: "Topaz Among the Serb Howitzers"] </F>   [Text] What Croatia will do in 1994 is the most frequent  question that not only the rebel Serbs, but also the military  analysts in Belgrade ask themselves. Apart from studying the  power and the intentions of the Croatian Army, they are also  considering the total Serb potential in case another great  Serb-Croat war breaks out.    Bearing in mind the lessons of the fighting in Slovenia,  Croatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina, the strategists of the regular  Serbian army believe that, at the very beginning of serious  conflicts with the Croats, as strong forces as possible should  be be deployed at the crucial point on the battlefield. To  achieve that, it is necessary to choose the appropriate  operational direction and avoid the unpleasant experiences of  Vukovar. The present Serbian commanders (all of whom got a good  taste of gunpowder during 1991 and 1992) are simply obsessed  with the importance of selecting the best strategy. They are  considering all the advantages and disadvantages of simple and a  complex strategies in relation to Croatia and its defense. They  will consider the strategy that would, in a given situation,  enable bringing more of their own forces than enemy troops to be  best. At any point, the battle is not won by troops noted down  on lists or scattered, but those that had been collected  earlier, trained well, equipped excellently, and prepared to go  into action at the crucial point on the battlefield immediately.  <H5>  Where Will the Serbs Strike? </H5>   It has still not been decided in Belgrade where they should  strike first to "cut the entrails of Croatia." In any case, if  Serbia starts an open war again (which will be the case if the  "Krajinas" are endangered), it will not be able to do anything  without the coordinated support of the army of the Bosnian Serbs  and joint plans. There is another thing to be clarified.  Whatever our opinion of the Serbs may be, it has to be admitted  that they have what military theory defines as stamina,  elasticity, and the will to survive regardless of the  conditions, the rationality and justifiability of their  political opinions, the balance of power, and external  pressures. The Croat side must, by no means, put all its hopes  on the economic exhaustion of Serbia and its monetary breakdown.  North Vietnam also went bankrupt in the Vietnam war, and in the  late Sixties, instead of the completely devalued local currency,  the dong, a pack of cigarettes became the unofficial means of  payment (the clever or lucky Vietnamese who possessed a carton  of Marlboros were considered rich). In spite of everything,  Hanoi fought against the Americans for 15 years, with the income  per capita being $100, and the Vietnamese constantly sending  weapons and experts to their ideological supporters in South  Vietnam.    Belgrade still does not deprive its cousins in the rebel  areas of Croatia of heavy weapons, military equipment, and the  means of transporting troops. On the contrary, while the people  in Belgrade are fighting and stepping over one another for a  loaf of bread, and waiting in lines for hours to receive a free  Christmas cookie, the Serb military industry works at full  capacity. This time we will present, in detail, three new  systems that are already being delivered to the "Krajinas" and  Ratko Mladic's [commander of the armed forces of the republic of  Srpska] units assigned to intervene as soon as the new round of  war starts in Croatia and around it.    Having fought against the Croats, the Serbs have learned  that  they have to remove the losses from the frontlines and deliver  new stocks fast. This is why they have not sent the remaining  T-55 tanks to the breaker's yards: 390 of those veterans, made  in the Sixties, are undergoing many changes and improvements to  increase their power, armored protection, and mobility. The  same steering system that the modern M-84 contains has been  installed in the changed Serbian tank T-55. Its power has been  increased by installing two launching rails (on the turret) for  armor-piercing Maljutka guided missiles. The French first  implemented this idea three decades ago (on small tanks AMX-13);  the Serbs have now applied it to their still most-numerous basic  combat tank. The Maljutkas are guided to the target (armored  vehicles and fortified facilities at a distance between 500 and  3,000 meters), from the guiding control panel situated in the  tank itself. The pitch of the missile is regulated by the  mechanism for elevating the gun barrel, and the operator guides  the missile by watching through the existing tank telescope  sight, the magnification factor of which is increased with  additional optics. With the two missiles that are on the  launchers all the time, there are also four more Maljutkas  within the tank turret.  <H5>  The Systematic Arming of the "Krajina" </H5>   With further modifications, the Serbs improved the  characteristics of the artillery ammunition for the T-55, and,  by installing thermal insulation cover on the outer surface of  the barrel of the 100-mm caliber gun, the traces appearing as a  result of uneven cooling are reduced by 80 percent. This has  increased the precision of the gun itself. The 12.7-mm caliber  DSKM [expansion unknown] heavy machine gun was retained on the  turret, as well as the matching 7.62-mm caliber PKT [expansion  unknown] machine gun. The Serb engineers have also installed the  anti-cumulative screens, protecting the sides of the tank, below  the supports for cases and reservoirs, the critical junction of  the armored panels of the tank floor and the sides, and the  surface at the level of the junction of the tank turret and the  armored body.    The Serbs want to secure the survival of this veteran  primarily on the Croatian battlefields. On the front of the  turret they installed 12 smoke launchers that can fire smoke  canisters distances greater than 100 meters (the equipment is  identical to that used on the M-84 tank). Apart from creating a  smokescreen, the launching barrels for firing smoke canisters  increase the anti-cumulative protection of the turret (on  hitting these barrels, enemy missiles are activated too early,  and their total effect is decreased).    Since most of the improved T-55's will be sent to Baranja  and  east Slavonia to reinforce the existing armored units, they have  also installed an entrenching plow (on the lower front glacis  plate). Entrenching takes 15 to 20 minutes (depending on the  type and category of soil). The plow switches from use to the  mobile position and vice versa in 2 to 3 minutes. This  improvement makes the T-55 independent in creating shelter, and  the additional armored panel on the plow increases the armored  protection of the tank front.    For close anti-armor fighting, the Serbs have developed a  new  light rocket launcher (they call it a "tank destroyer") that  introduces a new quality in the offensive and defensive  activities of their infantry. It is a simple 120-mm caliber  weapon (the M91 rocket launcher is more powerful than the Zolja  and Osa) whose main purpose is to break active and reactive tank  shields. It is most effective at 400 to 500 meters distance,  with a precision that provides for a deviation of 20 centimeters  from the target. The system is weatherproof (within a  temperature range from -30 to +50 degrees Centigrade); sand,  dust, rain, snow, and ice will not harm it. The minimum  distance using the launcher is 25 meters. The rocket will not  fail at angles of incidence greater than 20 degrees; the fuse is  of a quality providing reliable efficiency at all projected  distances. The launcher is disposable, and a telescope or  passive night sight can be installed on it. This is the variant  sent to the Bosnian Serbs and the rebel Serb areas in Croatia,  while the laser target markers will only be fitted to launchers  on the ground of mother Serbian (for fear of their being  captured). From this light, serially produced system, the Serbs  are developing a similar type of rocket launcher for multiple  use.    What everyone is looking forward to in the "Krajinas" is a  new 100-m caliber M-91 Topaz anti-tank gun (the Serbs call it a  gem among guns). Its main purpose is anti-armored fighting at  distances between 2,000 and 3,000 meters. The Serbs designed  and started the serial production of this piece, which has a low  firing height, with the internal ballistic design of the Russian  T-12 anti-tank gun (which is also of 100-mm caliber). The  differences in relation to the T-12 is the following: Topaz  uses the elements of the three-legged gun carriage of the Serb  122-mm D30-J howitzer, which provides a 360-degree field of  fire. Above its barrel Topaz has an installed anti-recoil  device, which the 122-mm D30-J howitzer also contains,  increasing stability during firing. Moreover, Topaz is 2 meters  shorter in transport than the T-12 gun (the piece is connected  to the vehicle through the Topaz gas break).    A day-and-night fire-control system [SUV -- fire-control  system] has been developed for the Topaz. The system can be  used on the Russian 100-mm T-12 and MT-12 caliber anti-tank guns  (they are still part of the Serb armament; Croatia also has  them), and they are ballistically fully compatible with Topaz.  The fire- control system determines and visualizes all the  necessary elements of indirect and direct fire at immobile and  mobile targets. The probability of hitting a mobile target (at  the distances of efficient destruction range) with the first  bullet is greater than 70 percent, and the system reaction time  at battery level is less than 15 seconds.  <H5>  Let Us Not Fool Ourselves, They Are Not Finished! </H5>   Let us summarize: The claim one can often hear around here  is: "The Serbs are finished." However, this is contrary to the  undoubted Serb vitality in continuing to add links to its chain  of technical and technological equipment despite the embargo and  the losses they have suffered. This is why, instead of  short-term propaganda, it is more important for our state to cut  off the logistic tail of the Serbian rebellion that wishes to  hold out with new weapons, in which the messages of fighting in  these areas over the past three years are inbuilt. For Croatia  it is a matter of long-term survival. For the Serbs it is a  misfortune that is only waiting to happen.

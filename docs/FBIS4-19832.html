			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Dirk Achten: "Small and Mobile"] </F>   [Text] There will be no new Belgian UN troops in the coming  months. If UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali needs  troops again soon for anywhere, for example Bosnia, then the  defense minister will politely request that he look elsewhere.  The enthusiasm in the Army for UN operations is at an absolute  low. Just as the prestige of the United Nations itself is  declining at a rapid rate.    Things sometimes turn out strangely. It was these very UN  operations which were to have given the reformed Belgian  professional Army the opportunity to demonstrate its usefulness.  It now appears that these UN activities are not as innocent as  they seem and that the world is more gruesome, cruel, and  dangerous than people liked to think at one time.    Therefore, there will be no new UN adventures, at least not  in the near future, in order to have some time to recover. That  is wise and logical. Also because a de facto full military base  remains in Kenya, should the situation in Burundi also  completely derail. In the meantime, the costs are mounting up.  Soon we will be talking about 1 billion [Belgian francs] or  more. Those calling for a permanent and strong military  presence in Central Africa would do well to make these financial  calculations as well. Can the Belgian Government, very short of  money, find this amount every year?    The enormous evacuation operation from Rwanda was a success,  not only due to the deployment of the paratroopers, but also  thanks to many other soldiers. The Army worked and achieved  very respectable results. That is not as self-evident as it  appears. Many people, including MP's, believe that in order to  solve matters quickly it is enough to call out the Army,  drastically reduced in size and continually subjected to rounds  of cuts.    It is not that simple and that is why the Rwandan operation  was an outstanding performance. The military also had enough  sense to not deal with the media as troublesome insects so that  the Rwandan operation received extensive attention. Attention  which the Army can well use in these uncertain times.    Because with the abolition of obligatory national service,  with the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, armed forces, even on a  small scale, are no longer really necessary in the eyes of many  people, including MP's. Moreover, defense always emerges as an  opportunity to save money while the same people find it simply  normal that the army is able to intervene in unexpected crisis  situations as a perfectly oiled and trained machine. Something  is wrong here.    Of course, money can be saved in the defense budget. It is  rather obvious that the times of the Cold War are behind us.  But even the little army which remains demands some attention  if it is to maintain a minimum of usefulness. The soldiers who  went to Rwanda did not go with the best equipment, modern  facilities, and in optimum condition. In some cases, it was  about making do. And that brings risks.    A small, mobile, and deployable professional army is  affordable but not completely free of charge. Transport,  effective weaponry, appropriate personal equipment, logistics,  modern radio equipment, and training are required. The  operation in Rwanda once again made it clear what the  considerably reduced army needs most to be able to do what is  asked of it. And that is not the very latest fighter aircraft.</p>

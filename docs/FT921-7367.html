			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Arts: French salerooms woo foreigners FRANCE'S 440 auctioneers, the most protected and privileged of Europe, are to introduce a flat rate buyer's premium of 9 per cent as compared with the 10 per cent in force in Britain and the US as an incentive to foreign companies. Replacing a complex four bracket system, the new system will also entail a reduction of the seller's commission from a maximum of 7.5 per cent to as little as 2 per cent. Drouot salerooms in Paris say the measures have been approved by Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy and should be completely rubber-stamped in time for their important auctions in May. Christie's and Sotheby's, who may prospect but not hold sales in France, welcome the 9 per cent but say more concessions are required before they set-up in Paris - something they now seem unlikely to do for at least another five years. Other reforms of French auctioning for 1993, due to become law over coming weeks, will make access for European auctioneers legally possible, but technically difficult and commercially unattractive. They anger France's biggest auctioneers who want Christie's and Sotheby's to work in Paris, but will serve the interests of the smallest French companies who would be driven to the wall by such competition. Non-French auctioneers will have to sit a qualifying examination and 'abide by French customs'. They will be able to practice anywhere in the country instead of only in their place of residence as previously, but only under certain restrictive conditions. The biggest obstacle for British auction houses, however, will be the requirement, unchanged by the new laws, to buy a licensed auctioneer's office at anything from Fr500,000 to Fr20m, which only an individual and not a firm may legally do. VAT rates of 5.5 per cent and 18.6 per cent on imported works of art, meanwhile, peculiar to France, are still dissuasive for Sotheby's and Christie's, as is the French droit de suite tax of 3 per cent which may one day be extended to the whole of Europe. 'France is the only big market still closed to us and news of the 9 per cent buyer's premium obviously delighted me because it is a big step in the right direction. But major obstacles remain. We will come to Paris only when the whole of the French auctioning profession and not just some of its most important members is ready to welcome us,' said Francois Curiel, director of Christie's Europe.</p>

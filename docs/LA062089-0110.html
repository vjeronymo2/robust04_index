			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> After an 11-year hiatus, pianist Van Cliburn resumed his public performances to  thunderous applause with a Philadelphia concert dedicated to two late friends.  Before performing his first selection, Liszt's Piano Concerto No. 1, Cliburn  told the audience of 12,000 that "this is a very sentimental evening for me."  The pianist dedicated the concert at the Mann Music Center to conductor Eugene  Ormandy and Fredric R. Mann, a former U.S. ambassador who headed the concert  festival there from 1949 until his death in 1987.  </P></p>

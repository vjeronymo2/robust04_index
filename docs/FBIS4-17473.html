			<p>BFN     [Text] The holding of elections for president of Ukraine  and the chairmen and deputies of local councils in June is  extremely undesirable and dangerous for the fate of Ukraine.  Ukrainian Republican Party Chairman Mykhaylo Horyn said this at  a news conference devoted to the results of the party's  extraordinary congress.    The Ukrainian Republican Party leader stressed that the  elections should take place after a new Ukrainian constitution  or a law on power is adopted. At the same time Mykhaylo Horyn  emphasized that, as postponing the elections is problematical,  the [party] congress gave the Ukrainian Republican Party  leadership the right to take a stand on its attitude to  contenders for the post of president of Ukraine.</p>

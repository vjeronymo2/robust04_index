			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Currency system defended MR Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, last night threw his weight behind the European Monetary System, arguing that it had a good long-term record in promoting monetary stability and economic convergence across Europe, writes Peter Marsh. But Mr Schlesinger also hinted, in a speech in London, that more realignments might be needed in the system before Europe reached the final goal of fixed exchange rates as part of economic and monetary union. Speaking to the Overseas Bankers' Club at the Guildhall, the Bundesbank president warned that, with Britain having no firm plans to rejoin the exchange rate mechanism, there would be 'less compulsion' for the UK to take the necessary steps ahead of union to harmonise its economy with the rest of Europe. He went out of his way to sound conciliatory about Britain, suggesting that for Europe to go ahead with economic and monetary union without the UK would be inappropriate. In a determinedly positive reference about the EMS, Mr Schlesinger said the recent spell of currency turbulence in Europe did not mean the system had failed. Rather, it demonstrated that the system needed periodic adjustments on the road to economic and monetary union, a goal which might be reached by the end of the century. Referring to the possibility of more realignments, he said: 'There was once a widely held illusion that the EMS was already a de facto monetary union, a currency area in which exchange rate adjustments were no longer possible. 'They have been necessary and they cannot simply be banned until monetary union is established, even though they will become less compulsory as covergence increases.'</p>

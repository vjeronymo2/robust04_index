			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SAN GABRIEL;  </P> <P> BLASZCAK SUIT ATTACKS RECALL  </P> <P> Former San Gabriel Vice Mayor Frank Blaszcak has sued to overturn the recall  election that threw him out of office in May.  </P> <P> Charging that there were widespread irregularities in the city-run election,  Blaszcak, who was recalled by a nine-vote margin on May 23, is seeking to be  reinstated on the City Council. A hearing has been scheduled for Aug. 10 in Los  Angeles Superior Court.  </P> <P> City Atty. Stephanie Scher said that Blaszcak's legal action was "without  basis." The City Council has scheduled a special election for Sept. 12 to fill  Blaszcak's seat.  </P> <P> Mark Rosen, Blaszcak's attorney, said that the election, which was supervised  by Assistant City Clerk Cindy Bookter, had been "contaminated" and that the  result was not accurate. He said enough voters either had been prevented from  voting or allowed to vote improperly to raise questions about the final  results.  </P> <P> Bookter says that she strictly adhered to state elections laws.  </P></p>

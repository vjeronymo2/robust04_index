			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANC LEADER NELSON MANDELA'S SOCIALISTIC VIEWS  </P> <P> There have been numerous articles ("Israel Has Right to Exist, Mandela Tells  U.S. Jews," June 10, "Mandela, Sharansky Agree to Disagree," June 30 and  letters, June 28) devoted to the concerns of Jewish leaders regarding Mandela's  association with Arafat, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and the  ANC leader's views on Israel. Unfortunately, The Times has focused little  attention on the opinion of black people.  </P> <P> Many African Americans were disillusioned by the widely publicized Jewish  discontent with the ANC leader's position on the Middle East. Anxious that  Mandela's American reception be as favorable as that he was given in Europe and  Canada, blacks questioned the proprietary of this collateral litmus test.  </P> <P> What is more, African Americans were stupefied by the irony of this  controversy. After all, it is no secret that Israel and South Africa have been  co-partners over the past 40 years. Even during periods of global boycotts and  embargoes, the two nations have unabashedly maintained strong economic,  military, nuclear, scientific, academic, cultural and athletic ties.  </P> <P> Israel was certainly not the only nation to fortify the apartheid state.  Nevertheless, in the present context of Jewish complaints against Mandela,  African Americans are hard-pressed to ignore the fact that when the chips were  down the PLO supported his struggle but Israel did not.  </P> <P> Many who are now calling for Mandela to denounce his allies were silent while  Israel supported his foes. Such manifest hypocrisy has not escaped the  attention of the ANC leader or of millions of other black people around the  world.  </P> <P> LEGRAND H. CLEGG II  </P> <P> Compton  </P></p>

			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / UK Company News: City Site passes pref dividend City Site Estates, the Glagow-based property investment company, yesterday announced that it would pass its preference dividends because of insufficient distributable reserves. Its share price dropped from 24p to close at 9p. The company said it was planning to transfer some of its share premium to distributable reserves to allow dividend payments to start again as soon as possible. The dividend on its 10 per cent preference shares and 5.2 per cent preference shares was due to be paid on September 30. In July, the company announced it had returned to pre-tax profit of Pounds 190,000 in the half year ended March 31 1992, compared with a loss of Pounds 1.99m for the same period the year before. It passed the interim dividend on its ordinary shares.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Li Yang (2621 2254) of Chinese Academy of Social </F> Sciences Finance and Trade Research Institute: "Establishing a  Highly Efficient Capital Market Is an Important Part of Banking  Reform"]    [Text] The CPC Central Committee's decision on building  the socialist market economic structure set forth the general  principle for the "sustained, rapid, and healthy" [chi xu kuai  su jian kang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660] development of the  national economy. Here, the necessary condition for the rapid  development of the national economy is the maintenance of a high  investment rate over a long period and the full condition for  the healthy development of the national economy is that the high  investment rate is supported by a corresponding high savings  rate. Only when the savings rate and the investment rate are  kept balanced can there be sustained development of the national  economy. To put it in a nutshell, balancing savings and  investment is the key to the implementation of the general  principle. In China, investment demand is always brisk so an  effective way to mobilize savings or the establishment of a  highly efficient capital market is of greater significance.    In the traditional structure, there was basically no capital  market in our country. In those years, under the centralized  financial system, savings in the whole society were mainly  concentrated in the hands of the government and were then  distributed to various enterprises for the purpose of investment  in the form of financial appropriation. This form of raising  and using funds can be regarded as a special form of internal  financing [nei yuan rong zi 0355 3293 5816 6357]. Since the  beginning of the economic structural reform, with the  readjustment of the elementary distribution structure of the  national income, the government savings in the gross social  savings have been gradually decreasing (and the net savings have  now become negative), while the savings kept by enterprises and  individuals have been gradually increasing. Being supported by  such a savings structure, external financing [wai yuan rong zi  1120 3293 5816 6357] has gradually come to prevail in our  country. According to statistics, external financing accounts  for about 70 percent of the current sources of enterprise  investment funds. This is reflected in the fact that in the  "cake" of state investment, bank loans and the funds raised by  the enterprises on their own are the main financial sources.  The rate of external financing in our country is rather high as  compared with the between 30 and 50 percent rate in the  countries with developed market economies.    The abovementioned change has caused the monetary policy to  hold a decisive position in our macroeconomic control and  regulation system. Signs of such change appeared in the early  stage of reform and people could obviously see it after the  three-year economic rectification. However, the reform of the  financial control system did not keep pace with such change.  This was mainly reflected in the following facts. First, we  still maintained the traditional means of credit distribution to  exercise financial management and it was increasingly difficult  to effectively control the gross quantity of credit and money  supply in the whole society by this means. Moreover, the  distribution and circulation of credit funds in the economy  became far distant from the subjective wishes of financial  authorities. Second, we still used the method of managing  credit funds to deal with the issuing of various securities by  imposing quantitative limits on such issues. Third, we still  lacked an effective means of managing the fund-raising  activities launched by enterprises on their own beyond the  direct financing under the state's control. All this brought  about a disorderly situation in the financial field during the  last few years.    It is indeed important to rectify the financial order.  Behind various disorder phenomena there exist various types of  misconduct and the inertial effects of the old system but there  also exist sprouts of the new financial system. We can even say  that many of the current financial problems are in fact a type  of spontaneous reaction from the market economic forces against  the ossified financial system. If we do not properly analyze  various factors, we cannot achieve the expected results in our  rectification efforts and China's further economic growth may  encounter other obstacles. As we have noticed, since the  beginning of the economic reform, major changes have occurred in  China's economic growth mechanisms. The country's economic  growth in the past more than 10 years was mainly attributed to  the rapid development of the nonstate-owned enterprises, the  expansion of the tertiary industry, and the high-speed growth in  the coastal areas. However, such economic entities and  industries, which made major contributions to the economic  growth, did not hold any significant position in the state's  credit plan; and what was actually gained by the economically  developed areas was obviously insufficient as compared with the  demand. This brought about a profound contradiction. On the  one hand, economic development had to rely heavily on the  nonstate-owned enterprises and the tertiary industry and on the  economic growth in the coastal areas; on the other hand, the  financial demand in such enterprises, trades, and areas could  not be satisfied by the state's official credit plan. As a  result, funds were "loaned" from the state-run banks to  nonstate-owned banks, nonbanking financial institutions,  nonstate-owned enterprises, trades in the tertiary industry, and  economically developed areas and this became an inevitable  trend. Because the derived financial demand was not aimed at  adjusting the monetary position, "daily loans" were inevitably  changed into "monthly loans," "quarterly loans," or "yearly  loans." Because most of such loans were not allowed by the  state, there naturally existed instances of violating financial  discipline and funds were offered at much higher costs. Similar  problems also occurred in the field of direct financing.  Because many new investment projects could not obtain funds  through official channels, it was rather common that they raised  funds on their own in various ways without the approval of the  administrative authorities.    Can we then improve the situation by means of "perfecting"  the fund distribution method? In our opinion, this should not,  and also cannot, be done. First, if social funds are  distributed by the monetary authorities, this is a typical  practice in the planned economy and logically comes into line  with the across-the-board planned management and distribution of  materials and funds. Such practice has now lost the necessary  economic conditions. Second, smooth funds distribution still  needs certain institutional conditions in the financial system:  1) The financial institution must be large and highly  centralized (as we had only one bank in society in the past) so  that funds do not move in and out of the financial system on a  large scale. 2) Social expenditure is made by entities bearing  the same character (as in the past, the state-owned enterprises  assumed an overwhelming proportion and their revenue and  expenditure were totally controlled by the government). Thus,  funds will not move between different economic elements. 3)  There should only be one single financial product (as in the  past, there were only simple deposits and loans in society) so  that there will be no replacement between different financial  products and no consequent transfer of funds. 4) The national  economy should be closed (as we laid lopsided stress on  self-reliance in the past) so that changes in international  reserve and in foreign exchange rates do not produce any  unexpected impact on domestic money supply. Obviously, all such  conditions no longer exist in China. As the foundation and the  conditions no longer exist, it is impossible to "improve" the  system being established on such foundations and under such  conditions. More importantly, when the market-oriented reform  has been carried out in depth today, credit planning can less  and less satisfy the increasingly active needs in economic  development and has become increasingly a huge "rent-seeking"  hotbed [xun zu yuan sou 1416 4436 3220 5674]. So, it should be  terminated as soon as possible and replaced with a new mechanism  for indirect control of the money supply. Under the new system,  the monetary authorities should apply indirect regulatory means  to control and adjust the gross quantity of money supply and  market interest rates. The movement of social funds should  mainly be directed by the profit- oriented financial  institutions and by the securities market according to market  signals.    In the new pattern of monetary regulation and control, the  establishment of an effective capital market is an important  task.    In the field of indirect financing, it is of course very  important to organize and establish some policy-oriented banks  [zheng ce xing yin hang 2398 4595 1840 6892 5887] but they can  only meet the financial needs of a small number of key trades  with a bearing on the national economy and the people's  livelihood. It is definitely necessary to transform the  existing specialized banks but, if long-term funds are mainly  provided by the commercial bank, the financial demand in society  still cannot be satisfied and the situation may become rather  dangerous in a certain sense. This is because the funds of the  commercial banks mainly come from the savings of individuals and  enterprises and the mobility of such funds is rather high.  Their liabilities constitute the main part of the money supply.  If such financial sources are used to make long-term  investments, a financial crisis can easily arise. This is the  reason why the monetary authorities must require the commercial  banks to keep reserve funds and provisions, lay down a strict  requirement on the rate of their own capital, and exercise  strict control over the operation of their assets. In the  countries mainly practicing the market economy, the long-term  funds supplied through some indirect financing channels mainly  come from nonbanking financial institutions, which mainly refer  to various insurance companies, pension funds, trust and  investment companies, common funds, savings and loans  associations, and financial companies. A common characteristic  of these financial institutions is that they all have long-term  and stable funds sources. It is precisely under such a  liabilities structure that they can play a major role in the  capital market. If our financial institutions are still not  well developed, then our nonbanking financial institutions are  just at the starting stage. Therefore, in order to establish an  effective capital market, it is necessary to greatly develop  nonbanking financial institutions and make them one of the key  points in our new financial system.    In the field of direct financing, we should mainly  substantially develop the standardized stock and corporate bond  markets. We should be soberly aware that exercising scale  management over the issuing of securities will inevitably hinder  the ongoing process of adopting the corporate system in the  reorganization of the existing enterprises and this is a  management method which goes against the principle of the market  economy. Only by abolishing such scale management can the  securities market and the market economy as a whole develop  healthily. With regard to stocks, some concepts should be  clarified. The adoption of the corporate system in the  reorganization of the existing enterprises certainly requires  that existing assets be turned into a certain quantity of  shares. However, first, this does not mean that the enterprise,  while turning its assets into shares should at the same time  increase its assets and shares. It is absolutely necessary to  prevent them from trying to increase investment and neglecting  the adjustment of the property rights structure. Second, while  an enterprise is reorganized into a joint-stock company, this  does not mean that its stocks must be negotiable in the market;  even if the stocks can be traded, it does not necessarily mean  that they should be listed on a stock exchange. After the  joint-stock company becomes the main enterprise form in our  country, the stocks of most enterprises should be negotiable in  the counter market [gui tai shi chang 2681 0669 1579 1034].  That is to say, we can adopt certain steady steps for listing  stocks in the exchange but it is certain that we should promote  the development of stocks counter trade [gu piao de gui tai jiao  yi 5140 4384 4104 2681 0669 0074 2496]. We hold that any  enterprises, as long as they meet the requirements for issuing  securities, should be allowed to raise funds through the market.  Limiting the scale of securities issuance will only lead to the  spread of irregular fundraising activities. In view of the  abnormal situation in which the rate of liabilities in the  enterprises of our country is too high, it is necessary to  change the enterprise capital structure in order to thoroughly  change this situation. To achieve this purpose, we must  substantially develop the stock market and the corporate-bond  market.    To sum up, we should make efforts to create a relaxed, free,  diverse, and competitive financial system through carrying out  financial reform. Only on the basis of such a financial system  can the central bank hold a detached position to play a role as  a referee in the competition. On the contrary, if there are  only a small number of financial institutions and a small number  of financial tools in the economy, they will become too  cumbersome and will not be able to play an effective role;  neither can the central bank play an effective role in  exercising macrocontrol.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Alexon profits downgraded following stock hangover A SALES fall of about 10 per cent in Alexon Group's main brands cut pre-tax profits by 46 per cent in the six months to July 25. The slide from Pounds 3.82m to Pounds 2.08m followed a 7 per cent decline in turnover to Pounds 48.7m from Pounds 52.5m (or Pounds 56.1m including discontinued activities). Sales in the south-east were particularly poor. And there was further bad news in that Mr Lawrence Snyder, chairman, said unsold stock from the spring and summer - in spite of extending the sale through August - would probably lead to a write-off at the end of the year. The shortfall on expected sales was about Pounds 4m. Analysts typically downgraded profit forecasts by Pounds 1.5m to take account of this. The share price shed 18p to close at 180p, compared with 444p in September last year, not long after the retail group demerged from Claremont Garments (Holdings), the Marks and Spencer supplier. Ms Ruth Henderson, chief executive, said Alexon ladieswear had performed the worst with a like-for-like sales fall of more than 10 per cent. Dash leisurewear was down by nearly 10 per cent. Eastex, aimed at the older, shorter woman and relaunched early last year, had gained 10 per cent and was now approaching a quarter of the business. The three brands had got off to a good start with their autumn ranges. However, Mr Snyder pointed out that the comparison was against a dreadful September 1991. He was in mea culpa mood, saying the group had got 'an awful lot wrong' in the past couple of years. The group had survived the early part of the recession relatively unscathed and its ranges had not been 'as fashionable as they should have been'. In Dash it had had to broaden the product range considerably to tackle the problem of copying. He said the stock problem should not recur because the group had ceased to commission so much in advance. Interest payments amounted to Pounds 803,000 (Pounds 557,000) and the average overdraft was about Pounds 14m. Fully diluted earnings per share fell to 4.39p (7.66p). The interim dividend is held at 3p. COMMENT Alexon annoyed analysts six months ago with an unexpected Pounds 400,000 pension cushion for its profits, and it has annoyed them again with the stock hangover. This is enough to set hands wringing over the management's credibility. However, the past year's disappointment ought to be seen against a good record over the previous eight years, especially in building up Dash and reviving Eastex since their acquisition in 1988. Much effort has been put into revitalising the products and the group has traditionally been tight on costs. There is no denying that the stock mistake was a big one - and showed that the management had got blase about sales. The lesson seems to have been learnt. A pre-tax forecast of Pounds 7.5m gives a prospective p/e of 12.5. This is at a discount to the stores sector, which it has underperformed by about 60 per cent in the past 12 months. Considering its long-term recovery prospects, it looks cheap and is supported by a yield of nearly 8 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Thoroughbred trainer Roger Stein has sued Truesdail Laboratories of Tustin for  "fraud, suppression of evidence, cover-up and laboratory malpractice," and  asked for damages in excess of $25 million in a complaint filed in Los Angeles  County Superior Court.  </P> <P> A postrace test conducted by Truesdail on Emperor's Turn, a horse trained by  Stein, last October at Santa Anita allegedly came up positive for cocaine,  prompting track stewards to levy a six-month suspension and a $2,000 fine on  the trainer. Stein is appealing the suspension and fine.  </P> <P> In the suit, Stein alleges that the lab intentionally destroyed a blood sample  taken from Emperor's Turn before it could be examined by an independent  laboratory, then attempted to cover up the destruction.  </P> <P> Dr. Norman Hester, president of Truesdail Laboratories, had no comment on the  suit.  </P></p>

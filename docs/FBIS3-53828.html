			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Amman (Petra)--The Fourth Islamic-Christian Dialogue  opened in Amman Tuesday [18 January] with a call from Jordan on  scholars and laymen alike to safeguard religion as a source of  justice and good deeds.    "We have a duty to isolate religion from and keep it safe  against political upheavals, whims and changes so that the  people will not lose confidence in their faith or suspect  religious teachings," said Nasir-al-Din al-Asad, president of  the Royal Academy for Islamic Civilisation Research (Al al-Bayt  Foundation).    Deputising for His Royal Highness Crown Prince Hasan, the  Regent, at the opening of the three-day meeting, Dr. al-Asad  said Muslim scholars and the heads of the Christian faith have  contributed towards bringing closer together the views of the  two sides and achieving better understanding between them.    It is hoped that these dialogues in which many senior  personalities from the two faiths and their societies  participate would help scrutinise those issues that have  remained outstanding and unclear and open the way for a better  comprehension of the principles on which the two religions are  based, said Dr. al-Asad.    Commenting on Jordan's endeavours to protect the holy places  in Jerusalem under the Hashemite rule, Dr. al-Asad referred in  particular to the recent royal decree for the formation of a  commission to handle the affairs of the holy city, grouping  Christian and Muslim individuals.    He noted that the present dialogue is dedicated to  discussing  religions' stand vis-a-vis nationalities, adding that religions  do not conflict with nationalistic feelings, but rather advocate  ending extremism, ethnic differences and other forms of  conflicts.    Cardinal Francis Arinze, president of the Vatican Council on  Promoting Relations with other faiths, who is attending the  meetings, told the first session that Christianity does not  oppose positive nationalities which do not oppose the law of  God. Christianity, he said, rather opposes those feelings of  superiority over other ethnic groups because such feelings  transform nationality into oppressive movements that work  against man and God.    A total of 65 scholars are participating in the discussions  held at the King 'Abdallah Mosque in Amman.    They are all scholars from Jordan, Palestine, Iraq, Bosnia,  Turkey, Senegal, Sudan, Morocco, Syria, Lebanon, the United  Kingdom, the United States, Malaysia, Spain, Nigeria and France.</p>

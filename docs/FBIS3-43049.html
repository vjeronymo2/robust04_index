Khristoforov, Dynamics of Geospheres  Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow; UDC 550.348.098]    [Abstract] A study was made to determine the minimum energy  of a space body impacting on the Earth's surface with which the  developing cloud breaks through the tropopause and enters the  upper atmosphere. The possible consequences of impacts of bodies  with a diameter from 100 m to 1 km is examined; the altitude of  rising of the cloud is estimated for an impact with an energy  10-30 megatons. The physical picture of the resulting effects is  discussed in detail. With the impact of meteor bodies with an  energy in the indicated range a break is formed in the  tropopause and dust surges into the upper layers of the  atmosphere. With an increase in the mass of the impacting body,  and accordingly, an increase in the energy of the explosion by  two or three orders of magnitude, there is a change in the very  character of rising of the dust cloud because instead of a  turbulent cloud rising relatively slowly under the influence of  Archimedes force a high-velocity plasma of the space body and  ground (with the mass of the latter being greater than that of  the space body itself) escapes into the upper layers of the  atmosphere. The atmospheric dust content will be determined to a  considerable degree by condensation processes. Only in the late  stages will there be a slower ejection of melt and finely  dispersed dust to lesser altitudes, but nevertheless above the  tropopause. Additional atmospheric pollution will occur due to  the great fires arising under the influence of thermal  radiation. Figures 4; references 15: 1 Russian, 14 Western.</p>

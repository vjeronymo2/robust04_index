			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>   [Text] Ousted Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang has been  allowed to go on a tour of Sichuan Province, one of his major  power bases. Chinese sources said that, while it was unlikely  Mr Zhao would return to the political scene in an official  capacity, his role as a potential kingmaker had become apparent  as the health of patriarch Deng Xiaoping remained precarious.    The sources said Mr Zhao arrived in the provincial capital  of  Chengdu before the Lunar New Year, and that he would be  returning to Beijing later this month. They said while the  former party general secretary enjoyed "generally good health",  he suffered from an unspecified lung ailment and had spent some  time at a sanatorium in Chengdu. Mr Zhao's wife, Liang Boqi,  who had treatment in a Beijing hospital late last year for a  heart problem, is also believed to be resting in the same  sanatorium.    An informed source in Sichuan said Mr Zhao continued to pay  attention to economic and political reform in the country, but  he was not in a good mood. "Mr Zhao is worried about the  pervasiveness of corruption, and the fear that it may get  worse," the source said. "He hinted the present leadership had  not acquitted itself well in curtailing graft saying he had done  more to stop corruption during his tenure as premier and party  chief."    Moreover, the source added, almost five years after his fall  from grace, Mr Zhao was still complaining about mistreatment.  "I was accused of liberalisation on the economic front, but the  leadership has been doing things that I would not have dared  do," he reportedly said.    China analysts said it was significant that Mr Zhao, who had  been under virtual house arrest, had been allowed to go to  Sichuan where he was party boss from 1975 to 1980. Last year,  the leader of the party's liberal wing was permitted to pay  visits to Guangxi, Hunan and Jilin provinces but not to  Guangdong, where he had also been party secretary.    It is understood the administration is nervous about Mr Zhao  travelling out of Beijing particularly in light of the  enthusiastic reception accorded the former leader last year.  Although Mr Zhao's status was that of an ordinary party member,  he was met in each of the three provinces by the top party  leaders.    Western diplomats said Mr Zhao's former associates had  become  more active since news about Mr Deng's failing health filtered  out late last year. These associates included former state  president Yang Shangkun and former head of the National People's  Congress, Wan Li. Mr Wan, who together with Mr Zhao spearheaded  agrarian reform in the late 1970s, was considered particularly  close to the former party chief. In the past few months Mr Deng  has told his intimates that Mr Wan should play a major role in  ensuring a smooth political transition after his death.    Sources in Beijing said Mr Zhao, who lives in a guarded  compound in the heart of the capital, had been allowed to see  more visitors since late last year. The latter included his  former associates as well as many influential children of senior  cadres.</p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: Anglovaal to raise R300m Anglovaal, one of South Africa's leading conglomerates with interests in mining, food and diamonds, is seeking to raise R300m (Dollars 82m) through an international offering of low-voting 'N' shares. According to bookrunner SG Warburg, this is the first international equity offering by a South African company since the country's general election in April. The proceeds will be used to finance Anglovaal's planned acquisition of Willards, a South African potato-crisp manufacturer. The issue's performance is likely to be closely monitored by other South African companies which are considering similar deals. A total of 2.5m 'N' shares will be sold on a global basis, and they will also be available to US investors under the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission's Rule 144A, which allows exemption from many normal disclosure requirements. The shares closed at R130 in Johannesburg yesterday. The company is due to start an international roadshow next week and the shares are likely to be priced on June 23, the day after the South African budget. The offer closes on June 30. News that the International Finance Corporation, the private sector arm of the World Bank, will include South Africa in its global index with a weighting of 13 per cent has increased international investor interest in the country.</p>

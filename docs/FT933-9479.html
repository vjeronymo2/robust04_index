			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Qatar to contest tribunal's Pounds 385m award to Westland QATAR is to contest the ruling last month by a Geneva-based arbitration tribunal that it, along with two other Arab governments, owes the British helicopter company Westland Pounds 385m in an action for breach of contract. Last month the tribunal awarded Westland the money in damages in the company's action against the governments of Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, as well as the Arab Organisation for Industrialisation and the Arab British Helicopter Company. A statement carried by the Qatari News Agency yesterday said the tribunal 'has no jurisdiction over any of the three countries, and any ruling by it does not bind any of these countries to pay any amount of money to Westland'. The dispute, which has been continuing since 1980 in the International Chamber of Commerce, concerns the collapse of an Egyptian-based helicopter manufacturing project. The tribunal decided in Westland's favour two years ago, ruling that the industrialisation body and the three states were liable for damages for breach of contract. The sum owed was set last month. The project, launched in 1978, involved setting up manufacturing facilities in Egypt for Westland Lynx military helicopters. It was to be done through Arab British Helicopter, a joint venture with the industrialisation body, Egypt and the three Gulf states. The partnership broke up after the 1979 Israel-Egypt peace treaty and the subsequent ostracism of Egypt by other Arab governments, leaving Westland stranded after investing in the new facility. The four partner countries were to have bought the first 250 helicopters produced at the plant, with further production intended for export.</p>

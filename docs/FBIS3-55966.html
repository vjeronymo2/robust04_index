			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yelizaveta Leontyeva: "Police Join Forces"] </F>   [Text] The Bureau To Coordinate the Fight Against  Organized Crime and Other Dangerous Forms of Crime on CIS  Territory has started work in Moscow.    The decision to create it was adopted by the Council of CIS  States' Heads of Government. As a preliminary step a decision  was made on joint measures to combat organized crime. There is  no time to waste -- despite differences in mutual relations  among the republics, a unified crime-conducive space has  survived in the CIS. Moreover, there is information that  criminal formations have "spread out" across the whole of the  former Union. Almost one-third of permanent criminal groups --  and 3,500 of them have been uncovered in Russia -- have  interregional links.    Commonwealth countries have a common problem in the shape of  "illegal" business in such lucrative fields as the export of  various kinds of raw materials and cultural treasures;  large-scale bank fraud and the theft and resale of cars; and  extortion, thefts, and attacks on means of transport. A  particular danger is posed by gangs engaged in the illegal  distribution of drugs and firearms and in foreign currency  dealings.    Criminals have "staked out" their own areas in each  Community  state. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, for example, are  "distinguished" for weapons sales and foreign currency dealings.  All the Transcaucasus republics are famous for their  concentration of bandit formations and also for weapons sales.  And raw materials illegally transit the Baltic states.    The newly created Bureau is a prototype "Europol." Its work  will be much more practical than that of Interpol, which is more  reminiscent of a police mail box. The Bureau's main task will  be precisely to combat crime in the CIS (particularly in its  organized forms). This is a task which is intended to result in  a decline in social tension, an improvement in the socioeconomic  situation, and the regularization of the consumer market. It is  also important to ensure that the dangerous processes of the  merging of criminal and economic crime do not gather momentum  and that criminal gang leaders and corrupt officials do not find  a common language. And how is drug addiction and the drugs  business to be eliminated? All this will undoubtedly fall on  the new Bureau's shoulders.    The Convention on Legal Aid and Legal Arrangements in Civil,  Family, and Criminal Cases signed in Minsk 22 January last year  provides a good legal basis for the matters which the Bureau  will tackle. But first the Convention has to be ratified. This  is a task for the new [Russian] parliament, which will be faced  with a whole series of legislative acts.</p>

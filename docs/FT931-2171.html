			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / French Elections: Left, right, or just Fed up? Vote for me]  -Fringe parties help spoil the chances of mainstream candidates BRINGING the total number of candidates to a record 5,169 in yesterday's first round of voting were more than a dozen fringe parties  - ranging from left- and right-wing splinter groups, to single-issue movements such as those for and against shooting and fishing, to the 'Fed Up' party. Most of these several hundred fringe candidates were knocked out last night, under the rule that only a candidate gaining 12.5 per cent of registered votes can go on to the second round of voting for the parliamentary elections on March 28. But some will have helped to spoil the chances of mainstream candidates. The Citizens Movement is fielding 52 candidates, many of them drawing votes away from Socialists, even though this party's founder, Mr Jean-Pierre Chevenement, the dissident Socialist ex-minister, is still a Socialist party member and running for re-election himself on its ticket. Muddying the waters in the centre of the political spectrum is the Movement of Reformists, inspired by Mr Jean-Pierre Soissons, himself an oddity as the current non-Socialist farm minister in the government of Mr Pierre Beregovoy, prime minister. The countryside has spawned many mini-parties - the 'Hunting, Nature, Fishing and Tradition' party (strong in Dordogne and Picardy), their more numerous opponents in the 'New Ecologists' Rally for Nature and Animals', and the hardline farming opponents of EC farm reform who have formed 'The Stakes for France' movement. To complete the political gamut of open-air enthusiasts, there is also the 'Rally for Sport' campaign pledged to give 'sport the place it deserves in our society'. Mysterious to most voters is the 'Natural Law' party. Active in Britain in the general election last year, this movement has now crossed the Channel with a promise to deal with high French unemployment by levitation. By contrast, many voters could probably identify with the 'Fed Up' (Ras-le-Bol) party, but since it fielded candidates only in Lorraine, only voters there had an actual chance to do so.</p>

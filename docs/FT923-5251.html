			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (12): In the throes of transformation - UK aerospace has lost a quarter of its jobs in three years WITH AN annual turnover of Pounds 12.5bn and exports of more than Pounds 8bn, the UK aerospace industry is Europe's largest and second only to the US. But it is now facing a series of pressures that are already beginning to alter its fundamental shape and nature, and are likely to have significant long-term repercussions for British manufacturing as a whole. The industry is in the throes of profound restructuring, to adapt to falling defence expenditure and the recession in civil aviation. The Society of British Aerospace Companies (SBAC), the industry's trade association, is estimating a 25 per cent fall in employment in the UK aerospace industry between 1989 and the end of this year, because of cuts in defence procurement and the slump in the commercial side of the business. Total employment is expected to fall from 194,000 in 1989 to around 150,000 by the end of this year. Another 40,000 UK aerospace industry jobs could be directly at risk if (as discussed on page 12 of this survey) the European Fighter Aircraft programme collapses. Even though Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, have continued to support strongly the Pounds 20bn EFA project, the decision of Germany to withdraw from the production phase of the new combat aircraft has made the future of the programme extremely uncertain. All the main UK aerospace companies have been forced to cut jobs and restructure their operations. British Aerospace, Europe's largest aerospace company, has undergone an extended period of top management turmoil, and is now refocusing its activities on its core aerospace and defence businesses. It has been forced to make extensive job reductions, announced that it is looking for a buyer to acquire a majority of its corporate jet business, and is scrambling to resolve the problems of its loss-making regional aircraft operations. It has also made clear that the company in future would no longer develop any new commercial aircraft on its own, and that it would rely increasingly on its 20 per cent involvement in the European Airbus programme for which it provides all the wings. Rolls-Royce, ranked as Europe's third largest aerospace company, has also been restructuring heavily, closing and rationalising plants and shedding 7,000 jobs over the past two years, in an effort to improve productivity to compete against its two larger US rivals, General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney, and to adapt to a shrinking defence market. Unlike previous downturns, the SBAC is worried by the current shake-out in the industry, because some UK aerospace companies have reported that over 30 per cent of job losses were among engineering and technical staff. 'In short, companies are cutting long-term capability,' the SBAC said, in a recent briefing paper. Apart from the loss of manpower, the downturn in both the civil and military sectors is also threatening the long-term health of the UK aerospace industry in other ways, according to the SBAC. The technology base is shrinking, with cuts taking place without benefit of any national assessment of the core technologies required to ensure that the UK's industry maintains a competitive edge. Falling sales are limiting the industry's ability to invest in product development. International competition is becoming fiercer, and competitor countries are becoming increasingly aggressive in their international marketing efforts and providing additional support for their indigenous industries. In the face of a shrinking defence market, aerospace companies have increasingly turned to civil activities, which are expected to show stronger longer-term growth once the airline industry recovers. Aircraft manufacturers are continuing to forecast demand for up to 8,000 new airliners during the next 15 years. But the SBAC emphasises that aerospace companies will need to invest heavily in new technologies at a time when the costs of product development are growing by between 5 and 10 per cent a year above inflation. 'Investment can only come from the return on sales, which, during the current recession, are being squeezed,' it adds. At the same time, there is a close link between the civil and military sides of the UK aerospace business. Reductions in defence activities (a fall of between 10 and 15 per cent in Ministry of Defence equipment expenditure is expected over the next few years, coupled with similar falls in Europe and the US) are bound to have a negative impact on commercial aerospace operations. 'The forecast reductions in overall defence expenditure will affect competitiveness throughout the aerospace industry, because reduced business levels drive up production costs and essential overheads, such as the maintenance of major research and test facilities,' warns the SBAC. To adapt to the new circumstances in the defence market and the commercial aerospace slump, the industry is adopting a series of options, including consolidation, greater collaboration, globalisation, or acquisition as has been the case this year with the TI Group's hostile bid for Dowty, the aerospace components maker. But the industry is also calling for the government to show more robust support by encouraging expansion of the civil aerospace sector and by increasing investment in new space and other civil projects. Additionally, the industry would like to see government launch funds for civil aerospace projects, expanded to include equipment and avionics, as well as backing for large aerospace companies considering investment in fields outside their traditional activities. The industry also argues that a government policy is needed on defence diversification, to study possible conversions from defence to civil activities. Above all, the UK industry believes a dialogue between companies and the government has become vital, to ensure that the country maintains the optimum defence industrial base and leading-edge technological competence in spite of the current wave of restructuring.</p>

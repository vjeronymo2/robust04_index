			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Opening statement by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez at a </F> news conference with domestic and foreign correspondents at the  Moncloa Palace in Madrid -- live]    [Text] Good afternoon. Thank you for attending this news  conference, which I want to make very brief. In view of the  situation of social alarm existing in recent days and also the  atmosphere of political crisis, I thought it necessary to  clarify to you, and thus to public opinion, what my position is  as head of government and also what the government's position is.    First, I must say that I share the climate of social alarm.  I think that the cases that have appeared recently, the cases  of corruption -- both the affair of Mr. Roldan [former head of  the Civil Guard] and the affair of Mr. Rubio [former Bank of  Spain governor] -- are serious enough to create that climate of  social alarm.    Second, I wish to say that I took on a commitment on 6 June  last year. During the whole election campaign, but in  particular on 6 June, the commitment was to a twofold endeavor  for our country. First, to fight against any cases of corruption  that might appear, even if they were, as in this case, old  corruption cases; and, second, to fight to overcome the economic  situation or the economic crisis that our country was going  through. These were the two major objectives of the election  campaign and of 6 June.    All of this has to be done in a climate of political  stability. We have been carrying out that task and shall  continue to do so.    The first doubt that I would like to clear up, because I  know  that there is speculation -- and not only speculation, there are  some opposition political forces that are even calling for my  resignation as prime minister -- the first thing that I would  like to clear up is that I am not going to resign. On the  contrary, I believe that it is my responsibility to remain as  head of government, to clear up the cases that have appeared and  any others that may appear, and to continue to fight the  situation of economic crisis, which we are beginning to  overcome. I also believe that this uncertainty and this social  alarm may cause economic harm. Therefore, we must continue to  fight our country's economic crisis in a serious, rigorous  manner.    You know what the events of the last few days have been, but  I will give an account of them as a brief summing up. Last  Saturday [30 April] I received the resignation of the minister  of the interior -- a resignation related to the political  responsibility that he accepted for the disappearance of Mr.  Roldan. I have accepted that resignation and I will explain to  you now, in order to avoid speculation, that I will be proposing  to the king that Luis Alberto Belloch should take charge of the  Ministry of the Interior, as well as his present Ministry of  Justice portfolio. Thus the Ministries of the Interior and  Justice will be merged and Luis Alberto Belloch will head that  double ministry. Because of his sense of political  responsibility, I have also received [former Interior Minister]  Jose Luis Corcuera's resignation of his parliamentary seat.  Naturally this is not a decision I can make; he was elected by  voters, but I think that it is an honorable gesture on his part,  from the point of view of political responsibility about which  so much is said -- and so often -- in our country.    Then yesterday afternoon I received -- and therefore I  understand that the climate from the political point of view is  a difficult one -- I received the resignation of the agriculture  minister. He has explained the reasons and of course I want to  thank him for the effort he made during this time, his good work  from the point of view of his political responsibility, and  naturally also for taking on that political responsibility.    I also want to underline the fact that I think that one  should make a distinction: In the case of the agriculture  minister there was never any enrichment due to his public  office. Consequently, I think that his explanation yesterday is  exactly what happened. I think that we should, or that I  should, accept this resignation and I have suggested that the  minister be replaced by Luis Atienza, who is now working at the  General Secretariat for Energy; he knows the ministry well,  having worked with Pedro Solbes while Pedro Solbes was minister.    I remain with the question of political responsibility. In  the Rubio affair, Carlos Solchaga has tendered his resignation  as president of the socialist parliamentary group and also the  resignation of his seat in the Congress of Deputies,  representing Navarre. In this case, as is also obvious, I wish  to thank Mr. Carlos Solchaga for the prodigious work that he has  carried out in all the posts of political responsibility that he  has occupied. He has done so effectively, with total  dedication, and, in my judgement, with laudable integrity in  every way. He is, then, capable, as any of us are, of making  the occasional mistake, but he has made this gesture, accepting  political responsibility in a role -- one in the parliamentary  group -- that has nothing to do with the role he exercised  before as minister of economy and finance. He has done so  seeking to register above all the significance of being able to  help the party and help the government in this situation, that,  as I admitted at the beginning, is a situation of serious  difficulty, which therefore calls for serious measures to be  taken.    The filling of that vacant post is not my responsibility,  but  rather that of the party's executive and the parliamentary  group, and in my view it will be filled immediately.    So here we have a number of the members of the government  team or the parliamentary team accepting political  responsibility, a degree of political responsibility that  probably exceeds what might be demanded in any democracy, but  that is perhaps made advisable -- and I am grateful for that  reason -- by the climate that our country is experiencing.    As I do not want this introduction to be too long -- I do  not  want to turn it into a speech -- I will repeat, because I want  it to be perfectly clear, that I respect, particularly in  certain cases, those people who think that the prime minister  ought to resign. I do not share their opinion. In some cases,  I repeat, the call for my resignation may have good intentions  or foundations and I therefore do not question them. In other  cases they are part of a political struggle that disregards such  important factors as political stability.    I know that the issue of whether or not the government is  going to face a vote of no confidence is also being discussed.  I want to tell you that I do not exclude this. However,  according to the Constitution, a no-confidence vote happens when  there is proof that there is a lack of parliamentary support.    However, regarding the decision to go ahead with a rigorous  investigation of the outstanding corruption cases, regarding the  decision to forge ahead with the policies that are proving  themselves efficient in bringing us out of the economic crisis,  in restructuring the labor market and other structural reforms,  I can assure you right now, this afternoon, that we still have  parliamentary support. The main one-party support is of course  that of the Socialist party, the socialist group, with the seats  it has. However, I spoke with Mr. Pujol, the president of  Convergence and Union, and he repeated his will to maintain this  support and this stability.    I also had the opportunity to briefly speak to Mr. Arzallus  [president of the Basque Nationalist Party]. He says he does  now want to enter into a game that could have destabilizing  consequences either.    Consequently, I think that the stability of our country is  very important at this key time for getting over the economic  crisis. My aim is consequently a firm will to forge ahead in  this twofold direction: I repeat, to clarify the issues at stake  and to get over the situation that our economy is going through  -- fortunately all the data and all the impartial observers  agree that it is getting better.</p>

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Sport: Precision is the Cambridge hallmark - The Boat Race / Oxford are underdogs but do not write them off - they have achieved the improbable before A boat race poster in the rowers' gym on the Iffley Road in Oxford asks: Can Oxford ever win? Until last year's race the poster's inquiry centred on Cambridge but after Oxford's defeat, a perceptive Dark Blue rower with a sense of humour changed it. It was a gesture that marked the end of Oxford's dominance in the varsity boat race. Before last year's Light Blue victory, Cambridge had won only one race in the last 17. Oxford had a stranglehold on the Beefeater trophy that threatened impartial interest in the race. Furthermore, Cambridge seemed impotent in the face of such superiority. However, this year Cambridge are the stronger crew and will start the race today at 12.30pm as hot favourites. What changed? The tide began to turn before last year's race and the change was obscured as Oxford pulled out a couple of remarkable victories against the odds. The Dark Blue wins in 1991 and 1992 masked some frailties. The Oxford crews were big and strong but their technique looked heavy handed. Recent Oxford crews have struggled in the last month before the race and have relied on Mike Spracklen, a renowned international coach, to wave the magic wand in the final two weeks. However, Spracklen and his wand are missing this year. Nothing epitomises the change between the two camps more than their approach to coaching. Cambridge have had only two head coaches in the last five years while Oxford have changed head coaches every year for four years. The Cambridge crews have benefited from the consistency. They row with a precise and fluid style. It is a style often found in top lightweight crews that cannot substitute size for skill. Eight blades come down to the water as one at the catch and emerge smoothly from the water at the finish. The Cambridge style was pronounced in a recent race with a potential Great Britain eight, rowing as Leander. The Light Blues left the internationals wallowing four lengths adrift. After that encounter, Brian Armstrong, director of international rowing in this country, described Cambridge as the best varsity crew he had seen, worthy of a world championship final. Oxford's coaching difficulties exploded in their faces last weekend. Richard Tinkler, head coach, and his assistant, Tim Bramfitt, were asked to step aside in the final week to allow Fred Smallbone, former Olympic oarsman, to take over. Tinkler and Bramfitt took this badly and after a public argument between them and the crew on the towpath they retreated in a huff. Oxford, it was argued, needed a fresh face and voice. Something new to lift their confidence in the last few days. The two coaches saw it differently and felt this was scant reward for six months very hard work. The hub of the dispute is a clash of personality between Tinkler and Jo Michaels, a former Oxford boat club president who is preparing for his fourth boat race. Tinkler saw Michaels as disruptive and said he was becoming an anchor on the boat. Steve Royle, director of Oxford rowing, called for a vote of confidence in the coaches, which went 8-1 in the coaches' favour. The lugubrious Michaels, moving to protect his seat, was the only dissenter. Strangely, the Oxford camp then decided to go for Smallbone. Some of the Oxford rowers are as confused as Tinkler and Bramfitt - who have been told they are very much part of the set up and have done nothing wrong. On Monday, the pair sardonically sipped coffee from the boathouse as they watched the Dark Blues take to the water. Ten yards away, Cambridge exuded inner harmony. Their coach for the run-in to the race is the New Zealander, Harry Mahon. The tanned and bearded Mahon looks as if he has just come from an Antarctic expedition. He stresses movement and rhythm to his charges who reward him with a silky smooth style with subtle changes in gear and speed. Mahon is coy about Cambridge's alleged superiority: 'It might be more interesting than the pundits are saying. Oxford have moved up a notch.' He constantly returns to movement as if he were a choreographer and uses analogies from the dance world. 'Moving like hell, instead of pulling like hell, using movement to put more power on the blade.' Cambridge have trained harder this year with outings frequently lasting up to 110 minutes and hour-long ergometer (rowing machine) sessions. Martin Haycock, last year's winning cox, is back in the driving seat after an earlier de-selection. He will not be drawn on today's outcome: 'In theory, this boat is faster than last year with a very fast base speed. We have four of last year's crew plus the cox, that really helps.' However, Oxford have responded well to the recent troubles. Steve Royle's calming presence has influenced the crew who have improved markedly. Oxford are relishing the role of the underdog and plan to capitalise on any Cambridge complacency. Oxford have done the improbable before and should not be written off.</p>

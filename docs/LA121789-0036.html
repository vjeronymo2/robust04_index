			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A HAVEN FOR GAY TEENS  </P> <P> I strongly agree that there should be some sort of program that accurately  addresses teen-age sexuality. But it infuriates me that our tax dollars are  being used to outright promote homosexuality. Virginia Uribe is not only a  proud lesbian, but a gay rights activist as well. How can a program founded and  operated by a lesbian activist be fair and unbiased? I am appalled that there  is even a debate as to whether this program is converting confused individuals  into proud homosexuals.  </P> <P> DAMON CARRON  </P> <P> Norwalk  </P></p>

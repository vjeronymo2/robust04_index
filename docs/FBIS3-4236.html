			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Ma Zhiping: "State To Step Up Reserve </F> Plan"]    [Text] A reserve scheme for key commodities is being  developed further to control price rises and curb inflation,  official sources said at the weekend.    The system, designed by the Internal Trade Ministry, aims to  ensure supplies of vital consumer goods cover people's basic  needs.    The programme has been tested in Shanghai, Beijing and  Tianjin and in Liaoning, Hubei and Guangdong provinces since the  start of the year .    "Shanghai has done a very good job in setting up a  municipal-level reserve system for important commodities  including grain, edible oil, pork and sugar," said a ministry  official.    "And the reserve system is already helping to stabilize  Shanghai's food market," he said, adding that the city's stocks  of pork and sugar could meet the daily needs of its more than 13  million citizens for about two months.    The system would also allow local governments to feed people  and keep prices stable in the event of natural disasters or  other "unexpected accidents," said the official.    The central government has authorized provincial, regional  and municipal governments to decide on the type and quantity of  vital goods in local reserves, in line with the conditions they  face and changes in market demand.    Reserves are being built up by the various local governments  and their commercial departments in line with policies laid down  by the Internal Trade Ministry.    The scheme is also seen as another arm of the government's  economic controls, said the official.    Meanwhile, the central government is moving to build up its  own supplies of such essential goods as grain, cotton, edible  oil and steel to ensure a steady market supply, the official  said.    He also revealed that the government is pressing ahead to  establish a commodity market funding system across the country  to develop production centres for consumer goods.    The government has set crop targets of 450 million tons of  grain, 4.85 million tons of cotton and 17 million tons of oil  crops for this year.    The total value of agricultural production is scheduled to  grow by 4 per cent and its sales value and profits are to go up  by 25 percent and 19 percent respectively.</p>

			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Zaire's inflation hits 93% in month Zaire's monthly inflation hit 93 per cent in July as millions of banknotes flooded on to the black market, triggering the collapse of the zaire, the national currency, Reuter reports from Kinshasa. The rate, calculated by US embassy economists, was almost five times June's 21 per cent and the worst recorded for the past seven months. Annual inflation is estimated at 12,500 per cent. The rocketing prices highlighted a decline in living standards for Zaireans accustomed to years of privation. In Kinshasa's central market, shoppers are buying ever -smaller quantities of manioc, bread, palm oil and dried fish, as these staples double and triple in price. The number of beggars at the capital's junctions has grown and as petrol prices soar, the streets are packed with hundreds of people who can no longer afford public transport and spend up to eight hours a day walking to and from work. Despite an attempt by the new prime minister, Mr Kengo Wa Dondo, to bring the country's security forces under control, underpaid policemen, gendarmes and soldiers are becoming ever more blatant in their demands for bribes. Mr Kengo's new government has cited the flood of notes onto the market, which pushed the currency to a low of 1,400 against the US dollar from 710 in just 10 days, as the reason for suspending the central bank governor, Mr Ndiang Kaboul, last month. Officials allege Mr Ndiang, sensing he was about to be dismissed, printed money to cover clandestine payments to friends, influential politicians and army generals. Mr Ndiang insists the currency's collapse was triggered by pay-outs Mr Kengo ordered to cover army and civil servants' salaries. The stand-off between Mr Ndiang and the government continues as a central bank audit begins. In the past few days, the zaire has recovered slightly, touching 1,250 to the dollar, but economists said this was due to the bank running out of notes rather than a recovery of confidence in the currency.</p>

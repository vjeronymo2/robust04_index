			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Surprise convoy visits Wolfsburg THE WORKERS at Wolfsburg, Volkswagen's home town, did not know about the plainclothes police and lawyers who arrived in convoy at the giant factory yesterday morning. They did not see, or hear the seven vehicles - two Volkswagen mini-vans and five Opel saloons - which just before 10am snaked along the wide, tree-lined entrance to VW's 13-storey administrative block. 'Sure, we knew about all the rumours. But they raided the place today? Wow, that's a big surprise] Well, well,' exclaimed Mario, a 24-year-old VW technician. Mario's parents came to Germany from Italy as immigrant workers in the late 1950s. In the Tunnel Schanke pub, the men smoking and drinking in the long, narrow building close to the factory gates, barely believed it. 'You're joking. You mean to tell us that the police are on the 13th floor (where directors' offices and VW lawyers are based). Here at VW,' asked Mr Martin Liesner, an engineer at VW for 20 years. 'But what do they want?' Everyone in Wolfsburg either works for VW or knows someone who works there. In fact more than 54,000 of the town's 130,000 population works there. 'Wolfsburg is Volkswagen,' local officials say. With local unemployment at around 8 per cent, the town's workers want the affair over quickly. 'Lopez is our hope,' said Mr Liesner: 'He can make Volkswagen competitive, he can give us security.' Mr Lutz Schilling, VW's director of communications, explained: 'It is not only affecting the 13th floor. They are also checking out the marketing and management institute (a building close to VW's private houses) and some guesthouses,' all in and around Wolfsburg. Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua's office is on the 13th floor. 'From there, Mr Lopez has a view, and a vision,' said Mr Schilling, adding that Mr Lopez was 'working all day' yesterday. 'Actually, this raid is not a surprise,' he added, with commendable sang froid. 'We were expecting it to take place sooner. At least it will clear the air. We will help the investigators in any way. This will end the speculation.' But he conceded: 'This is not a fine day for anybody.' 'You ask me what is behind all this?' Mr Schilling said. 'Well, the fact that Lopez left the number one car manufacturer in the world . . . it was a shock for them.' He added: 'We are happy to have Lopez. He is the best manager in the field, the state prosecutors will give a complete picture at last.' As he spoke workers streamed in and out of the factory as usual, impervious to the drama taking place inside. 'This is just another normal day,' said Mahmut, who came from Tunisia 20 years ago to work for VW.</p>

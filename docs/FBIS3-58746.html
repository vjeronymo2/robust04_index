			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Sarah Womack, PRESS ASSOCIATION lobby correspondent] </F>   [Text] There is no prospect of the immediate withdrawal of  British troops from Bosnia, Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind  said today. He was speaking as Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd  began a two-day visit to central Bosnia, as part of  consultations on whether British troops should continue to serve  with UN forces there.    He stressed there was no question of Britain pulling out  unilaterally or withdrawing during "these winter months". His  comments came as protracted talks to try to end the fighting  remained deadlocked.    Mr Rifkind told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "There is no  question of us pulling out during these winter months. There is  a job to be done ... and that is going to take a little bit  longer at the very least.    "Secondly, I don't think there is any likelihood of Britain  pulling out unilaterally.    "What we are talking about is whether the United Nations as  a  whole should continue to be in Bosnia, whether the time might  come at some stage when it no longer can carry out its mandate.    "That's not just a matter for the United Kingdom. France,  Spain, Canada and a number of other countries are all having  exactly this debate at the present time."    Britain and France currently provide the thrust of the UN  military operation which protects aid convoys to treacherous  parts of Bosnia.    Mr Hurd, following the main supply route running through the  British bases at Tomislavgrad, Gornji Vakuf and finally Vitez,  the location of the First Battalion Coldstream Guards, will  speak to officers from the battalion group before moving on to  the UN headquarters for Bosnia in Kiseljak tomorrow.    Mr Rifkind, pressed whether it was unlikely that British  troops would still be serving in Bosnia in the spring, indicated  that this was too early a time for withdrawal.    "`Come the spring' I think is fairly early, we are not far  from the spring.    "I think the important point first of all is to see this  winter through."    But if by the spring or early summer there was no prospect  of  a peace settlement "then it does have to be addressed as to  whether the UN presence is making a material contribution to  ending this ghastly war."    Liberal Democrat defence spokesman Menzies Campbell said a  unilateral British withdrawal would be "wholly unreasonable".    But Tory MP Peter Viggers said the humanitarian mission was  grinding to a halt and it was time to pull out the troops.    The Gosport MP and Commons Defence Select Committee member  told the Today programme: "We are coming to a time of decision.  I fear that decision must be to withdraw the troops."    Meanwhile, peace mediator Lord Owen was struggling to retain  credibility after an embarrassing vote of no confidence from  disgruntled Euro MPs in Strasbourg.    The 106-95 vote showed their determination to express  dissatisfaction at Lord Owen's failure to find a breakthrough  after almost two years of bloody conflict.</p>

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Signal failures of rail reform: Government plans to privatise BR cannot meet competition, service and efficiency targets However upbeat a note Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, may try to strike at today's Conservative party conference, the reality behind the privatisation of British Rail is that it is in danger of running into the buffers. The government remains as determined as ever to drive through the legislation that will make rail privatisation possible: it hopes to introduce a bill in November and to complete the parliamentary process by next summer. But as Department of Transport officials struggle to flesh out the bones of the white paper published in July, they are having to face up to the gloomy prognosis that the main aims of privatisation - more competition, greater efficiency and a wider choice of services - seem likely to translate into almost the opposite: local monopolies, even greater government subsidies, and the closure of both passenger and freight services. The principal factor undermining the government's plans is the one that has made rail privatisation so difficult from the start: the fact that BR is heavily loss-making. Even after subsidies of more than Pounds 1bn for commuter and branch line services in the year to March 1992, it turned in a pre-tax loss of Pounds 145m. A wholesale sell-off in the manner of other privatisations is therefore seen as impracticable. Instead, the government has decided to leave the railway tracks with BR and pursue a less ambitious notion of getting the operation of the trains into private hands. Its three-pronged plan is to sell BR's freight train operations outright; to franchise out the operation of the passenger services; and to encourage the private sector to start up new passenger or freight train services in competition with existing ones. Private sector involvement apart, the biggest innovation is the separation of the ownership of the trains from ownership of the tracks. After privatisation, the BR residuary body looking after the tracks - to be called Railtrack - will be required to operate on a commercial basis, earning a return on its assets by charging train operators for the use of its lines. The terms on which operators get access to the tracks are crucial to the success or failure of privatisation because they will largely determine whether there is any money to be made from running trains. But it is increasingly clear that any terms acceptable to train operators are likely to be in conflict with privatisation's main objectives. Take freight. At present, BR will carry almost any traffic provided it helps offset fixed costs. Customers are charged according to their ability to pay, with the result that some traffic makes only a small contribution to fixed costs while other traffic makes a comparatively large contribution. All this will change with privatisation. When the time comes for Railtrack to set out the track charges for private sector freight train operators, it may decide that the fair way to do so is to divide the track costs evenly between them. But this will mean that the traffic previously making small contributions to fixed costs will suddenly face much higher charges and become unviable, while the traffic that was previously making big contributions will enjoy a sudden fall in charges. One effect will be a loss of the marginal freight traffic to the roads; another, a downturn in Railtrack's revenues which will have to be made up by higher charges to other track users. One answer to this conundrum is to let Railtrack stick to the old system and charge what the market will bear. But it cannot, because under an EC transport directive governing access to the railways from January next year, the new track-charging regime is required to be non-discriminatory. Any attempt to introduce differential pricing would therefore provoke complaints to Brussels under EC competition law. The problems on the passenger side are still more fraught. Many of them are attributable to the government's determination to introduce competition to the railways by offering open access to all. Take, for example the hypothetical case of a company called TrainCo bidding for the franchise to operate the InterCity line between London King's Cross and Edinburgh. Once it has established what it must pay Railtrack for the use of the tracks and BR for the rental of its trains, TrainCo should be ready to launch its bid. But wait: what about open access? The government has said it wants to encourage competition by allowing other train operators to start up services alongside existing ones. Entrepreneurs, however, would only be interested in attacking the most lucrative services: in TrainCo's case, for example, they would probably want to operate a service 10 minutes ahead of the Flying Scotsman. So franchisees like TrainCo would have their profits attacked on the most lucrative services while still being obliged to run the other less profitable or loss-making trains. The same problem applies equally to subsidised services such as Network SouthEast's commuter operations. The government has said there will be negative tendering for loss-making services: in other words, franchises will go to the companies requiring the smallest subsidies. But not every train within an unprofitable service loses money, so entrepreneurs might still be tempted to enter the market and pick off profitable niches. The franchisee would then face even bigger losses on the remaining services. Two conclusions follow from the problems posed by open access. If the government holds fast to its commitment to open access, either the private sector will decline to bid for franchises altogether, or it will bid very small sums for the profitable franchises and require very large subsidies for the unprofitable ones. The result will be a big increase in the burden on the Exchequer. The only obvious alternative is to abandon open access and make the franchises exclusive: but that would defeat the government's intention to provide for on-rail competition. There is worse, from the passengers' point of view: at least, that is, for passengers living on the branch lines of Scotland, Wales and south-west England. Once Railtrack is in operation, the heavy cost of keeping these branch lines open will become transparent because Railtrack will be charging the whole of the cost to their users. The result would be to put the future of the lines in doubt. Take, for example, the line from Inverness to Wick in the far north of Scotland. The costs of operating and maintaining this 161-mile line - not presently divulged by BR - must be colossal; yet it carries only three trains daily each way, each of just two carriages. Any franchisee taking on the service would have to meet the whole of the track costs from the revenues from these three small trains. The train operator's losses would not only be vast, but would also be exposed to public scrutiny through the size of the subsidy required by the franchisee to take on the service. Once this happened, and it became clear that considerable sums could be saved by shutting the line and providing all its passengers with chauffeur-driven limousines instead, closure could become impossible to resist. Where subsidies are concerned, the prospect of line closures might suggest that the Treasury would gain from rail privatisation. In fact, it will almost certainly not: indeed, Whitehall sources indicate that the Treasury has already resigned itself to providing higher subsidies as a result of rail privatisation. One reason already touched upon is that the levelling of freight charges will cause marginally profitable traffic to disappear, while traffic that made a big contribution will enjoy a reduction in charges. Another is if open competition on the passenger lines leaves private sector entrepreneurs to cherry-pick the most lucrative services and keep the profits for themselves, the taxpayer will be left with an even bigger bill for subsidising the remaining services. In theory, these influences should be offset by efficiency gains from the private sector's involvement. But in practice, with Railtrack remaining a public sector monopoly and most of the passenger services remaining subsidised, there appears to be little scope for market forces to be brought to bear. Besides, the new structure will also have to carry the costs of the bureaucracies being created to serve it: Railtrack, the director general of Railway Regulation, the Passenger Railway Franchising Authority, and the operator licensing functions of the Health and Safety Executive, to name but four. Not all of privatisation's problems are insuperable. With freight charges, for example, some of the worst aspects of non-discriminatory pricing might be partially alleviated by establishing a range of price bands for different kinds of traffic. The aim would be to persuade the competition authorities that each kind of traffic constituted a separate market and therefore warranted a differential pricing regime. Some kind of fudge may also salvage the vestiges of open access. Any idea of different companies' trains competing simultaneously for the same passengers is out of the question, but it is just possible that some new services could be allowed onto the tracks provided they did not undermine the viability of existing ones by replicating them too closely. Even so, the reality of privatisation is in danger of falling far short of expectations. Insofar as privatisation brings any changes at all, they may be slow to arrive and almost imperceptible in their effects. Indeed, from this distance it is looking increasingly probable that the disadvantages will outweigh the benefits. So has the government chosen the wrong structure for privatisation? Probably not. Given the scale of BR's losses and the difficulties of trying to reconcile its commercial objectives with its social obligations, any 'Big Bang' sell-off of the railway, in whole or in parts, would probably have raised even more problems. Many of the difficulties outlined above, however, would evaporate if the railways could be made profitable. One reason why they are not so is that they cannot compete with roads which are free at the point of use. Significantly, transport ministers have been talking with more than usual enthusiasm in the last few days about the possible advantages of road pricing - that is, introducing a charge to vehicles for use of the busier roads. What Mr MacGregor says about that today may ultimately be more significant for the future of the railways than anything he says about privatisation itself.</p>

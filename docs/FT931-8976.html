			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / A TV tale of licence and licensing: Kevin Brown watches the final episodes of a soap opera in the Australian media AUSTRALIA'S television moguls are enmeshed in a soap opera more bizarre than anything on the small screen. The plot involves politicians, big business and struggling entrepreneurs. And the final episode, expected shortly, could seriously embarrass the government. The story began in November, when parliament approved the federal Labor government's plans for the introduction of subscription television services. It provided for two 4-channel commercial licences, and a 2-channel licence for the state-run Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). As an afterthought, the act also allowed the use of fibre optic cable or multi-point distribution systems by microwave (MDS) technology. 'There will be no restriction on the use of other technologies to deliver pay TV, such as cable or microwave,' Senator Bob Collins, the communications minister, told parliament. It is not clear whether Mr Collins realised that MDS could compete with satellite services. But the potential was spotted by some small media entrepreneurs, including Mr Steve Cosser, a former managing director of the Channel Ten commercial network, and Mr Kerry Stokes, a Western Australian publisher. By the end of January, Australis Media, Mr Cosser's private company, had acquired 24 microwave channels in Sydney and Melbourne, and was preparing to bid for a further six in each of Australia's six state capitals. Australis was also negotiating a partnership with Time Warner, the US publishing group, and Australian Provincial Newspapers (APN), an offshoot of Dr Tony O'Reilly's Irish Independent media group. Mr Cosser's plan was to set up a national subscription service, using microwave channels for local distribution and a satellite to carry the signal between cities. But less than 24 hours before the deadline for the remaining MDS channels, Mr Collins announced that the auction had been abandoned. He also instructed the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA), the independent regulatory body, not to issue licences to owners of microwave channels. Mr Collins said the ban was necessary to prevent 'inferior' MDS technology undermining the prospects for satellite transmission. He also claimed to have acted in response to pressure from the ABC. But a leaked letter from Mr David Hill, ABC chairman, shows that the government broadcaster told Mr Collins only three days earlier that it wanted to compete with Mr Cosser in MDS broadcasting. Nor does the claim that MDS is 'inferior' stand up to examination. The technology is in use in more than 20 countries, including in more than 17m homes in the US. The government's action has attracted almost universal opprobrium. But Mr Cosser has an explanation of why Mr Collins changed tack. He claims that the government was asked to block MDS by Consolidated Press Holdings (ConsPress), the media group owned by Mr Kerry Packer, Australia's richest man. Mr Packer, who dominates magazine publishing and owns a controlling share in Channel Nine, the top-rating commercial television network, is believed to be planning to bid for one of the two commercial satellite broadcasting licences. 'Kerry made us an offer, basically to get out of the road or get crushed. We rejected that offer,' says Mr Cosser. 'I believe that Kerry Packer's people and other large media players made representations to the government in the dying days of the tender process, some more forceful than others. But I don't know what was said, threatened or offered that led to such a dramatic policy reversal.' Mr Packer, who rarely speaks even to his own media, has not commented on Mr Cosser's claims. However, it is clear that both Channel Nine and the forthcoming satellite services would have faced serious competition if MDS broadcasting had not been blocked. In addition, the broadcasting act requires satellite broadcasters to use newly developed digital compression technology, which may not be available until 1996, giving MDS operators two or three years to build market loyalty. Whatever the reasons for his decision, Mr Collins has succeeded in reviving long-standing criticism of Labor's close relationship with media proprietors such as Mr Packer and Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, which controls 70 per cent of daily newspaper circulation. The decision has also hurt Australia's reputation among foreign investors, already wary following the last minute blocking of a proposed gold mine at Coronation Hill, in the Northern Territory, and the government's frequent policy changes over the sale of the Fairfax newspaper group, eventually acquired by Mr Conrad Black's UK Daily Telegraph group. However, the biggest blow to the government may be delivered in the courts, where it faces litigation on two fronts. In Western Australia, Mr Stokes won an interim injunction against the government's decision to stop the sale of MDS channels. The federal court will decide shortly whether the government has the power to stop the auction. In Sydney, Mr Cosser claims Mr Collins exceeded his authority in directing the ABA not to award MBS licences, and is threatening to sue for damages if the authority refuses his application. The wording of the broadcasting act suggests that he may win if the case goes to court. Australis has also lodged a complaint with the Trade Practices Commission, the competition watchdog, alleging that the commercial television networks colluded to prevent the company entering the subscription television market. Such collusion would be illegal under Australian competition legislation.</p>

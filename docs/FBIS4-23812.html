			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By David Greybe] </F>   [Text] Cape Town -- The ANC national working committee  decided yesterday to go ahead with a major phased restructuring  of the party aimed at gaining more effective party control over  members in government. The committee also agreed to introduce,  before next week's mini-session of Parliament, a type of  constituency system to ensure MPs and senators were put to work  effectively, ANC secretary-general Cyril Ramaphosa said  afterwards.    The committee, which met in Johannesburg, also set up a  subcommittee to investigate the salary structures of MPs,  senators and Ministers after complaints from ANC local and  provincial structures that these salaries were too big.    Ramaphosa said the ANC's restructuring was aimed at  "streamlining the party structures to ensure effective  co-ordination between what happens in Parliament, in government  and in the organisation".    He declined to disclose further details at this stage,  except  to say the restructuring would take place in stages. He  described the plan as "historic and ground-breaking". The next  stage would be for the ANC regions to discuss the proposal  before it was debated again.    Ramaphosa said the salary sub-committee would analyse the  report of the Melamet Committee on Remuneration of Politicians,  which was released in April and led to the row within the ANC.  The subcommittee would compare the salary structures under the  previous government and the new ones.    The Melamet committee recommended that MPs earn a basic  salary before tax of R193,200 [rand] while Ministers earn  R470,400 before tax.    The ANC parliament caucus decided two weeks ago that MPs,  senators, Deputy Ministers and Ministers would contribute  between R750 and R2,000 a month to the party earning the ANC  more than R260,000 a month.    ANC officials said earlier that they realised the danger of  ordinary MPs not having much work to do and seemingly being left  out in the cold on major decision-making. The more than 300 ANC  MPs and senators would be expected to represent all voters in  their area and not just their party's supporters.    The ANC constituencies -- the old system of constituencies  fell away when negotiators agreed to implement proportional  representation -- were expected to be broadly based on SA's  magisterial boundaries.</p>

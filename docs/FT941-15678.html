			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Fading hopes of a reduction in British interest rates in the wake of better than expected UK employment statistics brought heavy selling pressure in the derivatives for a second session in a row, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, a brief attempt at an advance in the March contract on the FT-SE 100 Index as it opened at 3,422 petered out with the release of the jobless numbers, leaving the contract to drift lower. US investment bank Goldman Sachs was said to have been the day's main player in the market and independent traders also joined the selling. March continued to slide, trading at a discount to fair value for most of the day. However, there was little sign of nervous selling among the London traders and one futures broker simply said: 'This is an inevitable correction that should lead us to 3,300, where we are likely to find good support.' The low of the day was reached at 3,379, but a bout of bear closing in the last few minutes of the session was expected to continue in after-hours' trading. March finished at 3,380, down 46 and at a 5-point discount to its fair value premium of around 13 points. Business in the stock options boosted overall volume in the traded options, which saw a total of 48,957 lots dealt by the close. Turnover in the FT-SE 100 option fell to 13,097 contracts and the Euro FT-SE option traded 5,223 lots. British Steel was the busiest stock option with a total of 5,006 lots transacted, followed by Tesco at 4,245. Prudential, at 2,039, and Land Securities, at 1,898, were also heavily traded.</p>

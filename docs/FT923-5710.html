			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Survey of Malaysia (9): A fillip for the capital markets - Privatisation / The first decade of the government's programme WHERE OTHERS have talked, Malaysia has acted. For the last decade, the government has embraced privatisation with an enthusiasm rarely matched elsewhere. This year alone has seen the sale on the Kuala Lumpur stock market of 23 per cent of the equity of Tenaga Nasional, the state electricity utility, and 30 per cent of Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional, the maker of Malaysia's Mitsubishi-based Proton cars. A total of 54 organisations have been privatised or partially privatised in the last 10 years, according to official figures. Most of them were existing government units sold to the private sector, and the rest new projects such as roads which would once have been the sole responsibility of the authorities. It all began in 1983. Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, initially had differences with Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the British premier, but her privatisation drive apparently caught his imagination. By regional standards, government involvement in the Malaysian economy was then exceptionally widespread, partly because of official efforts to speed the transfer of assets to the Malay community from the wealthier Chinese. Even in 1990, Malaysia's public expenditure amounted to 34.5 per cent of gross national product, compared with 21.5 per cent in Singapore and 15 per cent in Thailand. 'Hence we have to reorientate and downsize the public sector and promote privatisation,' Mr Mohamad Sheriff Kassim, secretary-general at the finance ministry, told a privatisation conference in Kuala Lumpur in June this year. Government officials cite several advantages of the privatisation programme, including windfall income of MDollars 6.7bn so far from the sale of government shares in privatised corporations, reduced government spending (privatisation has reduced the public sector workforce by about 65,000), and increased efficiency. They say the privatisation of the Klang Container Terminal in 1986 rapidly reduced the average length of time each container stayed on the dock, while the telephone network partially privatised in 1990 improved its service to customers, and the concession granted to a private television channel (TV3) in 1983 increased competition and benefited the viewing public. Furthermore, the privatisation programme has helped to develop local capital markets. Privatised companies account for a third of the capitalisation of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange. Recently, says Mr Mohamed Sidek, senior general manager of Arab-Malaysian Merchant Bank, 'we thought privatisation may crowd out some other private sector initiatives, but it didn't' The economic boom made sure of that. So far, the government has focused on 'flagship' corporations, including Malaysia Airlines System in 1985, in an attempt to ensure the success of the privatisation programme. But the smaller state entities, some of them unprofitable subsidiaries of state development corporations, need more restructuring and are more difficult to dispose of. On the government's own admission, 1991 was a disappointing year. Only five out of the original 23 targeted projects were privatised, because of lengthy and inconclusive negotiations between the government and private companies on projects initiated by the private sector, the need for new laws to allow for the privatisation of certain operations such as abattoirs and a failure to agree on the valuation of assets to be sold. However, a further 10 projects not included in the government's original action plan were also sold, including provincial companies such as Kedah Cement and Sabah Shipyard, bringing the 1991 total to 15. Plans are also under consideration to privatise the railways, while the government has shortlisted four proposals by private companies to build and operate electricity generating plants. Critics of the privatisation programme complain that the government has either maintained a majority stake or control in many of the larger, partially-privatised corporations, or effectively transferred control to ruling political organisations such as the United Malays National Organisation (Umno) or to influential individuals. For example, United Engineers, a company linked to Umno, was awarded the contract to complete the important north-south highway, a project which recently announced large financing overruns, and will now cost a total of MDollars 6bn. And a row erupted in parliament this year over allegations that Mr S Samy Vellu, the minister of energy, posts and telecommunications and leader of one of the parties in the National Front government, had misappropriated 9m shares from the privatisation of Telekom Malaysia. The dispute has yet to be resolved.</p>

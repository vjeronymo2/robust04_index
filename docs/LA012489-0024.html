			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MOTHER OF VICTIM SUES KILLER, 73;  </P> <P> FAMILY UPSET BY OUTPOURING OF SYMPATHY FOR SLAYER  </P> <P> The mother of a Southeast San Diego man shot to death, allegedly by a neighbor  who was irate about a parking problem, has filed a wrongful death lawsuit  against the neighbor in Superior Court.  </P> <P> Martha Copper of Alpine alleges in court documents that the "negligence" of  retired junk-car dealer Sam Lewis caused the death of her son, Sean Nichols,  who was 28 when he was killed Nov. 22 in his Gavin Street home.  </P> <P> Lewis, 73, is charged with two counts of murder in the deaths of Nichols and  his friend, Robert Rose, 33. His preliminary hearing is scheduled for Thursday  in San Diego Municipal Court.  </P> <P> Prosecutors say that the confrontation that left Nichols and Rose dead erupted  after Lewis became angry about a car that was blocking his driveway. Deputy  Dist. Atty. Robert Eichler said Lewis grabbed a .32-caliber revolver, walked  across the street and confronted Nichols through his screen door before firing  two fatal shots into the small living room.  </P> <P> Lewis, who had lived on Gavin Street for about 15 years, then walked back home,  asked his wife, Bertha, to call police, and turned himself in.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fired With No Warning  </P> <P> An eyewitness who was in the living room at the time of the shooting told  police that an "angry" Lewis opened fire even though Nichols had offered to ask  a friend in the rear of the home to move the offending car.  </P> <P> But defense attorney Millie Durovic said Lewis shot Nichols and Rose in  self-defense, believing they were going for guns. No weapons were found in the  house, but Durovic said Lewis heard Nichols ask another person in the home to  get him a gun and that he feared for his life.  </P> <P> The lawsuit, filed a week ago, seeks unspecified general and compensatory  damages. But, in an interview Monday, Copper said that she and her husband,  Tom, were not motivated by hopes of financial gain in suing Lewis.  </P> <P> "This is not about money, because there is no amount of money that can bring  back my son," Copper said. "Nothing is going to make it right. But there have  been all these suggestions that this man was justified in doing this, that he  had a reason. Well, we just can't take that. We just got tired of it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tide of Support  </P> <P> Copper was referring to the tide of support Lewis has received from friends and  community members, who founded a "Sam Lewis Support Fund" and raised enough  money to bail the Mississippi native out of jail in time for Christmas.  </P> <P> Many supporters have painted Lewis as a sort of folk hero, suggesting in  interviews and in letters to newspapers that he was justified in shooting  Nichols and Rose. At the same time, the two victims have been portrayed as drug  dealers who "tormented" the elderly Lewis, although police say there is no  evidence supporting those conclusions.  </P> <P> The Coppers' attorney, Peter S. Doft, said the civil action against Lewis  alleges that "whatever justification Mr. Lewis might think he had in shooting  Mr. Nichols, he was mistaken in that belief."  </P></p>

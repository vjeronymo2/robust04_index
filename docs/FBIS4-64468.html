			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Eugen Georg Schwartz report: "Current Coalition Hardly </F> Stands a Chance"]    [Text] The FOCUS-sponsored Basis Research Survey in April  indicated a 1 percentage point increase in the Union's  popularity, but it also suggested that the Union would lose its  dominant position. The new chancellor would be Rudolf Scharping.    According to the survey, with a projected election turnout  of  80 percent and without any overlapping mandates, the SPD [Social  Democratic Party of Germany] would return 274 deputies to  parliament, the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian  Socialist Union] would return 267, Alliance 90 and Greens would  return 68 deputies, and the FDP [Free Democratic Party] 47.  These figures are based on the Hare-Niemeyer system of  calculating votes, in use since 1987.    Thus, with a total of 656 parliamentary seats, there would  be  five possible coalitions. But only two of these are really  likely. One is an SPD-Alliance/Greens coalition with 342 seats,  and the other a grand coalition with 541 seats. The FDP would  only stand a chance of entering parliament as part of a  "red-yellow-green" coalition, but in such a case its capacity  would be limited.    If the PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism], derived from the  Socialist Unity Party of Germany, were to win three election  districts, for example Berlin and Brandenburg, it would win 28  parliamentary seats, because in this case its 4 percent total of  votes would not fall beneath the 5-percent threshold. In this  case, the number of SPD seats would fall to 262, the number of  Union seats to 255, the number of Alliance 90/Green seats to 66,  and the number of FDP seats to 45.    The consequence: The SPD and Greens, with a total of 328  seats, would be only one seat short of a parliamentary majority.  Or, to put it another way, if the PDS wins seats in the next  Bundestag, a grand coalition would be virtually inevitable,  according to the results of surveys so far.    The survival of the present Union/FDP coalition into the  next  Bundestag is becoming increasingly improbable. Although a  neck-and-neck race between the SPD and CDU/CSU seems possible on  16 October, the FDP is becoming Kohl's "security risk" to an  increasing extent. The survey suggests that the FDP would only  receive 6.5 percent of the vote. Never have the Free Democrats  been so far away from a double-digit result.    In answer to the question "If you could decide who is to  rule  after 16 October, who would you choose?" only 5 percent of  respondents said CDU/CSU/FDP (6 percent had said so in March),  but 16 percent said SPD/Greens, and 13 percent said CDU/CSU/SPD  (13 percent had said so in March).    Twenty percent of the respondents would like a CDU-led  coalition, 35 percent would like an SPD-led coalition, and 26  percent would like a coalition that includes the Christian and  Social Democrats.    The number of people preferring a sole SPD government has  again fallen from 17 percent in January to 14 percent in April.  On the other hand, the number of those preferring a Union  government has risen from 10 percent in January to 12 percent in  April.    What is noticeable is that although the Union has won a  percentage point in popularity, the observed upward trend in  Helmut Kohl's support has not continued. The chancellor has  lost 3 percentage points in the popularity ratings (now 29  percent), and Scharping has gained 3 points (now 47 percent).    It is of no use to Kohl that more people were optimistic  about the economy in April. In one year, i.e. six months after  the Bundestag elections, 46 percent of Germans expect a better  economic situation than today.</p>

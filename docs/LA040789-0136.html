			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 38 MORE SAVINGS AND LOANS SEIZED;  </P> <P> REGULATORS TAKE CONTROL OF 12 CALIFORNIA INSTITUTIONS  </P> <P> The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. seized control of 38 more troubled savings  and loan institutions Thursday, including 12 in California and 11 in Texas,  under President Bush's plan to shore up the thrift industry.  </P> <P> The government takeovers brought to 215 the number of savings and loans,  located in 31 states, enrolled in the so-called joint regulatory oversight  program, which Bush launched in February.  </P> <P> Under Bush's plan, the FDIC would take over many of the oversight  responsibilities now performed by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and its  insurance fund, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which is broke.  </P> <P> The FDIC, which now insures deposits at banks, said the 38 thrifts brought  under its control Thursday would maintain normal operations and depositors  would continue to be protected up to the $100,000 insurance level.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Negative Net Worth  </P> <P> Of the 38, six are in Southern California. Four of the six had already been  seized by S&amp;L regulators, who hired management teams to operate them while  seeking buyers.  </P> <P> The Southern California thrifts are all relatively small. The figures that  follow are all as of Dec. 31. The institutions are:  </P> <P> First California Savings, Orange -- $168 million in assets, $204 million in  deposits and a negative net worth of $75.1 million, which means that its  liabilities exceeded its assets by that amount.  </P> <P> Founded 19 years ago as Camino Real Savings, the S&amp;L had a history of bad  loans and foreclosed real estate. Its foreclosed commercial properties --  office buildings and apartments mainly in California -- continue to plague the  institution.  </P> <P> It was sold in 1985 to developer Mervyn Phelan of Orange, who claims in a  lawsuit against regulators that they misrepresented the institution's financial  health. S&amp;L regulators seized it in August, 1987.  </P> <P> At the end of last year, it had $167.9 million in assets and a negative net  worth of $75.1 million.  </P> <P> Founders Savings &amp; Loan, Los Angeles -- $132.6 million in assets, $160  million in deposits and negative net worth of $37.2 million.  </P> <P> Founders suffered losses from bad commercial and construction loans. In  addition, much of the books and records were in disarray when S&amp;L  regulators seized it in September, 1986, threw out top management and hired new  operators. At the end of 1988, Founders had $132.6 million in assets and a  negative net worth of $37.2 million.  </P> <P> Arrowhead Pacific Savings Bank, San Bernardino -- $57 million in assets, $81  million in deposits and negative net worth of $26.5 million.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Already Under Supervision  </P> <P> Arrowhead Pacific had not been seized by thrift regulators previously, but  regulators did force the institution to replace a number of top managers nearly  three years ago. The ousted managers were held accountable substantial losses  from loans in which Arrowhead participated with other S&amp;Ls. Many of those  loans were poorly underwritten and eventually went sour.  </P> <P> Unified Savings, Northridge -- $37 million in assets, $53 million in deposits  and a negative net worth of $18.5 million.  </P> <P> Unified already had been under regulatory supervision since October, 1986, when  it was declared insolvent and seized by federal thrift officials. Organized in  1982, the S&amp;L had been beset by bad loans, costly deposits and fraud by  certain customers.  </P> <P> City Savings &amp; Loan, Westlake Village -- $32 million in assets and $31  million in deposits. It had negative regulatory capital of $1.1 million.  </P> <P> Perpetual Savings, Santa Ana -- $23.7 million in assets, $34 million in  deposits and a negative net worth of $10.2 million.  </P> <P> Perpetual's insolvency was the result of losses from the purchases of  over-valued stock in a metal mining company and overvalued commercial property  in Los Angeles. The deals were financed with high-cost jumbo certificates of  deposit brought in from money brokers. Perpetual was seized March 18, 1987, and  regulators sued its founders three months later alleging that they were trying  to profit personally from the two deals.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Largest S&amp;L in Texas  </P> <P> Thursday's action should not have any effect on the operations of the S&amp;Ls,  except that interest rates on new deposits and on certificates of deposits that  are renewed will likely be reduced, said David Barr, a spokesman for the FSLIC.  </P> <P> "The institutions will be competitive, but they won't be known as the rate  leader in their communities," he said.  </P> <P> The largest thrift of the 38 seized Thursday is Murray Savings Assn., Dallas,  which had assets of $1.45 billion. Also involved were 10 other thrifts in  Texas, five in Mississippi, three in Missouri, two in Colorado, two in Indiana,  two in Illinois and one in Kansas.  </P> <P> The FDIC heads the joint regulatory oversight teams, which also include staff  from the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the FSLIC, the Office of the Comptroller  of the Currency and the Federal Reserve.  </P></p>

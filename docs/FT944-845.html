			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Arts: Confused sexual identities - Theatre off-Broadway Among the great pleasures of this bustling off-Broadway season is a rare New York stage appearance by Vanessa Redgrave, in Vita and Virginia, Eileen Atkins' adaptation of the letters of Vita Sackville-West and Virginia Woolf which played in Chichester and London last year. Redgrave is in stunning form: few actors look as alive, emotionally and physically, on stage as she, and the passionate, voracious Sackville-West is a character she was born to play. Atkins, here as in the show's English incarnation, plays Woolf, and though her performance brings out the woman's quiet strength, wry humor, and weakening emotional and physical health, even she cannot make sense of the story's abrupt ending: because the script focuses on the women only in relation to each other we have little sense of the factors which are sending Virginia over the edge to suicide. It is a lone weakness in Zoe Caldwell's otherwise elegant and entertaining production, which looks well ensconced at the Union Square Theatre until March, perhaps beyond. While Vita and Virginia feeds America's seemingly insatiable appetite for things English and literary, You Should Be So Lucky, another of the season's off-Broadway success stories, is one of those theatrical phenomenons that could only happen in New York. The play marks a turning point in the career of its playwright and star, Charles Busch, heretofore New York's best-known drag performer; it is his first stage appearance as a man. A modern-day Cinderella story/screwball comedy, You Should Be So Lucky concerns Christopher, an agoraphobic gay played by Busch, whose life is transformed when he lends a kind hand to an elderly stranger who turns out to be a millionaire. The conceit is far from original, Busch's storytelling is often clunky, and Kenneth Elliot's production is awkward to the point of being amateurish. But the play's spirit is so big-hearted that its faults end up working it its favour: we are drawn into a world as winningly idiosyncratic as Busch's lovably nebbishy stage presence. Play and production carry the authentically obsessive flavour of contemporary Manhattan life: everyone is either in therapy or desperately in need of it, and trying to create some sense of community in a world of opportunism, tiny apartments, rampant diseases, and trashy talk shows. A hit at the not-for-profit Primary Stages Company, it has now transfered to the Westside Theatre. As Busch gives voice to Manhattan's manic spirit, the outer boroughs have an able representative in Danny Hoch, a 23-year-old actor and writer whose solo show, Some People, is playing at the New York Shakespeare Festival's Public Theatre. A multi-character monologuist in the tradition of Anna Deavere Smith and John Leguizamo, Hoch impersonates New Yorkers of different social and racial backgrounds, from an Afro-Caribbean late-night DJ to a middle-aged Jewish mother to a Cuban-American girl in her 20s to a Puerto Rican senior citizen. Hoch is an astonishingly adept mimic, but he is still learning that the strength of his work lies in letting characters speak for themselves; a preachy coda tacked on to the 90-minute-long monologue undermines its subtlety. Nonetheless, it is a stunning debut from a young artist whose politics and aesthetics are bound to shape the next generation of American theatre. Lesbian English authoresses; a drag queen in trousers; an ethnically politicised monologuist: whence the voice of straight white America? A play by AR Gurney, America's premier playwright of White Anglo Saxon Protestant culture, seems a well-timed addition to this diverse theatrical climate, particularly given his present source material: the short stories of John Cheever, the Pulitzer Prize-winning chronicler of New York middle class culture. But the series of scenes and monologues Gurney has patched together out of these stories, called A Cheever Evening, does not add up to much of a play. The vignettes are so brief and Don Scardino's production at Playwrights Horizons so brisk and surface-level that there is no chance to get to know or care about the characters. We are left with a vague, generalised idea of the anxieties and passions underlying this social class's pristine exterior, but without anything solid to hang on to; it is like a dinner party that never gets past the hors d'oeuvres.</p>

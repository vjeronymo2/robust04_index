			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / World Commodities Prices: Copper prices bounce to 4-year highs - Market Report COPPER prices bounced to four year highs at the London Metal Exchange yesterday after absorbing a morning bout of selling associated with the approach of 'third Wednesday' option declarations. With that out of the way, buyers crowded back into the market, pushing the three months delivery contract to a four-year high of Dollars 2,751 a tonne at the close, up Dollars 68.50. Analyst Angus MacMillan of Billiton Metals explained that fundamentals remained supportive for copper, with stocks continuing to fall. Other base metals followed copper's lead and all ended with substantial gains. ALUMINIUM, bolstered by speculative buying and developing supply tightness, gained Dollars 28.50 at Dollars 1,183 a tonne for three months delivery. COFFEE futures pared gains to end sharply lower on mixed selling triggered by stop-loss selling orders in both New York and London and higher exports from Brazil. Compiled from Reuters</p>

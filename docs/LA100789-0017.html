			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPORTER COMMENDED FOR TAKING ON TAC  </P> <P> I would like to commend Julie Cart for her recent articles regarding the  unconscionable exploits of The Athletics Congress.  </P> <P> Perhaps some day the truth will come out about TAC in a public forum. It  obviously won't come out of a clandestine, self-serving TAC meeting.  </P> <P> I believe that talk of lawsuits to be brought against Darrell Robinson by  Florence Griffith-Joyner and Carl Lewis is simply rhetoric and empty threats.  </P> <P> If either sues, the truth is likely to come out with the subpoenaing of  athletes, coaches, doctors and others involved with drug use. Until this issue  is brought to court, the truth will come only in the form of a TAC  "investigation," and we know how reliable those are.  </P> <P> RON MILFORD, Burbank  </P></p>

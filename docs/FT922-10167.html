			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Zantac fears hit Glaxo PRESS reports from the US casting doubts over Glaxo's number one drug, Zantac, hit the shares in late trading and they fell sharply against the market. When trading began, the shares were up on positive news about Glaxo's anti-migraine drug announced on Thursday. However, a report of tests by researchers in Houston Texas suggested that antibiotics might be more effective in treating ulcers than the class of drugs which includes Glaxo's Zantac and SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet. Glaxo, for which Zantac represents about 75 per cent of profits dropped 24 to 720p. Turnover of 4.6m was higher than usual. Tagamet represents but a third of SmithKline's profits and the shares fell only 4 to 855p. UK analysts said the effectiveness of anti-biotics on ulcers had been debated for some time in Europe but was not widely considered in the US. Consequently, when Wall Street opened Glaxo's US-held stock was sold and the UK shares followed suit. Lasmo disappoints An announcement by oil exploration group Lasmo that it is to float off its downstream assets in California upset a market expecting a quick sale. The shares fell 21 to 217, the biggest percentage drop of all the FT-SE 100 stocks, with a hefty 7.9m traded. Oil analysts had calculated at Pounds 900m the book value of the assets acquired after Lasmo's takeover of Ultramar last year. Bears like County NatWest believed Lasmo would get at least Pounds 700m whereas more optimistic securities houses were looking for a figure closer to the book value. In the event, Lasmo expects to raise around Pounds 100m less than the lower forecast. Also, there was disappointment that, rather than hear something concrete yesterday, the market will have to wait until a flotation scheduled for June. Ratners bid talk Jeweller Ratners was steady at 20 1/2 p, but climbed 5 1/4 p during the course of the week on rumours of a possible bid. Turnover yesterday remained strong at 11m shares. Kingfisher, holding company of the Woolworth to B &amp; Q Group, is known to have further acquisitions in mind and was suggested as possibly stalking Ratners, but Kingfisher's shares rose 2 to 544p and analysts had doubts about the bid talk. It was pointed out that there is a big debt problem to overcome and any company looking at Ratners at present is likely to be put off after looking at the balance sheet. Composite insurers performed well as securities house Smith New Court advised clients that the time was ripe to pick them up. Mr Stephen Bird, Smith's insurance analyst said the recent rise in the stockmarket was a boost for the insurers which held about 28 per cent of their investment in equities and mainly in the UK. He added that there was 'growing momentum for higher commercial insurance rates' following the increase in personal rates last year. Mr Bird added that he did not expect the sector to be hit by the riots in the US. Commercial Union, which has underperformed since the general election, gained 11 to 481p. Mr Bird strengthened his buy stance on Commercial and on Sun Alliance, which he said was the group most exposed to UK equities and to the UK. Sun rose 5 to 298p. He also lifted his stance on Royal Insurance from sell to hold while Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken was recommending it as a speculative buy. The shares lifted 9 to 224p. The two-way pull continued in BP which saw heavy turnover of 19m shares and ended the day only 2 stronger at 270p after being 8 better at one stage. US investors were said to be back on the bid the previous night and now hold 13.8 per cent of BP in the form of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). US buying had taken the ADRs up to the sterling equivalent of 275p and, the shares reached that level in the UK but then ran into heavy selling and ticked back again. Troubled conglomerate Lonrho dived 16 early in the session after a press report said the US Government was investigating the company's links with Libya including a deal involving Lonrho's north American hotels. Last month, the company sold a third of its holding in London's Metropole hotel for Pounds 177.5m to Libya. The shares had been one of the week's leading recovery stocks but retreated on the news. However, buyers emerged at the lower levels, sending the shares forward to recover some of the lost ground and eventually ended 11 lighter at 95p on reasonable turnover of 5.2m shares. Utilities were firm as the reporting season approaches. Analysts have noted an unravelling of the Electricity Package of late, down 5 at Pounds 3,193 yesterday, as investors anticipate what may be the best stocks when the package splits in September. Among water stocks, North West, one of the earliest due to report, continued to attract support, rising 8 to 435p. Allied-Lyons weakened against the trend in the brewing and drinks sector, losing 6 to 639p as Lehman Brothers downgraded the stock from a buy to attractive, on worries about spirit sales. Media stocks continued to attract US investors. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi rose 3 1/2 to 23 1/4 p with 52m traded, making a turnover of 92m in two days. MEPC finished 14 higher at 358p following rumours that the company has let its Alban Gate office development in London. Food group Albert Fisher rose 5 to 77p, still boosted by recent presentations in the US. Turnover was a hefty 10m shares, but down on Thursday's 17.1m. Analysts said it was not yet clear what impact the US riots would have on Albert Fisher's operations in Los Angeles. reported to have been the beneficiary of a profits upgrading from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew remained a good market adding another 6 to 294p. Turnover at 2.8m shares was down on Thursday's high figure. Turnover in Kalon Group, the paints and chemicals group, unchanged at 106p, rose to 48m after Smith New Court and James Capel together placed 24m shares on the behalf of the past chairman, Leslie Silver, and his family.

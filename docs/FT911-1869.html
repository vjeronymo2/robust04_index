			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Letter: G7 - the capital picture and political reality Sir, Your leader states that US policy makers must accept that the principal aim of G7 is not to secure the re-election of the president. No more was it the aim of G7 to secure the re-election of the German chancellor, but G7 members are adjusting to the economic consequences of his election campaign. Neither is it now an aim of G7 to provide a framework for a British prime minister to time monetary policy changes to attempt to win an election in the midst of his own recession. It is very easy to impute party political motives to the positions of G7 members but it is probably more worth- while to analyse the overt propositions as objectively as possible. The US is making the simple point that there is now a danger of worldwide recession. Given that four members of G7 have admitted a classic domestic recession, not including Germany which has a composite rate of unemployment of 11 1/2 per cent, it does not seem to be an opinion which should be derided and dismissed out of hand. Acting on the assumption that the US is right risks a mild increase in inflation. Acting on the assumption that the US is wrong risks a world recession on the scale of the current UK recession or worse. The latter is by far the most damaging prospect and if G7 have rejected the need for a managed reduction in interest rates, we will have to hope that they unanimously agreed to keep their fingers crossed.

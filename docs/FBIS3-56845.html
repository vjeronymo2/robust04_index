			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said that he  had a meeting with the U.S. ambassador to Moscow Thomas  Pickering to discuss the statement made Tuesday by the State  Department spokesman. Commenting on Kozyrev's remarks at a  conference on the Russian policy towards the CIS member states  the spokesman had not even troubled to verify the text of  Kozyrev's statement. "What is strange is that a press secretary  starts argument with a minister," Kozyrev said Wednesday in  conclusion of the conference.    Kozyrev also described the reaction of the Baltic states as  strange. In his view, certain political figures there used his  remarks out of the context of the entire speech which was not  specifically about Latvia and had a fit of "hysterics." He  explained that he wanted the withdrawal of Russian troops from  the Baltics to proceed on a civilized basis of bilateral  agreements. Kozyrev emphasized that troops could not be  withdrawn overnight. "Our Baltic partners know this very well.  Russia will be firm about this. An orderly withdrawal in the  framework of agreements will contribute to consolidation of the  sovereignty of those countries," Kozyrev emphasized.    The minister said that the Russian government was under  pressure from extremists demanding that tanks be sent there and  those who wanted Russia to withdraw completely from former  Soviet republics. In his view, each of them would lead to a  replay of the Yugoslav scenario in what used to be the USSR.    He thinks that ignoring the special role played by Russia  would also lead to a disaster. "If Russia gets out of  Tajikistan, discontinues its peace mission in Karabakh, Ossetia  and other trouble spots, where will the refugees move, some of  them not Slavic at all? Where will the Tajiks, Georgians,  Abkhazians and Ossetians go? They will go to Moscow. We cannot  and will not allow this," Kozyrev said.    The minister emphasized that appropriate agreements had to  be  signed on the stay of Russian troops in the republics that  needed them.    In his words, "our Western partners sometimes find it  difficult to comprehend these simple truths.... They don't seem  to understand the special role played by Russia and so panicky  noises are made that Kozyrev calls for Russian military presence  on foreign soil." This reminded him of the former USSR's  diplomacy which created a bogey of an enemy and made continuous  noise about U.S. bases.    Kozyrev warned that Russia would not keep silent when the  rights of the Russian-speaking population in former Soviet  republics were infringed on. He said that negotiations on the  Russian speaking population were underway with the leaders of  all former Soviet republics and added that if the international  law was ignored and the rights of the Russian speaking  population were violated, Russia could "take a tough line....  We had been saying even before Zhirinovskiy that economic  sanctions can be imposed on states that pursue this kind of  policy." On the other hand, he warned against yielding to  pro-fascist forces in Russia.</p>

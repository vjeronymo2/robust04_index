Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses and performance data applicable to all classes of shares in every shareholder report. The shareholder reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to the Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis.

To the extent that any advertisement or sales literature describes the expenses and/or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it will also disclose the respective expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares.

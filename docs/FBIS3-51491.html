			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari at </F> Los Pinos Presidential Residence in Mexico City on 12 January;  from the "24 Hours" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] Ladies and gentlemen: After analyzing the security  conditions prevailing in the municipalities that were assaulted  beginning on 1 January by a group of attackers, National Defense  Secretary General Antonio Riviello Bazan has informed me that  the largest cities and towns where this group was present have  already been placed under the control of the Mexican Army,  thereby guaranteeing the tranquility of the residents of these  communities in Chiapas State.    The Army has, therefore, achieved its first objective begun  on the first of day of 1994, working within the framework of its  constitutional duty and in response to the request of the  Chiapas government to protect the civilian population and  restore security in the state.    On the other hand, the changes made 48 hours ago at the  presidential cabinet are permitting us to advance in the tasks  aimed at promoting actions in favor of peace. The background  and determination of the government secretary and the meeting  between the commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas  and various sectors have resulted in broad support for the  measures that may end the confrontation. The Catholic Church,  as a whole, has expressed its support, as have the members of  other churches.    The presidential candidates of each of the political parties  have pledged to work in favor of peace. The Special Commission  of Senators and Deputies has expressed its decision to  contribute to the elimination of violence as soon as possible.  Different social movements, nongovernment organizations, the  media, the country's most important trendsetters in public  opinion, intellectuals, and citizens in general are in favor of  the search for peace.    The government of the Republic is now taking a firm step.  Once the security of the region and that of the very members of  the Mexican Army has been guaranteed, while attempting to send a  clear message of reconciliation, peace, and respect for human  rights; taking into consideration the fact that the Mexican Army  has already reached the first objective in its constitutional  mission to guarantee the security of the region; considering the  feelings and opinion of the country; and given the very  conviction of the president of the Republic, I, in a responsible  way, have decided to suspend armed actions in the state of  Chiapas. The Mexican Army will guarantee the tranquility of the  residents of these cities and towns. The Army will only respond  if attacked.    If the armed groups do not end their aggressive actions, the  Army will have to defend itself and defend the civilian  population. Also, in this kind of situation, it is common that  actions are carried out to achieve propaganda objectives. This  cannot be ruled out, and we will remain alert.    By doing this, the president of the Republic -- the supreme  commander of the Armed Forces -- is doing everything possible to  seek peace seriously. The most urgent task is to create more  room for reconciliation. I fervently hope that this decision of  the government of the Republic, which has the support of all of  society, is the first step toward saving lives and finding new  means of reconciliation. We have the chance to find a solution  that can show the extraordinary strength of Mexican society.  This is a moment of unity necessary in overcoming a difficult  situation. We will continue to bring relief and food to those  affected by the confrontation. We will redouble attention given  to the social demands of Indian communities, particularly those  in the highlands and jungle of Chiapas, with their own  participation. We will act to ensure that there is greater  justice.    I also reiterate that those who have participated in the  uprising because of pressure or desperation and who now accept  peace and legality will be pardoned. This makes me confident  that Mexico will come out stronger. Now let us all act in favor  of peace and reconciliation. We therefore demonstrate, with the  voice of a united Mexico, that the strength of peace is much  greater than any violent group's capacity to do harm. Thank you  very much.</p>

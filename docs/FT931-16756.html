			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Letter: Corporate rescue can be costly and pointless exercise Sir, I am a small shareholder in a small public company currently in administration. I have just received four documents, weighing 2lb 2oz and comprising 244 pages, setting out proposals for the reconstruction of the company. The two principal documents tell me that if I am in any doubt about the action I should take I should immediately consult my 'stockbroker, bank manager, legal adviser, accountant or other professional adviser authorised under the Financial Services Act 1986'. Insofar as the directors 'believe that if the proposed reconstruction is not approved and implemented there is no likelihood of any distribution being made to ordinary creditors, nor of any value being preserved for ordinary shareholders' I am not, in fact, in any doubt about the action which I should take. While, on the one hand, however, I cannot fail to be impressed by the lengths to which the company and its advisers have had to go to protect the interests of small shareholders, on the other, the whole (obviously very costly) exercise does seem somewhat pointless. The company has a substantial balance sheet deficit - a fate unfortunately shared by many other companies at the present time - and I would have thought it desirable for some less cumbersome and costly process to be introduced where rescue operations are being considered and where the shareholders have no effective interests to be protected.

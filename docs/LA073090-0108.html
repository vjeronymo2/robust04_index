			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> RAY BUCKEY TO SUE HIS ACCUSERS  </P> <P> A lawyer for Ray Buckey said the 32-year-old former teacher at the McMartin  Pre-School intends to sue police and parents of former McMartin students as  soon as a judge disposes of the eight undecided molestation charges filed  against him.  </P> <P> "To have this young man in jail for five years with no bail is very sad. . . .  It has to be corrected," said Buckey's lawyer, James Davis.  </P> <P> The 7-year-old criminal case could come to an end Wednesday when the charges  against Buckey are expected to be formally dismissed. On Friday, a Superior  Court jury deadlocked on eight counts lodged against Buckey, and prosecutors  said they would not seek a new trial. Buckey had been cleared by a previous  jury on 40 other molestation counts.  </P> <P> Davis said Buckey's suit will be tacked onto lawsuits already filed by Buckey's  mother, grandmother and sister.  </P></p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Lasmo The risk in yesterday's Pounds 127m assets sale by Lasmo is that it might give the company an excuse to maintain the dividend. The company has not only obtained a price significantly above book; the cash will also reduce Lasmo's interest bill and cut its gearing ratio to around 75 per cent. Had the dollar held at the level prevailing at the time of the interims, gearing would be even lower, possibly as little as 50 per cent. That gives Mr Joe Darby, Lasmo's chief executive, room for flexibility, but development expenditure requirements will be high over the next couple of years. Production from Lasmo's existing assets will not peak until the mid-1990s. The exploration budget has already been cut. The dividend costs over Pounds 80m after allowing for unrelieved ACT. There is not an indefinite supply of peripheral assets which can be sold to meet the payment. The relaxed performance of the shares since the resignation of Mr Chris Greentree suggests a dividend cut is already largely discounted. Indeed, investors might be happier with a strategy aimed at securing long-term growth out of Lasmo's undoubtedly valuable assets than with one offering them only short-term return. BP's share price is now higher than it was last June when Mr Bob Horton's resignation made a dividend cut inevitable. That partly reflects the higher sterling oil price, but it also shows the market can respond positively to the establishment of a dividend level in line with what the balance sheet will bear.</p>

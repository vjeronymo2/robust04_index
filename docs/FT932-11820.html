			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (5): Most competitive market - North America A recent announcement by Mercedes-Benz that it intends to build a new sport-utility vehicle in the US underlines the changing nature and intense competitiveness of the American executive car market, where an extraordinary burst of Japanese success in recent years is now being met by a much stronger challenge from US and European rivals. Mercedes is to make its first significant foray into manufacturing passenger cars outside Germany by building a new four-wheel-drive vehicle at a yet-to-be chosen site in the US. The new plant will cost some Dollars 300m and will have the capacity to make 60,000 vehicles a year, of which some 40,000 will be earmarked for export. Its move underlines some important changes in the executive car sector. First, the 'sports utility' category - which includes vehicles under the Jeep and Range Rover brand names - has not traditionally been regarded as falling under the executive car heading, but increasingly in the US this fast-growing market segment is competing at the upper end of its range against traditional executive sedans. As Mr Helmut Werner, Mercedes' deputy president, said in announcing the US project: 'The classic division of the market into luxury class, mid-size class and compact class is losing its importance.' Second, German luxury car manufacturers, no less than American ones, are having to adopt new tactics to cope with the inroads made over the past few years in the US market by Japanese executive cars, sold at extremely keen prices. Mercedes is the second German company to decide to manufacture in the US and is following a lead set by BMW which broke ground last year for a new plant in South Carolina. The advantages for both companies include much lower production costs than in Germany and proximity to the North American market, the biggest and most competitive in the world. The dangers include losing the status associated with a product bearing a 'Made in Germany' label. The Japanese have come from nowhere in recent years to account for almost one third of the US luxury car market, with Toyota's Lexus epitomising their success. Introduced in 1989, it changed perceptions of the relationship between price and performance by presenting buyers with a superior-quality, volume-produced luxury car selling below Dollars 40,000. Nearly 40 per cent of Lexus buyers trading-in their old cars are defectors from European marques, with slightly less coming from American marques and 22 per cent from Japanese manufacturers. However, the Japanese have been finding it harder to add market share over the past 15 months. In 1992, they gained 1.6 per cent of the US luxury market for a 30.8 per cent total, leaving the Big Three US carmakers - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler - with a market share down 3.6 per cent at 47.9 per cent and the Europeans up 2 per cent at 21.3 per cent. Ms Susan Jacobs, an independent analyst, says the Japanese slowdown signals 'an end to the period of easy gains when expansion of the product line-up across body styles and price levels supported rapid sales and share growth.' She says that this year the dynamics of the market will change, with 'competition among the Japanese - as opposed to the Japanese versus the European and US Big Three makers - becoming an increasingly important factor in the pricing environment.' Certainly, intensifying competition among all manufacturers in a weak US market played an important role in last September's decision by Mazda, the Japanese manufacturer, to abandon plans to follow the lead of its rivals and establish a separate luxury car distribution channel in the US. The channel, to have been called Amati, was to have begun operations in 1994. Other reasons for the company's decision included its existing heavy investment burden, appreciation of the yen, and a slump in Mazda's domestic Japanese market. The US market was particularly weak last year when unit sales totalled 1.189m, down 5 per cent on 1991, with sales from the Big Three US manufacturers down 11 per cent, the Japanese up 1 per cent and Europeans up 5 per cent. Contributory factors included an overhang from the recession of 1991 and the Bush administration's imposition of a 10 per cent luxury tax on cars costing more than Dollars 30,000. Analysts expect the luxury market as a whole to grow modestly this year, possibly by about 5 per cent. The sales recovery by European manufacturers is expected to continue, helped by keener prices and new product launches, while the Big Three are likely to see a further loss of market share as they phase out some of their more traditional models, which account for more than four-fifths of their luxury sales. However, the Americans are also fighting back with a range of new products which are designed on more European lines. Cadillac, GM's luxury car division, has enjoyed particular success over the past two years with its new Seville and Eldorado models. Chrysler is about to launch its new luxury cars, the New Yorker and LHS, which are slightly bigger versions of the much-praised LH series of sedans it introduced last autumn. It is aiming to attract more sophisticated baby-boomers who usually buy imported cars, and its advertising campaign emphasises the models' departure from the traditional 'floating boat' stereotype of American luxury cars. 'Float, wallow, dive and other American luxury car diseases cured,' says one advertisement, while another claims the LHS is a car for those who 'drive for sport' rather than seeking to 'encapsulate themselves in a living room on wheels.' Ford, for its part, recently introduced the Lincoln Mark VIII - an all-new sports coupe with much more of an 'import' look, designed to compete against the Lexus SC400 and the Cadillac Eldorado. Cars such as these offer Detroit hope that its long slide against the Japanese in the luxury segment of the market can at least be stemmed, if not easily reversed.</p>

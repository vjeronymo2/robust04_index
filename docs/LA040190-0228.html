			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> The networks wonder why they're losing viewers and the answer is simple: Too  many shows have constant repeats! "thirtysomething" is one of the biggest  offenders. When the story lines of programs are serialized, it's especially  difficult for viewers to get back into the series after a few repeats. If the  networks want a larger audience, they should order more episodes.  </P> <P> Aaron Paquette, San Marino  </P></p>

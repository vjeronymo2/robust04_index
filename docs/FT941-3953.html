			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Business Travel: Sizing up Sydney - Kate Bevan explains how to get around the city Like Captain Cook and the convicts who followed him, the modern traveller's point of entry to Sydney is Botany Bay. The runway of Kingsford Smith airport, 8km south of the city's business and tourism centre, juts into the bay. Although the journey to Australia is much faster than in Cook's day, getting out of the airport can be slow. The international terminal is overstretched, and luggage may take some time to reach the reclaim hall. Expect customs officials to ask suspicious questions about everything of an organic or edible nature that might be in your luggage, particularly if you've arrived from Asia - although travellers are no longer greeted with flight attendants spraying their aircraft with insecticide. Many travellers smuggle pots of Marmite through customs for pining British expats, but if these are found they will be confiscated and you will be heavily fined. Luggage trolleys can only be freed from their ranks with ADollars 2 coins - so break into a note on the aircraft. The business and tourist areas are concentrated in the oldest part of the city, much of which has views of the harbour bridge and the opera house, although the suburbs sprawl in all directions around the harbour. Most business travellers will stay and work in that central downtown area. The efficient transit system boasts two bus services from the airport, running from the international terminal via the two domestic terminals into the city. Information leaflets at the airport will help you decide which route to take. The first service, Route 300, goes to the Central railway station through the business district and then on to Circular Quay, the central ferry wharf for harbourside suburbs. Route 350 runs via Central station through Kings Cross, east of the business district. Look after your belongings in Kings Cross at night. The trip on either bus costs ADollars 5 (Pounds 2.40), or ADollars 8 for a return ticket, and should take about 30 minutes. There are also a couple of privately operated bus services which run to city-centre hotels and those in the new tourist complex at Darling Harbour, which is not on the airport bus routes. However, if your destination is outside the central business district, you will find yourself dragging luggage on to connecting services. Sydney's CityRail connections cover most of the city south of the harbour and a line runs to North Sydney, a growing business district north of the harbour bridge. The best place to make your connection is Central station, where both airport bus services call, or Wynyard station, also the main interchange for commuter buses. Otherwise, it is worth using the cheap ferries to get to harbour-side suburbs. They all start from Circular Quay, which is simple to use and has clear signposting. Bus services to and around the north shore from Wynyard station are frequent, but travellers with heavy luggage might consider getting the airport bus to Circular Quay - the nearest point to the water - and then getting a taxi across the bridge or through the harbour tunnel. Taxis are plentiful into the city and will set you back about ADollars 20 from the airport for a trip south of the harbour bridge or tunnel. Taxi drivers expect single passengers to sit in the front with them and, although tipping is not the custom in Australia, they won't be averse to accepting one. For getting around the city, several travel passes are available based on the rather confusing zone system, as well as the Sydney Pass, which is valid for three, five or seven days and costs from ADollars 50. That covers all the city buses and ferries - but not the trains - as well as some tourist buses, plus your return fare on the airport bus. You can buy a pass when you arrive at the airport, on the airport bus, or at various locations around the city. Transport around the city is tightly regulated and efficient. But you are on your own if you hit the tourist trail - dozens of unregulated operators are willing to relieve you of your dollars for a spin around the harbour or a cuddle with a koala.</p>

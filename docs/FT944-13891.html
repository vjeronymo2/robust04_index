			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Russia fails Euro-rights test The Council of Europe said yesterday that Russia's human rights record was still not good enough to allow it to join. 'Russia has made considerable progress for satisfying the Council of Europe's standards. But the country still has a long way to go,' said Mr David Atkinson, chairman of the committee which decides membership questions. Russia applied to join the 32-nation pan-European body, which promotes democracy and human rights, in 1992. But its application was dealt a blow earlier this month when a panel of European experts delivered a damning indictment of its legal system and its protection of human and minority rights.</p>

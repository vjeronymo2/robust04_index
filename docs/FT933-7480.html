			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Nigeria waits for its marching orders: A look at the momentous decision General Babangida will take next week THE COUNTDOWN to a confrontation that could reverberate across Africa is under way. By this time next week General Ibrahim Babangida, Nigeria's military leader, will have made a decision which will shape the future of the continent's most populous nation and second largest economy. Will the general buckle under international and domestic pressure, and honour his promise to hand over to civilians by August 27? Or will he extend the life of a regime widely viewed as corrupt, incompetent and as unpopular as any in Nigeria's turbulent history since independence in 1960? Yesterday, the Nigerian Labour Congress issued a blunt warning: 'If by August 27 1993 the military does not proclaim the 1989 constitution, hand over to the senate president, and disengage from governance, workers should stay at home and dissociate themselves from any unconstitutional government until further notice.' Also demanding that he go are a growing number of senior military officers, two of the country's former military leaders - and an erstwhile friend of more than 20 years' standing. 'By the grace of God, I will be home on my 56th birthday next Tuesday,' says Chief Moshood Abiola, the man who is entitled to call himself Nigeria's president-elect, but who recently fled the country in his private aircraft, in fear for his life. Over breakfast in London, the wealthy businessman, winner of the June 12 poll annulled by the general, vowed to return to Lagos, though declining to comment on suggestions that he intends to be sworn into office on arrival, in defiance of the regime. It would be surprising if Mr Abiola's supporters were not out in force. Nigeria's commercial capital is also the chief's political stronghold, in the heart of the Yoruba-dominated south-west. But as Yorubas prepare to rally behind their kinsman, Mr Abiola's Social Democratic party seems to be losing the broad national support that secured him his comfortable victory, performing well in the National Republican Convention's northern base. As tensions rise, loyalties that go much deeper than those owed to two artificial parties created by the soldiers seem to be taking hold, exacerbating old rivalries between the Yoruba Christian south and the Hausa-Fulani Moslem north. Fearful of what may be to come, many thousands of Nigerians and their families are relocating across a country the combined size of France, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands, to seek refuge in home regions. It is the latest chapter in a saga which has taken Nigeria from confident, if not arrogant, petro-dollar billionaire with aspirations to a seat on the UN security council, to the brink of disaster. Over a decade spanning the early 1970s into the early 1980s, some Dollars 100bn (Pounds 67bn) flowed into a country once dependent on cocoa, groundnuts and palm oil for modest foreign exchange earnings. In 1980, at the peak of an oil boom that proved a curse and not a blessing, Nigeria earned Dollars 25bn. It created a generation of overnight millionaires, who pocketed inflated commissions and kickbacks. It left a legacy of white elephants that burden the country to this day. But even more damaging, the abuse and mismanagement of wealth helped destroy the fabric of Nigerian society. 'It's left the universities without books, the judges without integrity, the civil servant without honesty,' says a bitter Nigerian in his 30s. 'Our politics have been commercialised, our army has been politicised,' says a cynical young lawyer. But the most ominous observation was offered earlier this year in Kaduna, political heart of the north, by a distinguished civil servant who retired in the mid-1970s: 'We've lost the old leaders, and the system is too rotten to train new ones? Where does that leave us?' Meanwhile, in his fortified presidential palace in the capital, Abuja, protected by the Brigade of Guards, Gen Babangida prepares his next move. He is as tough as he is unpredictable, and few Nigerians are sure what that will be. Earlier this week, in a speech expected to end the nervous uncertainty and set out the powers and composition of the new interim civilian administration, he gave no details. Instead, he seemed to hint that he was preparing to swap his army uniform for civilian attire and serve Nigeria for some time to come. 'I shall also be prepared and ready at the end of the interim government to pass on my experience to the elected president,' he said. An announcement is now expected next Wednesday. the day the existing transitional council is due to hand over to an interim national government, headed by a civilian. That would hold a fresh presidential election in October 1994, yielding power to the winner on December 31 next year. Some army officers - in a minority, say observers - are urging Gen Babangida to stay. But those who want the 52-year-old general to go will not relish the prospect of breaking the news to him.</p>

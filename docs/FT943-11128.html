			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / International Company News: Iveco sees break-even in 1994 Iveco, the commercial vehicles subsidiary of Fiat of Italy, expects to break even in 1994 following the heaviest loss in its history last year. The group, the second largest truck maker in Europe, plunged to a group net loss of Fl 592.4m (Dollars 335m) last year from a loss of Fl 258.2m a year earlier. Iveco has suffered losses for the past three years in succession totalling Fl 1.15bn in the face of the prolonged recession in the west European truck industry. Truck sales in Europe have fallen for four consecutive years from a peak in 1989, but there are growing signs that the market is emerging from recession this year with sales rising in some large markets such as the UK and France. Iveco said its sales volume rose by 25 per cent in the first quarter this year to 24,552 units from 19,594 in the corresponding period a year ago. Last year, the group's commercial vehicle sales fell by 21.3 per cent to 90,830, the lowest level for nine years, from 115,433 a year earlier and a peak of 136,088 in 1989. Group turnover fell by 25.6 per cent to Fl 8.4bn. Successive heavy losses have forced the company to restructure and Iveco's total active workforce has been reduced by a third to 30,000 from 45,000 between 1989 and 1993. The number of white collar and managerial staff has been been reduced by 37 per cent in the same period to 10,000 from 16,000. Restructuring costs for redundancy and retraining have totalled Fl 560m since 1989. Iveco said the era of extraordinary costs was over but it could 'not allow the financial situation to weaken any further'. It claimed it had achieved 'a quantum leap' in the efficiency and productivity of its manufacturing operations. The group had cut its break-even sales point to 116,000 last year from 131,000 in 1991, and this was forecast to fall this year to 101,000, the lowest ever. Iveco spent heavily in the early 1990s renewing its product range and modernising its plants, but the company claimed 'the years of big spending designed to develop and to protect the business are behind us'.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 56.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Abuses. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As stated above, we intend by these attribution rules to ensure that bidders and recipients of these licenses are  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> bona fide <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in their eligibility, and we intend to conduct random audits both before the auctions and during the 10-year initial license period to ensure that our rules are complied with in letter and spirit. If we find that large firms or individuals exceeding our personal net worth caps are able to assume control of licensees that have received small business provisions or otherwise circumvent our rules, we will not hesitate to force divestiture of such improper interests or, in appropriate cases, issue forfeitures or revoke licenses. In this regard, we reiterate that it is our intent, and the intent of Congress, that women, minorities and small businesses be given an opportunity to participate in narrowband PCS services, not merely as fronts for other entities, but as active entrepreneurs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 57. In addition, in view of our new small business definition and the associated maximum investor limits, we are modifying our unjust enrichment rules to prevent any post-auction circumvention of our financial threshold, and to ensure that the ultimate licensees are  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> bona fide <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  designated entities. Accordingly, firms that received installment payments based on their small business status will be subject to repayment if, for example, another entity subsequently purchases an ``attributable'' interest or becomes a member of the control group and, as a result, the gross revenues of the firm would exceed the $40 million gross revenues cap, or the personal net worth of an individual investor exceeds the $40 million personal net worth threshold. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Bidding Credits in Regional Narrowband Auctions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 58. In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Third Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  we established bidding credits of 25 percent for women- and minority-owned businesses on two of the six regional narrowband licenses. <FOOTCITE>93</FOOTCITE>  In order to increase the opportunities for women and minorities to participate in the provision of narrowband service, we have decided to increase the bidding credit on the same two licenses for women- and minority-owned businesses in the upcoming regional narrowband auction from 25 percent to 40 percent. Our experience with the nationwide narrowband PCS auctions, where very high license values coupled with only a 25 percent bidding credit may have contributed to the failure of women- and minority-owned businesses to win licenses, suggests that a credit of this magnitude may be necessary to overcome the disadvantages of these groups in bidding for licenses representing large populations and large geographic areas. <FOOTCITE>94</FOOTCITE>  In an  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ex parte <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  filing, Essence Television Productions, Inc. one of the initial participants in the nationwide narrowband PCS auction, argues that designated entities should receive bidding credits of up to 40 percent when competing in auctions against non-designated entities. <FOOTCITE>95</FOOTCITE>  The increased bidding credit combined with installment payments for firms that meet our revised small business definition should enable minority- and women-owned businesses to attract the capital necessary to compete. In addition, we seek comment on whether additional measures such as an entrepreneur's block should be employed in future auctions (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> infra. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 93 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Third Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  at &para;68. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 94 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> We have already adopted installment payments for small businesses on regional, MTA and BTA licenses.

Rural Telephone Companies <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 59. In this docket, we established general rules and identified several measures, including installment payments, spectrum set-asides, bidding credits and tax certificates, that we would choose among in establishing rules for auctionable spectrum-based services, on a service-specific basis. In adopting service-specific rules, we have carefully selected provisions to meet the particular needs of each designated entity group, so as to ``ensure,'' pursuant to the statute, that each group has the opportunity to participate in providing spectrum-based services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 60. As we indicated above, it is occasionally necessary to do more to ensure that businesses owned by members of minority groups and women have a meaningful opportunity to participate in provision of personal communications services than is necessary to ensure that other designated entity groups have similar opportunities. <FOOTCITE>96</FOOTCITE>  The major problem facing minorities and women who seek to offer PCS is lack of access to capital. <FOOTCITE>97</FOOTCITE>  Small businesses also encounter serious funding problems. <FOOTCITE>98</FOOTCITE>  In contrast, rural telephone companies that are not small businesses (and are not owned by minorities or women) do not face the same difficulties in obtaining capital. Accordingly, we do not believe that any additional provisions for rural telephone companies are necessary or appropriate in the context of narrowband PCS. Moreover, as we stated in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Second Report and Order, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  limiting installment payments to smaller businesses, including those owned by minorities and women, best comports with the intent of Congress by avoiding auction procedures that tend to favor incumbents with established revenue streams over new companies and entrepreneurs. <FOOTCITE>99</FOOTCITE>  Therefore, rural telephone companies that are not eligible as small businesses will not receive installment payment assistance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 96 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Fifth Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  at &para;96, in PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253, FCC 94&hyph;178, adopted June 29, 1994, released July 15, 1994, 59 FR 37566 (Jul 29, 1994), ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Fifth Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 97 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id.; see also, e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Report of the FCC Small Business Advisory Committee to the FCC Regarding Gen.

We note, however, that many more rural telephone companies are considered small businesses under our revised small business definition than was the case previously. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, 26 Apr (EFE) -- Argentine Ambassador to  Geneva Juan Sanchez Arnaud has said that the Uruguay Round of  GATT talks is the most important trade agreement ever signed.  Sanchez said the agreement opens a new stage in the history of  international economic relations and consolidates  multilateralism.    The ambassador talked at the UN Conference on Trade and  Development, UNCTAD. He said the agreement "permitted us to  progress in the process of reducing tariff obstacles in the  industrial field, allowed us to improve the situation of  agriculture and services, and facilitated the introduction of  trade measures on investments at the multilateral level."    The ambassador stressed the importance of adopting and  improving the codes approved during the Tokyo Round of talks,  which has consolidated a broad variety of norms directed at  regulating aspects of international trade, providing clarity,  and eliminating discretionary powers and unilateral decisions in  imposing trade obstacles or applying sanctions.    Another important decision was the creation of the World  Trade Organization (WTO), which will work on the liberalization  process and will broaden the multilateral discipline. At the  same time, the new mechanism to resolve conflicts will  consolidate the legal bases of the complex system of norms, and  will address problems and conflicts between trade and the  environment.    Sanchez Arnaud said that not all of the results of the  Uruguay Round were up to expectations. The ambassador added  that perhaps the greatest shortcoming was the lack of  correlation between the contribution of developing countries to  the process of trade liberalization and the new opportunities  they will have through the proposals of the industrialized  countries.    The ambassador said that the second shortcoming was the  limited scope of the agreement on agriculture. "My country and  all other members of the `Cairns Group' of agricultural  producers, which do not subsidize their production, wanted to  have an agriculture agreement worked out to raise the area to  the same level of conditions approved for the industrial area,  particularly through internal and export subsidies and the  reduction of import obstacles," the ambassador said.    "The results are far from our aspirations, although we must  stress that what has been achieved is the first step toward  changing protectionist agricultural policies which, in the first  place, affect developing countries, and secondly affect the  consumers in countries encouraging such protectionist policies,"  Sanchez said.    The lack of concrete results favoring less developed  countries "is a shortcoming that concerns us all, because the  solution to the grave problems affecting developing countries  lies in an improvement in trade and the introduction of  structural changes to increase production and improve  infrastructure conditions."</p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Soya mayhem bemuses analysts After last summer's devastating US floods, world grain traders are used to weather stirring up the grain futures markets. However, the mayhem it has wrought on soyabean prices this is unusual because the crop is only just planted and will not be particularly weather-sensitive for several weeks. Prices for soyabean futures at the Chicago Board of Trade climbed 75 cents per bushel in the six trading days ending Monday, easily topping Dollars 7 per bushel for delivery this summer, and approaching that level for new harvest delivery. Traders bought soyabean contracts thinking dryness in the northern plains would inhibit germination in newly-planted seeds. Weather forecasters fueled bullish speculation by predicting a long-term weather pattern would keep crop areas dry. Then, on Monday afternoon rains began to fall in Iowa, Ohio, and Illinois, flushing the bulls out of the soyabean futures pits. In a heavy-volume rout on Tuesday and Wednesday, prices skidded more than 54 cents a bushel, forcing the Chicago Board of Trade to expand its limits on daily price declines. In late trading yesterday the prompt July position was down another 5 1/2 cents at Dollars 6.69 1/2 a bushel. Agronomists are bemused by the market's rollercoaster ride, noting that US crop conditions are nearly as ideal today as in 1992, when the US had a bin-busting record maize harvest and excellent soyabean yields. Last season's rains left ample subsoil moisture in most areas and warm dry weather this spring allowed early seedings and hence a longer growing season. Analysts say two factor are contributing to the volatility of Chicago grain markets. Firstly, last year's small harvest has left very little room for error in this season's crop - grain processors and exporters will have very little cushion if this year's harvest is delayed or smaller than forecast. Secondly, institutional investors who historically have scorned commodity markets have discovered their use as inflation hedges just as internal rules at the commodities exchanges have been adjusted to permit much larger speculative investments. At the Chicago Board of Trade for example, a single speculator can now control as many as 30m bushels of maize and 21m bushels of soyabeans, twice the size allowable just two months ago. With the stakes higher, grain markets have entered the world of high finance, and deep-pocketed fund managers are throwing their bets into the soyabean ring with unprecedented vigor. The result, traders say, is exaggerated daily price moves that don't always reflect the long-term fundamentals of the crop.</p>

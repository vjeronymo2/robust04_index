			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / UN team returns to Iraq UNITED Nations weapons inspectors returned to Baghdad yesterday to complete the destruction of missile production equipment which Iraqi officials initially had blocked in defiance of the Gulf War ceasefire agreement, agencies report. A second UN team, meanwhile, left Baghdad to destroy buildings at the al-Atheer nuclear complex, which inspectors say was central to Iraqi plans to create a nuclear weapon. A permanent team of UN inspectors will also arrive soon in Iraq to oversee the destruction of thousands of chemical munitions. Mr Christopher Holland, the leader of the seven-man team of ballistic missile inspectors which arrived from Bahrain, refused to give details of his latest mission before meeting his Iraqi counterparts yesterday evening.</p>

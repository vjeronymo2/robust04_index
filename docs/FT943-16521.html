			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Prudential sells Irish life assurance arm for Pounds 30m Prudential, the UK's largest life insurer, has sold its Irish life assurance and pensions company to Irish Permanent Building Society for Pounds 30m cash. Prudential Life of Ireland was already involved in a joint venture with Irish Permanent through Irish Permanent Life and Pensions, which sells pensions, investment and life products through the society's branch network. The purchase was driven by the same factors that have led some larger UK building societies to set up their own life operations. Details of the deal will be given in the prospectus to be issued by Irish Permanent as it prepares to convert from a mutual organisation to plc status in the autumn. Prudential Life of Ireland is among the country's 10 largest life insurers with 6.7 per cent of the individual regular premium market.</p>

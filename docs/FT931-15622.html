			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Arts: Pelleas and Melisande - Opera in Chicago Something is stirring: more, surely, than the simple centenary of the original Maeterlinck play. The present abundance of productions of Debussy's opera suggests a deeper reverberation from one fin-de-siecle to the next, the new version at the Chicago Lyric Opera does not want to tell us very much about what the echo might be. Robert Israel's designs helpfully suggest realistic people in a non-realistic place: the suits and long dresses are sober; the palace of Allemonde holds at a moment of shock, with a panelled drawing-room wall about to topple into a forest of slender pillars, behind which a band of ultramarine is an abstract sea under photographed clouds. But the production, by Frank Galati, sentimentalises the action towards exactly the kind of bourgeois anecdote Debussy wanted to avoid and has the characters looking as if they've been mislaid by Noel Coward. Pelleas stands around not knowing what to do with his hands; Melisande hunches her shoulders in sobs at the end of the tower scene. Slap against the literalism, however, is the doubling of the role of Yniold, who is acted by a boy but sung by a woman, and not from the wings but right there on stage, in costume, as if the lady were his nurse telling hime what to say, while everyone else - and especially Golaud in the most crucial scene of his jealousy - has to pretend she is not there at all. In a different sort of production this could have been a powerful device; here it is just awry. Other strange mistakes include the restoration of a scene Debussy cut from the play - that of the servants washing the castle, done in dumbshow during the prelude and the dropping of symbolical objects from the flies: a golden caravel when Pelleas and Melisande are watching a ship depart, or a horse to bring home the point about Golaud's riding accident, or a Margritte-like floating rock for Yniold's solo (here, of course, duo) scene. Many of the production's problems may have to do with the vast scale of the Civic Opera House, which makes it necessary for the singers to face the audience squarely at all times in order to be heard. And heard they are. Both Jerry Hadley and Faith Esham, in the title roles, created the proper effect of a musical recitation, with every word audible, and every phrase a union of melody and verbal sense. Mr Hadley brought a lyric tenor's freshness to the upper shoots of his part, and had no problems in the more baritonal territory. Ms Esham had the natural purity needed for Melisande: a grace without affectation, a voice that swims. She also moved well and looked good, with the help of excellent wigs. Victor Braun affectingly presented Golaud's frustration with a slatey gnash of desperation at moments of extremity; others in the cast included Yvonne Minton with her Genevieve as generous as usual. James Conlon, the conductor, seemed still to be feeling his way at the opening night, though he too had his task made almost impossible by the size of the theatre. Orchestral points have to be urged across, with the result that it is difficult to maintain the often necessary sense of two tempos happening at once, or to leap across the air from one shape to the next. The most successful act was the fifth - perhaps just because it was the last, or more likely because the musical situation here is one more simply of a slow inevitability being rocked and racked by Golaud's urgent wish, even at the last, to understand.</p>

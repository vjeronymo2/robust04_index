			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 19 Apr (PL) -- Victor Manuel Melendez, of  the Mexican Entrepreneurial Council for International Affairs  [Consejo Empresarial Mexicano Para Asuntos Internacionales --  CEMAI] and who is taking part in a bilateral meeting here today,  said that in the future Cuba could sign a free trade agreement  with Mexico or Central America.    The 11th plenary session of the Cuba-Mexico Entrepreneurial  Committee [Comite Empresarial Cuba-Mexico], which began meeting  on Monday in the El Nacional Hotel in Havana, presented in its  opening session a conference on NAFTA (Mexico-United  States-Canada) and similar agreements signed by Mexico with  Chile and Costa Rica, as well as similar future agreements to be  signed by Mexico with four other Central American countries.    Melendez said the process of openness that has begun in Cuba  could expedite its participation in free trade agreements. He  warned that because of current trends toward a global economy,  no country can survive in isolation.    In reply to a question by Julio Garcia Olivera,  representative of the Gaviota Tourist Corporation, on how NAFTA  will affect bilateral trade, Melendez explained his country's  commitments to the United States and Canada do not affect trade  with Cuba.    He warned, however, that competition could be a factor,  because Cuban products would compete in terms of prices and  tariffs with similar Canadian or U.S. products, which have the  advantage of not paying import duties to enter the Mexican  market.    On the other hand, Cuban merchandise would be barred from  being reexported to the United States, especially merchandise  blacklisted by the U.S. blockade, due to the certificate of  origin required for all merchandise involved in the trilateral  trade pact.    The entrepreneurial committee continues its sessions today  and will end the sessions on Thursday. Forty Cuban businessmen  and 37 Mexican businessmen will attend this meeting.</p>

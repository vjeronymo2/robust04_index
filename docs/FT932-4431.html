			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Margins eroded at Allied Colloids ALLIED COLLOIDS, the speciality chemicals company, lifted profits to Pounds 44.4m last year but robust growth in sales was marred by lower operating margins. The company expected recovery would 'begin very gradually in the major economies' but that it could maintain its sales growth at the much improved levels. Pre-tax profits in the year to end-April rose from Pounds 42.1m on sales up nearly 16 per cent at Pounds 295m. After stripping out a small acquisition and the effect of currency movements, organic sales growth was 11 per cent. Administrative costs rose at an underlying rate of 12 per cent. This included a 71 per cent increase in insurance premiums after the fire at Bradford in July last year. In 1994 the rate will more than double from this higher rate of Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 5.4m. Earnings per share during the year fell from 12.3p to 11.36p after a jump in the tax charge but the company is to pay a final dividend of 3.35p, giving a 10 per cent increase for the year to 4.29p. Mr Gordon Senior, finance director, said the group was well aware of the pressure on margins. One of the problems had been that the group had born during the year much of the cost of registering chemical processes in accordance with new environmental controls. The partial recovery of sterling and the effect of more favourable currency hedges should begin to help build margins again soon, some analysts believe. Capital spending increased from Pounds 16.9m to Pounds 21.1m. Nevertheless, cash balances rose Pounds 8m to Pounds 23.7m. Net assets rose from Pounds 145m to Pounds 169m. COMMENT Allied Colloids has again shown its ability to grow sales organically. Recession may have slowed the growth from the 20 per cent levels it achieved in the 1980s but judging by the progress in the last half, the company has not lost the knack of selling. A worrying development, however, is the erosion of operating margin as overheads have grown. A part of this relates to higher insurance premiums; part from increased raw material costs, following sterling's devaluation, that could not be passed on. But there is also a more permanent increase in the cost of running a chemicals business with tighter environmental controls. The trick for Colloids is to prove overheads have not moved on to a permanently higher level. This year the company should make pre-tax profits of about Pounds 50m, or earnings of 12.6p, giving a prospective multiple of over 17. The premium may be justified by the quality of organic growth, but Colloids is not the kind of stock likely to excite for the moment now that the market's attention is firmly on recovery.</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Management Education &amp; Training (8): Solid domestic base for a world mission - The European Experience / France International business school, south west of Paris, not far from Versailles. For most multinational business executives outside France that map reference means just one word: Insead. Set up in 1959 on the Harvard model, the Fontainebleau-based Institute of Business Administration is almost synonymous with management education in Europe. However, the same part of France - the village of Jouy-en-Josas, to be precise - boasts another institution with a growing claim on outsiders' attention. Groupe HEC (L'Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales) is France's leading grande ecole of management, and representative of a proud educational tradition which lies at the heart of the country's executive training system. Frequently misunderstood - and too easily dismissed by international commentators - HEC and other grandes ecoles like ESSEC, ESC Paris and ESC Lyon are developing serious international strategies on what, from the outside at least, appear to be enviably solid domestic foundations. At a time when the Anglo-Saxon MBA model seems no longer to be able to provide all the answers, the French system offers an instructive alternative. The grandes ecoles, which like so much in France can be traced back to Napoleon, are independent of the French universities, but closely associated with and partly financed by local chambers of commerce through a compulsory payroll tax on employers. Originally set up to prepare children of wealthy industrialists and merchants for a career in the family business, they evolved after the second world war into much more professional and better focused management training institutions, influenced greatly by what was going on in the US. Today, there are 21 grandes ecoles of management which turn out some 8,000 graduates per year. Students follow typically a 5 year general management curriculum which starts immediately after the baccalaureat and which is sub-divided into two years of classes preparatoires devoted to pre-business school courses; a one year foundation course; and the two year graduate programme proper. Students already holding a university degree, as well as foreign students, generally go straight on to the graduate programme. The qualification they receive is generally known in France as the masters in management, and is quite distinct from the MBA. The latter, of course, is of Anglo-Saxon origin and is aimed at graduates with a general education who have already spent several years working in a business. In one sense, the two systems are complementary: indeed HEC and Lyon recognise this and offer both. But in another sense the economic climate in Europe has sharpened rivalry as business schools seek to find the most appropriate methods for training the Euro-manager of the mid 1990s. There is more than a touch of anti-Americanism in the jibe that Insead is an offshore business school, but while such remarks merely underline HEC's still chauvinistic instincts and Parisian hauteur, it would be a mistake to under-estimate the advances which the grandes ecoles have made in broadening their course content (less emphasis on mathematics and closer contacts with the business community), the seriousness of the international mission of schools, such as HEC and Lyon, and the inherent attractions of the business vocational approach. HEC points out that its international student exchange programme actually started 20 years ago with New York University, and that 25 per cent of its students are non-French. It was also one of the founders of the Community of European Management Schools(CEMS) which has attempted to set standards for a European masters. That said, there is still some way to go. Its international drive really only started with the creation of HEC's specialist MBA arm the Institut Superieur des Affaires, while only 10-15 per cent of the faculty is non-French. Henri Tezenas du Montcel, HEC's President, admits that the school is ' still too small and still too French', but he adds provocatively: ' We are not so far now from schools, such as Harvard, MIT and Columbia. Ten years ago you could not have said that'. Lyon, meanwhile, is a more unlikely institution to be going global but as Bruno Dufour, the school's dynamic president, explains: ' It was the only strategy we could develop. If you are outside Paris in this country and you want to exist, you have to do something else.' He, too, admits that the school has a long way to go if it wants to be more than just a well regarded European school, and he predicts it will take another 10 years to be truly international, notably in terms of faculty quality. Lyon, nevertheless, has a good mix of non-French students taking the masters degree, and the student exchange programme is said to have progressed better than expected. Lyon has 13 double degrees with other institutions, including Cranfield of the UK and Esade of Spain, and 31 cross-border partners, with whom course work is validated for degree purposes. It is also a participant in the multiregional international business programme, run between the so-called club of rich regions in France, Italy, Germany and Spain, plus Wales and the Canadian province of Ontario. This involves students spending a full year at another business school, and carrying out a research project, or internship, in one of the other partner regions. Dufour lists many challenges facing business schools, including the need to adapt to new customer demands, develop a more flexible teaching approach, and make up budget losses arising from lower apprenticeship tax contributions in France. 'Some of the smaller grandes ecoles are going to go out of business', he says. The French-speaking market for management education is not large enough for distance learning, he believes, but schools in France will have to deliver their programmes with the help of the new technologies, such as videoconferencing. The cost of management education can be broken down into one third travelling and accommodation, one third salaries of the participants, and one third teaching expenses. 'If you can remove part of this equation so much the better.' In the absence of strong partnerships with companies, business schools are in big trouble, he says.</p>

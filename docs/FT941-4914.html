			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Business and the Environment: Green legislation will test Tokyo's sincerity - Japan is sharpening up its environmental policy, reports Emiko Terazono in the latest in a series / Worldwide waste In a recent letter to more than 600 Japanese manufacturers, Wakako Hironaka, chief of the country's Environmental Agency, urged business leaders to invest in environmental technology to help the struggling economy. Although the Japanese government has embraced the green issue over recent years to enhance its international image, it has done little to lay down legislation defining industry's role in environmental protection or imposing standards for industrial waste. Just how genuine the government is over its pledge to become more green will be tested later this year when it produces specific legislation to follow up the Basic Environmental Law, a broad policy statement passed by parliament last November. After rapid economic growth in the 1950s and 1960s, a public outcry over the sharp rise in pollution forced the government to lay down strict anti-pollution laws. Cases such as the Minamata disaster, where toxic mercury was dumped into the coast of a small seaside town in southern Japan, or the Yokkaichi air pollution scandal, in which residents of an industrial town in central Japan suffered severe respiratory problems due to the air pollution from chemical plants, led to litigation by victims. After numerous lawsuits against manufacturers and the government, tough laws controlling air and water pollution were passed. Companies rushed to spend on pollution control, investing 17 per cent of total capital investment at the peak in 1975. However, green legislation has hardly changed since then. 'Japan's philosophy towards the environmental issue hasn't developed in the last 20 years,' says Ian Austin, the Tokyo-based director of Japan business development at Dames &amp; Moore, the US environmental consultancy. Because Japan's industrial waste policy remains lax compared with that of the US and Europe, the financial burden on corporations remains almost non-existent. The agency had initially intended the Basic Environmental Law to include the implementation of a tax to limit carbon dioxide emissions and to make it obligatory for companies to conduct environmental impact assessments. But opposition from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) and the construction ministry led to the law being watered down. Soil pollution from industrial waste landfills is expected to pose a problem for the Japanese government and companies in the next few years. Legislation covering user charges, which require companies to pay for collection and treatment of polluted waste, will have to be implemented, since the cost of closing down and cleaning up industrial waste landfills is expected to be enormous. From its experience with Minamata, the agency realises that clean-up is more costly than prevention. The agency says that because Chisso, the chemical company responsible for the Minamata poisoning, had neglected to spend an annual Y100m (Pounds 645,000) in pollution prevention, its liabilities, including compensation to the victims and local fishermen, grew more than 100 times to an adjusted Y11.9bn a year. Austin says that leading multinational companies in the European Union and the US are already applying environmental management policies to their operations in Japan to avoid possible future liabilities. Japanese businesses, meanwhile, have seen profit opportunities in the development of green technology, and have also adopted action plans to show that they are already environmentally sound, and do not need further legislation. In 1991, the Keidanren, Japan's leading business federation, produced a policy statement which said companies should put board members in charge of environmental matters, while in 1992 Miti laid down a 'voluntary plan concerning environmental matters'. Although such pronouncements have mostly sounded superficial, some companies claim to be sincere. Toyota Motor says it will start producing cars in which 85 per cent of the body and engine parts can be recycled, while Toshiba has stopped using ozone-depleting CFCs to clean its computer chips. Kao, the detergent and consumer goods maker, promises to cut its industrial waste by 50 per cent by the end of next year. But some companies' behaviour overseas may not be consistent with the way they do business in Japan. Mitsubishi Kasei, the chemicals group, was forced to close its chemical plant in Malaysia after local activists' allegations of radioactive waste. Although Mitsubishi overturned a decision by the Malaysian court in 1992 to terminate operations, the case damaged the company's image and it pulled out anyway. In seven years, companies will run out of industrial waste sites, and some Japanese general construction companies have started to develop industrial waste and soil pollution technologies ahead of likely controls.

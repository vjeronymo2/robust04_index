			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Libyan gesture to Paris on bombings THE LIBYAN government has agreed to co-operate with France in an investigation of the 1989 terrorist attack on a UTA jet liner over West Africa but has again refused to extradite two Libyan agents accused of plotting the Lockerbie disaster nine months earlier. The Libyan authorities' stance was reported to the United Nations by Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the UN secretary general. He pressed Libya on the matter after a Security Council resolution last month that in effect called for the handing over of the Lockerbie bombers to British or US justice. The secretary general said Colonel Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan leader, had informed his special envoy that a judge was already appointed to try the accused. If Britain and the US were dissatisfied with the Libyan judges they should send judicial observers, Col Gadaffi advised. In his report to the Security Council, the secretary general said he subsequently got further clarification of the Libyan position in both the UTA and Pan Am disasters, which took a total of 441 lives. Libya now accepted French requests for all material evidence and access to documents, as well as the assembling of witnesses, and the facilities for contacts and meetings to investigate the UTA disaster. This decision was taken because France - which did not seek extradition of the suspected terrorists - acted 'in conformity with international law and did not infringe upon the sovereignty of Libya,' according to Col Gadaffi. The Libyan response came after reports that the suspects in the Pan Am bombing had disappeared and might have been executed. However, this has been denied and Mr Boutros-Ghali has made no mention of it. Libya is expected now to invite a French magistrate to Tripoli to investigate the downing of the French jet, rather than surrender four agents France wants to question. US State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Libya was trying to confuse the issue and 'remains unwilling to comply in any meaningful way' with the UN resolution, Reuter reports from Washington. 'We fully expect Libya to comply with those demands. If Libya fails to comply, as we've said before we consider all options open,' he said. Libya, meanwhile, is preparing for a possible punitive western military strike by hiding its mobile Soviet-made Scud missiles and strengthening its air defences, a US official claimed. 'We've had considerable evidence that the Libyans are concerned about some offensive military action,' said a government official, who added that the Libyan actions had been evident for many weeks.</p>

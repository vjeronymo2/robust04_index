			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Ailing health scheme: Alan Pike and James Buxton on the lessons of a flawed plan for a private hospital Shortly before it went into receivership this week, the Health Care International private hospital at Clydebank announced plans for a conference on the use of clinical information in management. 'Inaccurate information can be worse than no information at all,' the conference promotional leaflet declared. 'Consequently, information resources are central to business success.' To the many sceptics who had always rejected the case for building a huge Pounds 180m private hospital aimed at the overseas market on reclaimed industrial land near Glasgow, Health Care International seemed to have summed up its own plight. The hospital's financial backers - who included the government with Pounds 30m of public funds - appeared to have acted on inaccurate information when, in a vacuum, their instincts might have warned them to beware. The project was conceived ten years ago by US surgeons Dr Raphael Levey and Dr Angelo Eraklis, from Harvard Medical School. Their idea was to provide tertiary health care - serious operations for disorders such as cancer and heart disease - for patients living in countries where good treatment was hard to obtain. They identified Italy, Greece and the Middle East as potential markets: a view confirmed in the late 1980s, but not unequivocally, by Coopers &amp; Lybrand in studies commissioned by the Scottish Development Agency. The government committed Pounds 30m to the scheme, tied partly to the 1,800 direct jobs it was expected to create and Samuel Montagu in London and Montgomery Medical Ventures of San Francisco completed the financing arrangements in 1991. The project was made more dependent on borrowing with the reversal by the Industrial Bank of Japan of its decision to invest equity in HCI. But even as the idea was being developed, European construction companies were literally building a hole in the case in the form of new, well-equipped local hospitals in the Middle East and elsewhere that reduced the need for patients to travel to Europe or the US. Overseas patients used to form a bigger part of the market for UK private medicine than they do today, but fewer than 3 per cent of people admitted to UK independent hospitals in 1992-1993 (excluding abortion cases) came from overseas. They accounted for a greater proportion of revenue, since many were suffering from complex conditions. Even so, the authoritative Laing's Review of Private Healthcare estimates that overseas patients now account for about 10 per cent of the private sector's total revenue. Much of this goes to a handful of internationally famous London hospitals. Health managers estimate that to succeed in the existing market, a hospital the size of Clydebank would need to attract about one-third of all overseas patients treated by the entire UK independent sector. The alternative was to create a new market. The scheme's backers argue that this was Clydebank's aim. Smaller private hospitals cater largely for British patients seeking routine treatment outside the NHS. HCI sought to provide the more sophisticated and complex range of treatments offered by the central London independent hospitals, and make it available to a wider overseas market. In bed terms, Clydebank is almost as big as the NHS's specialist Royal Brompton National Heart and Lung hospital in London. The Royal Brompton, with five operating theatres, performed 2,700 operations last year. Clydebank has 21 theatres to keep busy, but when the receivers were called in on Wednesday, only 20 of the 50 beds commissioned were filled. These were early days, says Dr Levey, for a hospital that only began treating patients in March, and was not fully operational until June. 'The tragedy is,' he says, 'that in the last few days we had been achieving a rate of admissions that would meet our targets and ensure our viability. We had just signed conventions with three private Italian diagnostic centres whose patients would be covered by private medical insurance.' Late last month the hospital reached agreements with the authorities in Egypt and Lebanon. But time had run out. Negotiations had been going on since late summer between HCI, its bankers and investors, about a financial restructuring, but Credit Lyonnais, one of the five members of the banking consortium which had lent HCI Pounds 80m, refused to advance any more money, precipitating receivership. The scheme had always been opposed by trade unions and the Labour Party in Scotland, where the commitment to the NHS runs deep. The Independent Healthcare Association, which represents the UK private sector, also questioned the grandiose scheme's viability. 'The concept and scale of the project was unrealistic given the size of the international market and competition around the world,' says Mr John Randle, the association's chairman. The scheme's promoters had also failed to sell the idea to IDA Ireland, the Irish development agency. Talks lasted more than a year and the IDA says it would have been prepared to back the scheme if it had been satisfied it was viable. 'We kept asking the promoters for more information on potential markets and financial viability,' said an IDA official this week. 'It never reached the stage where we felt they had provided the information that would have enabled us to agree to the project, and the talks eventually came to an end.' Even so, Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, hopes it will be possible for the hospital to be taken forward from receivership and survive. New investors may be found - HCI hoped for more equity from the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, linked to a flow of patients from the emirate. But for Mr Barry Hassell, chief executive of the Independent Healthcare Association, the verdict is clear. 'I have visited the hospital and it is splendid,' he says. 'The trouble is that it is too big, it is in the wrong place, and it opened at the wrong time.' HCI seems to fly in the face of the Whitehall adage that ministers should never give money to someone who wants to manufacture square golfballs - even if his business plan is flawless. If the scheme fails, the whole world will remind you that golfballs are always round.</p>

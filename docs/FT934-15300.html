			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Lucas advance on results AUTOMOTIVE and aerospace components group Lucas Industries cheered an otherwise dull market after it reported bumper profits at the top end of most analysts' forecasts, and maintained the dividend. The group posted profits of Pounds 50.3m against Pounds 22.5m a year earlier, when the range of forecasts in the market was Pounds 40m-Pounds 56m. Lucas maintained the full-year dividend at 7p, with many researchers predicting a reduction, the more pessimistic even expecting it to be halved. The shares leapt forward in heavy demand for the stock and closed 12 ahead at 167p, on good volume of 10m. The equivalent of 1.3m shares was also dealt in the traded options market. However, dealers said the failure of the group to name a new chief executive, as had been expected, prevented a stronger advance in the shares, and profit-taking was also seen just ahead of the market close which brought the stock from the day's high. Many analysts upgraded profit expectations for the current year, moving the range of forecasts from Pounds 60-Pounds 80m to Pounds 90-Pounds 100m. Mr Robert Speed, at Henderson Crosthwaite, a long-time bull of the stock, is maintaining his forecast for the current year at Pounds 100m. Explaining the day's performance of the stock, he said: 'Today's share price movement reflects final recognition that Lucas has got to grips with tackling its cost base. It can now make gains in spite of difficulties in the underlying market conditions for aerospace and motor components.'</p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Argentina falls victim to forced selling Latin America provided the best and worst performers among the emerging markets in August. According to data provided by the IFC, part of the World Bank, Argentina fell by 13.7 per cent and Venezuela rose by 9.9 per cent in dollar terms. Analysts say Argentina was driven lower by forced selling by leveraged domestic operators so that they could meet their margin commitments. However, they note that the market has bounced back by around 5 per cent since the start of September. The prolonged liquidation of positions last month was accentuated by below-average daily turnover of around Dollars 50m, and the lack of institutional buyers meant that there was virtually no support on the downside. The market's drop was compounded by selling by disappointed domestic investors, who had speculated that foreign investors were about to return. Mr Marc Wenhammer, an in-house fund manager at Latin American Securities, says there was no fundamental reason for the fall in Argentina. In fact, there have been some good corporate results which have prompted selective buying since the end of the month. Venezuela's advance was more due to an absence of bad news, which encouraged the more intrepid investors, mainly specialist US funds, to pick up bargains. Lower interest rates also prompted a switch into equities. Positive developments on the macro-economic front - GDP rose by 8.5 per cent in the first half of 1992 from the year-ago period - as well as some good company results contributed to the short term stability. The second best performance in August came from South Korea, up 9.6 per cent following the implementation of long-awaited, market-boosting measures and the country's signing of diplomatic ties with China. The market has also been encouraged by the recovery in the Tokyo stock market. India came a close third, up 9.3 per cent on hopes that a government package to stimulate the economy will boost equity values, which have languished since a securities scandal broke early last May. A more detailed article on Argentina's stock market by John Barham, our correspondent in Buenos Aires, is scheduled to run on this page later this week.</p>

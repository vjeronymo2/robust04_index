			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Time for a Gatt deal WHEN IGNAZ Kiechle, Bonn's combative farm minister, describes leading farm lobbyists as 'day dreamers who have no idea of agricultural political necessities', revolutionary times have come. The reform of the Common Agricultural Policy agreed last week may be a small revolution but it is a revolution none the less. The CAP will never be the same again. Can the Gatt be far behind? The political necessity of which Mr Kiechle talks is not just the need to cut the cost of farm subsidies, but to prevent a failure to settle the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. Another, more specifically German, necessity is to ensure that continued failure will not poison the summit of the G7 leading industrial countries in July, which is to be hosted in Munich by Chancellor Helmut Kohl. It cannot be assumed that last week's agreement over farm price reform in the EC will lead to settlement of the Uruguay Round. But big obstacles have at least been cleared. The decision to cut cereal prices by 29 per cent over three years, for example, means a much larger proportionate cut in EC domestic support for production. The demand in the draft Uruguay Round agreement for a 20 per cent cut can be met with ease. Lower cereal prices should lead to reduced production and higher consumption. Once stocks have been used up, this ought to result in a significantly lower quantity of subsidised exports and, with lower domestic intervention prices, a still greater decline in the value of subsidies to exports. Again the Uruguay Round requirement for a 36 per cent cut in the value of subsidised exports, and a 24 per cent cut in volume, ought to be achieved with some comfort. Differences remain This does not mean that all reasons for dispute have disappeared. Differences remain over whether the EC's proposed compensation payments to farmers distort production. But this need not prove a great difficulty. Any output due to the compensation is likely to be negligible, certainly by comparison with the US government's deficiency payments, which clearly encourage production. If the result of the negotiation were to leave these compensation payments unchallenged for several years, that should be acceptable to all sides: to the EC, because it should not wish to pay compensation forever for lowering what were outrageously high prices; to lower cost producers, because it would allow EC reform to be banked now and reconsidered subsequently. Intractable issue That leaves one hitherto intractable issue: the EC's demand for 'rebalancing', effectively a demand that US exports of cereal substitutes to the EC be limited. The US has on principle refused to bow to this EC demand to alter already agreed terms of market access. There is no principled reason why its negotiators should change their stand. Nor should they, since lower EC cereal prices will themselves limit imports of US cereal substitutes. What is needed now is swift agreement between the EC and US, with the former abandoning the demand for 'rebalancing' and the latter accepting the EC's compensation payments for a predetermined period of years. The presence of EC negotiators in Washington this week gives both sides the needed opportunity. The participation of Mr James Baker, US Secretary of State, will add the necessary clout. However imperfect the agreement that can now be reached, it would at least provide more agricultural liberalisation than many could have reasonably hoped back in 1986, when the Uruguay Round started. Having reached the needed deal, the US and EC should turn their attention elsewhere: to other countries that must make significant offers on agriculture, Japan, first and foremost; and to the other outstanding obstacles, particularly market access and services. EC reform of the CAP has provided the basis for a final agreement in the Uruguay Round. The US should settle on that basis, recognising that the EC now has almost no room for manoeuvre. Although imperfect, the resulting outcome can deliver what the world most needs: a major trade liberalisation; a strengthened Gatt; and, not least, internationally agreed limits on the world's agricultural policy fiasco.</p>

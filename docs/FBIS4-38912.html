			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, June 02, BNS -- Major General Aleksander  Einseln, the commander of the Estonian Defense Forces, wants to  resign because he is dissatisfied with the activity of Prime  Minister Mart Laar.    Einseln asked President Lennart Meri on May 31 to accept the  resignation he had put in May 4. The army chief found Laar's  information about Estonian-Israeli cooperation "unethical, if  not a downright lie."    Laar met on Feb. 8 with an Israeli working group led by  General Dan Shomron to discuss questions of Estonia's security  and defense concept and opportunities for Estonian-Israeli  cooperation in defense.    "The leader of defense forces, who under the Constitution is  competent with regard to national defense issues, was not  informed about the meeting, its results and agreements  concluded. Under the circumstances when the defense forces'  chief lacks information about the premier's agreements with the  Israeli TAAS company concerning national defense, the commander  finds it difficult to answer for the country's defense  capability and security," the information department of the  Defense Forces general staff told BNS.    Einseln drew the conclusion that the prime minister doesn't  trust him and "has on purpose been acting without consulting  with him." Under the circumstances, Einseln considered his  resignation "inevitable."    Former Defense Minister Indrek Kannik, too, has claimed that  Laar's information about the Estonian-Israeli defense  cooperation project is somewhat distorted.    Kannik claimed Laar maintained in a May 17 letter to Einseln  that the "government has neither in my nor anyone else's person  signed a cooperation project with General Shomron."    Kannik told BNS the record of Laar's Feb. 8 meeting with  Shomron states that the "visitors and Mr. Laar agreed that the  cooperation between Estonia and Israel may be divided into three  main categories."    The former defense minister maintained one of the agreed  categories concerns the establishment of a joint working group  at the Estonian Interior Ministry to analyze both the military  and security aspects of the Estonian defense concept.    The government press service told BNS that neither the  Estonian Government nor ministries have signed any pacts or  agreements without informing the Defense Forces general staff  about it.    "During the visit of General Shomron to Estonia on Feb. 8-9  the Israeli party proposed to form a joint working group to  promote the mapping out of Estonia's defense concept. The  Estonian side found that Estonia must have priority in this  issue, but expert opinions are welcome. Consultations with  private companies in security issues are widespread the world  over, especially in the United States," the government press  release reads.    The meeting between the Estonian premier and the Israeli  general found that Estonia needs more assistance with questions  falling within the competence of the Interior Ministry,  primarily those concerning improvement of the work of the police  and the border guard, therefore "further solution of this issue"  was referred to the Interior Ministry, the press service said.    "Neither the premier nor the government have addressed this  question. The Israeli side informed about its views on possible  cooperation the Interior and the Defense Ministries. The prime  minister's office has not received information about this," the  government press service told BNS.    The press service confirms that the protocol of Laar's  meeting with Shomron provides for the formation of an  Estonian-Israeli working group at the Interior Ministry to  analyze the Estonian defense concept. Both Interior and Defense  Ministry officials are expected to belong to the group.    "The parties agreed that the group will start work as soon  as  possible and prepare a preliminary report by end June 1994," the  press service informs.</p>

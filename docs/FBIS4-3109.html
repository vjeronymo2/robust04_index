Han, who arrived here on Wednesday, held talks with his  Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev, Ivan Rybkin, speaker of the  lower house of parliament, and Vladimir Shumeyko, head of the  upper house.    According to the ITAR-TASS news agency, the two sides "have  similar views on international issues and are ready to expand  bilateral cooperation and interaction on the international  scene, primarily in northeastern Asia."    It said Moscow and Seoul are "rather close" in their stands  on nuclear non-proliferation on the Korean peninsula.    After his talks with han on Thursday, Kozyrev told reporters  that Russia "cannot allow violation of the nuclear  non-proliferation regime in any area and by any state."    Kozyrev also stressed that Russia is opposed to pressuring  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) by force on the  nuclear issue.    South Korea supports Russia's proposal to convene an  international conference on the security and non-nuclear status  of the Korean peninsula. But Seoul emphasized that preferably  the Korean nuclear issue should be resolved at the UN Security  Council.    Russia said the proposed international conference should be  held on a six-plus-two formula with participation of Russia, the  United States, China, Japan, the DPRK, South Korea, the United  Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency.    Another topic in Han Sung-chu's Moscow talks was  preparations  for the forthcoming visit of South Korean President Kim Yong-sam  to Russia in June.    At the Russian-South Korean summit meeting, the two sides  are  expected to sign a package of documents on cooperation in the  economic and political spheres.    It will be Kim Yong-sam's first visit to Moscow. Russian  President Boris Yeltsin visited Seoul in November 1992.    Leaving Moscow for home on Friday, Han expressed  satisfaction  with his three-day Moscow trip. For its part, the Russian side  described his visit as successful, noting that relations between  Moscow and Seoul are "on the rise."</p>

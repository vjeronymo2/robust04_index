			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (8): Oozing opulence - The Hotel de Crillon offers comfort, elegance and classical French style THE view across Place de la Concorde from the Hotel de Crillon is, or so said Victor Hugo, the 19th century French writer, the most beautiful view in the world. Hugo, of course, saw the Place de la Concorde without all the cars and coaches that honk their horns and belch out fumes around the obelisk today. But the view from the suites along the Crillon's facade is still stunning particularly at night when the 19th century lamps are lit and you can look out over the trees of the Tuileries gardens to the giant clocks of Musee d'Orsay on the other side of the Seine. Even if you plump for a more modest room along the side of the hotel, the Crillon positively oozes opulence. The whole hotel has been restored over the past few years, from the sumptuous marble lobby with its forests of flowers festooned on Louis XVI tables, to Jacques-Ange Gabriel's 18th century facade. The Crillon is still a very French establishment. Even the royal suites along Place de la Concorde are small, certainly by American standards, and there are none of the amenities, the multi-gyms or swimming pools, that a Montana millionaire might expect from one of the very grandest European hotels. But the Crillon more than compensates with its glossy blend of icy elegance and comfort, classical French style at its best. The rooms are decked out in powder blue and white, with glacial glass chandeliers and gold leaf inlaid in the woodwork. All the hardware that all too often messes up the aesthetics of modern hotel rooms, including the mini bar, is discreetly hidden away, although even the Crillon has yet to find a way of hiding the black-clad bodyguards that hang out around the rooms of its security-sensitive guests. Best of all, the marble bathrooms are arranged in suites of tiny rooms, so that the bath, bidet, shower and make-up area, are completely separate from the bedrooms themselves. There are also walk-in wardrobes, with plenty of drawers and hanging space, so that even the smallest rooms need never be cluttered up by baggage, however long your stay. The staff even leave a little weather guide by your bed each night with a forecast for the coming day. Foodies need not stir from the hotel. Les Ambassadeurs ranks as one of Paris' finest restaurants thanks to Christian Constant's classic French cuisine. It also has one of the most stunning settings, with its glowing marble walls and the afternoon sun streaming in from Place de la Concorde. L'Obelisque offers less formal fare from Andre Signoret's kitchens at the Grand Vefour on Palais Royal, in its art nouveau-style restaurant, prettily decorated in red velvet banquettes. Hotel de Crillon, 10 Place de la Concorde, 75008; tel: 4265 2424. Rooms: FFr2,300 to FFr3,300. Suites: FFr4,600 to FFr24,000.</p>

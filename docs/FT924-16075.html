			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Talks lift hope for Maxwell pensions CONTESTED CLAIMS on assets in the Maxwell business empire totalling at least Pounds 100m may be resolved in out-of-court settlements negotiated with the help of the government's Maxwell pensions unit, it emerged yesterday. Sir John Cuckney, head of the unit, which works on behalf of the pensioners to recover assets, said that at least four parties involved in both sides of a series of contested actions had approached him for help. He said that the trust set up by the government to collect donations to help plug the hole of stolen assets - which is also headed by Sir John  - had raised sufficient money to pay full entitlements to all the Maxwell pensioners for at least three years. The unit hopes to save time and legal fees by avoiding court cases that may take several years to resolve and consume money that might otherwise go to the pension funds. Sir John emphasised that discussions were still at a very early stage. 'We have barely started the hors d'oeuvres,' he said. The unit's role would be simply a co-ordinating one. He said that the trust would have received about Pounds 5.75m by the end of this week, after the receipt of one imminent donation for about Pounds 250,000. There has also been a Pounds 2.5m contribution from the Department of Social Security. Contributions to the trust had ranged in size 'from Pounds 6 from a pensioner to six-digits'. Goldman Sachs - the US merchant bank that carried out a number of share dealings with the Maxwell companies - has confirmed that it has made a substantial donation, believed to be about Pounds 1m. Sir John said there had been 'a reasonable number' of donations from organisations that had conducted business with the Maxwell companies. He added that there had been 'some disappointment' at the level of contributions from the City, and he was changing the focus of his fund-raising to concentrate on those groups. He emphasised that donations did not imply guilt from companies that did business with Robert Maxwell and added that there was no question of donations as 'hush money' in lieu of potential litigation. Some existing contributors had pledged more money in the future, he said, and other potential donors were holding back until there was a clearer view of how much money would be needed. He was reluctant to give a target because there was a risk of loss of credibility if it was not made - but he expected it to ultimately be 'in the tens of millions'. Sir John said that after meetings with the insolvency practitioners he was personally satisfied with the levels of fees being charged. The trust has paid about Pounds 1.5m to Maxwell pensioners since the end of June. It has also helped to ease the progress of matters relating to the Maxwell pensioners within Whitehall, resolving difficulties in agencies including the DSS and the Inland Revenue.</p>

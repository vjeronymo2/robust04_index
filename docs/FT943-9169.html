			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Ferguson in agreed Pounds 38m bid for Elswick Ferguson International Holdings, the mini-conglomerate, yesterday made an agreed offer worth Pounds 37.7m for Elswick, a rival label supplier. The move will turn Ferguson into the largest group in the Pounds 600m a year UK labels market, with a share of about 10 per cent. Ferguson is offering one new share and 175p cash for every 29.2 Elswick shares. This values each Elswick share at 18 1/4 p, a 50 per cent premium to the closing price on Wednesday. Yesterday, the shares finished 5p up at 17p. Ferguson shares were little changed at 356p. Mr Denis Cassidy, Ferguson chairman, admitted that the company was paying a 'full price' for Elswick, but said this was partly to warn off any other predators. 'We understand other companies may have become interested.' He added that the offer valued Elswick at an exit multiple of nearly 18 on historic earnings per share close to the sector average. 'We wanted a business that would be a major step in the development of our core label business. Elswick does that. It brings together two high quality businesses with similar trading styles operating in complementary sectors.' Ferguson specialises in supplying labels for the garment and food industries, while Elswick is strong in the toiletries and car care sectors. Mr Cassidy said the deal would be earnings dilutive in the year to February 28, becoming earnings enhancing in year two. The company is to issue up to 7.5m new shares, with the cash part accounting for Pounds 12.4m of the offer. Gearing will jump from the present 12 per cent to about 60 per cent, and increase further as investment is made in the new business. Mr Cassidy said he was confident that the synergies from the takeover would become evident 'fairly quickly'. Elswick made operating profits of Pounds 3m last year on turnover of Pounds 54.2m, 75 per cent of which emanated from its labels business. The remainder came from an agribusiness based in East Anglia.</p>

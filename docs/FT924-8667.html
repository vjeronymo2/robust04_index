			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Letter: Work horse Sir, So Gillian Shephard ('Shephard stresses rights of individuals', November 6) thinks abolishing the wages councils will 'strengthen the rights of individuals'. As a student needing work in the holidays, I will be able to undercut other applicants and am sure to get a job. Mind you I will need to work much longer hours to compensate, so it is a good job I have also 'got the right' to work as many hours as I can thanks to the opt-out on the Social Chapter. Why not bring back workhouses too] Gingham Taylor, 29 Burlington Road, Hull HU8 0HN</p>

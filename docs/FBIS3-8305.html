These are the global  evaluations of the Macedonian Chamber of Commerce, which is  following the realization of the 1994 stabilization program of  the government. The situation in certain segments, as for  example in the monetary policy, is even worse than last year and  threaten to prove disastrous for the economy.    The companies, besides on the Greek embargo and reduced  foreign markets, also bitterly criticized the domestic factors  smothering the realization of the stabilization program. They  point out the low percentage of using of the available  capacities, the heavy burden of public expenditures, the low  accumulative capacity of the economy, and the unemployment. The  January break of the planned 8 percent to even up to [passage  indistinct] end of the year is realistic. Therefore, they  appealed to the bankers not to introduce a rapid increase of the  interest rates. The restrictive monetary policy threatens to  grow into a real war between the banks and the companies, since  it gives little opportunities for the weakened Macedonian  economy. The companies claim the interest rates are not in the  function of stabilizing and stimulating the production.    Additional problems are also the delayed privatization  process, the too large exposure of the domestic market to  liberalization, etc. In such conditions it is hard to expect  that the economy will function property, and a co-operation  between the proposer -- the Government and [passage indistinct].</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The SIP revision USEPA is approving in this action substitutes a plantwide definition for a dual definition in Indiana's existing nonattainment NSR program. In obtaining USEPA approval of its original part D SIP, Indiana did not rely on any emission reductions from the operation of its existing NSR program. Also, Indiana uses a plantwide definition of source. A July 22, 1987 letter from Timothy J. Method, then Acting Assistant Commissioner, Office of Air Management, Steve Rothblatt then Chief of the Air and Radiation Branch, states Indiana's rationale for implementing the plantwide definition. The letter further states that in obtaining USEPA approval of its original part D SIP, Indiana did not rely on emission reductions from its existing NSR program. Indiana has nonattainment areas for sulfur dioxide, lead, ozone, and fine particulate matter. Indiana has submitted several revisions required by the amended Act prior to attainment of the NAAQS by the statutory attainment dates, which range from 1994 to 2007 for the nonattainment areas in Indiana. For example, Indiana has submitted revisions for VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  RACT, Stage II vapor recovery, clean fuel fleets, and 15% VOC reduction, employee commute options vehicle inspection and maintenance and the 1990 base year ozone emissions inventory. These revisions have been or will be acted on by USEPA in subsequent actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Indiana's plantwide definition of source is consistent with the NSR requirements for ozone nonattainment areas in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Lake and Porter Counties are classified as a ``severe'' ozone nonattainment area. Therefore, the attainment date for the area is now 2007 (see section 181(a)), and Indiana must meet an independent requirement to reduce VOC emissions by fifteen percent in the first six years after 1990 and three percent per year thereafter (see section 182(b)(1) and (c)(2)(B)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While Indiana must account for the impact of its plantwide definition of source in the attainment and reasonable further progress demonstrations it submits under the amended Act, it is clear that Congress anticipated States could use the plantwide definition of source when devising such plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amended Act includes provisions regulating the application of the plantwide definition of source, including a special rule for serious and severe ozone nonattainment areas for determining ``de minimis'' net increases in VOC emissions from source modifications (section 182(c)(6)). It is clear that Congress anticipates states will often continue to employ USEPA's plantwide definition of source in ozone nonattainment areas (except in extreme areas, see section 182(e)(2)), provided the states can also meet the new reasonable further progress requirements in the Act. In addition, it is important to note that the 1990 Amendments' adoption of new future attainment deadlines has mooted concerns regarding the approvability of a plantwide source definition where a state has missed prior attainment deadlines. Congress has given Indiana additional time to submit a revised SIP to provide for attainment by the revised deadlines. As described above, Indiana has already begun to meet its obligations under the 1990 Amendments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USEPA expects to publish a proposed rule in late 1994 to implement the changes under the amended Act in the NSR provisions in parts C and D of title I of the Act. USEPA may refer to the proposed rule as the most authoritative guidance available regarding the approvability of the NSR SIP submittals. USEPA expects to take final action to promulgate a rule to implement the parts C and D changes sometime during 1995. At that time, USEPA will review the NSR SIPs of all states to determine whether further SIP revisions are necessary. Prior to USEPA approval of a State's NSR SIP submission, the State may continue permitting only in accordance with the new statutory requirements for permit applications completed after the relevant SIP submittal date (e.g. November 15, 1992 for ozone nonattainment areas). This policy was explained in transition guidance memoranda from John Seitz dated March 11, 1991 and September 3, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As explained in the March 11 memorandum, USEPA does not believe Congress intended to mandate the more stringent Title I NSR requirements during the time provided for SIP development. States were thus allowed to continue to permit consistent with requirements in their current NSR SIPs during that period, or apply 40 CFR part 51, appendix S for newly designated areas that did not previously have NSR SIP requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The September 3 memorandum also addressed the situation where States did not submit the part D NSR SIP requirements or revisions by the applicable statutory deadline. For permit applications complete by the SIP submittal deadline, States may issue final permits under the prior NSR rules, assuming certain conditions in the September 3 memorandum are met. However, for applications completed after the SIP submittal deadline, USEPA will consider the source to be in compliance with the Act only where the source obtains a permit that is consistent with the substantive new NSR part D provisions in the amended Act from the State. USEPA believes this guidance continues to apply to permitting pending final action on NSR SIP submittals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Rulemaking Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing USEPA's action on SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;66).

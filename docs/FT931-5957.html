			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Rate cut optimism ebbs after German repo move A HIGHER than expected repo rate in Germany slightly dampened hopes of a cut in key interest rates this Thursday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT consolidated, banks staying relatively strong on the view that rate cuts are only a matter of time, and degree. Deutsche Bank ended unchanged at DM711, while Dresdner rose DM2.50 to DM407.30 as the DAX index eased 4.21 to 1,696.74, and turnover fell from DM7.5bn to DM6.8bn. Notable fallers included Hoechst, down DM5.10 at DM260.90 following adverse media comment on the likely health impact of last week's toxic chemicals spillage in the suburbs of Frankfurt. Carmakers were mixed, with BMW down DM5.40 to DM497.50, but Volkswagen DM4.50 higher at DM278.50. VW said in Geneva that recent reports on its prospects had been too gloomy, that it would break even this year and that it would focus on profits, not volume, in the 1990s. PARIS finally broke through the 2,000 barrier to close at its highest level for about 9 months. The CAC-40 index, which had seen a day's low of 1,987, finished just 2.50 ahead at 2,0001.50 in turnover of some FFr2.9bn. Some analysts said that while the 2,000 level had been in target since last week it was not clear who was buying the market, although some US funds had been seen. Michelin was among the day's losers after an independent research group cut its earnings forecasts in half because of the depressed state of the car sector. The shares fell FFr4.60 or 2.5 per cent to FFr181.60. MILAN was driven by Monday's late news that the Italian cabinet had approved a decree law allowing the establishment of private pension funds. Even a downgrade by Standard and Poor's, the US rating agency, of the country's long term debt had little lasting effect on sentiment and the Comit index closed up 5.49 at 536.68 in heavy turnover. Against this, analysts said that economic fundamentals remain poor, that the pension fund news has already been discounted and that, while fresh liquidity will be generated, this is unlikely to have any effect on the equity market before the end of the year. Generali, the county's largest insurer, which had advanced nearly 6 per cent on Monday ahead of the cabinet's announcement, eased on the kerb, losing L60 to L36,950. AMSTERDAM weakened with KLM being affected by a statement from SAS which cautioned against hopes that talks between the Dutch carrier and members of the European Quality Alliance - SAS, Swissair and Austrian Airlines - would eventually lead to a merger between the four. The CBS Tendency lost 0.6 to 99.3 with KLM down Fl 1.10 at Fl 24.70. MADRID eased on profit-taking, the general index closing 1.05 lower at 235.61. Banks were flat on average and constructions generally weaker. The day's big fall was reserved for the recently ebullient Nissan Iberica, Pta34, or nearly 10 per cent lower at Pta313, reporting a big 1992 loss in the middle of an ambitious expansion programme. STOCKHOLM retreated on profit-taking, the Affarsvarlden general index slipping 3.8 to 1,014.3 in turnover down to SKr729m from SKr873m. Skandia, the insurance group, lost SKr6 to SKr112 after Allianz of Germany denied that it was interested in a takeover. ZURICH's SMI index rose 10.3 to 2,130.8, banks and insurers rising as investors moved frombonds into equities. Industrials received less attention. Kleinwort Benson was quoted yesterday as advising asset allocators to underweight the Swiss equity market, with particular reference to uncertainty in the pharmaceuticals sector. DUBLIN's ISEQ overall index closed 30.05 higher at 1,367.47 for a two-day gain of 4.4 per cent. Mr Robbie Kelleher, head of research at Davy Stockbrokers, said that there were three main reasons: a growing belief that interest rates were going to come down significantly; news of a US bid for the government stake in the food group, Greencore; and results from Allied Irish Banks. The AIB results were better than expected, said Mr Kelleher, leaving the shares 9p higher at IPounds 2.09, and giving added strength to a financial sector already lifted by interest rate prospects.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- March 2                                            THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1155.97    1155.99    1156.99    1156.53 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1209.47    1209.28    1209.42    1209.73  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes          13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1156.03    1156.80    1156.92    1156.71 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1209.12    1209.20    1212.02    1211.84  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Mar 1    Feb 26    Feb 25    Feb 24    Feb 23  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1158.20   1139.80   1125.06   1116.05   1119.41 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1213.57   1194.07   1178.13   1172.14   1178.69  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1157.45 ; 200 - 1212.97 Low/day: 100 - 1155.53  200 - 1207.84 .  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

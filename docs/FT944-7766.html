			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: NSM backs Budge's assumptions One of Britain's largest independent coal companies yesterday backed the assumptions used by Mr Richard Budge, chief executive of RJB Mining, in his controversial Pounds 914m bid for British Coal's English regions. Mr John Jermine, executive chairman of NSM, which failed in its own bid for the South Wales region, implied doubts behind RJB's bid could be exaggerated. 'I do not think it is beyond reason that Budge's assumptions will work out,' he said. Mr Jermine said he was optimistic about the outlook for coal in spite of two widely publicised threats to the UK industry - imports and the potential shift from coal to gas-fired power stations. Mr Jermine said coal was the cheapest fuel for power stations. The generators 'still make more money from coal than from any other source of energy,' he said. Secondly, Mr Jermine maintains that imports are expected to become increasingly expensive as transportation costs rise. 'Our prices in the UK are already broadly competitive with imports on a secured stream of coal,' he said. However, he attacked the delay by the Coal Authority to reduce the royalties it receives from independent coal miners. These have over the last 18 months fallen from Pounds 5 to Pounds 2 per tonne for open cast coal. However, a further expected reduction to 50p, which would make UK coal more competitive with imports, had not yet been implemented. Mr Jermine's comments on the British Coal bidding process almost overshadowed his own company's buoyant performance in the first half and its promise to pay the first dividend since 1990. Pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 rose by Pounds 2m to Pounds 2.7m, on sales 9 per cent ahead to Pounds 62m. NSM said it expected to pay a final dividend, in light of the continuing improvement in the trading performance. Profits in the first half were helped by a record year in the plant hire business, and by lower interest charges of Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 3.94m) after the Pounds 40m rights issue in July. The US mining division almost trebled pre-tax profits from Pounds 959,000 to Pounds 2.3m largely due to reducing costs. Prices in the US remained under pressure, and were not expected to improve until industrial activity picked up. In the UK, mining profits rose by 28 per cent to Pounds 4.4m. About three-quarters of NSM's UK mining turnover comes from low margin contracts with British Coal. However the bulk of profit came from NSM's own mines which supply UK utilities on fixed contracts which run to 1998. Earnings per share almost doubled from 3.5p to 6.9p. There was no interim payout.</p>

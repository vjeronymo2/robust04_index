			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, May 18 (XINHUA) -- The European Union (EU)  should abolish trade restrictions on China, urged Li Ruihuan,  chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).    Li made the call when meeting here today with Willy Claes,  Belgian deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs,  on Sino-European and Belgian relations.    The European Union (EU) still has some restrictions on  Sino-European relations which is incompatible with present  needs, Li said, these restrictions should be abolished.    Li expressed Chinese belief that Sino-European relations  would develop smoothly if the two sides carry out the principles  of seeking common ground while reserving differences,  respecting, non-interference of each other's internal affairs  and peaceful mutual benefit.    Showing his understanding on Li's viewpoint, Claes said that  the EU should adopt a positive attitude towards China, relaxing  its restrictions to China on trade and economy and opening to  the country.    Li also said that the Chinese Government attaches importance  in developing long-standing, equal and mutually beneficial  relations with West European countries and that those relations  are good on the whole.    He stressed that both sides share the same or similar views  on essential international affairs, the economic base for  cooperation is concrete and the future for development is  tremendous.    Chairman Li said that Sino-Belgian trade and economic  relations have been increasing in recent years.    The healthy and fast pace of China's national economy with  its big market and advanced technology, equipment and funds from  Belgium offers great cooperation potential and a bright future  for trade and economic cooperation of the two countries, he  added.    Li expressed China's willingness in making joint efforts  with  Belgian parties to promote mutually-beneficial cooperation  between the two countries.    Claes said the trade and economic cooperation between  Belgium  and China are satisfactory and Belgium has a strong wish to  develop more relations with China.    He added, Belgium will take new measures to expand trade and  economic exchanges with the country and I believe the chairman's  visit will influence positively the understanding and  cooperations between Belgium and China.    Freddy Thilemans, the mayor of Brussels, hosted a welcome  ceremony this afternoon for Chairman Li, who is on the last leg  of a five-nation European tour, which has already taken him to  Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark.</p>

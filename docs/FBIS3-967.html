			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Supervision and Control Commission, CSC, has not  reached agreement on the salaries to be paid to the soldiers in  the future Mozambique Defense Armed Forces, FADM. Labor  Minister Teodato Hunguana has said that the problem must be  viewed objectively. He added that solutions must be found that  are in tandem with the country's realities.    At the CSC meeting yesterday, the Mozambique National  Resistance, Renamo, proposed that the number of FADM troops be  reduced to 20,000 men so that better salaries can be paid to  them.</p>

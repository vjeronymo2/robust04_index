			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Ministries blamed over red tape THE INCREASING burden of red tape on British business is partly caused by the ambivalence of the Department of Trade and Industry and the Treasury towards deregulation, according to a paper published today by the Social Market Foundation. The paper is written by Mr David Willetts, Conservative MP for Havant, who was formerly a Downing Street policy adviser and director of the Centre for Policy Studies, the think tank founded by Lady Thatcher and Lord Joseph. It is published a day before a seminar called by Mr John Major at which ministers and senior civil servants will be expected to explain their plans for deregulation. Mr Willetts says red tape has increased steadily since the mid-1980s and now represents a serious obstacle to the creation of a flexible, dynamic economy. An important reason for the growth in regulation is the ambivalence of the two main ministries involved, he suggests. The DTI was concerned mainly with large companies, which often regarded regulation as a useful barrier to new competition. The Treasury saw regulation as a way of attaining objectives without public spending. Mr Willetts targets 10 areas of government legislation for urgent action, including the Companies Act requirement that small firms carry out an audit, the quality management standard BS5750, food safety legislation and the Children Act, governing child care facilities. Regulation is allowed to proliferate because departments aim for the highest standards without questioning the cost; because central government wrongly blames Europe or local authorities for the problem; and because in areas such as safety, regulation appeals to our emotions. The government needs to look at a stronger lay involvement in working groups drafting legislation so that acceptable basic standards are adopted, Mr Willetts said. Business should be disciplined by the prospect of legal liability rather than be forced to comply with a mass of regulation designed to prevent mishaps. Areas of action should include: Removing the statutory audit for small firms. This can cost up to 4 per cent of turnover and it prevents companies using low-cost book-keepers. The EC directive harmonising company law does not require an independent audit but the UK insists on one. The Food Safety Act. This was introduced after food poisoning scares and imposes tight controls on retailers. Yet there is evidence that, in many instances, problems arise further down the food chain. Rail and Tube safety. Recent accidents have prompted a huge programme of safety spending, pushing up fares. Yet rail remains one of the safest forms of transport. Accident inquiries often produce uncosted and overlapping proposals for reform. Deregulation. Social Market Foundation, 20 Queen Anne's Gate, London SW1H 9AA. Pounds 3.

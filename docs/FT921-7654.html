			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Surprise sale of Greencore stake by Irish government IN A surprise move which caused considerable annoyance on the Dublin stock market, the Irish government yesterday sold a third of its 45 per cent holding in Greencore, the Irish sugar and foods group. The 12.5m shares were sold at 265p each to the Investment Bank of Ireland, an institutional fund manager for a number of Irish pension funds. The sale has breached an undertaking made by the ministry of finance in April last year at the time of Greencore's flotation, that the government would not dispose of any further shares in the company for at least two years unless there were unforeseen circumstances. The company was floated at 230p per share. Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, justified the move, saying that circumstances had changed because of new budgetary pressures resulting from 1992 public sector pay awards. He said 'it had been the original intention to make the disposal later in the year and thus stay as close as possible to the two years mentioned . . . but a firm bid at a fair price came through one stockbroker acting for an institutional fund manager who was prepared to hold the shares.' Dealers in Dublin said they were 'shocked', especially as Greencore shares were being bought at between 270p and 280p during the week, and no effort was made to make a pro-rata offering to existing shareholders at the discounted price. The market found out about the deal at 11am yesterday, but the Dublin Stock Exchange was apparently not informed until late in the afternoon. One dealer said: 'It was disgraceful as far as overseas investors are concerned.' Some 1.7m shares were later released onto the market, calming some of the outrage. The finance ministry said 'it was a difficult choice to make' but that a sale to a single bidder was considered 'orderly from the market's point of view'. The ministry added that 'there is categorically no question of any further share sales this year.'</p>

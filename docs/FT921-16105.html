			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Muted response to Clarke proposals PLANS by Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, to demolish the current structure of graduate teacher training in favour of a mainly classroom-based system have received a surprisingly muted response from the teaching unions and the Labour party. Most union leaders argued with some aspects of Mr Clarke's plan and emphasised the importance of adequate funding. But they did not disagree with the principle of shifting more training to the classroom. The harshest criticism came from Mr David Harrison, chairman of the committee of vice-chancellors and principals. He said there was no evidence that secondary-school training was failing. The main problem continued to be shortages of teachers in key areas. Mr Clarke's plan would shift the ratio of classroom to academic training from 40:60 to 80:20 and would transfer the financing and administration of training to selected schools. A report at the weekend from the schools inspectorate on school-based training, also published at the weekend, said the principle was sound. But it cast doubt on the practicality of Mr Clarke's plan by stating: 'The prime purpose of schools, and the one to which governors and head teachers give priority, is to teach pupils, not to train students.' Mr Clarke's plan, due to be introduced in the autumn, has a strongly political dimension. It will probably form the centrepiece of the education proposals in the Conservative manifesto and is part of the government's attempt to blame falling educational standards on the 'progressive' educational theories supported in many teacher-training colleges. But the union response suggests that it is unlikely to turn into a populist election issue for the government with Labour and the unions on the side of the 'experts' and the Conservatives backing 'ordinary parents'. Even the National Union of Teachers, the most militant of the teaching unions, said the government's plan would not alarm teachers 'provided it is properly prepared and planned and given the necessary resources'. Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers, said Mr Clarke was pushing a good idea too far and proposed equal shares for classroom and academic training.

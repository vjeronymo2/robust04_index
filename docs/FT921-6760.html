			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / World Trade News: US and Mexico unveil Nafta environment plan THE US and Mexico unveiled their long-awaited border environment plan yesterday, a key component of their strategy to persuade US Congressmen to support the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Mr William Reilly, head of the US environmental protection agency, presented the plan in Los Angeles, claiming: 'Never have two nations developed so extensive a plan to improve health and environment along their entire border'. Mexico's environment minister made a simultaneous presentation in Tijuana, Baja California. Under the pact, Mexico will spend Dollars 460m (Pounds 262.8m) over three years (Dollars 147m in 1992) on water treatment and other public works, doubling the number of environmental inspectors, and toughening regulation of Mexican-based industries. The US proposes spending in its 1993 budget Dollars 179m on border environmental protection, of which Dollars 170m is earmarked for waste-water treatment. But the fear that the border environment will deteriorate in the event of Mexican-US free trade has become a focus of opposition to Nafta in Congress.</p>

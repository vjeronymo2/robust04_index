			<p>BFN     [Text] Parliament May 20 SAPA -- New president of the  Senate Mr Kobie Coetsee undertook to do his best to promote a  spirit of fairness, justice and impartiality in the house.  Elected unanimously on Friday, he appealed to senators -- who  had just been sworn in by Chief Justice Michael Corbett -- to  co-operate in upholding the senate's dignity. "As president of  the senate, one of my duties will be to see that the right of  freedom of speech is upheld in the house."    After the swearing in of the new senators in the historic  old  senate chamber at Parliament, Mr Justice Corbett asked for  nominations for the presidency. The National Party's chief whip  Mr Attie Jooste proposed Mr Coetsee and Mr Alex van Breda,  former chief whip of Parliament, seconded the proposal. Mr  Coetsee was duly declared elected.    Mr Justice Corbett then called for nominations for deputy  president. Former Rivonia trialist, Robben Island prisoner  member of the ANC's National Executive Committee Mr Govan Mbeki  was the sole nomination, proposed and seconded by the ANC's Mr  Dennis Bloem and Ms Isabella Direko. Mr Mbeki, father of South  Africa's first deputy president Mr Thabo Mbeki, was declared  duly elected.    Mr Coetsee was then escorted to the president's chair by Mr  Jooste and Mr van Breda to deliver a short speech to senators  before adjournment. "I deem it a great privilege to have been  elected to this first senate under the new constitution," he  declared. "It is my pleasant duty to express my appreciation to  the house for its confidence." He undertook to discharge his  duties to the best of his abilities. "Let us never forget that  a spirit of tolerance and good humour is conducive to good  debate."    Mr Coetsee said the Senate would play an important role in  South Africa's constitutional development, especially in view of  its composition of 10 senators from each of the nine new  provinces.    Among those watching proceedings from the public galleries  was the speaker of the National Assembly, Dr Frene Ginwala; her  deputy, Dr Bhadra Ranchod; and the Western Cape premier, Mr  Hernus Kriel.    The African National Congress occupies benches from the  president's right; with the Freedom Front and Democratic Party  sandwiched in between the ANC and the National Party [NP] which  occupies the first block of benches to the president's left.    There are 60 ANC senators, 17 from the NP, five each from  the  Inkatha Freedom Party and the Freedom Front and three from the  Democratic Party.</p>

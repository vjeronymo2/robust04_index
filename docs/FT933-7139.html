			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Tories feel the strain of paying for the train THE Brighton Evening Argus said it all. 'Rail fares fury' screamed the headline over an article calculating that proposed British Rail fare rises leaked this weekend would force Brighton commuters to pay at least Pounds 172 more for their Pounds 2,347 annual season tickets to London. Judging by the mood in Brighton yesterday the sentiment was shared by many - not only among the town's commuters but also in the embattled local Conservative party. Sussex has long been part of the south of England Tory heartland, but a gradual erosion of the party's vote - in May's local elections it lost control of the county councils in East and West Sussex for the first time - has left many local Tories increasingly nervous about the impact of the rail fares issue. Mr Andrew Bowden, Tory MP for Brighton Kemptown, who has a slim 3,000 majority, lost no time in expressing his concern. 'If they try to impose a 16 per cent increase, all hell will break loose in the constituency. I am sure they won't do it,' he said. With a 'huge number' of commuters in his constituency, increasing fares could only exacerbate the anti-Tory swing, he added. At the local Conservative headquarters the mood was more restrained. Ms Pat Smith, Tory agent for the town's two parliamentary constituencies - the other, Pavilion, has a 3,500 majority - insisted there was little sign of outright rebellion so far. 'Normally can I tell if there's a lot of Conservative party dissatisfaction from the number of people ringing me. There hasn't been any phone calls so far,' she said. But privately other local Tories admitted they were incensed. 'It's supposed to be a public service, and this just isn't a public service at all. Of course there is a lot of anger,' complained one local councillor. Mr Adam Trimingham, political correspondent on the Evening Argus, put it more bluntly. 'The two Tory seats in Brighton are both marginal seats . . . This is going to have a big impact.' Not all the passengers on the platforms yesterday agreed with such sentiments. Mr Chris Wilson, who commutes from Brighton to a solicitor's office to Burgess Hill, on the line to London, said: 'It won't stop me going on the train. Even with big increases it is still the cheapest way to get to work. It won't make me vote against the government.' But Ms Shelley Atlas, chairman of the Brighton line commuters pressure group, and a daily commuter to London, insists that the increases would reduce the number of passengers. 'It's going to hit the lowest-paid commuters hardest of all. A lot of employers are freezing wages, so its going to be very hard to cope with a big jump,' she said. Mr Peter Chester, deputy chief executive of the Sussex chamber of Commerce, shared her concerns. 'Companies here are trying to keep wage increases down. This is not going to help,' he said. With unemployment in the town running at 15 per cent, some of the most bitter complaints came from those without work. Mr Gary Cross, who is unemployed and who makes regular leisure trips between Crawley and Brighton, said: 'I will definitely be going less by rail if they put on those increases. 'Those who have got good jobs in the City can easily afford an extra 30 quid or whatever. It's the housewives and others without jobs that can't - and they vote, don't they.'</p>

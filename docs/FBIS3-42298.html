"In their press interviews, Dr. Ibrahim Yazuri and Khalid  al-Hindi have encouraged the Fatah Hawks to act against  Israelis," said Abu-Zayida, the PLO liaison with the Israeli  authorities. Yesterday he was mentioned as one of the young  leaders who have lost control over the Hawks. "It stands to  reason that if they meant to forge such cooperation, they would  not run to the press with their remarks of encouragement. In my  opinion, this is just a guess on the part of the Shin Bet."

			<p>920411 FT  11 APR 92 / Election 1992: Regional breakdown shows swing failure IN NO REGION of the country did Labour achieve the level of swing required to become the largest party. Only in the east Midlands did the party make the kind of improvement which could have removed Mr John Major's overall majority. A swing to Labour in London of 3.3 per cent was enough to win 12 seats, 10 from the Conservatives and the two remaining outposts of Dr David Owen's SDP. But the Conservatives held nine of the 21 seats in the capital which Mr Neil Kinnock needed for an overall majority. As suggested by the opinion polls, Tory support held up well in the north-west. Scotland swung by more than 2 per cent from Labour to the Conservatives, and the band of Tory MPs swelled from nine to 11. The Liberal Democrats were down from 1987 in every region, most markedly in Scotland and London where their vote was squeezed in the Conservative/Labour battle, and in East Anglia where their vote plummeted in Cambridge and Cambridgeshire North-East.</p>

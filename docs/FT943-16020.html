			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / International Company News: Cimpor float raises Es39.6bn A public offering of 20 per cent of Cimpor, Portugal's largest cement producer, was 4.8 per cent oversubscribed, officials said yesterday. The privatisation on the Lisbon stock exchange raised Es39.61bn (Dollars 241m). Employees and small savers bought 33 per cent of the 14m shares on offer, at discounted prices of Es2,600 and Es2,700 respectively. The fixed price for other investors was Es2,900. Foreign investors purchased 32 per cent of the offer. 'The operation was a success for the government, considering the depressed condition of the market,' said a Lisbon stockbroker. 'But an oversubscription of only 4.8 per cent is not enough to create an active after market in Cimpor shares.' Lisbon market analysts said the interest from foreign investors was below expectations. They attributed this partly to the gloomy climate of world stock markets, and to the early pricing of the Cimpor offer. 'Since the price of the Cimpor operation was fixed two months ago, the Portuguese market has fallen 15 per cent,' said a Lisbon dealer. 'Pricing the offer two or three days before the sale would have ensured that the price reflected market conditions.' However, the government was successful in attracting small investors to the first offering to embody its recently-revived policy of advancing 'popular capitalism'. Its aim is to disperse the capital of privatised companies and stimulate stock market activity. Cimpor now has 14,138 private shareholders, of which 246 are foreign. Employees own 0.94 per cent of the company's total capital, while small investors hold 5.66 per cent. A further 20 to 25 per cent is to be sold on foreign stock exchanges later this year, followed by the privatisation of another 20 to 30 per cent in Portugal in 1995.</p>

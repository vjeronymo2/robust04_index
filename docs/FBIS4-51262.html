			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "China Issues Loans To Support Six </F> Types of State-Owned Loss-Making Enterprises"]    [Text] Beijing, 25 May (HSIN WAN PAO)--The relevant  quarters in China recently decided to adopt a preferential  policy this year and next for state-owned industrial  enterprises, especially for the six types of enterprises, with  regard to offering loans of circulating funds.    It has been a serious phenomenon for a long time that  state-owned enterprises owe one another loan repayments and this  seriously hinders their operations. For this reason, it is very  necessary for the state to concentrate some capital to clear the  debts of key industries in addition to settling bank bills to  strengthen credit measures by the banks.    It has been learned that the state-owned loss-making  industrial enterprises for which the State has decided to give  support in terms of circulating funds comprise the following six  types: Enterprises whose products have a ready market and whose  production and marketing rate is greater than 93 percent;  foreign-trade export-oriented enterprises which make profits  from exports and have export orders but lack circulating funds  for the execution of contracts; enterprises whose production  continues all the year round and whose products are marketed in  a particular season or whose production lasts for a particular  season and whose products are marketed all the year round;  enterprises with clear loss-curbing goals; enterprises which  ensure that [loss-curbing] measures are implemented; and those  enterprises which have begun to produce profit-making products  and hope to curb losses in one or two years.    For these six types of state-owned loss-making enterprises,  the relevant banks will grant support loans using the average  amount of the actual loans of circulating funds obtained between  1991 and 1993 as the base. These enterprises should pay back  the loans as scheduled in accordance with the loan contracts.  If they fail to do so, their banks can stop offering loans to  them.    This preferential circulating-fund policy also means that  the  State's loans to profit-making industrial enterprises this year  and next generally will not be lower than the amounts in 1993.  It will increase loans to enterprises whose returns are good  appropriately, in keeping with deposit status of the banks in  the current year.    When deciding to offer loans of circulating funds to  state-owned enterprises, the relevant quarters specifically  stressed the need to pay attention to integrating production and  marketing and to continue to strictly limit the production of  unmarketable and overstocked products in keeping with the  principle of "increasing the production of marketable products,  limiting the production of less marketable products, and  stopping the production of unmarketable products."</p>

			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENDPAPERS: THE WOMAN WHO WROTE SIX FIRST NOVELS  </P> <P> Perhaps these notes ought to be called a public service announcement for career  counseling. What they reveal comes out of a job-related experience. As a  passport control officer at a major American city where international flights  arrive and every incoming passenger must be cleared through customs, I have  occasion, day in and day out, to look at the way people describe themselves on  the line in their passports where they're asked to supply their "occupation."  </P> <P> The majority of answers are what you would conventionally expect: Women declare  themselves housewives and something else like gourmet cooks or fashion  specialists or interior decorators; men name some profession or technical  competence that confirms their place in the hierarchy of earning powers in our  social Establishment. But, now and then, there are surprises.  </P> <P> Writers make up a peculiarly interesting group. Some call themselves  "creative," others "free-lance" -- I suppose depending on their godly or  devilish associations. Those who identify with more specific powers enlist as  novelists, playwrights, short story writers, essayists or film writers. But I  think I've seen everything now that a woman appeared just the other day who  handed me her passport where I read, as her occupation, the phrase "first  novelist."  </P> <P> I asked: "Does that mean you've just written your first novel?" I must have  said it with a strong sense of surprise because, given nearly professionally  radiant makeup and a truly handsome wardrobe, she appeared to be a creature  somewhere between the ages of 30 and 50; anywhere between 30 and 50.  </P> <P> "Oh, no," she replied. "I've written a number of first novels." She said it  with unconcealed satisfaction.  </P> <P> "What number?" I asked.  </P> <P> "Six. I've written six first novels during the past 12 years."  </P> <P> "Forgive me, madame, but how is that possible? You sound like a mother who's  telling me she's had six first babies. You can't have a first child except the  first time you give birth to a baby."  </P> <P> "Well, let's say that is a semantical point. It depends on what you mean by  you. When you are known by a particular name and you use that same name on one  novel after another, then, no, you are right. You can't have written six first  novels. But if you change your name for each novel that you produce, so that  you seem to be a person who has never written any other novel before, that you  is able to write a first novel each time she has a novel published -- as I do."  </P> <P> "Isn't that like misrepresentation? Doing business under illegal conditions?  Doesn't it get you into trouble with the Internal Revenue Service every income  tax time?"  </P> <P> "Oh, no, no." She was comfortable about her role. "It's perfectly legal, just  like a large corporation taking out a different trademark for each different  product that it creates and manufactures. It doesn't matter by now if Philip  Morris cigarettes is responsible for Kraft Cheese, or is it Kraft Cheese that  is responsible for Marlboro cigarettes? Those various goods are considered  strictly on their own merits, each by itself, and in no way benefit from or are  undermined by association with other products from the same owner."  </P> <P> "But literary artists don't like to think of their writings as comparable to  what a Campbell's Soup Co. might put out, do they? Don't they take pride in a  whole career rather than just one of their books now and then?"  </P> <P> "Well, that's the way it used to be. There was a time -- it lasted for about  200 years, and ended about 20 years ago -- when there were publishers who  brought out whatever an author would write whether it was poems, stories,  plays, essays, or novels. Such a person was a man of letters and such a  publisher published whatever he wrote, as it was his intention to bring out his  collected works, his oeuvre, the body of an entire writing career: For such a  writer was thought of as an author, an authority, a genuine creative artist.  Moreover, there were readers who wanted to read whatever such a genuine author  created.  </P> <P> "But those days are long since past. At least 20 years past. There is no  concealing the fact that in the Western world today writing is divided the way  the food we eat is divided, between gourmet literature and junk literature. But  for both kinds no author is authority enough for a publisher to take a gamble  on anything -- that is to say everything -- that he or she writes. Therefore  each thing (story, play, novel, essay) is judged by itself on the basis of  whether it will be a 'hit' on its own or not."  </P> <P> "But then how can a writer make a name for himself?"  </P> <P> "Neither he nor she can, anymore. We're conditioned so our maximum attention  span can accommodate one TV commercial every few minutes. I guess the future of  literature lies in the aphorism. In any case, neither the publisher nor the  audience -- the book-buying public -- has the attention span to finish a whole  novel let alone follow a whole career."  </P> <P> "Is that why writers keep changing publishers?"  </P> <P> "Yes. And that's why I keep changing names. And it's why there are no Men -- or  Women -- of Letters anymore. The age of specialization is upon us. No one, it  is believed, can be good at more than one thing. If you're a poet, then you  can't expect your publisher to bring out your stories or articles. If you're a  novelist, you can't expect anyone to produce or broadcast or license your  plays. There are no more Voltaires, no more Victor Hugos. There are no more  giants. Neither publisher nor reader will invest in a person, an artist, a  creator in the sense of becoming a devoted follower, a supporter, sponsor of a  whole career."  </P> <P> "A devotee."  </P> <P> "Correct: Devotion is passe, And yet, amazingly, there survives a tiny remnant,  a vestigial mini-audience who believes that ingenious, original, creative  literary art might be a godsend, a revelation, something in the way of a truth  that will set ye free -- therefore, a particularly generous, a uniquely kindly,  courteous reading -- reviewing -- and buying of First Novels takes place. So  I've plugged into that. I write only first novels."  </P> <P> "But as a different person each time. No one will ever look for the shape of  your literary career as a whole," I said, sadly.  </P> <P> "That's the price I have to pay," she replied. In a world where no one reads  enough to discover the pattern in the carpet, how can one dream to be read  enough for anyone to find the shape in the career? No. It's enough to get  published at all, each time under a new name, by a different publisher."  </P> <P> "As if 'the first time' might yield the only new information."  </P> <P> "All readers have become Don Juans lusting only for virgins. . . ."  </P> <P> "And all writers engaged in the hope of a new life within each new literary  beginning. We don't really feel satisfied with the thought of making money the  old fashioned way, slowly over some period of time -- earning it; what we want  is magic -- making fame and fortune by one stroke of the wand."  </P> <P> We had held up the line of travelers long enough. The other arriving passengers  were becoming restless. I cleared the lady's passport and sent her on through  customs. I went back to checking passports remembering quietly to myself that I  too am a writer of sorts, trying, experimenting, between busy-work hours here  at the Customs House. During those times, when I make things up, I, too, can  think of myself as an Imaginative Writer. My day will come -- I hope. In the  meanwhile: Call me Ishmael.  </P></p>

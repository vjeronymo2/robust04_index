			<p>BFN     [Text] The Yoruba community in the troubled Bakassi  peninsula has appealed to the government, obas, and the chiefs  of some states to (?assist) it to resume their present  activities. The states include Lagos, Ogun, Oyo, Osun, and  Ondo. In their written plea to these states, members of the  community, who are mainly fishermen and traders, gave the  details of the atrocities committed against them by Cameroonian  gendarmes. This includes the illegal seizure of their fishing  boats, the imposition and forceful collection of Cameroonian  taxes, the burning of their homes, and looting of their  property. They urged the administrators and the traditional  rulers as well as other leaders to channel assistance to the  Cross River State Government.</p>

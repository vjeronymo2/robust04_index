			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Executive to step down at leading Danish bank MR Steen Rasborg, chief executive of Unidanmark, Denmark's second-largest bank group, is to resign and the bank will bring in an outsider to take over his job. The move , announced by the board yesterday, came two weeks before the bank's half-year interim report is due, on August 18. The report will show a pre-tax loss of DKr1.5bn (Dollars 267m), reflecting loan loss provisions of DKr2.5bn and unrealised losses on the value of securities of DKr400m. The result for the full year is expected to be a slightly larger loss than last year's DKr1.7bn, depending on how securities markets perform over the next few months. Mr Hugo Schroder, supervisory board chairman, said the change at the top was necessary to restore 'unconditional confidence,' in the bank. The bank reported losses of DKr1.1bn in 1990 and DKr1.66bn in 1991, but this was not the core of the problem, said Mr Schroder. 'On the last five occasions that the bank has published a report it has predicted an improvement in results, which has given us a bit of a credibility problem,' he added. Mr Rasborg has presided over the bank since its was formed in 1990 from a merger of three banks, Privatbanken, SDS, the savings bank, and Andelsbanken. Mr Rasborg was formerly chief executive at Privatbanken. Since the merger the bank has been dogged by large loan loss provisions, which increased from DKr2.66bn in 1990 to DKr4.21bn last year. Privatbanken had a reputation as a bank prepared to accept high-risk business, but Unibank has consistently denied the old Privatbanken portfolio was responsible for a disproportionate share of the bank's losses. Mr Lars Eskesen, Mr Rasborg's co-director, will take over as acting chief executive until a new appointment is made.</p>

			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEEDS OF TRAGEDY;  </P> <P> CRIME: BRAD POWERS JR. AND HIS DAD SHARED A PRIVATE WORLD OF LOVE AND RAGE.  WHEN IT DISSOLVED, 2 INNOCENT PEOPLE DIED.  </P> <P> So great was his love for his father that Brad Powers Jr. -- twisted, confused,  and consumed with vodka and grief -- sought to avenge his anguish with  bloodshed on Easter weekend.  </P> <P> Gun drawn, he stalked into the Mission Bay Memorial Hospital emergency room,  where his father had died just hours earlier. He chose a place of healing for a  scene of revenge, killing two hospital workers and wounding two other people,  police said.  </P> <P> "Those two days were the most traumatic, horrible experience I ever had in my  life, the way they did my father wrong," Brad Powers Jr. said, sitting in jail,  still convinced the hospital had improperly cared for his father, Brad Powers  Sr., 75, a nationally known architectural illustrator. "I loved my father,  that's what's on my mind now. It's a horrible, horrible tragedy."  </P> <P> In his grief, Brad cannot see how, in seeking an outlet for his rage, he has  spread pain and anguish in a widening circle.  </P> <P> "It's devastating -- I can hardly talk or read," said Florence Burke, the  mother of Deborah Kay Burke, a nurse killed in the rampage. "The loss can't be  measured. It's so total and unbearable, and it doesn't go away with her  burial."  </P> <P> For 46 years, the lives of Brad Powers Jr. and his father had been bound  together. Brad had never held a job; he lived with his parents at home and  leaned on his father to raise his own two children.  </P> <P> Yet, sometimes in fits of anger, he would turn on his father and strike him.  Neighbors along Castle Hills Drive remember police cars parked outside the  Powers' front gate. Once, the elder Powers tried to commit his son for mental  problems.  </P> <P> But the family held strong. His parents paid for Brad's divorce and custody  battle, and even coached him on what to say in court.  </P> <P> During a brief stint in the Coast Guard, he fell from a ladder and injured his  back. A doctor prescribed a painkiller that had a lasting effect on Brad and  made him sometimes act strangely, his mother said. Although unable to recall  the name of the drug, Brad said he has disliked doctors ever since.  </P> <P> Even today, although admitting to the shooting rampage, Brad does not believe  it was truly his fault. He was drunk, he said -- although police say tests show  he was not. He still blames the hospital and said he is sure people will  understand his actions once they learn the circumstances.  </P> <P> "What the hospital did was murder," he said. "If the hospital hadn't been  negligent, if they cared for my father the way they should have, this whole  damn tragedy never would have taken place."  </P> <P> The Powers family lived in an ocean-view home on La Jolla's Mt. Soledad, with  five dogs and 12 cats. Brad handled the household chores. His father sketched  in the small, cluttered studio next to the swimming pool.  </P> <P> "We were a family that was a good team," Brad said, adding that his father,  "was just the most wonderful man a son could have. We shared every day  together, for years and years and years."  </P> <P> But all was not well inside that home.  </P> <P> The "good team" did not include Brad's brother, Charles Powers, 51, an  assistant vice chancellor for design at UC Irvine. He says he has been  estranged from his brother and mother for 25 years. He declined to explain  further.  </P> <P> The Powers were a proud family, and a private one. And not many neighbors,  friends or even Charles Powers really ever knew all that went on inside the  gracious home, carefully hidden from the road by trees and shrubs.  </P> <P> The elder Powers had come to Southern California in the 1920s when he was 9  years old, after his father, stricken with polio, had tired of slipping on  Chicago's icy sidewalks. By the 1930s, he had his first illustrating job,  painting color posters for movies playing at the Fox theater. He drew Boris  Karloff as the Frankenstein monster and actor Leo Carillo as a bandit. He  parlayed that work, at 19, into a job as an architectural illustrator and drew  renderings for some prestigious projects.  </P> <P> He worked on some San Diego landmarks: the County Administration Center, the  Civic Theatre, the Westgate Hotel. By the 1950s and '60s, he had earned a  national reputation.  </P> <P> "I enjoy making something that's needed beautiful," he once said of his work,  "rather than making it ugly."  </P> <P> He spent many days in his studio, which was entered through two sliding glass  doors. The studio walls were covered with rough pencil sketches and drawings.  His 106-year-old desk once belonged to his grandfather. The lingering smell of  smoke from his pipe wafted throughout the house.  </P> <P> "He had this Norman Rockwellian way about him," said Jonathan Finfer, a San  Diego architect who, three years ago, organized an art exhibit highlighting  Powers' work. "He had this high-pitched laugh. You would just roll back and  laugh with him, and then you could see he was in ill health. He would cough for  15 seconds when he told his stories, and all you could think of was, 'Get some  help.' "  </P> <P> The elder Powers often was treated at Mission Bay hospital, where he was such a  regular that he referred to the nursing staff as "my girls." He would walk into  the emergency room, and, without even checking in, hook himself to the machine  that evaluated his weak pulmonary condition.  </P> <P> A month before his death, Powers filled out a "Star Card," praising the  hospital emergency room. "Emphysema sometimes brings me here feeling as if I  have one foot in the grave," he wrote. After being treated, "I go out back to  my flamenco dancing again."  </P> <P> As his father grew weaker, Brad grew more and more responsible for running the  small household. He shopped and cooked, maintained the pool and tended the  family menagerie.  </P> <P> "I carried the load of the household, I kept the place running," he said. "I am  a pretty responsible fellow. Just because you are not working a particular job  doesn't mean you are not working."  </P> <P> His mother, friends and neighbors describe this gentle side. "I have never seen  Brad Jr. when he was anything but a considerate, thoughtful, good neighbor,"  said Beatrice England, who has known the Powers family for more than 25 years.  "In any dealings I had with him, he has been very polite and friendly."  </P> <P> Mary Powers, 73, says her son was a "very sweet little boy who was very  bright." He worked hard on the family boat and soon became an able sailor who  was well-liked by his peers, she said: "He had friends all over. I know Brad  does not have anything mentally wrong."  </P> <P> His father had designed the main clubhouse at the Mission Bay Yacht Club, where  his son first learned to sail, winning teen-age trophies. "He was real active  and real handsome, and the girls all had crushes on him," said a club official.  </P> <P> Six feet tall, with blond-brown hair and blue eyes, Brad has a boyish face and  an athletic build that makes him look younger than his age.  </P> <P> "He was the sweetest, nicest guy you could hope to meet," said Mary Hayward,  whom Brad escorted to the senior prom. She had not seen him after graduation  until she visited him recently in jail. "He's so sensitive," she said. "I just  think he snapped."  </P> <P> There were earlier emotional problems. When Brad was 21, his father filed a  petition in San Diego Superior Court. Powers said his son appeared to be  mentally troubled and took the first steps to commit him. A doctor had told  them Brad was "in an acute psychotic episode and appears to be on the verge of  violence," Powers said in the court petition. "He refused to take the  prescribed medicine. He was admitted to the psychiatric ward as an emergency."  </P> <P> But within five days, Powers had dropped his efforts and withdrawn the  petition. Asked about this episode, Brad recalled suffering an "emotional  disturbance from an over-prescribed tranquilizer" that was supposed to ease  upper back pain.  </P> <P> "That's when I started having bad feelings towards doctors," he said. "That  caused an emotional disturbance, and it almost killed me. I carried that along  many, many years. It took me five years to pull out of that thing."  </P> <P> Brad believes he recuperated from that episode. When his four-year marriage to  Jeanne Evelyn Powers ended in divorce in 1971, court papers made no mention of  his mental illness.  </P> <P> The court battle over custody of their two children, Warren and Laura, raged  for years, with Brad's father backing him in countless fights until custody  finally was awarded to the youngsters' grandparents and father.  </P> <P> Many saw Powers and his wife -- not Brad -- as the driving force in the fight  over the children.  </P> <P> "Brad was an incredibly weak man with no backbone," said a family attorney, who  requested anonymity. "He had an excuse for everything he might have ever done  wrong. Brad was very unhealthy. He was being controlled by his parents, and he  seemed to regurgitate what they told him to say. He wasn't effective as a human  being."  </P> <P> Neighbors recalled strange events. Dorene Guerrazzi, 22, said she would  sunbathe in her back yard, only to hear Brad tromp down the hill and offer her  money for sex. Once, she said, he threw a rock with a $50 bill and a note  wrapped around it, asking her to "spread her legs." She called police. "He just  seemed strange," she said. "He seemed lonely."  </P> <P> He also sometimes physically abused his father.  </P> <P> "There were only two or three occasions, and they were extremely mild," Brad  said. "I never hit him, it was a slap here and there -- like fathers and sons  do. It was a minor thing really, that was all it was. On one occasion, I went  overboard and he had me arrested."  </P> <P> But after his death, a family member asked that coroners investigate to  ascertain that abuse did not contribute to the elder Powers' demise, said Dr.  H.E. Hammerstead, the surgeon who had operated on him. The coroners' office,  however, found no evidence of abuse.  </P> <P> Brad's mother said her son's spats with his father were not serious. "They had  disagreements off and on because they loved each other," she said. "They did  talk back and forth. My husband was always yelling at everybody. (But) my son  wouldn't touch a flea, he wasn't that type of person. He did disagree with his  dad, but he loved him. If he hadn't loved him, he wouldn't have spent his life  taking care of him."  </P> <P> The elder Powers felt tremendous pressure to support the household and  postponed retirement, said Marvin Mizeur, another lawyer who has known the  family for 16 years. "It was not a pleasant situation for Brad Sr. for the last  10 years," said Mizeur. Powers had told him Brad verbally abused him  constantly, Mizeur said -- a contention the son denies.  </P> <P> "I am a good guy," Brad said. "I never hurt anybody in my life. I never hit  anyone with a closed fist, never pointed a gun until this horrible, horrible  incident."  </P> <P> But, he added, "you never know, you wake up on a Friday morning, and you never  know what the day is going to turn out to be like."  </P> <P> Friday, April 13, began like any other day for Brad Powers Jr.  </P> <P> After returning from the grocery store, he learned his father had gone to  Mission Bay Memorial Hospital. He was not upset. His father was overweight and  had a history of heart and lung problems.  </P> <P> The senior Powers appeared in the emergency room, complaining of shortness of  breath. "He was adequately evaluated and treated and released in good  condition," said Dr. Harry Henderson, the hospital's chief-of-staff-elect.  </P> <P> Powers returned to the emergency room the next morning, complaining of  abdominal pain. The diagnosis: a ruptured aneurysm. Doctors telephoned Brad at  home and told him they needed to operate to save his father's life, Henderson  said. "His attitude was that, 'If you're going to operate on him, don't do it  until I get there,' " the doctor recalled.  </P> <P> Brad "arrived prior to the surgery and the (lead) surgeon had a chance to  discuss with him just how serious the situation was," Henderson said. "He was  very concerned that his father was going to have an operation, but what he  didn't realize at first was that without an operation his father was going to  die. And once he realized that, he calmed down."  </P> <P> But during surgery, the elder Powers suffered a heart attack and died, despite  what doctors said were their every efforts to save him.  </P> <P> Told of his father's death, Brad grew agitated and upset. He screamed that  doctors had not done enough to save his dad. He was furious that his father had  been sent home the day before, angry that doctors had gone ahead with the  surgery, despite his father's frail condition.  </P> <P> Brad went home, the house sadly dark and silent without his father. He drank  heavily from a large bottle of vodka, he said.  </P> <P> Then, suddenly, without a word, he grabbed the .22-caliber handgun the family  kept at home for protection, started the Corvette his parents had bought him  and drove back to the hospital.  </P> <P> Shortly before 5 p.m., eight hours after his father's death, the staff and  patients in the emergency room were jolted by a scream, a man yelling: "You  killed my father!"  </P> <P> The roar of gunfire resounded through the room.  </P> <P> Nurse Deborah Kay Burke and Edward Thomas Rooney, a medical trainee, were  killed. Fred Mowrer, a patient's father, was shot once in the backside. Dr.  Michael Hughes -- a physician who just hours before had tried to comfort the  obviously distraught Brad about his father's death -- was wounded with a spray  of gunfire, hit possibly five times.  </P> <P> Burke, a vibrant, funny "aerobics-olic" who had been a nurse for 12 years, was  preparing to take a vacation in Germany with her boyfriend. That Saturday shift  was one of the few remaining before her trip. Burke, 36, had treated the elder  Powers during some of his emergency room visits, but hospital officials were  unsure whether she saw him on the day of his death.  </P> <P> Burke was sitting at the long white nurses' desk when the gunman stormed in.  She tried to scramble under her chair but was shot once in the chest. Bleeding  and confused, she ran outside and begged an elderly couple in a car in the  parking lot to drive her to another hospital.  </P> <P> Bewildered, they pointed back at the hospital.  </P> <P> Burke ran back inside and collapsed. She died of her wounds two hours later.  </P> <P> Rooney, 30, a student, was three hours into his shift when, police said, Brad  entered the emergency room. Rooney, engaged to be married in October, had to  spend eight hours observing doctors and nurses to graduate from an emergency  medicine course. He was not at the hospital when the elder Powers had been  there.  </P> <P> Rooney was watching Hughes treat an elderly woman in the three-bed emergency  room when the gunman entered. After Rooney was shot, he fell to the floor. The  gunman walked over to him and fired once more, killing him.  </P> <P> Mowrer, a lawyer from Albuquerque, N.M., visiting San Diego that Easter  weekend, was in the hospital for the first time. He had brought his daughter  Chelsea, 2, in for treatment for the flu.  </P> <P> "He didn't look like a crazy man," Mowrer said of the gunman. "I was looking at  him and I saw the gun coming up. I turned to avoid him. I didn't even know I  was shot. I fell to the ground. I had just seen him shoot (Rooney) on the  ground and thought, 'I am not going to let him do that to me.' "  </P> <P> Mowrer fell. He did not realize he was shot until he saw his green shorts were  stained red with blood.  </P> <P> Brad, back in his car, fled the scene. He headed north toward Oregon.  </P> <P> "I love Oregon. I have always loved Oregon -- it's beautiful, serene,  pleasant," he said.  </P> <P> But "I realized it was just a matter of time, and they would get me on the  freeway. I figured if they got me on the highway, they might blow me away."  </P> <P> So, 40 miles from the hospital, he turned off Interstate 5 and stopped at a pay  phone. He called Oceanside police and confessed.  </P> <P> Today, under $2.5 million bail, Brad faces two charges of murder and three of  attempted murder. In his jail cell, he said, he has pinned sailing pictures on  the wall.  </P> <P> He is bitter about the events that put him there.  </P> <P> "It's a damn wonder that things didn't turn out worse than they did. . . . I  will always feel towards the hospital what I feel now," he said.  </P> <P> "I have always loved animals. Animals never turn on you no matter what happens,  they are totally devoted and dedicated. If only people were more like dogs," he  says with a laugh.  </P> <P> Brad said he worried about jeopardizing his legal defense -- a preliminary  hearing in his case is set for June -- but he agreed to speak to The Times on  four separate occasions.  </P> <P> Although he said he did not want to discuss his defense, he added: "It was  temporary insanity. . . . When you go flipping out the way I did there, you  don't realize that you don't know what you are doing.  </P> <P> "The hospital did my father wrong," he said. "That's why I am in this tragedy.  </P> <P> "I feel very horrible about the people, the families. I can't bring those  people back. I can't bring my father back either.  </P> <P> "When these facts come out, there will be plenty of people who can tell what  kind of person I am. Hopefully, they won't condemn me. Hopefully, they will  understand a fellow who snapped under the circumstances."  </P></p>

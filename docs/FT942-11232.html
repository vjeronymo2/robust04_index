			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: B&amp;J counter proposal expected - Board's support likely for SA retailer's plan to inject up to Pounds 60m Pepkor, the South African retailer, is expected today to offer to inject up to Pounds 60m into Brown &amp; Jackson, which owns the troubled Poundstretcher chain of variety discount retailers. The Pepkor offer is likely to be backed by the B&amp;J board, which last month recommended acceptance of a rescue deal with the Weisfelds, the millionaire couple who created the What Everyone Wants discount clothing chain. B&amp;J shareholders are due to vote at an EGM on Monday on the plan for Mr Gerald and Mrs Vera Weisfeld to inject an initial Pounds 6m to meet the lossmaking group's immediate working capital needs, in return for a 19 per cent stake and two seats on the board. However, Pepkor executives have continued talking to B&amp;J and last night were still negotiating details of their counter-offer. This would involve an immediate cash injection of up to Pounds 20m, in return for an eventual substantial shareholding. The deal is unlikely to involve any offer to existing shareholders. Sources close to the talks dismissed a report that Pepkor would launch a hostile Pounds 50m bid and described the 8p per share mentioned as 'far too high'. B&amp;J's shares last night closed 1p higher at 6 1/2 p, valuing the group at Pounds 42m. Pepkor is Africa's largest mass-market retailer. PEP, the group's core business, sells to a predominantly black customer base. Although its international presence has been hitherto restricted to Scotland, where it operates a number of outlets under the Your More Store name, it has been looking for further international acquisitions. B&amp;J has been struggling to recover since the Pounds 16m rescue rights issue which brought in new management in 1992. However, poorer than expected trading last Christmas led to a profits warning in January. In March the group announced losses of Pounds 12.7m for 1993, against expectations prior to the warning of a Pounds 4m deficit. The Weisfelds' proposal was their first business venture since they unexpectedly left Amber Day, as WEW was then known, just eight months after selling the chain to Amber Day for Pounds 47m in 1990. Since then, the Weisfelds, who sold their 15 per cent stake in Amber Day for Pounds 11m, have devoted most of their time to charity work. Mr Weisfeld was not surprised by Pepkor's intervention, but said: 'What do they know about British retailing? They are last-minute people, who have been flushed out by our bid. Where were they when the company was going bust?'</p>

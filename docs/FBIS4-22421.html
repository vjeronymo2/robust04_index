			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by K. Briviba: "Demographic Situation of Ethnic </F> Latvians Detailed"]    [Text] The Latvian nation experienced a very heavy shock in  the sixteenth and seventeenth century when war and the Black  plague ravaged the land. The Kurlandish writer Jekabs Jansevskis  described this era in his book Mezvidus laudis (People of  the Forest) as follows: "The bright side of this plague is  that it quickly eliminates the aristocracy, the monks, the  church leaders and all of the collectors of tithes and tribute.  The tragedy is that the plague does not spare our kind of people  who also die in entire regions."    The historian Edgar Dunsdorfs estimates that half of the  population of Latvia perished at this time. The greatest losses  were suffered by the Kurzeme and Vidzeme regions with lesser  losses to the inhabitants of Latgale.    Later, in the 18th century, the people of Latvia also lived  under conditions similarly stressful to the 16th and 17th, but  at this time they had large families with as many as ten or more  children. As a result, after the years of ruin Latvia  experienced an explosive growth in population. For example, at  the beginning of the 18th century Latvia's population was about  465,000 but at the end of the century it had already reached  873,000. Therefor, the population nearly doubled during the  following 90 years. Information about the ethnic composition of  the population is shown in Table 1.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

Dunsdorfs indicates that this figure (873 thousand) does  not include the Russian army and that the number of Latvians  includes only those in the territory of Latvia.    Table 1 shows that the Latvian comprise a high percentage of  the total population -- 89.8 percent. This means that the  immigration from neighboring countries was negligible and that  the rapid increase of the population resulted from the high  birth rate and natural population growth.    Naturally, 18th century Latvians did not have demographers  or  other specialists, who were concerned with and encouraged the  renewal of the living force of the nation. It is also unlikely  that at that time that heightened national consciousness would  have motivated larger families to leave less room for foreigners  to settle in the homeland of the Latvian people.    In our era, when it is known that families with only one  child, or none, dominate, and that the once strong and healthy  Latvian nation is dying out in its own country, during a time of  peace (see Table 3) it is useful to reflect on and learn from  the objective conditions that stimulated the higher birthrate.    First, families and high birthrates received moral support,  because the manor lords were interested that they had a pool of  familiar, Latvian workers instead of having to hire unknown  strangers. For example, the court of the Duke of Kurland issued  regulations that peasants are to be encouraged to marry and that  these marriages are to be facilitated in every way possible.  This regulation also says that mothers of children born out of  wedlock are to be punished only lightly and that they cannot be  shamed with punishment meted out by the church. It is also,  however, stated that older wives of farmers and servants are to  watch over young girls. Historical data shows that some manors  ordered bachelors to find brides even in other regions. The  Russian government of the 18th century showed little interest in  the inhabitants of Latvia, however, they did issue a decree,  that the inhabitants cannot be restrained from marriage.    Second, at that time families were also supported by  economic  means. The historical record shows that manor lords in Vidzeme  paid premiums to the newly married and their children. Also the  manors permitted proper families with children to purchase their  own homes, but gave the most difficult and unpleasant jobs to  the unwed without children. The difficult conditions of the time  also motivated the peasants to have more children, because large  families made it easier to complete the work demanded by the  manor as well as the tasks for one's own farmstead.    Third, we can mention another significant factor  contributing  to the high birthrate which is that at that time modern methods  of birth control were unknown. It is noteworthy that at this  time that the registered number of abortions significantly  exceeds the number of live births. As an example, in 1990 there  were 37,900 births and 45,100 abortions. This condition persists  to this day. At the same time, we are first in the world with  our divorce rate, because nearly every other marriage ends up in  divorce.    The next destructive shock that Latvians experienced was the  first World War. The War, the fleeing of refugees and the fight  for independence resulted in a loss of more than 700,000  inhabitants. The psyche of the people, however, was not  traumatized. By 1935, when the Latvian government began to be  concerned with the demographic state of the country, Latvia's  birthrate began to recover. In the inter war period one could  encounter not a small number of large families (ref. to the  picture of President Cakste's large family [photo not  reproduced]) -- among farmers, workers and intellectuals.    It must also be noted that at this time that there were few  abortions and divorces. For example, in 1937 statistics show  1,300 divorces and 4,100 registered abortions or about one tenth  the current number of abortions and one eighth the number of  abortions.    Following 20 years of peaceful development terrible  destruction was wreaked by World War II when Latvia lost more  than half a million inhabitants. As a result of both world wars  Latvia lost more than 1.2 million inhabitants as a direct result  of the wars, through migration of refugees, losses in the fight  for independence, and deportations. No European smaller country  has experienced a comparable loss. This left a negative impact  on the psyche of the nation, but still did not destroy the will  of the country and following the war the birthrate grew at a  satisfactory rate which is evidenced by Table 2.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 2. Births, Deaths, and Natural Population Growth in Latvia per 1,000 |  |Inhabitants                                                                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Year              |Births            |Deaths            |Natural Growth    |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1939              |18.5              |13.9              |4.6               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1950              |17.0              |12.4              |4.6               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1970              |14.5              |11.2              |3.3               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1980              |14.0              |12.7              |1.3               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1990              |14.1              |13.0              |1.1               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1991              |12.9              |13.0              |-0.1              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      Table 2 shows that births and natural population growth fell  rapidly in the Postwar period, and that starting in 1991, until  the current moment, growth has been negative, that is more  inhabitants are dying than are being born.    Latvia's native people are in a particularly critical  situation, because beginning with 1991 they are on the gloomy  path of national extinction (see Table 3).    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 3. Latvian Ethnic Population Growth                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Year                                  |Natural Growth (Number of People)     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1990                                  |+1546                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1991                                  |-310                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1992                                  |-584                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Statistical information also shows, that during the past 45  years that the number of immigrants has exceeded the number of  emigrants by 470,000. Since the immigrants tend to be younger  people, then in Riga's public schools in 1992/3 there were  63,800 students studying in Russian and only 30,900 studying in  Latvian. In this same period (in the beginning of 1993) there  were 138 pre-schools for Russian speakers and 60 for Latvian  speakers.    According to information of the State Statistical Committee  (Table 4), Latvians are an ethnic minority in the largest cities  of Latvia.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 4.

To  halt this process the Latvian People's Self-help Foundation is  being established to stimulate broad and far reaching measures  throughout the territory of Latvia. This is a not-for-profit,  public welfare foundation whose mission is fight for the ethnic  survival of the Latvian people. First, the Foundation, based on  experience from prior years, is to provide moral support to  families and to encourage young people to marry and to establish  stable families. It is proposed to involve existing social  welfare and women's organizations, medical workers, and other  social organizations and representatives of the intelligencia,  especially of pensioners. It is also proposed to invite  established religious organizations to participate in this  important undertaking. The Foundation is expecting to wage an  unwavering battle against alcoholism, smoking, drug addiction  and other immoral behavior.    Secondly, families, particularly those with more children,  need material support. In Western countries, as we know, this is  seen as a social norm. We can only hope that this will also  happen in our country. The Foundation is also expected to  provide support to those who are experiencing economic  difficulties. It is expected that the Foundation will seek  donations of money, clothes, shoes, and food.    Thirdly, artificial birth control, primarily abortions, are  a  complex and difficult to solve problems under present  circumstances, but we expect to work in this direction as well.  I must mention that in 1991, when the Council of Ministers was  still in power, that I submitted a proposal to at least  establish a price limit for abortion operations, to which I  received only a form letter as a response.    During my lectures at the Latvian World Science Congress I  touched on the abortion problem. Foreign scientists were  surprised at the large number of abortions. After my lecture we  discussed this problem with a consensus that without government  support it will be very difficult to achieve visible results.    The Latvian People's Self-help Foundation's primary mission  is to wage an energetic fight, using all legitimate means, to  increase the natural growth rate of the population, and to  provide the family, as the primary institution of society, with  material support. I invite other social and political  organizations, as well as individuals, to participate in the  formation of the Latvian People's Self-help Foundation.</p>

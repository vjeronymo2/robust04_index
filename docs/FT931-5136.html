			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / City 'did not fall' ANGOLAN government sources yesterday denied a claim by the rebel movement Unita to have captured the key central city of Huambo, Reuter reports from Luanda. 'The fighting is continuing,' said one source who denied Unita's claim to have captured the provincial governor's palace, the last main redoubt of government troops in Huambo, on Saturday. Other officials said Unita had made several previous claims to complete victory in Huambo, the main focus of renewed fighting between government and Unita forces over the past two months. The official news agency Angop carried an armed forces statement on Saturday night which said intense fighting was continuing in the city of half a million people. But this was issued three hours before Vorgan, the rebel radio station, said Unita forces controlled Huambo.</p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Gen Rose to visit besieged enclave UN Bosnia commander General Sir Michael Rose is to travel to the UN 'safe haven' around Gorazde in eastern Bosnia today after rebel Bosnian Serbs closed in on the Moslem enclave following a week-long assault in which more than 50 people have died. Gen Rose will be the first high-level western official to visit the enclave since fighting began two years ago. The UN will also send additional military observers immediately to the besieged city and 1,000 Ukrainian peacekeeping troops within the next week or so. Yesterday however, despite Serb artillery and tank columns advancing 10km within the enclave, the US refused to sanction use of Nato air power against the Serbs, at least for the time being. UN special representative Mr Yasushi Akashi also plans to travel today to Pale, the Bosnian Serb stronghold, to emphasise the UN's alarm at recent attacks by Serb forces and its intention to hold Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, directly responsible. The French charity Medecins sans Frontieres said Serb forces had broken through Moslem lines and were 3.5km from the town.</p>

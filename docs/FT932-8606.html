			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: Sales hit at Swiss arms group OERLIKON Buhrle, the Swiss armaments, engineering and retailing group, said sales and orders in the first four months of 1993 were sharply lower than in the same period of last year. However, Mr Hans Widmer, chairman, forecast that net income this year would be higher than the SFr37m (Dollars 25.3m) recorded last year, as cost-cutting continued. Oerlikon, which has been subjected by new management to restructuring after six consecutive years of losses up to 1991, said orders in the first four months were 17 per cent lower and sales were 10 per cent lower. The declines were mainly due to delays in incoming orders at its Pilatus light aircraft subsidiary and its Contraves armaments unit. A controversial SFr250m order from the South African government for 60 Pilatus trainer aircraft has been delayed because of fears the aeroplanes could be used for military purposes. Mr Widmer said the future of both Pilatus and Contraves was uncertain because of the possibility that the Swiss government would outlaw all weapons exports within the next two years. He said it was clear the group as a whole 'would be hurt' by such a development, but it could finance the contraction out of operating earnings. Pilatus was hoping to secure its future with the development of a light business model, the PC-12, and by taking over the business of Piper, the bankrupt US aircraft maker. Mr Ernst Thomke, chairman of Pilatus, said the certification of the PC-12, expected for this summer, had been delayed because tests showed a need to strengthen its wings. Mr Beat Baumgartner, Oerlikon finance director, said no dividend could be paid in the current year again because of a SFr67m deficit in the parent company. The group aimed to eliminate the deficit by the end of 1994. Landis &amp; Gyr, the electrical engineering group, said its sales fell 4.6 per cent to SFr1.4bn in the six months to March. New orders were off 1.2 per cent to SFr1.5bn. The group, controlled by Mr Stephan Schmidheiny, expects net income for its year ending in September 30, 1993, to be about the same as last year's SFr78.4m, mainly as a result of cost-cutting.</p>

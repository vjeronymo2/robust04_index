			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Support grows for fishing treaty There is 'overwhelming' support among governments for a binding international treaty to preserve the world's fish stocks, the chairman of a United Nations conference said yesterday. But the failure of the two-week meeting to reach consensus was sharply criticised by environmentalists. Greenpeace called draft proposals generated by the meeting 'too little too late'. The conference comes after a year of fierce international clashes over disputed fishing rights and fishing methods in nearly every ocean. Improved technology helped the annual catch of fish to rise fivefold between 1950 and 1989 to 91m tonnes, UN figures indicate. But countries worldwide report that catch sizes now appear to be falling because of depleted stocks. The draft text issued yesterday from the conference on 'straddling and highly migratory fish stocks' asks countries 'to conserve and sustainably manage fish stocks'. It recommends creation of regional organisations to set limits on the size of national catches, and a compulsory arbitration procedure to resolve disputes. Most conflicts have flared over fish that travel through the high seas rather than national waters. Migratory fish such as tuna travel thousands of kilometres, while 'straddling' fish, such as cod, herring and some squid, travel back and forth from coastal waters into international zones. Controversy at the meeting has centred on compliance and enforcement, with Japan, North Korea and Russia expressing most unease. But Mr Satya Nandan, Fiji ambassador to the UN and conference chairman, said the required backing of two-thirds of delegates 'is achievable' as 'the overwhelming majority want a binding solution'. UN officials said although the meeting had not reached consensus, considerable progress had been made since the last session in March, when governments had clashed over much of the draft text. Delegates were hopeful yesterday that the next session in March could agree on a binding treaty.</p>

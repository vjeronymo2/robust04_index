			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / UK Company News: US growth lifts Elan Third quarter profits of Elan Corporation, the Irish health care products group, improved from IPounds 3.06m to IPounds 5.17m (Pounds 5.38m) pre-tax. For the nine months to December 31, profits rose from IPounds 8.58m to IPounds 14.15m. Mr Donald E Panoz, chairman, said the growth could be attributed to the success of Cardizem CD in the US market. Although sales by Lederle of Prostep declined significantly in the US, that was partly offset by increased sales of the nicotine patch in international markets. Turnover improved from IPounds 14.9m to IPounds 23.4m. Earnings per share rose to 0.15p (0.1p).</p>

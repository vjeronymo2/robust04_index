			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Huang Mei-ping; from the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] Bilateral talks between the ROC [Republic of China]  and the United States on the former's admission to GATT have  begun. According to the U.S. assistant trade representative who  serves as the chief U.S. negotiator, the task force on our  country's admission to GATT will soon enter the stage of  substantive discussions. The United States is willing to  coordinate its actions and assist our country in joining GATT,  and in becoming a member of other world trade bodies. It is  hoped that during the current talks, the two sides will make  substantial progress in reducing tariffs and in opening up the  agricultural and service markets. Speaking after the talks,  Vice Economic Minister Hsu K'e-sheng, who is our chief  negotiator, said: Of the more than 2,700 products in which the  United States expressed an interest, our side promised to adjust  the tariff rates for 253 farm products and 2,093 industrial  goods, but the U.S. side was not satisfied. It also did not  accept our country's request that talks on initial negotiation  rights be held only after the conclusion of talks on tariffs and  the finalization of the tariff reduction scheme. The two sides  decided to hold more discussions on tariff reductions on 26  February. The U.S. side, however, accepted our request that  tariff reductions in preparation for our admission to GATT be  introduced in a single move so that the cow would not be skinned  twice. He said:    [Begin recording Hsu K'e-sheng] Other than the 2,700 tariff  items that are of interest to them, we did not respond to their  demands that we set the overall level of our tariff rates and  specify the goods to which the U.S. side can claim initial  negotiation rights. The U.S. side thought this would make  piecemeal discussions with us impossible. [end recording]    During the talks, our side also said: After joining GATT,  our country agrees to import food grains and to allow the  gradual import of some farm products based on tariffication and  tariff quotas in accordance with the results of the Uruguay  Round of trade talks. The U.S. side, however, emphasized that  tariffcation measures are inappropriate for our country, which  is not currently a GATT member. As for the opening of the rice  market, our side expressed the hope that it be allowed to adopt  the South Korean model, but the U.S. side did not offer an  immediate response. According to the agenda for the second day  of talks, the two sides will continue discussions on opening up  the service market and on our country's participation in signing  the Tokyo Round agreements.</p>

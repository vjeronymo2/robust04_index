			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S.-GREEK TALKS ON BASES END WITH 'LITTLE PROGRESS'  </P> <P> Greek and U.S. negotiators ended their 16th round of talks on the future of  American military bases in Greece with "little progress toward a new accord," a  government spokesman said Friday.  </P> <P> The negotiators, who began the most recent round of talks Monday, are trying to  reach a comprehensive defense and economic cooperation pact that would  determine the future of four major U.S. military bases and 20 smaller  installations.  </P> <P> Greek government spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos said the two sides "examined the  preamble and various aspects of a possible agreement, but there was no notable  progress."  </P> <P> A five-year accord on the bases expired in December, and the United States has  a 17-month grace period before the military facilities would have to be  dismantled.  </P> <P> Kostopoulos said talks will resume next month but will be "temporarily  suspended" in June because of general elections in Greece.  </P></p>

			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Naples political chiefs face probe: Former Italian PM Andreotti investigated for alleged Mafia links FIVE political bosses in Naples were warned yesterday that they were under investigation for alleged association with the city's organised crime families, the Camorra. This follows the move by Palermo magistrates over the weekend advising Mr Giulio Andreotti, the veteran Christian Democrat politician who has served seven times as prime minister, that he is under investigation for allegedly consorting with the Sicilian Mafia. These latest moves confirmed that the shadowy links between the Mafia and political establishment have become a central issue in Italy's corruption scandals. Mr Andreotti, 74, and now a life senator, is the most senior political figure to have received such a warning. In a cool manner, he released the news and proceeded to defend himself vigorously. Parliament has been sent a dossier concerning Mr Andreotti running to more than 200 pages, and this will form the basis of whether his parliamentary immunity will be waived. As Italy's postwar political establishment has been incapacitated by over a year's investigations into corruption in the north of the country, the politicians' long-suspected links with organised crime in the south have scarcely been touched. Naples magistrates have begun to act after years of inactivity or investigations which were deliberately buried. Within the past 48 hours, 18 members of parliament and Euro-MPs have been warned they are under investigation for alleged corruption and half the city council has been arrested. All the Naples political bosses have been caught in the net and the magistrates are now following even more potentially explosive leads of their alleged links with the local Mafia. Those served notice yesterday are already involved in investigations for corruption. The most notable are two former Christian Democrat ministers - Mr Antonio Gava and Mr Paolo Cirino Pomicino. Last night Mr Gava, a former interior minister, resigned as leader of the Christian Democrat group in the senate and his seat on the joint parliamentary commission for constitutional reform. He and Mr Pomicino, a former finance minister, denied Mafia involvement. According to Palermo magistrates, they wish to question Mr Andreotti over his connections with Mr Salvatore Lima, the Christian Democrat Euro-MP assassinated by the Mafia last March. Mr Lima, the most powerful politician in Sicily, was a close friend of Mr Andreotti and considered to have acted as an intermediary with Rome. Investigations into Mr Lima's death and the subsequent assassination of the two leading anti-Mafia magistrates, Mr Giovanni Falcone and Mr Paolo Borsellino, lie behind the magistrates' move against Mr Andreotti. His alleged mediation with the Mafia has been referred to by at least three and perhaps six former members of Sicilian clans which are co-operating under special plea bargaining programmes. Mr Andreotti claimed these confessions were part of a vendetta for having initiated a drive against organised crime.</p>

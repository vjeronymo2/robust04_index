			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 3 (YONHAP) -- The European Union is  poised to stop granting Generalized System of Preference (GSP)  status to such South Korean products as consumer electronics,  cars, semiconductors and footwear, indicating the union no  longer sees Korea as a developing country.    According to a report released by the Korea Trade Promotion  Corp. (KOTRA) Tuesday, the European Association of Consumer  Electronics Manufacturers (EACEM) has demanded that the EU  commission withdraw the GSP status of South Korea, Singapore,  Taiwan and Hong Kong. The group insists that GSP treatment,  intended to promote economic progress in developing countries,  actually benefits only a few advanced developing nations.    In a report titled "The effect of GSP on the European  consumer electronics and lightning apparatus industries," the  EACEM argued that GSP treatment only enables the advanced  developing countries to further penetrate the European market,  KOTRA said.    In compliance with the demands of the EACEM and other  industry members, the EU commission is likely to withdraw  special treatment for consumer electronics from South Korea and  other advanced developing countries beginning July 1 when the  commission announces its GSP policy for 1994, according to the  KOTRA report.    Meanwhile, the European Association of Automobile  Manufacturers (ACEA), the European Electronic Component  Manufacturers' Association (EECA) and the European footwear  industry have joined forces with the EACEM in demanding the  suspension of GSP status for goods from South Korea and other  advanced East Asian Countries -- in the form of complaints filed  with the EU commission over the past months.    KOTRA sources believe the EU's move foreshadows a formal  decision to suspend special treatment for cars, semiconductors  and footwear from East Asian countries.    Officials from KOTRA expect that the new EU policy on GSP  effective July 1 will include suspension of GSP status for such  key South Korean exports as textile products, autos,  semiconductors and footwear.    They noted that the associations of various industries,  which  asked the EU commission to drop GSP treatment for products from  advanced developing countries including South Korea, represent  each industry and are influential enough in Europe to sway  public opinion.    Moreover, Europeans no longer consider South Korea to be a  developing country, they added.</p>

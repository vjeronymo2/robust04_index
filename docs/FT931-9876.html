			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Soft approach keeps toilet paper ads rolling - Andrex's plans to take its puppy campaign to the Continent In 1942, Andrex Surgical Toilet Wadding established a set of brand values which, in 50 years, have hardly changed. Today it is difficult to imagine any consumer goods company running advertising with the same blatant snob-price appeal; yet premium pricing remains the foundation of Andrex's extraordinary success. That success was demonstrated recently by market research which puts Andrex into fourth place in the league table of UK brands sold through grocers. On an advertising spend of Pounds 13m, according to Nielsen research data, Andrex sold Pounds 193m in 1992, moving ahead of Nestle's coffee brand, Nescafe (Pounds 177.8m). Only Unilever's soap powder, Persil (Pounds 237.2m), Coca-Cola (Pounds 237m) and Procter &amp; Gamble's soap powder, Ariel (Pounds 224.4m), did better. On other score sheets Andrex's showing is even more impressive; according to the trade magazine Marketing, its Pounds 5.7m television advertising campaign achieved a higher prompted recall than any other brand, leaving the much-hyped Nescafe Gold Blend advertising, featuring the drawn-out saga of a couple whose on-off relationship is conducted over coffee beans, in only fifth place. The fast-food chain McDonald's spent almost three times that sum on its television advertising in 1992, but languished 19 places behind Andrex in Marketing's prompted recall chart. Andrex's up-market strategy was evident from its first campaign, with press advertising which subtly probed the consumer psyche: 'You buy powder and good soap, of course, but are they everything? What do you use in your toilet? Is it as safe and as pure as it should be? Are you paying enough for it?' Customers probably were; at the time of its launch Andrex was sold only in Harrods. In the meantime Andrex, now owned by Scott Paper, has become a classic example of a brand which has successfully managed to charge substantially more - a price premium of up to 40 per cent above the market average - and yet dominate on what should be a thoroughly commoditised and price-only battlefield. Andrex currently has about 34 per cent (by value) of the UK toilet tissue market, the next major brand being Kleenex, owned by Kimberly-Clark, with 12.6 per cent (ranked 26 in Nielsen's top 100 brands). The questions now are how far it can sustain its position in the UK - especially given the rise of own-label brands right across the spectrum of consumer products - and how far Scott can penetrate the continental European market. Kleenex, for one, is investing Dollars 200m in what is claimed to be Europe's biggest toilet tissue mill, in France, aiming at taking the European toilet tissue market by storm this decade. It took a step in that direction one year ago, by introducing common European packaging for the entire Kleenex toilet tissue range. In the UK, though, Andrex faces its major marketing battle not against Kleenex but against own-label products, with a 39.7 per cent market share, again by value. In volume terms own-label products have a 41.2 per cent share, against Andrex's 29.2 per cent and Kleenex's 11.6 per cent. Premium price toilet tissue accounts for 61.6 per cent of the UK market, giving Andrex, a premium product, plenty of scope for eating into the own-label threat. Andrex is a UK-only brand so far; Scott markets toilet tissue under other brand names, Scottex and Cotonell, in the rest of Europe. But Scott intends following up the astonishing popularity of its UK television advertising campaign - featuring a Labrador puppy which entangles itself in toilet tissue - by extending the same campaign into the rest of Europe. The puppy has been with Andrex since 1972 and, like many successful advertising images, was a matter of chance. Andrex's advertising agency, J Walter Thompson, had originally thought of using a little girl to muddle up a toilet roll; but the Independent Television Commission, the UK body which monitors television advertising, ruled against the idea on the grounds that it might be seen as encouraging children to waste paper. JWT has been Andrex's advertising agency since 1956, which itself is something of an achievement given that client-agency relationships tend to be stormy affairs. The puppy was thus substituted, with the idea of demonstrating what Andrex claims as its key attributes - softness, length and strength. At least one own-label premium toilet tissue in the UK - Tesco's - has thought Andrex's original slogan - 'soft, long and strong' - good enough to be worth adopting on its own product. At the end of January this year JWT Europe got the go-ahead from Scott to set the puppy running across west Europe's TV screens. It is now being used in Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Italy and Germany. Andrex's marketing manager, Paul Duncanson, is fond of the puppy: 'I cannot overestimate the contribution that little animal has made.' He has every reason to be proud; since the puppy first appeared, Andrex's volume share of the UK toilet tissue market has risen from 5 per cent to its current dominance. But Scott faces a tricky problem in its effort to repeat across Europe its UK branding success with Andrex. In France, for example, the biggest brand, Lotus, has a volume share of less than 16 per cent and sells at a price premium of only 19 per cent above the market average. In Germany - the largest European toilet tissue market accounting for about a quarter of EC volumes - the biggest brand is Bess, with a national volume share of only 11 per cent. But the own-label sector has 67 per cent of the market, and has recently witnessed a price war. Scott and JWT will be hoping that their old dog will be able to come up with a few new tricks to please potential continental customers.</p>

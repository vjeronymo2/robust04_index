			<p>BFN     [Text] Almaty, April 27 (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng's visit  to Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan marks the  beginning of a new era in China's relationship with Central  Asian nations.    Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Dai Bingguo, who has been  traveling with the premier, made the remark in an interview here  today, the last day of Li's 10-day tour of Central Asia.    Li's trip is a complete success with fruitful results that  will generate far-reaching impact, said Dai.    In their talks, Premier Li had reached full agreement with  leaders of the four countries on ways of furthering bilateral  ties, and on regional and international issues of common  concern, according to Dai.    "The visit has achieved the desired objective of enhancing  mutual understanding, promoting friendship and expanding  mutually- beneficial cooperation," he said.    Dai said the principles Li stated during the tour on  developing political as well as economic relations with the  Central Asian nations are "a long-term policy."    As time goes by, these principles will show its increasing  vitalities, Dai said, calling the prospect "inspiring" for  cooperation with Central Asia in both political and economic  fields.    Referring to the signing of the Sino-Kazakh border agreement  and the common wish expressed by China and Kyrgyzstan to solve  the border issue at an early date, Dai said Li's tour served to  further improve China's "environment in the neighborhood."    "We hope to see an early successful settlement of the border  issue with all the neighboring countries to the north, and turn  our common boundary into a bond of lasting peace and  friendship," he said.    After the tour of the four former Soviet republics, Li will  continue his trip to Mongolia for a two-day official visit that  will end on April 29.</p>

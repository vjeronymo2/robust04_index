			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (9): A healthier atmosphere for supplier and customer - US gas prices harden after five year trough THE gloom is finally starting to lift from the US natural gas industry thanks to rising gas prices, after five years when it seemed that they would never recover. Hurricane Andrew can take some of the credit for the reversal of ill fortune. When the hurricane swept through the Gulf of Mexico in August, not only did demand for gas rise sharply, but it also knocked out a fair amount of production which helped fuel a further spike in gas prices. By September, the gas futures contract had hit a peak of Dollars 2.74 per million British thermal units (Btu), compared with prices as low as Dollars 1.05 per million Btu earlier this year. But prices had started to creep higher months before the hurricane hit. Gas delivered to Henry Hubb, Louisiana, - a major pipeline interchange point - had an average price of Dollars 1.21 per million Btu in February. By May, the average price was up to Dollars 1.59 per million Btu rising to Dollars 1.75 per million Btu in July before soaring to Dollars 2.33 per million Btu in September. Ironically, part of the reason for the underlying price improvement lies in the high storage levels at the end of last year's very mild winter. Shortly after the stored gas was dumped on the market at very low prices, demand for gas shot up thanks to unusually cool weather in March and April. According to Mr Thomas Driscoll, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, storage actually fell below target levels, pushing prices higher as the storage was refilled later in the summer. When the hurricane struck, market supply was already tight and storage was still below target levels. Barring an extraordinarily warm winter, analysts expect prices to hold at higher levels, albeit below their September peaks. The improved prices bode well for the industry's short-term outlook, but may do little to alleviate the industry's fundamental problems. 'The balance of supply and demand in the gas industry is a comedy of errors,' say Mr Driscoll. 'Right now it just happens to be in good shape.' Mr Driscoll is one of many observers who believes the erratic fortunes of the US gas industry are 'the legacy of congressional meddling and what that has meant for prices and demand'. De-regulation of the US gas industry, which started in the early 1980s, fostered conditions conducive to cost undercutting. The creation of an open access transportation system prompted competition among interstate pipelines, while the monthly bidding process for 30-day spot natural gas supplies contributed to volatile prices. Producers exacerbated the pricing problem by trying to bolster sales volumes to counter the damage of plummeting prices. Compounding the industry's troubles was legislation dating to the 1970s which prohibited the use of gas for fuel in new industrial plants and electrical power plants. The move was designed to preserve what was perceived as a rapidly depleting resource. Largely as a result, natural gas has never challenged coal as US industry's main fuel. The biggest use of gas is in the residential market - making up about half of all energy consumed in US homes. Although industrial demand for gas is expected to rise, now that the ban has been lifted, it is unlikely to change the face of the gas industry. In addition, a tax credit introduced by Congress in 1980 to stimulate drilling in difficult areas has dampened prices by allowing the government to subsidise a large portion of gas production. The Section 29 tax credits, enacted at a time when conventional wisdom expected the world to run out of energy, is now being phased out. The credit will only apply to drilling that starts by December 21, although the output from that drilling will continue to be subsidised through 2002. Given that about half of all wells drilling today are drilling for Section 29 gas, analysts expect production to fall sharply, unless the credit is extended, which should help support higher gas prices. The gas industry also hopes to benefit from the 1990 Clean Air Act, under which US cities with the worst air pollution must take alternative fuel measures in the next decade. Demand for natural gas as a cleaner burning fuel in vehicles is expected to rise as a result. In addition, electric utilities will probably turn to natural gas to meet the acid rain provision of the Act. According to Mr Driscoll, the Clean Air Act is starting to have an impact on the gas industry, but it is unlikely to improve conditions dramatically. 'If you look at all the natural gas vehicles and all the power plants that will have to reduce emissions, it still won't affect today's performance. If you look at the numbers, there's still not a lot of demand for gas.' It is estimated that prices would have to climb to a range of Dollars 2.50 to Dollars 3 per million Btu to stimulate a significant increase in drilling and exploration. Largely as a result of the low prices, weak demand and environmental pressures, most of the big US gas producers have turned their attention away from the US and are concentrating on drilling overseas. Independent producers, however, are still focused on the US and are starting to buy the assets being sold by the major companies, which will leave the US somewhat more dependent on independent gas producers in years to come. 'The gas industry is now changing rapidly on the production side,' says Mr Driscoll. 'At this point, the major producers have decided to move overseas and the ability of the gas industry to drill is quickly declining. I think it will take a long time to turn that around. The government does very little to help the industry and in many ways is driving the industry out of the US.'</p>

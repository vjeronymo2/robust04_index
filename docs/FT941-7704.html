			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Butter price European farm ministers have dismissed plans for an extra 3 per cent cut in the butter price for 1994-95 and further curbs on beef aid, saying they would inflict more hardship on farmers, Reuter reports from Brussels. France, together with Spain and other southern member states, also criticised the Commission's delay in proposing wine, sugar, fruit and vegetable reforms. Mr Rene Steichen, the farm commissioner, said he was 'dumbstruck' by ministers' demands for more aid when the budget was already stretched beyond the limit.</p>

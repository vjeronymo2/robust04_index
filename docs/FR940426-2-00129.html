			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Those commenters opposed to this requirement contended that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is burdensome and unnecessary, while those in favor argued that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it forces systems to review routes on a regular basis, giving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> private operators an opportunity to make their case.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One transit system commenter noted that the requirement was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``oddly redundant'' since all of its service already was provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the private sector, and noted that it was a burden because of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the inordinate amount of staff time required to complete the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> task. A Senator stated that the agency's proposed action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``wisely reduces burdensome paper work and other restrictive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, while retaining options of private enterprise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A large transit system stated that the current requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entail a significant administrative burden for many transit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies with large and complex route structures, necessitating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the diversion of significant resources to conducting reviews on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a three-year cycle. Another transit operator stated that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement places an inordinate planning burden on it, without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any corresponding benefits. Rather than such a mandated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach, this operator supported route analysis based on local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needs and considerations and noted that it carries on an ongoing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis of service levels required to meet demand.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters supporting this requirement, in contrast, contended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that contracting out has saved significant sums and that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three-year review period is necessary to realize these savings,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as well as for the agency to satisfy the private enterprise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions in the statute. One commenter stated that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three-year review helps to ensure efficiency and effectiveness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the delivery of transit services. Competition, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter noted, requires periodic review of results. Whatever  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FTA's view on three-year reviews of routes, this commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continued, the claim that they are burdensome is without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foundation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Appeal Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The private sector circulars provide that both recipients and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MPOs should develop a process for the resolution of disputes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with private operators, with an appeal to FTA available to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> private operators if they fail to resolve disputes at the local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level. In the Notice, FTA indicated that since it would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducting regular reviews of grantee compliance with planning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, a formal appeal process leading to FTA did not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appear necessary, although the agency is always available to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive reports of planning process failures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This aspect of the Notice did not generate much specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment, but appeared to be included in the general opposition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to ``burdensome'' requirements on the part of some commenters, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the other hand, to be one of the elements that those in favor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the existing guidance support.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter noted that, in response to a Freedom of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Information Act (FOIA) request, it was provided with FTA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> private sector complaint decisions: of the twelve complaints,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eight were dismissed for failure to state a cognizable claim;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two were remanded for failure to have a local dispute process;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and two included findings of violations with no penalties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposed. This record, the commenter argued, underscores the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lack of burden created by the FTA appellate process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. FTA Response To Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Procedural and Legal Adequacy of the Notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Procedural Objections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters objected to the Notice as failing to meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the rulemaking requirement of section 12(i)(3) of the FT Act:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``The Secretary shall propose or implement rules governing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities under this Act only in accordance with this section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> except for routine matters and matters having no significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact.'' They pointed out that in the Notice, FTA acknowledged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the proposed recision of its private enterprise guidance is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``a relatively significant change''; consequently, they argued,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the section 12(i)(3) rulemaking requirement applies to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proceeding. Section 12 defines a ``rule'' as a ``statement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general or particular applicability designed to implement,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpret, or prescribe law or policy in carrying out provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this Act'' and requires the following procedures: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (i) Rulemaking procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary shall provide an agenda listing all areas in which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary intends to propose rules governing activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under this chapter within the following twelve-month period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary shall publish the proposed agenda in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  as part of the Secretary's semi-annual rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agenda which lists rulemaking activities of (FTA). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary shall also transmit the Agenda required by the first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sentence of this paragraph to [various committees] on the day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the Secretary's semi-annual rulemaking agenda is published  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Views.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Except for emergency rules, the Secretary shall give interested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parties not less than sixty days to participate in any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking under this chapter through submission of written  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data, views, arguments with or without the opportunity for oral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presentation, except when the Secretary for good cause finds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that public notice and comment are unnecessary due to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> routine nature or matter or insignificant impact of the rule, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that an emergency rule should be promulgated. The Secretary may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extend the 60-day period if the Secretary determines that such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period is insufficient for diligent persons to prepare comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or that other circumstances justify an extension of time. An  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergency rule shall terminate 120 days after the date on which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it is promulgated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Limitation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Attainment of the Ozone NAAQS <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The submittal contains an analysis of ozone air quality data which is relevant to the maintenance plan and to the redesignation request for the entire Huntington-Ashland nonattainment area. Ambient ozone monitoring data for 1989 through 1991 show attainment of the ozone NAAQS in the Huntington, West Virginia area. Ambient ozone monitoring data for 1991 through 1993 show attainment of the ozone NAAQS for the entire Huntington-Ashland area. See 40 CFR 50.9 and appendix H. The State of West Virginia's request for redesignation included documentation that the entire area has complete quality assured data showing attainment of the standard over the most recent consecutive three calendar year period. Therefore the area has met the first statutory criterion of attainment of the ozone NAAQS. West Virginia has also met the second statutory criterion by committing to continue monitoring the moderate nonattainment area in accordance with the Act's requirements as prescribed in 40 CFR part 58.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Meeting Applicable Requirements of Section 110 and Part D <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As previously stated, EPA fully approved the State of West Virginia SIP for the Huntington, West Virginia area as meeting the requirements of section 110(a)(2) and part D of the 1977 Act. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, however, modified section 110(a)(2) and, under part D, revised section 172 and added new requirements for all nonattainment areas. Therefore, for purposes of redesignation, EPA has reviewed the SIP and determined that it contains all measures that were due under the Act prior to November 12, 1992, the date the State of West Virginia submitted its redesignation request satisfying the completeness criteria of 40 CFR part 51 appendix V. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.A. Section 110 Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although Section 110 of the 1977 Act was amended in 1990, the Huntington, West Virginia SIP meets the requirements of section 110(a)(2) of the amended Act. A number of the requirements did not change in substance and, therefore, EPA believes that the pre-amendment SIP met these requirements. As to those requirements that were amended, See 57 FR 27936 and 23939 (June 23, 1993), many are duplicative of other requirements of the Act. EPA has analyzed the SIP and determined that it is consistent with the requirements of amended section 110(a)(2) of the Act. The SIP contains enforceable emission limitations adequate to produce attainment, requires monitoring, compiling, and analyzing ambient air quality data. It provides for adequate funding, staff, and associated resources necessary to implement SIP requirements, and requires stationary source emissions monitoring and reporting. Once the redesignation to attainment is approved, the Act requires that provisions for the prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) apply for the preconstruction review of new major stationary sources and major modifications to existing ones. EPA approved West Virginia's PSD program on April 11, 1986 (51 FR 12517) which, under the approved SIP, applies in all designated attainment areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.B. Part D Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.B.1. Subpart 1 of Part D_Section 172(c) Plan Provisions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 172(b), the section 172(c) requirements are applicable no later than three years after an area has been designated as nonattainment under the Act. EPA has determined that these requirements were not applicable to ozone nonattainment areas on or before November 12, 1992_the date the State of West Virginia submitted a complete redesignation request and maintenance plan for Huntington. West Virginia has, however, completed and submitted a 1993 base year emissions inventory for the Huntington ozone nonattainment area in accordance with EPA's guidance. The year 1993 was chosen as the base year to correspond with the base year being used by Kentucky for the Ashland portion of the area. The year 1993 is the base year from which emissions have been projected through the year 2005 in the maintenance plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.B.2. Subpart 1 of Part D_Section 176 Conformity Plan Provisions  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 176(c) of the Act requires States to revise their SIPs to establish criteria and procedures to ensure that Federal actions, before they are taken, conform to the air quality planning goals in the applicable State SIP. The requirement to determine conformity applies to transportation plans, programs and projects developed, funded or approved under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act (``transportation conformity''), as well as to all other Federal actions (``general conformity''). Section 176 further provides that the conformity revisions to be submitted by States must be consistent with Federal conformity regulations that the Act required EPA to promulgate. Congress provided for the State revisions to be submitted one year after the date for promulgation of final EPA conformity regulations. When that date passed without such promulgation, EPA's General Preamble for the Implementation of title I informed State that its conformity regulations would establish a submittal date (see 57 FR 13498, 13557 (April 16, 1992)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA promulgated final transportation conformity regulations on November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62188) and general conformity regulations on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63214). These conformity rules require that States adopt both transportation and general conformity provisions in the SIP for areas designated nonattainment or subject to a maintenance plan approved under CAA section 175A. Pursuant to &sect;51.396 of the transportation conformity rule and &sect;51.851 of the general conformity rule, the State of West Virginia is required to submit a SIP revision containing transportation conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established in the Federal rule November 25, 1994. Similarly, West Virginia is required to submit a SIP revision containing general conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established in the Federal rule by December 1, 1994. Because the deadlines for these submittals have not yet come due, they are not yet applicable requirements under section 107(d)(3)(E)(v) and, thus, do not affect approval of this redesignation request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

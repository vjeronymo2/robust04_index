			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: TUC withholds formal endorsement for Labour FOR THE first time in recent memory the general council of the Trades Union Congress has withheld its formal endorsement for the Labour party in the coming election. This is not because the unions have lost faith in the party they established at the beginning of the century. The unions have said nothing, and are taking virtually no part in Labour's national campaign, because they desperately want Labour to win. In past election years, the last TUC general council meeting before an election has put out a ringing statement urging members of TUC-affiliated unions to vote Labour. That is so unremarkable that it normally goes unreported. Yesterday's general council meeting made no statement on the election. Labour and the unions alike have concluded that their close political and financial ties are a presentational handicap to a party seeking to become a future government. It appears that one of the formal or informal gatherings that bring together senior union officials and Labour officials decided to ask for no formal endorsement. Even though the unions are paying for about 90 per cent of the Labour campaign and still hold 90 per cent of the votes at the Labour party conference, the Conservatives have so far failed to exploit the union-Labour link in the election campaign. That is partly because the relationship has genuinely changed. Labour has accepted most of Mrs Thatcher's union reforms, initially to the irritation of the unions. Mr Tony Blair, Labour's employment spokesman, has a more arm's-length relationship with union leaders than many of his predecessors. The union block vote is already being phased down and, whichever party wins the election, Labour's link with the unions is bound to become looser still. Nearly half of Labour's annual running costs are, significantly, now covered by non-union sources. In some ways it is an odd time for both sides of the union-Labour link to be acting so shyly about it. Trade unions in the UK are much less unpopular now that they have lost so much power. The Labour party has also won back a lot of the trade unionist support it lost in 1983 and 1987. Only 33 per cent of union members in 1983 and 42 per cent in 1987 followed the TUC appeal to vote Labour. This time about 55 per cent of union members are expected to vote Labour, and without even being asked to.</p>

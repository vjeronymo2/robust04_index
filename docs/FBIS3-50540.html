			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Havana, 1 Jan (EFE) -- Cuba today commemorates  the 35th anniversary of a revolution that placed Fidel Castro in  power; unleashed passions throughout the world, especially among  the Cubans, and is now going through its most dramatic moment in  its struggle to survive.    Usually, 1 January is not a day of mass demonstrations or a  day for official commemorations or speeches, because the Cubans  also take part in the worldwide 1 January hangover, although it  is true that the average family budget does not allow the  majority to get involved in any overindulging on New Year's Eve.    In its latest edition, the official daily GRANMA says, "We  have to look at 1994 with optimism, hope, and trust, because we  are already 35 and the revolution will prevail." It reports  that 1993 "will be remembered by millions of honorable and  patriotic Cubans who have known how to firmly resist the  onslaught of this difficult period." [passage omitted]</p>

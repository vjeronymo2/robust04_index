			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Backtracking on rail sale: Change of heart over privatisation plans British Rail's passengers do not want privatisation. Look at it this way, they argue. BR is terminally unprofitable. If it is privatised, it will have to start making money. There are really only two ways of achieving that: raising the fares, or axeing unprofitable services. Either way, rail users will suffer. It is not just BR's passengers who are concerned about privatisation. Communities fear for the future of their transport links. Car drivers want to keep people on the trains and off the roads. The environmental lobby presents public transport as a panacea for pollution. Nearly everyone agrees that railways are A Good Thing. That, in short, is why ministers have abandoned plans for a 'big bang' privatisation of BR. One recent opinion poll suggested that more than 80 per cent of voters see privatisation as a threat to rail services rather than a boon. With a general election looming, ideology has therefore had to take a back seat to pragmatism in the quest for a means of fulfilling the government's privatisation pledge. It all looked so different just four months ago. Then, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary, had the air of a man in a hurry. No part of the railway would be untouched by privatisation in the lifetime of the next parliament, he said. The profitable InterCity and Railfreight divisions would be swiftly sold off - in InterCity's case, complete with tracks. Services on the loss-making Network SouthEast and Regional Railway networks would be franchised to whoever would run them with the smallest subsidies. But the plans always seemed ambitious. Railfreight, which had good potential for making profits because it was unburdened by the cost and complexity of owning its own tracks, might conceivably have sold. But InterCity was far from making what the private sector would regard as a commercial return, and its most important route, the London Euston to Glasgow line, was badly in need of a Pounds 750m refurbishment. Franchising, too, presented a series of problems. In the absence of any domestic or international market for used trains, where would franchisees get their rolling stock? What would happen if a franchisee went bust? What sort of service would people get from a company serving out the last few months of a franchise that had not been renewed? Another feature of the Rifkind plan was on-track competition, at least for InterCity. But if InterCity owned the tracks, what was to stop it keeping competitors away by inflicting punitive charges for access? And if a regulatory body was set up to prevent this, would InterCity's signalmen simply shunt competitors' trains into the sidings while their own trains whistled by? As the difficulties mounted, rival plans began to emerge. Trade and industry ministers, influenced by the Adam Smith Institute, the right-wing think tank, said the only way to guarantee proper competition was to separate ownership of the tracks from the trains - in other words, making railways like roads or airports. Downing Street backed the ideas of the right-wing Centre for Policy Studies in seeking a return to the glory days of the regional companies like the Great Western Railway. History does not relate what the Treasury made of all this. In all probability, it was aghast. Proceeds from any form of privatisation would be tiny; many parts of the railway would have to be fattened up with heavy investment to make them saleable; and subsidies, far from falling, might need to rise to enable private sector operators to make a commercial return. Faced with the intractability of these objections, ministers have finally decided to do what BR chairman Sir Bob Reid said they should have done all along: take things slowly. First, private sector trains will be allowed on to the tracks. Next, BR's unprofitable train services will be franchised out and the profitable ones sold - possibly in groups, like the former Great Western services out of London Paddington. Finally, when all the trains are privately run, BR will end up as a track authority, perhaps to be sold off to the private sector as an asset-rich blue-chip stock. One attraction of this solution is that everybody seems to get something out of it. BR gets a stay of execution; trade and industry ministers get their track authority; Downing Street gets its Great Western Railway; and Mr Rifkind can argue that his only serious reverse has been the decision to split the sale of InterCity's trains and tracks. And what of the passengers? Inevitably, the package has been designed with the election in mind. Voters will be reassured with the message that privatisation - or denationalisation, as it is to be known - will bring the dawn of a new golden age for the railways. Whether they swallow it or not is another matter. But their two big concerns  -fare rises and service cuts - are likely to remain naggingly persistent. After all, if BR's services are sold to the private sector, then the government will relinquish control over fares and timetables. If it insists on retaining that control, then the private sector will not want to buy the services. No amount of repackaging will make that conundrum go away.</p>

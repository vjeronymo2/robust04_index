These changes are necessary to comply with Section 2384, Title XXIII, of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;624). This law is to establish and implement a program that is similar to the program established under Section 353 of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 2001), except that the debt restructuring and loan servicing procedures shall apply to delinquent Community Facility hospital or health care program loans rather than Farmer Program loans. The intended effect is to keep these facilities in operation with manageable debt. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  September 7, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Jennifer Barton, Loan Specialist, Community Facilities Division, Farmers Home Administration, Room 6314, South Agriculture Building, Washington, D.C. 20250, telephone:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (202) 720&hyph;1504. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Classification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This rule has been determined to be significant/economically significant and was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Environmental Impact Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This document has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1940, subpart G, ``Environmental Program.''

L. 101&hyph;624, amended the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act and requires the Secretary of Agriculture to develop a debt restructuring and loan servicing program for FmHA hospital or health care facility borrowers. This program is similar to the loan restructuring and servicing program in effect for delinquent Farmer Program loans. This rule amends current FmHA regulations to implement this program. The program is intended to facilitate the continued operation of rural hospitals and health care facilities by implementing all possible debt restructuring options available that will result in an economically viable facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given the congressional intent to provide rural hospitals and health care facilities a debt restructuring option similar to that provided Farmer Program borrowers, this regulation is modeled in a general sense on the Farmer Program restructuring scheme. Under this regulation, a hospital or health care debtor who is delinquent on its FmHA loan, and is unable to cure its delinquency through more traditional servicing methods, will be notified of the options available for debt restructuring. The debtor can apply for consideration by providing financial and operational information and proposing its own plan for curing the delinquency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to be eligible for consideration for debt restructuring, the debtor's delinquency must have been caused by factors outside the debtor's control. In addition, the debtor must have acted in good faith with regard to the FmHA loan. FmHA will make these determinations based on the debtor's representation and the Agency's review of other documents relevant to these preliminary matters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Once the debtor provides the financial and operational information required, FmHA will conduct a thorough analysis of the debtor's operations. This analysis will typically include contracting for an independent appraisal of the collateral securing the loan and contracting with an independent expert to prepare an ``operations review.'' This review will provide FmHA with information regarding the facility's operations, its financial standing, and suggest alternatives that could be implemented to address the delinquency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / World Trade News: White House takes softer line on Japan OFFICIALS in the Clinton administration yesterday promised that the US would not retaliate if Tokyo failed to meet numerical goals which the two sides negotiate to remedy trade imbalances. The softer tone from the US, which has often won trade agreements by retaliation or threats, was contained in a proposal on a trade negotiating framework, which will be discussed in Washington on Friday. The proposal was delivered to Japan's ambassador in the capital. Tokyo has insisted it will not be dragged into any agreement smacking of 'managed trade' which establishes numerical targets. Senior US officials still say it is necessary to monitor progress through a series of multiple indicators in order to get 'genuine objective gauges' of progress and to measure the need for 'a mid-course correction'. 'Clearly we are looking for results,' an official said. 'It is difficult to look for results in the abstract.' But there will be 'no retaliatory trigger contained in the proposal'. The US proposal calls for negotiations on a series of 'baskets' into which various trade disputes will be divided. It also wants to set a range for a reduction of Japan's current account surplus, something in the order of 2 per cent of GNP. In exchange for Japanese agreement the US would commit itself to following through on plans to halve the trade deficit over the next four years and keep US markets open. The latter is a substantial offer, considering the political pressure on the administration to act against Japan on a wide range of disputes. 'We hope we can move the relationship forward without the need for bluster and threats and retaliation and without the need for unprincipled gimmickry, like requests for the Japanese to limit their auto exports, of the kind the Europeans have engaged in recently,' one official said. In line with demands from Tokyo the US will propose a number of policies the Japanese government alone can undertake without requiring its private sector to meet specified goals. 'Our goal is to expand trade, not to manage trade,' an official said. However, Japan must recognise its economic relations are 'far from international norms' both in its high surplus and its low level of import penetration. 'We want to see significant progress in three to four years,' he added. Negotiations are expected to be completed swiftly, with the results announced at the Tokyo summit in July.</p>

			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Wandsworth row over opt-outs WANDSWORTH council, the Conservatives' flagship borough in south-west London, looks set to resist attempts by its remaining comprehensive schools to opt out of its control in order to avoid the reintroduction of selection. Mr Edward Lister, chairman of Wandsworth's education committee, said he was 'strenuously opposed' to the borough's secondary schools opting out as a way of remaining unreformed comprehensives. Although this was a personal view, he said he was 'confident' it would be the borough's response to any opt-out applications. Applications by schools for grant-maintained status do not require local-authority consent, but if applications were opposed by Wandsworth they would be embarrassing test cases of the government's commitment to opting-out. Education ministers have repeatedly claimed that opting-out is intended to foster freedom and responsibility for school governors, irrespective of arguments for and against selection. Apart from two church schools, only four comprehensives, one of which is to become a selective city technology college, remain under Wandsworth's direct control. Three other comprehensives have already opted out with the borough's blessing. Mr Lister, who is favourite to succeed Sir Paul Beresford as leader of the council, is determined that the council's three remaining comprehensives adopt subject or vocational specialisms along with tests and interviews to select pupils. Mr Lister said: 'We must oppose those three schools opting out of council control. It would not improve choice. But if those schools become selective and provide choice and variety then I will happily support grant-maintained status thereafter.' Governors at the three schools are currently considering making opt-out applications. Mr John O'Malley, chairman of governors at Chestnut Grove School, Balham, said he and others were 'upset and seriously concerned' at the council's plans. Classroom struggle, Page 6</p>

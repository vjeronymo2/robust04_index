			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with PRI presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo </F> Ponce de Leon by F. Orgambides in Mexico City; date not given:  "They Will Not Succeed in Destabilizing Us"]    [Text] Days ago, the Mexican press obtained a photo of  Ernesto Zedillo shining the shoes of a boy in Guadalajara. The  item formed part of the electoral campaign, but the aptitude  with which he wielded the brush showed that the candidate was  quite an expert in the profession. It happens that Ernesto  Zedillo, a doctor in economics from Yale University, did indeed  take to the streets as a shoeshine boy to help finance his  studies.    The interview with EL PAIS was held in Mexico City at the  headquarters of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), the  organization that has governed Mexico for the last 65 years. In  this building, there are still photos of the late-lamented Luis  Donaldo Colosio, most of them draped in black crepe.    Zedillo, despite the coldness of the surroundings, put our  interview on an informal plane, admitting his love for rock  music and revealing to me the many friends he has in Spain, from  the worlds of politics and business. Identified with President  Salinas de Gortari, the man who initiated the modernization of  Mexico, the PRI candidate at the elections of 21 August is very  sure he will win. He respects, although he is not yet worried  about, his most immediate rival, the already historical leader  of the opposition, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas.    [Orgambides] Many things have occurred in Mexico since  January: guerrilla warfare, kidnapping, and a crime shrouded in  mystery which led to the death of your friend Colosio...    [Zedillo] It is true that Mexico is experiencing  unprecedented events and that all have one thing in common: we  do not know who is behind them. We are very concerned by that,  but I am extremely confident that, as time passes, these things  will become more clear and, as a result, people will regain  confidence. Despite this, this concern has not prevented our  country from making progress.    [Orgambides] While each of these events pretends to be  different from the rest, it would appear that the objective is  the same in each case: to destabilize the government.    [Zedillo] I cannot say for certain that there is a  conspiracy, but many Mexicans have the feeling that someone is  trying to destabilize the country. Now, I can confirm that they  will not succeed in destabilizing us. Isolated events cannot  affect a country as strong as Mexico.    [Orgambides] You belong to the generation of change, the one  that started the transformation of Mexico. Will this continue  if you become president?    [Zedillo] The country, because of its problems and  circumstances, needs to continue with its transformation. I  have already said that my government will combine continuity in  certain areas with strength and renovation in others, and change  where required. We cannot use a single adjective to  characterize the political intentions of my future government.  What is clear is that we will place particular emphasis on  macroeconomic stability and we will strengthen our social policy  to make it more ambitious. I also plan to undertake major  reforms in the fields of justice and national security.    [Orgambides] Do you think that there is a degree of contrast  between a conceptually old party like the PRI and you, the  technocrats, who have faced up to the modernization of Mexico?    [Zedillo] The PRI has an enormous capacity for change and  one  of my internal messages was that the party should be seen as an  organization that is already fully competing with the other  political forces in the country. Times have changed since the  PRI dominated Mexican political life and could win without  making much of an effort. Now, as far as we are concerned, we  have to do it by sheer hard work, day by day, because Mexico is  more involved, more diverse, and more demanding.    [Orgambides] Do you mean that the reform the PRI needs will  come about in the short term?    [Zedillo] Reform must be a constant process. I am sure that,  given the way circumstances are changing, the PRI will be able  to renew itself to lead the way in the progress Mexico is making  on the democratic level.    [Orgambides] Now you, and before you Colosio, promised clean  elections. What are you going to do to ensure this?    [Zedillo] Many things. Firstly, we are encouraging our party  to establish a consensus for better election legislation.  Second, we have requested real action to be taken, such as the  external auditing of the electoral roll. We are working in  tandem with the rest of the parties to ensure that there no one  has any suspicions about the election officials. Mexico will  have an institutionalized electoral organization in which the  PRI will be one more voice, and an electoral roll comparable  with the best in the world. The Mexican voters, on the other  hand, will for the first time have to turn up to federal  elections with an identity document bearing their photograph.    [Orgambides] There is a problem of credibility in Mexico.  What would happen if you win the elections and a major section  of the population does not believe it?    [Zedillo] Credibility has to be built up in a progressive  way. We do not have to wait until 21 August to see for ourselves  what has already happened and I am sure we will win the majority  of the vote. I have publicly encouraged the media and  independent organizations to carry out opinion polls that, over  the coming months, will show the electoral preferences of the  Mexican people. As a result, on the day of the elections,  people will see that a lot of effort and the progressive  accumulation of preferences have worked in my favor.    [Orgambides] President Salinas has said many times that  Mexico has already changed its mentality, but we see that the  people lately have lost their illusions.    [Zedillo] We can make out distinct moments in our country's  recent history. With President Salinas, we have witnessed a  major process of national renewal that led to the reawakening of  hope in the Mexican people because the country's serious  economic problems have been resolved. Now Mexico is going  through a worrying time because of the violent events that have  occurred in the last four months and over which the government  has had no control. If one thing is really clear at the moment  it is that the people want social peace and Mexican unity. The  PRI can guarantee them that.    [Orgambides] They say that you, Salinas's men, paid so much  attention to macroeconomic issues that you forgot that there are  16 million people in Mexico living in extreme poverty.    [Zedillo] That is not true. Six years ago, the country's  most serious problem was the risk of hyperinflation. This would  have caused the contraction of the economy, the destruction of  work, and, above all, it would have had a very negative effect  on the poor. The first problem was how to eliminate our foreign  debt and thus the lack of control over public finances.  Salinas, when he promoted his policy of stabilization and  economic modernization, also set out an extremely ambitious  social policy. I know that for sure because, as the then-Plan  and Budget Secretary I had to balance the national budget and at  the same time increase by 100 percent social expenditure in real  terms.    [Orgambides] Are you afraid of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas?    [Zedillo] Absolutely not. I am very confident that I will  not only beat him but I will also beat all the other candidates.  Everyone aspiring to the presidency deserves my greatest  respect, but I sincerely believe that the majority of the  Mexican people will vote for me.    [Orgambides] What if they do not accept your victory?    [Zedillo] That is not my problem. The main thing is that the  election must be clean, every vote must count and count well.  The people will decide. In any case, I am confident that  Cardenas and the other candidates will respect the law.    [Orgambides] These days, Mexico is a trading partner of  Canada and the United States. Do you think that this new  relationship could entail some cultural damage?    [Zedillo] The reciprocal influences on the cultures of other  countries is an inherent phenomenon of communication. The North  American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will not make this  situation any worse. As Carlos Fuentes would say, it is the  North Americans who should be concerned by too great a Mexican  influence.    [Orgambides] In recent years, Spain and Mexico have enjoyed  excellent relations. What plans do you have in this respect  when you become president?    [Zedillo] Spain is a very special country for Mexico. The  Spanish and Mexican peoples identify greatly with one another.  The members of my generation are very gratified to see that our  foreign relations -- as well as extending into North America --  are drawing increasingly closer to Spain. Thus I propose, when  I am president, not just to ensure closer relations but also to  strengthen these ties.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] After three years of negotiations, Brazil has closed  its foreign debt agreement. The country will pay $51 billion  over 30 years, representing a 30 percent discount. A maneuver  by the Brazilian negotiators thwarted threats by the Dart  family, which holds Brazilian foreign debt papers and does not  agree with the discount. The Dart family was threatening to  file an international lawsuit against Brazil for failure to pay.</p>

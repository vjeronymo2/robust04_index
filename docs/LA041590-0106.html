			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> PRIDE SPURS WHITBREAD'S ROUND-THE-WORLD SAILORS  </P> <P> At the Southeast 17th Street causeway over the Intracoastal Waterway, many  worlds meet. To the southwest, cruise ships dock, chop-a-block with  multinational clienteles. From the northwest, charter fishing boats rumble away  from hotel marinas and private piers toward Port Everglades Channel and the  fishing grounds offshore.  </P> <P> To the northeast stands Pier 66 Resort and Marina, all spit and polish, fern  bars and waterside cafes, and primary layover facility for the fleet in the  Whitbread Round the World Race.  </P> <P> To the southeast stands a lesser hotel and a flamingo-pink shopping center. At  the lesser hotel, the Best Western Marina Inn, part of the Whitbread overflow  will dock this week. At a small, smelly bar tucked away in the pink shopping  center, an ersatz treasure hunter named Dick Vogel was holding court late one  night last week.  </P> <P> Vogel's tales of treasure were nonsensical; his admiration for the Nazi  infantry in World War II was vocal and comparable in zeal only to his distaste  for the Whitbread race.  </P> <P> "Whitebread, who cares about the Whitebread?" Herr Vogel said. "Bunch of slimy  limeys and (assorted other racial epithets) chasing each other around the  world. Who cares? What's the point?"  </P> <P> In the bar that night while Vogel presided was a knot of journalists in town to  cover the Whitbread. The correspondent from Britain's The Independent sat  quietly while Vogel railed about gold coins, emeralds and the Wehrmacht ("an  Englishman is never unintentionally rude," he said several times), but Vogel's  assessment of the Whitbread set him off.  </P> <P> "But that is -- quite exactly, really -- the point," said the correspondent  from The Independent. "Slimy limeys, Italians, Swedes, Dutch, Finns, Americans,  Kiwis, Australians and Germans racing around the whole bloody world. Not for  money -- for a chance to win a few silly, plated trophies and the privilege to  be able to say they have done it."  </P> <P> The point seemed quite lost on Vogel. Treasure, after all, to many is something  you can pick up, rub between your fingers and admire or sell. Perhaps the point  is lost on many other Americans as well.  </P> <P> There will be some who notice that Steinlager 2 and Fisher &amp; Paykel, each a  multimillion-dollar campaign with major corporate sponsors, are neck and neck  over the past four legs of the race. Others may have taken note that there is  no American entry and there is one all-woman crew. But few will be able to tick  off the ports of call, the large or small tragedies and triumphs in 33,000  miles of racing.  </P> <P> To many of the crew, being there at all is treasure in itself.  </P> <P> On the top boats, in Division A, crew members are paid about $30,000 a year.  Going down through the other classes, Division C, D and Cruising Class, some  crew are paid, but most pay their own way -- including owning interests in the  boats they sail.  </P> <P> Except for the top boats, the yachts are secondhand, perhaps veterans of  previous Whitbreads, perhaps only the best available under their financial  restrictions.  </P> <P> La Poste, sponsored lightly by the French post office, is the smallest boat in  the race, with an IOR rating of 40.46 feet. The boat is last in the standings  and not due in until Monday, a week after the leaders. But its crew list, made  up entirely of postal workers who pay their own way and change after each leg,  has been filled for years.  </P> <P> Schlussel Von Bremen is owned by the Wappen Von Bremen Sailing Club and its  crew schedule is arranged to allow participation of as many club members as  possible.  </P> <P> Liverpool Enterprise, an English entry, is set up as a trust fund and is a  training ship for young people. Its crew is either unpaid or paying.  </P> <P> With Integrity, one of two boats in the all-British Cruising Class, has been  sailed in each of the Whitbreads and won the 1973-74 and 1977-78 races as Great  Britain II. Its skipper, Andy Coghill, sold his house so he could sail this  race. His crew is partly paid and partly paying.  </P> <P> Creightons Naturally, another recycled English entry, had been stored in a  boatyard since the 1981-82 race. Several members of its crew have a financial  interest in the yacht, which they personally rebuilt. The yacht also is a watch  craft for International Dolphin Watch and records all sightings as they race  around the world.  </P> <P> "They're all good people involved. They're all go-getters," said Steinlager 2  skipper Peter Blake. "They're not namby-pamby at all.  </P> <P> "Whether they win or come in second or come in 10th in the race, what's  important to them is that they are out there having a go. It's the fact that  they got round at all."  </P> <P> That Creighton's Naturally still is in the race perhaps typifies the dedication  of the sailors and the interest and understanding of the Europeans who  passionately root for their men and boys as they go round.  </P> <P> On the morning of Nov. 12, while Creightons Naturally was running heavily  before a full gale across the bottom of the world, the yacht gybed unexpectedly  and two crew were thrown overboard. Both were recovered, but one, Tony  Phillips, could not be resuscitated.  </P> <P> Two days later, with the permission and blessing of Phillips' parents, he was  buried at sea and Creightons Naturally raced on.  </P></p>

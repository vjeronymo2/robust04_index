			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / MPs to disclose Lloyd's interests The public will gain access to more details of MPs' involvement at the Lloyd's of London insurance market next week. The new directory of members' interests to be published on Monday will disclose which MPs are Names - the individuals who provide assets supporting insurance market - and for the first time give details of which syndicates they support. The directory will not, however, provide details of how much capacity the MPs provide to each of their syndicates, nor of their stop-loss insurance - a personal reinsurance policy which limits possible loss. On the basis of the information contained in the directory it will be impossible to determine the exact extent of the MPs' exposure to losses. A number of Tory MPs are known to be members of loss-making syndicates and will be affected by the market's expected Pounds 2bn overall loss for 1991. According to the blue book, a Lloyd's publication which has a restricted circulation, at least 15 MPs were members of syndicates in the 1991 year. Among them are Mr Paul Marland, MP for Gloucestershire West, a member of loss-making Gooda Walker syndicates who has campaigned on behalf of loss-making Names, and Mr Peter Viggers, MP for Gosport, a member of the Lloyd's governing council. Last year Lloyd's described reports that Tory MPs might be forced into bankruptcy by their losses at Lloyd's as 'completely misleading'.</p>

			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Wind farms generate storm (4) - David Lascelles' article on the future of wind energy, published on August 19, provoked a large number of letters, both for and against the development of wind power. Here is a selection Sir, May I congratulate David Lascelles on his most objective article on wind power. As he indicates, it would take thousands of wind generators to replace one large power station, and the capital costs involved clearly favour more traditional generating methods. However, I would point out that the economic argument against wind generation is even worse than that set out in the article. In the UK, the highest levels of electricity demand can arise when there is a settled high-pressure weather pattern in mid-winter, producing sustained low temperatures. Such conditions provide little wind at times of greatest need. Consequently, wind generation requires backup alternative generating capacity to avoid a shortfall in supply. The cost of this duplicate capacity constitutes an additional subsidy to wind generation. It also poses the question, why does one need two generating systems when one reliable one will do?

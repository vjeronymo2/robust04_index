			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Jarvis shares fall as loss emerges at Pounds 3.2m Shares of Jarvis dipped 3p to 13 1/2 p yesterday after the building, civil engineering and property group announced a further deficit reflecting continuing problems in its construction activities. On turnover down 23 per cent to Pounds 70.8m, the pre-tax loss for the 1993 year narrowed from Pounds 3.72m to Pounds 3.15m. Mr Harvey Bard, chairman, said that despite a 'reasonable' contribution from property and an improved showing from the products and services side, the group incurred losses 'significantly greater than anticipated' in construction where 'severe trading conditions . . . showed no sign of improvement'. This, he said, had dealt a 'severe blow' to recovery hopes expressed at the interim stage. Tender prices were depressed by 'intense' competition, making it difficult to cover overhead costs. Substantial loss provisions were required against a large road contract in Essex where problems continue, while a pipeline contract for Severn Trent Water incurred heavy losses before its completion. Despite the Pounds 2.4m rights issue last summer, shareholders funds dipped to Pounds 13m (Pounds 13.3m) by the year end, equal to 36p per share. Future cash demands of a reduced construction operation will be funded by realising part of the investment property portfolio. Losses per share were 10.5p (9.9p rights adjusted).</p>

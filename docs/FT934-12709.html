			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / 'Social dumping' fears over Emu THE European Community's move to economic and monetary union threatens to enshrine social inequalities between one country and another, according to a draft European Commission policy paper on social policy, Reuter reports from Brussels. 'It would be foolish to deny that Emu would be a serious challenge to social policy matters,' says the green paper, drawn up by social affairs commissioner, Mr Padraig Flynn. 'The Community should pay the greatest attention to any possible negative social effects of the integration process, in particular the risk of dumping.' The threat of adverse effects underlined the need to counter a spread of 'social dumping', whereby companies relocate to countries where social costs are cheaper, by harmonising social legislation in step with convergence of government monetary policies under Emu. 'Yes we are worried . . . We do believe that if we do want to avoid dumping we need EC social legislation,' an official for the European Trade Union Confederation said. He said 'social dumping' had taken place and could spread under Emu. However, the European employers' group, Unice, said complete harmonisation of social systems is not a necessary condition for progress towards the objectives of the Maastricht treaty.</p>

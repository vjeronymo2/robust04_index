			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Syndicated Loans: Turkish borrower to launch Dollars 100m deal KOC, one of Turkey's two largest industrial conglomerates, is launching its first substantial international financing, consisting of a Dollars 70m club loan and a DM50m private placement of bonds. The Dollars 100m medium-term financing is interesting for two reasons: first, because Koc hopes to raise its profile in the international capital markets and, secondly, because Turkish names have tended to borrow short-term in the loans market recently, but are keen to extend their debt maturity profile. Koc, a family-controlled group, is listed on the Istanbul Stock Exchange and has subsidiaries in the banking, tourism, textiles, consumer durables and auto sectors. It is not well-known in the international capital markets. In the past, the group has met its financing requirements from its cash flow or with the help of domestic banks. Although it issued DM30m in Eurobonds in 1989, using a private placement, Koc has not made any other significant borrowings in the international markets. The Dollars 100m financing is seen as a means of establishing relations with a small group of banks in preparation for further international borrowings - possibly to help finance acquisitions in Europe. So far Koc has not made such acquisitions to expand outside its home base. 'The advantage of doing this (Dollars 100m) financing now is that if Koc decides to do an acquisition later on, it would be better-known in the capital markets, and could raise the necessary financing more easily and more quickly than if it had not borrowed in the capital markets before,' says one banker associated with the deal. The five-year club deal has three arrangers: International Finance Corporation (IFC, the World Bank affiliate devoted to private sector investment); Commerzbank (which is leading the D-Mark bond placement); and JP Morgan. Deutsche Bank, Union Bank of Switzerland, and Bank of Tokyo are lead managers and underwriters. Three of the lenders - IFC, JP Morgan and UBS - have triple A ratings. The margin is around 100 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor). Clearly, Turkish borrowers have had to agree to more generous pricings since the last medium-term loan - the Republic of Turkey's three-year Dollars 200m syndicated credit launched last summer with a margin of 90 basis points over Libor. At the time, the deal was described as aggressively priced and met with a poor reception. Several Turkish borrowers tapped the syndicated loans market after the the Gulf war, although many of them have used one-year deals. While Turkish borrowers are keen to extend their debt maturity profile, bankers point out that it is difficult to attract lenders for longer-term loans. British Bank of the Middle East has agreed a 10-year Dollars 56.6m financing for the United Arab Emirates' latest Airbus A310-300. The airline is expanding its fleet, and three A310s are to be delivered this year.</p>

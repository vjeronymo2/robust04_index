			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Smoke-Free Workplace <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Public Health Service strongly encourages all cooperative agreement recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Eligible Applicants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Eligible applicants include all nonprofit and for-profit organizations. Thus, universities, colleges, research institutes, hospitals, and other public and private organizations, including State and local health departments, are eligible for these cooperative agreements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Availability of Funds <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Approximately $250,000 will be available in FY 1994 to fund approximately two awards. It is expected that the average award will be approximately $125,000. Awards will begin on or about September 1, 1994, and will be made for 12-month budget periods within a project period of up to 3 years. Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change. Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory programmatic progress and the availability of funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of these awards is to help support researchers in the study of important HIV-related epidemiologic issues and specifically to evaluate the impact of HIV program services on the psychological adjustment and transition to new living situations among children (ages 5&hyph;12) whose mothers are in the terminal stage of AIDS or have died of AIDS. Programs which examine this research issue as it affects minority populations are of special interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Program Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Research Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One research issue of programmatic interest to the health care community and to CDC for FY 1994 is described below and is considered to be of significant importance in gaining a greater understanding of the epidemiology of AIDS and HIV infection. However, applications submitted by organizations that examine other important HIV-related epidemiologic research issues will also be accepted and considered for funding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Study proposals are solicited that address issues related to the impact of the terminal illness and death of the HIV-infected mother upon the child by evaluating services available to families before, during, and after the mother's death. Specifically, proposals are sought which will describe methods to identify and evaluate those interventions which are necessary and effective in promoting the child's healthy, psychological adjustment as well as transition to their new living situation. The transition period of specific interest includes the periods immediately prior to and after the mother's death. The evaluation component must include both process and outcome evaluations and descriptions of how the researchers will access children with HIV-infected mothers and follow them after the mother's death. Preference will be given to proposals that evaluate two or more existing transitional programs sponsored by State or local governmental agencies or community-based organizations and include a minimum of 125 children (ages 5&hyph;12) per program. Applicants are also encouraged to submit proposals that compare different types of transitional programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Examples of worthwhile proposals include: Limited, longitudinal studies of children enrolled in foster care or other transitional programs specifically for families of HIV-infected mothers. Research strategies may include, but need not be limited to, record reviews to document numbers and types of foster or other caretaking arrangements of the child, placement of siblings, quantitative interviews with caretakers, and psychological measures including measures of bereavement, anxiety and depression, etc. Applicants must document specific behavioral research and evaluation expertise among the proposed staff. Applicants must also be willing to participate collaboratively with CDC and other researchers in the development, implementation, and analysis of data from the proposed study.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Cooperative Agreements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A cooperative agreement indicates that CDC will assist the collaborator in conducting the epidemiologic research of AIDS and HIV infection described in the PURPOSE section of this announcement. The application should be presented in a manner that demonstrates the applicant's ability to address the research problem in a collaborative manner with CDC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In conducting activities to achieve the purpose of this program, the recipient shall be responsible for the activities under A., below, and CDC shall be responsible for conducting activities under B., below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A.

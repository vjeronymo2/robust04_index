These wolves will be classified as a nonessential experimental population pursuant to section 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Gray wolf populations have been extirpated from most of the Western United States. They presently occur in a small population in extreme northwestern Montana, and as incidental occurrences in Idaho, Wyoming, and Washington as a result of wolves dispersing from existing populations in Montana and Canada. The purpose of this reintroduction plan is to reestablish a viable wolf population in central Idaho, one of three wolf recovery areas identified in the Northern Rocky Mountain Wolf Recovery Plan. Potential effects of this final rule were evaluated in an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) completed in May 1994. This gray wolf reintroduction does not conflict with existing or anticipated Federal agency actions or traditional public uses of park lands, wilderness areas, or surrounding lands.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  November 18, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments or other information may be sent to Gray Wolf Reintroduction, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, P.O.

L. 97&hyph;304, made significant changes to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) (Act), including the creation of section 10(j), which provides for the designation of specific animals as ``experimental.'' Under previous authorities in the Act, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) was permitted to reintroduce a listed species into unoccupied portions of its historic range for conservation and recovery purposes. However, local opposition to reintroduction efforts from certain parties concerned about potential restrictions, and prohibitions on Federal and private activities contained in sections 7 and 9 of the Act, reduced the utility of reintroduction as a management tool.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 10(j), a listed species reintroduced outside of its current range, but within its historic range, may be designated, at the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary), as ``experimental.'' This designation increases the Service's flexibility and discretion in managing reintroduced endangered species because such experimental animals may be treated as a threatened species. The Act requires that animals used to form an experimental population be separated geographically from nonexperimental populations of the same species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional management flexibility is possible if the experimental animals are found to be ``nonessential'' to the continued existence of the species in question. Nonessential experimental animals located outside national parks or national wildlife refuges are treated, for purposes of section 7 of the Act, as if they were only proposed for listing. Consequently, only two provisions of section 7 would apply to animals located outside of national wildlife refuges and national parks_section 7(a)(1) and section 7(a)(4). Section 7(a)(1) requires all Federal agencies to establish conservation programs for federally listed species. Utilization of Federal public lands, including national parks and national forests, is consistent with the legal responsibility of these agencies to sustain the native wildlife resources of the United States and to use their authorities to further the purposes of the Act by carrying out conservation programs for endangered and threatened species. Section 7(a)(4) requires all Federal agencies to informally confer with the Service on actions that will likely jeopardize the continued existence of species proposed to be listed as threatened or endangered. The results of a conference are advisory in nature, and agencies are not required to refrain from committing resources to projects as a result of a conference. In addition, section 10(j) of the Act states that nonessential experimental animals are not subject to the formal consultation provision of the Act unless they occur on land designated as a national wildlife refuge or national park. Activities undertaken on private lands are not affected by section 7 of the Act unless they are funded, authorized, or carried out by a Federal agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specimens used to establish an experimental population may be removed from a source or donor population, provided their removal is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the species and appropriate permits have been issued in accordance with 50 CFR 17.22. Gray wolves for the reintroduction will be obtained from healthy Canadian wolf populations with permission from the Canadian and Provincial governments. Gray wolves are common in western Canada (tens of thousands) and Alaska (about 7,000). No adverse biological impact is expected from the removal of about 150 from the Canadian population. Consequently, the Service finds that wolves to be used in the reintroduction effort meet the definition of ``nonessential'' (50 CFR 17.80(b)) because the loss of the reintroduced wolves is not likely to appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival of the species in the wild.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

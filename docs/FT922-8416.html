			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Environment better served by free-trade carrot than protectionist stick - Co-operation produces better results than coercion, says a World Bank report intended to fuel debate at the Earth Summit next month PUNISHING poor countries through trade bans is unlikely to help protect the global environment, the World Bank concludes in a report published this month. While free trade is no panacea, co-operation will produce better results than coercion, it says. Developing countries, in particular, should not be forced to take action they cannot afford, such as stricter environmental legislation. 'In the case of worldwide global problems like global warming or in the case of regional problems like acid rain, there is no viable alternative to international co-operation,' says Mr Lawrence Summers, vice-president and chief economist, in his foreword to the report on trade and the environment. The study focuses on the pressure in the developed world for trade bans and other punitive action against countries whose environmental regulation falls below the standards of other countries. Blanket harmonisation of environmental regulation, sought to ensure fair competition between exporters, is inappropriate and runs counter to accepted principles of international trade, it argues. The report, intended to fuel debate at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro next month, acknowledges that the failure to take proper account of environmental costs has led in some cases to environmental degradation. It examines six broad themes: how trade and environment policy are linked; whether 'dirty' industries migrate in the face of higher environmental standards; whether higher standards hurt competitiveness; whether liberal trade, and the quest for economic growth underpinning it, necessarily results in degradation of the environment; how protectionists have captured environmental issues to aid their cause; and how international trade co-operation, including measures aimed at forcing harmonisation of environmental policies, can help to protect the environment. Attention should be paid to sustainable development, the use of unexploited natural resources, energy consumption, the possibility of environmental accidents, and threats to the 'global commons' including the oceans, the ozone layer and the world's forests, it says. Among its main conclusions, the report says: Companies have no environmental grounds on which to demand tariff protection against imports from countries with less rigorous environmental rules. Nor are there good economic grounds, since the cost of meeting environmental standards account for such a small proportion of total costs. There is no evidence that 'dirty' industries migrate to countries because their environmental standards are lax, and there is scant economic sense in doing so. International harmonisation of environmental standards is not necessarily a sensible aim, and may be used by governments to delay domestic environmental reform. In developing countries where poverty alleviation is a greater priority than environmental protection, different environmental standards may be valid. Trade bans, punitive tariffs or other forms of coercion are unlikely to be effective: 'Countries coerced into action by threats are unlikely to comply either very thoroughly or for very long, leaving the environmental outcome in doubt,' says Mr Summers. 'When consumption in the petitioning country is 20 times that of the country asked to bear additional costs for environmental improvement, or when countries are asked to forgo the benefits of their natural resources, equity more than economic logic suggests that threats to reduce poor countries' incomes further by trade restrictions are inappropriate.' A recurring theme in the report is the 'strong preference' governments show for 'direct command and control measures, which come far down in the efficiency hierarchy' when it comes to tackling environmental problems. Governments 'have omitted to give adequate consideration to the justification for measures they have adopted, or to the nature of the options available', the report concludes. Confirming the findings of a report by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) published in February, the World Bank accepts that trade measures may be justified as environmental policy 'in very narrowly defined circumstances', but that 'there is almost always a better way of meeting environmental objectives.' It rejects the 'deep ecology' view that environmental assets such as rain forests or endangered species have infinite value. From this, it follows that countries have a right to decide what value they give to environmental quality, traded against the need to provide jobs, relieve poverty, provide proper health care and education. 'Environmental standards and pollution abatement and control activities will be different among countries, and there is no valid presumption in favour of uniformity or harmonisation,' says Mr Patrick Low, the report's editor. While the report challenges the claim that a failure to harmonise environmental standards will result in 'dirty' industries migrating to countries with lax standards, it concedes that the amount of 'dirty' industry output in developing countries has grown steadily over the past two decades. It suggests, however, that this has more to do with the stage of industrialisation of many developing countries than any other factor. Studies in Chile and more widely across Latin America also contradict the claims that free trade leads to environmental degradation and that industries migrating to developing countries seek comparative advantage in their lower environmental standards. 'The more open an economy, the more rapidly clean technolsays. It also suggests that migrating companies have imported their technologies with them, rather than exploited lower local environmental standards. Several reasons are given for this: companies have become fearful of liabilities arising in the event of environmental accidents, and are sensitive to the demands of 'green' consumers in export markets. They economise by using common production standards in all plants, wherever they are based, and find it cheaper to start new plants with state-of-the-art technology rather than face the comparatively expensive prospect of 'retrofitting' ageing plant. They also have to anticipate that developing countries will over time demand more stringent environmental standards. The report attacks the case for protecting industries forced to meet high environmental standards because research shows the costs of pollution abatement and control to be small. Even in the US, which has generally high standards, these costs add up to an average 0.54 per cent of a company's overall costs. Even in the cement industry, which pays more for pollution control than any other, it accounts for just 3 per cent of costs. It argues that any attempt in the US to introduce a tax to 'level the playing field' would be 'strongly suggestive of a protectionist reflex, with little or no environmental justification'. It alerts environmentalists, who have often allied with protectionists in trade issues, that this provides a good example of how protectionist interests have no concern for better environment standards - only for the elimination of competitive disadvantage. 'Trade restrictions are an economically costly means for one country to use in trying to induce another to (take proper account of pollution costs), and they do not guarantee success in terms of the environmental outcome.' The report examines options to compensate developing countries undertaking environmental protection - including cash transfers, debt-for-nature swaps, technology transfers and sanctions for nature. It concludes that only the transfer of clean or pollution-reducing technology is without adverse side effects. *International Trade and the Environment, edited by Patrick Low.

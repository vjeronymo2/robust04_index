			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WITH MACLEAN APPEARING WEAK, UCLA COACH ORDERS BLOOD TESTS  </P> <P> Is Don MacLean OK?  </P> <P> It depends on who is asked.  </P> <P> "I'm feeling fine," MacLean said.  </P> <P> Jim Harrick thinks not.  </P> <P> The UCLA basketball coach, concerned that MacLean lost 10 pounds last month as  the Bruins played 6 of 8 games on the road, ordered blood tests this week for  the freshman forward, who is UCLA's No. 1 scorer and No. 2 rebounder.  </P> <P> Harrick said that MacLean appears weak and run-down.  </P> <P> "His shot's been flat," Harrick said. "He just seems to progressively be just a  little bit off. He's missed some shots that he never missed before, and he's  not quite as fast to the ball rebounding and defensively -- just little things  that I've noticed. And I'm concerned about that. . . .  </P> <P> "I've noticed it for a long time. I just hadn't said anything about it. I  talked to his mother about it after the Arizona State game and she noticed it,  too. She said, 'Oh, yeah, that's not the same kid.' "  </P> <P> When it was suggested that MacLean's symptoms sounded like mononucleosis,  Harrick said: "That's what bothers me."  </P> <P> MacLean practiced Tuesday.  </P> <P> "He thinks I'm nuts," Harrick said.  </P> <P> MacLean will be examined today by assistant team physician James Puffer. Test  results will be known Friday.  </P></p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Gatt row brews on Mercosur scrutiny A ROW is brewing in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) on how it should scrutinise Mercosur, the Southern Cone Common Market grouping Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, writes Frances Williams. Mercosur says its free trade arrangement should be considered under Gatt's 'enabling clause'. This allows preferential trade deals between developing countries to be simply notified to Gatt's Committee on Trade and Development, and protects them from challenge by other Gatt members. But, at today's meeting of the Gatt council, the US will call for a working party on Mercosur under Article 24 of the General Agreement on free trade areas and customs unions. It argues that the size and potential importance of Mercosur, with a population of 200m and an annual GNP of Dollars 500bn (Pounds 260bn), merits a detailed examination by trading partners to check its consistency with Gatt rules. The EC yesterday proposed a compromise under which Mercosur would be examined by a working party set up by the committee. Mr Nunes Amorim, Brazil's ambassador to Gatt, said yesterday that Mercosur members were prepared to provide full information on Mercosur to Gatt members, and to enter into consultations with any country that felt its Gatt rights were being impaired. Mr Rubens Barbosa, a senior trade official from Braslia, said in an interview that trade between Mercosur members had jumped by over a third between 1990 and 1991, while Brazil's exports to Mercosur partners had risen 77 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> VIRGINIA'S GEORGE WELSH PROVES TO BE AN ENDURING COACH  </P> <P> It's fitting George Welsh found his way here to Mr. Jefferson's University.  Jefferson said, "Those who labor in the earth are the chosen people," and  that's precisely how it came to be that Welsh won for the 100th time as a  college football coach last Saturday. How else but with sheer effort could he  win that many games at academically oriented Navy and Virginia, two places, a  coaching colleague once marveled, "Where it couldn't be done"?  </P> <P> It wasn't by gimmicks. Can anyone remember George Welsh cooking up a scheme to  win a football game? A self-promoter he isn't. Think of a college football  coach and chances are he'll never come to mind. Charismatic? He's never given a  Gipper speech, although playing to a good part of his audience he has quoted  Solzhenitsyn at halftime.  </P> <P> At 56 he's college coaching's marathon man.  </P> <P> Obstacles don't daunt him. His teams have been blown off the field by Goliaths  such as Notre Dame and Clemson, kicked in the shins by a David, William and  Mary. Setbacks, his wife Sandra says, turn him from quiet to "very, very  quiet." But like a long-distance runner, he shakes off the hole he stepped into  and soon can be seen coming over the next ridge, dirty-kneed, perhaps, but  relentless.  </P> <P> The book on Welsh, a trim man with a hawk's nose, is this: bright,  hard-working, knows his X's and O's, up-to-date with an increasingly wide-open  offense. His day begins at 5 a.m. when he starts writing out a detailed daily  practice schedule. No dinosaur in his thinking, he is "constantly changing,  constantly looking for new ideas and methods," according to Penn State Coach  Joe Paterno. Alabama Coach Bill Curry has said, "George Welsh can beat you with  his brain."  </P> <P> Welsh and Paterno are friends from way back, when both were assistants at Penn  State under Rip Engle. By mutual agreement they virtually stopped speaking to  one another several years ago when Penn State-Virginia games for 1988 and 1989  were scheduled. (Typically of Welsh's determination, Virginia lost to Penn  State 42-14 last season at home, then this season stunned an improved Nittany  Lions team up there, 14-6.) As soon as he has time, Welsh wants to resume  talking football with Paterno -- and read Solzhenitsyn's "August 1914."  </P> <P> "It's out now," Welsh said eagerly, but as a man with priorities, he won't get  to the book until after the season. After all, it's 857 pages.  </P> <P> First comes football and to Welsh that means practice.  </P> <P> "We try to emphasize getting better in practice," he said, "to improve  individually and collectively." If players don't practice, they don't play. If  they don't practice well, they may learn their coach isn't as laid-back as some  people say. He's been known to chase a player off the practice field, or throw  his cap down and stomp on it. Jefferson also said it was all right to stir  things up occasionally.  </P> <P> Once Welsh overdid it. Illustrating a move, he broke his ankle and had to coach  the final game of 1986 in a wheelchair. But on better afternoons on the  practice field out behind University Hall, Welsh is like a professor lecturing  to a large group, making his points. Football men who believe he has something  to impart entrust their sons to him. The current roster includes former Georgia  coach Vince Dooley's son Derek, former Dolphins quarterback Bob Griese's son  Scott and Curry's son Bill.  </P> <P> Welsh seems suited to Virginia. "Virginia promotes a kind of exploring among  its students in terms of outside interests," said Athletic Director Jim  Copeland, "and he doesn't stymie that. Just be a football player when you're  supposed to be a football player. But he thinks you can be something else, and  that's a great lesson for anybody to learn."  </P> <P> Virginia won the College Football Association Academic Achievement Award for  the highest graduation of scholarship football players in 1985 (92.6 percent)  and 1986 (88.9 percent) and received honorable mention in 1984, 1987, 1988 and  1989. Welsh is as proud of his quarterback who went to medical school as the  one he sent to the Green Bay Packers. (Virginia's fifth-year students with  playing eligibility usually aren't stringing out their courses; last season one  already was in law school and a captain this year, Roy Brown is studying for  his master's in international relations.)  </P> <P> Welsh said: "I didn't necessarily come to Virginia because it was a good  academic school. It didn't deter me, though."  </P> <P> It just happened that way. Virginia was looking for a coach just when Welsh  turned 48 and thought that if he ever was going to move it was about time. As  thoroughly as he plans football games and seasons, he seems to have had no game  plan for his career. He doesn't like to change jobs, and the times he has he's  done it pretty much on instinct.  </P> <P> "It's a matter of timing with George," Sandra Welsh said. "I don't think he  plans. He didn't get into football until he was 30."  </P> <P> He was an officer before he was a Virginia gentleman. Eight years in the Navy  after graduating from the academy probably had something to do with his decorum  and officer-enlisted man relationship with his players. He's sometimes  described as aloof. He isn't; he's just not pals with the players.  </P> <P> "I never have been, even when I was younger," he said. "When I was an assistant  coach, in my early 30s, I tried to keep a professional relationship. I've tried  to encourage the idea that the door is open. I've tried to be available. But  there's a line there that I never wanted to cross."  </P> <P> One of his former Navy players once likened him to "the captain of a ship. You  certainly get the feeling he's off by himself."  </P> <P> What he is, is organized. He may have learned about that from Engle. "Rip knew  how to handle a staff," Welsh said. "One of Rip's great strengths was that he'd  allow everybody to talk in a meeting and he would sit and not say much, maybe  for a couple of hours. Then he'd pull it all together and make the decision. He  was good at that."  </P> <P> So is Welsh, his peers say. "He's an intelligent person, probably able to  analyze things as well as anybody and make deductions and then implement from  there," said Gary Tranquill, Welsh's assistant at Navy and again here. "He may  not say much, but when he does, it's exactly what he wants."  </P> <P> Welsh was high in leadership qualities as a Midshipman, a small but instinctive  and winning quarterback. He came out of Coaldale, Pa., with "no idea" what he  was getting into at the academy. Yale and Columbia were among his  possibilities, but his father was a Navy fan and had taken him to Baltimore a  couple of times to see the Midshipmen play. As a 162-pound field general, he  became the heart of Navy's 1954 "Team of Desire," which had a 7-2 record and  upset Mississippi, 21-0, in the Sugar Bowl.  </P> <P> "The '54 team was one of the great Navy teams," he said. "Maybe not as good as  the (Roger) Staubach teams, but almost. Because I was no Staubach."  </P> <P> In 1955 Welsh led the nation in total offense, and when he speaks of that  season he can't help mentioning the Army game. "We probably had a better team  than Army that year, but they were better than us that day and we just didn't  win. We turned the ball over six or seven times."  </P> <P> As a Midshipman he met his wife on a blind date. As a young officer, he was  assigned for a while to the academy and helped out coaching football in 1960  and 1961. Sandra remembered him saying one day, "I could be very good at this."  </P> <P> Still he went back to sea. He stayed in the Navy eight years. "I didn't get out  of the Navy to coach. I got out to change a profession. I just decided it was  not the thing for me," he said of what was hardly a snap decision. He thought  of going to law school ("Maybe I wouldn't have gotten in anyway," he added).  "But I had two small children and I didn't seem to be able to do it." (He has  four grown children now.) He applied for a few assistant coaching jobs, but  appeared headed for business when Engle hired him for Penn State.  </P> <P> From 1963 through 1972 he worked under Engle, then Paterno. Sue Paterno and  Sandra Welsh became like sisters. Disappointed that the Welshes would be  leaving when Navy came looking for a coach, Sue Paterno said to her husband,  "You didn't recommend him, did you?"  </P> <P> Welsh had been content to be an assistant, just as he would become content as  Navy's coach. In that job he proved unsinkable. "It took me five years," he  said, "to get my head above water."  </P> <P> Again he minimizes his accomplishments; unlike many coaches, he doesn't have a  big ego. His wife told him recently, "With all those losses, you deserve a  hundred wins."  </P> <P> But even Welsh's early losing teams at Navy beat Army (he was 7-1-1 against the  Cadets in all). He finished with four winning seasons (55-46-1 for nine years)  and took Navy to three bowl games. Often his name came up when there were  coaching vacancies elsewhere. But stories invariably followed that he was  staying, usually accompanied by speculation as to what motivated him to remain  put. He simply wasn't aggressive about leaving, and even when he accepted  Virginia in December 1981, he said, "My family didn't particularly want to  leave."  </P> <P> He laughed gently. "But I had worked in a military organization as a  Midshipman, seven years as a commissioned officer, nine years as a coach there.  That was my 20, I figured. I'd paid the government back."  </P> <P> This is his eighth season at Virginia. He's had winning teams five of the last  six seasons. He's 5-2 this year, 45-39-2 overall, including two bowl victories  in two appearances. Yet in the 29 years before he came, Virginia had only two  winning seasons. It had never been to a bowl. (Navy has had only one winning  season since he left, and that was the year after.) Welsh thought he could win  at Virginia, but confesses to underestimating the climb during that first 2-9  season.  </P> <P> Basketball coach Terry Holland and his wife Ann were among those welcoming the  Welsh family. Sandra Welsh said, "They were the first people on our doorstep."  </P> <P> "He came with a good attitude," Terry Holland said. "People by and large try to  make excuses. I've seen coaches come through here and after a year or two they  say this is the reason we can't be successful.  </P> <P> "He's a fierce competitor. He takes what he does seriously. He has a good staff  that's loyal and been with him for a while. He's been an effective recruiter,  especially in the last few years. But he also coaches players to be better than  maybe their press clippings are. And that's what you have to do at a place like  Virginia. He always has a walk-on or two."  </P> <P> Lately Welsh has been keeping more good in-state players in state. His most  heralded recruit has been freshman Terry Kirby, who had been perhaps the most  sought-after running back in the nation and who also will play basketball.  "Recruiting is hell," Kirby said the other day, but he appreciated Welsh and  his assistants "for being kind of laid-back. ... He came in and told me exactly  what they had. He said you're going to have to work your butt off to get your  position. Nothing's promised you. And that really impressed me."  </P> <P> Welsh believes freshmen should be ineligible for varsity football because they  need a chance to mature while facing the new demands of college. He's also "not  sure players now have as much fun. We never spent 10 to 11 months of the year  on football."  </P> <P> He believes everyone should have time off. He squeezes in vacation at the home  he had built on Nantucket a couple of years ago. He takes one week in February  and three weeks in the summer. He fishes, he reads (his interest in Russian  literature began with a college course), he runs. He began running long before  it was popular.  </P> <P> "I still want to have a third career," Welsh said. That's after coaching, and  no time soon. It could be athletic administration, business; he isn't sure. He  wouldn't mind a six-month sabbatical at sea to think about it, but after that  it should come as no surprise that anyone so indefatigable would want to keep  on running.  </P></p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / International Company News: Austrian bank seeks change in ownership A SIGNIFICANT change in ownership of GiroCredit Bank, Austria's third-largest bank, is in prospect following a truce among feuding camps at the group's board meeting in Vienna yesterday. Mr Rene Alfons Haiden, chief executive of Bank Austria, and Mr Konrad Fuchs, chief executive of Die Erste Osterreichische Spar-Casse-Bank, announced following the meeting that talks would begin immediately aimed at achieving a change in the shareholding structure by next April. Bank Austria and Die Erste together hold a majority of Giro shares, a situation Giro management considers intolerable because the two are also important competitors. Mr Haiden said yesterday that there should be one clear source of decision-making. Giro management, which is seeking to secure a retail base for itself, eased the tension before the meeting by shelving proposals to buy minority share stakes in savings banks in Salzburg and Linz. These had been opposed by Bank Austria and Die Erste as an inefficient use of capital. Giro feared its two largest shareholders were trying to crowd it out of the retail market. But Mr Haiden and Mr Fuchs acknowledged yesterday that Giro had a dual function - as a partner of the savings banks and as a specialised universal bank. 'It has to fulfil a function in the retail market,' Mr Haiden said. 'We are all very pleased,' a Giro spokesman said following the meeting. Giro management has been trying to entice Bayerische Landesbank-Girozentrale, the German bank, to buy a large minority shareholding, but Bayerische has said it will not make a decision until Giro's relations with its two largest shareholders are sorted out. A year ago, negotiations aimed at merging Die Erste, which operates a network of savings banks, and Giro collapsed in acrimony.</p>

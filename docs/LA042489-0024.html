			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NFL DRAFT;  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> WHEN QUESTIONS ARISE, MIAMI HAS THE ANSWERS  </P> <P> When it came time to pull two first-round triggers, the Rams were left stunned  at what remained on Sunday's draft table. So they stalked and talked and darn  near balked, waiting until waning seconds before finally turning to Miami  Twice.  </P> <P> It wasn't supposed to be so difficult. The Rams were almost locked into Miami  defensive end Bill Hawkins at pick 21, but were forced to reconsider with so  many blue-chippers left.  </P> <P> Gnashing teeth as minutes passed, the Rams were left to ponder: How do you not  take cornerback Louis Oliver, considered a top 10 pick in most circles? Or  receiver Andre Rison? Or fullback Cleveland Gary? What were the Rams doing with  this incredible opportunity?  </P> <P> Panicking, as it turns out. With only 16 seconds left to choose in their  allotted 15 minutes, the Rams scribbled Hawkins' name on some paper and raced  it to the podium.  </P> <P> They resisted temptation in the end and stuck to their guns, passing on the  best-available athlete theory to fill a long-standing need at defensive end. It  seemed a victory for the coaching staff, defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur in  particular. This wasn't a public relations pick.  </P> <P> So Bill Hawkins it was. He's tall (6-6) and lean (265) and was a three-year  starter for the Hurricanes, who lost one football game the past two seasons.  </P> <P> "He has a chance to develop into the big-time pass rusher we've always talked  about but never found," Ram Coach John Robinson said.  </P> <P> Robinson wasn't out of the woods yet.  </P> <P> Five picks later at 26, Miami fullback Cleveland Gary was still on the board  and flashing like neon lights in front of Robinson's eyes. The Rams were still  thinking defense, or maybe tight end. But not a fullback. Only minutes before,  Robinson said that Robert Delpino, last year's rookie sensation, was a  perfectly capable fullback.  </P> <P> But this time the Rams couldn't pass on a big-name talent. They used every  second of their 15 minutes and finally decided on Gary, passing over Auburn  tight end Lawyer Tillman and Tennessee linebacker Keith DeLong.  </P> <P> Just what the Rams need, another running back. But Robinson coached Gary in the  Senior Bowl and claims he's one of the best receiving backs to come out of  college in years.  </P> <P> Gary wasn't as thrilled over the developments, figuring he never should have  lasted long enough to become a Ram.  </P> <P> "I didn't think I'd be there," said Gary, who considered himself a top 10 pick.  "But the decision's been made and I'm and L.A. Ram. I love it. . . . You have  to prepare for things like that. I'm elated that it's over."  </P> <P> Next question: Are there enough footballs to go around? The Rams are suddenly  well-stocked in the backfield, Gary joining a team that includes Greg Bell,  Delpino, Buford McGee and last year's first round choice, Gaston Green.  </P> <P> Robinson seems to think he can keep everyone happy.  </P> <P> "It's an area that we once did not have any depth," Robinson said. "We now have  depth. This isn't a game where you can have one deep. It just isn't."  </P> <P> But doesn't something have to give? Is Greg Bell on the trading block?  </P> <P> "No," Robinson said.  </P> <P> What about Gary being a makeup pick for Green, who played sparingly as a  rookie.  </P> <P> "I heard one genius say that it's indicative of our feelings for Gaston Green,"  Robinson responded. "But that's way off. It's not even close."  </P> <P> Only time will tell whether the Rams will regret taking Gary over DeLong, a Ram  favorite who went two picks later to the San Francisco 49ers.  </P> <P> A brief look at the rest of the Rams' Sunday picks:  </P> <P> Second Round  </P> <P> 45th choice -- Frank Stams, linebacker, Notre Dame. The final payoff for Eric  Dickerson, Stams gives the Rams another outside pass rusher to go with Hawkins.  Robinson compares Stams to the NFL's second-leading quarterback sacker last  season. Lawrence Taylor? Bruce Smith? No, Kevin Greene, remember? The Rams'  outside linebacker finished with 16 1/2, trailing only Reggie White of the  Philadelphia Eagles for the league lead.  </P> <P> "We see him like Kevin Greene," Robinson said of Stams. "He came off the corner  for Notre Dame much like Kevin Greene did for us."  </P> <P> Stams is a converted fullback and one of several prime-time players from Notre  Dame's national championship defense. He led the Irish with seven sacks in  1988.  </P> <P> One knock on Stams is his inability to drop into pass coverage. The Rams  knocked on wood. Robinson spoke of Stams as if he were a son.  </P> <P> 'I'm not supposed to get emotionally involved with guys," he said. "But I  really feel good about this guy."  </P> <P> 48th pick -- Brian Smith, defensive end/linebacker, Auburn. Like Hawkins, Smith  is 6-foot-6, giving the Rams a pair of ends who can peer over a line of  scrimmage for a change; unlike say, a Donald Evans. Rams' personnel director  John Math calls Smith "747" because of his large wing span. He's also been  called "String Bean," but that's what weight rooms are for. Smith is listed at  245 pounds, though Robinson envisions him at 270 pounds some day.  </P> <P> "He's a Richard Dent-type," said Robinson, careful not to actually compare  Smith to the Chicago Bears' All-Pro.  </P> <P> 53rd pick -- Darryl Henley, cornerback, UCLA. He returns to a Bruin reunion  that includes Gaston Green, James Washington, Flipper Anderson, Duval Love, et  al. At 5-feet-8 and 165 pounds, Henley lacks size and muscle, but could be the  punt returner the Rams have been looking for since receiver Henry Ellard became  too valuable to risk returning kicks.  </P> <P> "He's a great punt returner, and that's very positive for us," Robinson said.  "His lack of size probably kept him from being a first-round corner. He played  like a first-round corner."  </P> <P> Henley's best shot this season seems to be as a nickel-back player.  </P> <P> Third Round  </P> <P> 75th pick overall -- Kevin Robbins, offensive tackle, Michigan State. Right  now, he's just the answer to Tony Mandarich's trivia question: Name the other  tackle at Michigan State last season. Yes, it was Robbins, who pales in  comparison to Mandarich at only 6-foot-4 and 286 pounds. Robbins, however, was  an Academic All-Big 10 Conference selection.  </P> <P> Fourth Round  </P> <P> 102nd pick overall -- Jeff Carlson, quarterback, Weber State. A local product  from Pacifica High School in Cypress, Carlson could be that developmental  quarterback Robinson was talking about. The lefthander passed for more than  5,000 yards in his college career.  </P> <P> Fifth Round  </P> <P> 135th pick overall -- Alfred Jackson, cornerback, San Diego State. A wide  receiver in college, Jackson will compete for a spot in a very crowded Rams  secondary.  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> As exected, Robinson said Sunday he would soon meet with veteran linebacker  Carl Ekern, 34, and fullback Mike Guman, 31, and probably ask both to retire. .  . . Darryl Henley is the brother of Thomas, a free-agent receiver recently  signed by the Rams.  </P> <P> THE RAMS' PICKS  </P> <P> The Rams' selections in the 1989 NFL draft:  </P> <TABLE CWL="1.45IN:2.66IN:1.56IN:2.55IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Rn.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Player  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Pos.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> School  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Bill Hawkins  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> DE  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Miami (Fla.)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Cleveland Gary  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> FB  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Miami (Fla.)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Frank Stams  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> LB  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Notre Dame  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Brian Smith  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> LB  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Auburn  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Darryl Henley  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> DB  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> UCLA  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Kevin Robbins  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> OT  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Michigan St.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Jeff Carlson  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> QB  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Weber St.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Alfred Jackson  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> WR  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> San Diego St.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE></p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Coopers &amp; Lybrand elects chairman MR PETER SMITH has been elected the new chairman of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the UK's largest accountancy firm, for the first of what he hopes will be two five-year terms. The firm's 700 partners selected Mr Smith using a single-transferable vote system controlled by the Electoral Reform Society at the end of an election process leading to a short-list of four candidates. Mr Brandon Gough, the current chairman, said the Electoral Reform Society had only provided Coopers with the name of the winner and had not disclosed the votes for the other candidates. His victory came over Mr Adrian Lamb, partner in charge of the regions, Mr Alan McFetrich, an executive partner, and Mr Richard Stone, head of corporate finance. Mr Smith, partner in charge of the London office, was believed to have been Mr Gough's favoured candidate. Mr Smith will take up his position from May 1. He said he had not yet finalised his choice of the team that will help him run the firm. His election is for five years, but he said he hoped to be in place for two consecutive terms.</p>

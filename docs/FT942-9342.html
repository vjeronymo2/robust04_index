			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / EU close to Russia-Ukraine trade accord The European Union is poised to cement a close relationship with Russia and Ukraine at next month's heads of government summit in Corfu which would lead to a common free trade zone by the end of the century. Following a meeting in Brussels of the Twelve's foreign ministers, all now hinges on a visit to Moscow later this week by France's foreign minister, Mr Alain Juppe, aimed at resolving residual French objections on Russia's exports of enriched uranium. The EU has already initialled a 'partnership' agreement with Ukraine, and yesterday all but overcame French objections to a similar but broader agreement with Moscow, which should be ironed out before Corfu. If achieved, both agreements are seen by the EU as the foundations of a stable relationship with profoundly unstable and powerful eastern neighbours, and the necessary preconditions for the EU's common foreign and security policy. 'It's going in the right direction,' said a spokesman for Sir Leon Brittan, EU external economic affairs commissioner. The hope is that both Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, and Mr Leonid Kravchuk, his Ukrainian counterpart, will be in Corfu on June 24 to close the deal. The controversies which have snagged the negotiations with Russia have now been largely resolved. Moscow has agreed a safeguards regime to prevent sudden export flows of uranium fuel which might undercut French production for its network of nuclear power plants. The EU and Russia have also arrived at a modus vivendi on treatment of foreign banks working within the Russian federation. Paris nevertheless insists on further guarantees over Russian uranium exports beyond the planned expiry date of the safeguard regime in 1997. Mr Juppe is looking for a quotas agreement in his Moscow talks this week, but EU diplomats believe France values an overall deal with Moscow too highly to jeopardise it over the fine print. The Ukraine deal, although it was reached earlier and for that reason alone has convulsed foreign ministries across the EU, still awaits additional agreements on how to finance the complete shutdown of the Chernobyl nuclear complex. The EU wishes to develop a separate policy towards Kiev, through food aid, macro-economic support and possibly very expensive aid to build alternative nuclear reactors. The potential cost of this, estimated at between Ecu500m (Pounds 387m) and Ecu1bn, was underlined yesterday by Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, who, like his EU colleagues, wants to share the cost with the US and Japan. 'We will have to come back to this, particularly on Chernobyl,' Mr Hurd said, referring to the summit of the Group of Seven industrial countries in Naples in July.</p>

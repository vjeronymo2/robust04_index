Robin Raphel, the under  secretary of state and chief of the Clinton administration's  committee on South Asia and the Pacific, told the House of  Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee that aid to Pakistan  was suspended under the Pressler Amendment. The Pressler  Amendment has been helpful in slowing down Pakistan's nuclear  program. After assuming office, the present government gave the  nation good news that it would not only bring Pakistan out of  the isolation resulting from the wrong policies of the previous  government, but that it would also improve Pakistan-U.S.  relations to such a level that it would lead to the annulment of  the Pressler Amendment and resumption of U.S. aid to Pakistan.  Stories about world support on the Kashmir issue and further  revision in the Pressler Amendment by the United States,  especially Pakistan's exclusion from it, could be heard in those  days. But all the fond hopes are now evaporating one by one and  it is becoming clear to the people that what they witnessed was  a dream and what they heard was merely a story.    At first, the UN General Assembly was approached about the  Kashmir issue and the government declared that once again they  were raising the issue at the world body. A resolution was also  presented about which the opposition claims that it was planned  during the Nawaz Sharif government and it had also secured the  support of most of the friendly countries as a result of  lobbying by the previous government. But suddenly, the present  government announced the withdrawal of the resolution and the  people were told that it had been done due to the insistence of  "friends" and their reported assurances. It was also said that  those friends had assured that they would exert pressure on  India and ensure that the Kashmir issue is resolved through  negotiations. Naturally, the whole nation's attention was  focused on the Pakistan-India talks in the first week of  January. However, the talks remained unproductive and India not  only repeated its old claim that Kashmir is an integral part of  India, but also belied hopes of normalizing relations between  the two countries by embarking on a major operation against  Kashmiris in Sopor. The siege of the Hazratbal shrine also  continued.    The government then adopted the policy of raising the  Kashmir  issue at the UN Human Rights Commission and the prime minister  said that she would herself go and raise the issue at the UN  body. Well, she did so and tried to convince the nation that  India would face a defeat at the global forum and it would  eventually lead to an end to Indian atrocities in occupied  Kashmir and that India would be forced to resolve the Kashmir  issue.    An impression was also created that the United States was  backing the present government and it was putting pressure on  India. In an attempt to satisfy the United States, the prime  minister also announced that Pakistan does not help the Sikhs.  Despite all this, the latest resolution was also withdrawn,  thereby belying the government's claim that Pakistan is no  longer an isolated country like before.    Whatever happened in Geneva is nothing but a clear  manifestation of the failure of Pakistan's foreign policy. It  has also been proven that not only did we fail to appease the  United States, but we also deprived ourselves of the warm  relationships we enjoyed with our traditional friends. India  has now declared that it will not allow ambassadors of Islamic  countries to visit Kashmir. The stand taken by the United States  and European countries on this occasion is very obvious.    The Pressler Amendment is a discriminatory law against  Pakistan as a result of which U.S. aid to Pakistan has remained  suspended since 1990. The previous government paid no attention  to improving relations with the United States or securing aid.  The previous government, by launching the self-reliance  program, created an impression that it did not need U.S. aid.  However, the present government is quite active in this regard  and it has been saying that restoration of warm relations with  the United States will be its major and historic achievement.  Propaganda was also launched about the withdrawal of the  Pressler Amendment. But the sweet dream has now vanished.  Because not only is the amendment still in place in its  original form and aid to Pakistan for 1995 stopped, but the  Clinton administration has also indirectly praised the  amendment. Robin Raphel said that the amendment has helped  bridle Pakistan's nuclear program. It seems that the talk of  warmth in Pakistan-U.S. relations was only fiction and we as a  nation were involved in self-deception in hoping that the new  government and its leader are capable of taming the United  States. Reports say that her proposed U.S. visit has also run  into trouble and expectations from the United States are not  likely to be fulfilled.    Given the situation, the government instead of keeping its  eyes closed like an ostrich should pay attention to overhauling  the country's foreign policy and make fresh initiatives for  creating a consensus between the government and the opposition  on major issues. It should also do away with mistakes which have  been causing successive failures.    We have tried every means to appease the United States and  put ourselves under its patronage only to find out that no  encouraging response has been forthcoming from the other side.  We are gradually losing the love and affection of our  defendable friends due to our efforts to appease the United  States. Our national dignity has also been injured due to our  policy and it has also stalled our forward movement toward the  goal of self-reliance. Therefore, instead of wasting any  further time, the government should take the opposition along  and devise a comprehensive strategy. It is not wise to keep  trying that which has already been tried. No one was surprised  at the U.S. behavior, but we are still being overwhelmed by  absurd optimism, or at least pretending to be.</p>

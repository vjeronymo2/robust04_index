			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the 'Talk of the Week' feature] </F>   [Text] Public attention is being paid to relations between  Vietnam and the Vatican, relations relating to Vietnamese  Catholics, the [words indistinct] relations. Mr. Vu Quang,  director of the government committee for religious affairs, in a  recent interview with the Vietnamese weekly DAI DOAN KET (Great  Solidarity) provided an outline on these issues.    Mr. Vu Quang said that in the middle of last month, the  Vatican sent a representative delegation headed by Deputy  Foreign Minister Claudio Celli to Vietnam for a week to work on  issues relating to Vietnamese Catholics and issues of mutual  concern. That follows the 1990 visit of Cardinal (?Wilsur  Heshgaray) to Vietnam. The cardinal and the Vietnamese  Government agreed that the Vatican would inform the Vietnamese  Government of all issues relating to Vietnamese Catholics, and  only make a decision upon agreement reached with the Vietnamese  Government. These issues include Vatican policy, the  consecration of cardinals, bishops, and issues of mutual  concern. When there are contradictory opinions, the two sides  will meet for discussion. Up to now, the Vatican has sent four  delegations to Vietnam, and Vietnam has also sent delegations to  the Vatican. Eighteen bishops have been consecrated out of the  approval of the Vietnamese Government upon office from the  Vatican. During the last month visit to Vietnam, the Vatican  reaffirmed the 1990 agreement. The Vatican delegation  acknowledged that it was illogical to have a number of dioceses  without bishops, as the Vatican delayed making a decision on  personnel that the Vatican has proposed in the first place in  which the Vietnamese Government has already approved. This  time, both sides agreed to find a solution to the issue soon.  The Vietnamese Government has agreed on the personnel proposed  by the Vatican and to the bishops of Hanoi and Hue dioceses.    As for the cases of Khanh Hoa and Thanh Hoa provinces, the  Vietnamese Government will consider an answer to Vatican in the  shortest period of time. In Ho Chi Minh City, both sides agreed  to keep up Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh in his position with full  responsibility and power. The Vietnamese Government will  discuss with the Vatican the successor to the archbishop in the  Ho Chi Minh City Diocese.    Vietnam makes clear that the Vatican by asking Vietnamese  Catholic priests not to join the Committee of United Vietnamese  Catholics with the reason that the priests should not carry out  political activities, the Vatican has [word indistinct]  Vietnamese law, citizen rights, and human rights for the priests  who have the rights to participate in social and patriotic  activities. Vietnam makes clear that while the Vatican  prevented Vietnamese Catholic priests from joining the Committee  of United Vietnamese Catholics and other social organizations it  lets some overseas Vietnamese Catholic priests carry out  political activities, and the Vatican itself, slandering the  situation of Vietnamese Catholics, and against the Vietnamese  Government. It is a lack of goodwill attitude towards Vietnam,  causing obstacles to normal relations between the Vatican and  Vietnam.    The head of the Vatican delegation will report to the  responsible priesthood in the Vatican on discussion in Vietnam,  to remove all obstacles to normalize relations between the  Vatican and the Vietnamese Government.</p>

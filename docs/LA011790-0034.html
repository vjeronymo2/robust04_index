			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STATE MAY DECERTIFY 'CREATIONIST' SCHOOL  </P> <P> A state Board of Education evaluation team has recommended that state approval  be removed from a school in San Diego County that is the only "creation  science" school in the country offering master's degrees.  </P> <P> The team's report recommends stripping the mantle of state legitimacy from the  Institute for Creation Research in Santee.  </P> <P> The report "seems reasonable to me," state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill  Honig said Tuesday, although he will not act on the recommendation for a month  or so.  </P> <P> Withdrawal of the state license might mean the end for the institute, which has  provided some of the ideological underpinning for the literal, fundamentalist  biblical interpretation of the creation of the Earth and life on it.  </P> <P> John Morris, administrative vice president of the institute, said the report is  part of "a very insidious plot" on Honig's part to "establish a state religion  in California" that would be "anti-creationist" in nature.  </P> <P> Morris said he had received no word of the evaluation team's report, but added  that "obviously we'll appeal if the ruling goes against us."  </P> <P> The institute has been authorized to grant master's degrees in biology,  geology, physics and science education since 1981, but has awarded only about  20 degrees in that time, Morris said.  </P> <P> For more than a year, Honig has been trying to drop state approval because he  thinks the school teaches religion, not science.  </P> <P> The evaluation report, written by a team of five college and university  scientists who visited the institute for several days last August, touches only  lightly on that controversy, but does find that the institute's offerings are  not comparable to other higher-education institutions.  </P> <P> The institute's curriculum "is not consistent in quality with curricula offered  by appropriate established accredited institutions," the report says, and its  courses "are not comparable to the courses required of graduates" of accredited  schools.  </P> <P> The report says the faculty has produced little reputable research, the library  and laboratories are inadequate and the courses do not prepare students to be  science teachers, which is one of the institute's main goals.  </P> <P> Honig said the negative findings, and the recommendation that state approval be  lifted, were unanimous on the part of the five-member team, which included two  science faculty members from UCLA, one from UC San Diego, one from California  State University, Long Beach and one from Cedarville College in Cedarville,  Ohio.  </P> <P> But the report states that Leroy E. Eimers, professor of physics and  mathematics at Cedarville, disagreed with some of the findings and recommended  that state approval be continued for the master's programs in geology, physics  and science education but not in biology. Eimers was named to the evaluation  group at the suggestion of the Institute for Creation Research.  </P> <P> This is Honig's second encounter with the forces of "creation science" in  recent months.  </P> <P> In November, after a dispute that lasted several months, the Board of Education  adopted curriculum guidelines for science textbooks that stress the teaching of  evolution as theory but delete references to evolution as scientific fact.  </P> <P> The dispute with the Institute for Creation Research began when the school  applied for renewal of its state license in 1987.  </P> <P> Non-accredited higher-education institutions must have state approval in order  to offer degrees.  </P> <P> Honig did not think an institution that taught its students that mountain  ranges could be created in a day and that Earth might be only 6,000 years old,  instead of about 4.5 billion years as most scientists believe, was very  educational.  </P> <P> However, those judgments are made by teams of experts, not by Honig's office.  Evaluators visited the Santee campus in the summer of 1988 and later wrote a  report recommending that state approval be withdrawn.  </P> <P> But the committee vote was 3 to 2, and one of its members switched his vote,  Department of Education sources said Tuesday.  </P> <P> After lengthy discussions among lawyers for both sides, it was determined that  the institute would make some curriculum changes and a new review would be  conducted in the summer of 1989. This is the negative report that was made  public Tuesday.  </P> <P> The institute can appeal to a state administrative law judge, who would  recommend that Honig either accept or reject the evaluation report.  </P> <P> The institute also can, and probably will, seek to overturn the decision in  court.  </P></p>

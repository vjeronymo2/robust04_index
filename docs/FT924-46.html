			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Pentos Life must indeed be tough if you find it difficult to sell cards at Christmas. Yet judging by yesterday's profits warning, Pentos' Athena chain is struggling to find a replacement for its wilting teenage market. That might not matter so much if the company's office furniture operation was not also having a miserable time. Despite ratio-nalisation neither is likely to help the main books business much next year. Which is a pity, because Dillons is unlikely to find bookselling much easier. Both Dillons and Waterstones have invested heavily in upmarket stores, soaking up cash. Yet there remain worries about the likely return on capital employed. With Waterstones backed by WH Smith, and Pentos' gearing rising, there can be little doubt who has the deeper pockets to fight a protracted battle. If the Pentos chairman gets his dearest wish and the net book agreement is abolished, he may just live to regret it.</p>

			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Hong Kong The market, which last week saw the Hang Seng index plunge 5 per cent to a low for the year, faces another raft of potentially negative news this week, writes Louise Lucas. Brokers say that regional funds, raising cash in anticipation of redemptions, are likely to continue selling while the dominant fear of rising interest rates will continue to deter investors. Today the market will be digesting Friday's unemployment figures from the US, but investors will also be acting on news of spiralling inflation in mainland China. An arm of the State Planning Commission reckons that the retail price index will rise by 21 per cent next year, which would be the biggest recorded jump since the Communist takeover in 1949. China shares have already been performing badly - the new H share listing, Zhenhai Refining and Chemical Company, fell 12.8 per cent on its debut on Friday. Compiled by Michael Morgan</p>

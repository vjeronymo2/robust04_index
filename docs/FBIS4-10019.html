			<p>BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 4 Apr (PL) -- Colombian Foreign  Minister Noemi Sanin has said she is pleased with the meeting  she held with her Cuban counterpart, Roberto Robaina, during a  stopover he made on his way to Uruguay, where today he started  an official visit until 6 April.    Robaina, who met with Sanin for 30 minutes tonight, is  making  an official visit to Ecuador, Peru, and Argentina. He will also  make an unofficial visit to Paraguay, a country with which Cuba  has yet to establish diplomatic relations.    In statements made to PRENSA LATINA and a Radio Rebelde  journalist accompanying the Cuban delegation, the Colombian  foreign minister reiterated that she will visit Havana on a date  that will be set soon.    She added that both she and Robaina are satisfied with the  Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO newspaper, which publicly  acknowledged it published unfounded information on an alleged  meeting between Colombian guerrillas in Havana.    As for the unfounded report, Sanin pointed out that she will  meet with Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff soon because his  office apparently provided reports that said an alleged former  guerrilla and an aide to the late drug trafficker chief Pablo  Escobar attended a meeting in Havana.</p>

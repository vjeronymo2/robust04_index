			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / UK shares reach record high on hopes of recovery THE UK stock market closed at record highs yesterday as investors gained confidence that economic recovery may be under way at last. Helped by Tuesday's higher prices on Wall Street, encouraging UK company results and hopes that the Bundesbank will cut German interest rates today, the FT-SE 100 index jumped by 36.3 points to a new closing high of 2,918.6. The FT-SE mid 250 index also posted a record closing high after a day in which a healthy 710m shares were traded. The market took heart from news of a sharp increase in new home sales so far this year. The Treasury's latest monthly monetary report, published yesterday, highlighted the upwards trend of retail sales and commented that demand and activity late last year 'appear to have been, if anything, a little stronger than assumed' in the government's Autumn Statement of last year. However, the patchy and fragile nature of any recovery was underlined by a Nationwide Building Society report that house prices fell 1.4 per cent in February and a warning from the Confederation of British Industry that unemployment is unlikely to fall below 2.25m even after recovery has become established. The share price jump coincided with a determined attempt by the government to talk up prospects for recovery. Mr John Major, the prime minister, again castigated what he called the 'doom-mongers' attempting to paint a picture of a nation in decline. He pointed to record exports, rapid growth in productivity and low inflation as evidence of the underlying strength of the economy. Lex, Page 20 London stocks, Page 40</p>

Units, bandit formations, and groups, which  penetrate into the territory of Tajikistan with hostile  intentions, are making attempts to cross the state frontier  almost continually.    The prime purpose of these attempts is reconnaissance,  sabotage, and terrorism. And tension is arising as a result of  these attempts.    There are also formations which have gone underground in  Tajikistan, and I think that they are also, for the time being,  not disposed toward keeping the peace.    The most important thing is that, along with the border  guards, Tajikistan's national army, and units and elements of  the Interior Ministry, the peacekeeping forces have taken steps  to guarantee, as far as possible, peaceful conditions for  constructive work in Tajikistan.

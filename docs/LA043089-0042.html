			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Soviet Jewish immigrants living in Israel have submitted a record number of  invitations for their relatives to come from the Soviet Union, Israel Radio  reported. It said about 79,000 invitations were submitted to Soviet authorities  last year, the highest annual figure since the late 1960s. An invitation from  relatives living abroad is a necessary step for a person wishing to emigrate  from the Soviet Union. Uri Gordon, head of the Jewish Agency's immigration  department, was quoted by the radio as estimating that Soviet Jewish emigration  will reach 50,000 this year.  </P></p>

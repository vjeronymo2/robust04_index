			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Violeta Pacheco] </F>   [Text] Veracruz, Ver., 3 April--Sinaloa, Chihuahua, and  Durango States are the ones with the greatest incidence of  marijuana and poppy growing; hence, "the operations conducted by  the National Defense Secretariat in its battle against the drug  traffic are being constantly reinforced." This statement was  made today by the commander of the 13th Infantry Battalion  Garrison, General Fernan Perez Casanova.    He explained that, for four months, from November to March,  a  contingent of 300 members of that battalion, headquartered in  this port, backed the action to combat marijuana and poppy  growing.    He added that, as a result, 2,073 marijuana plantations,  covering an area of 2,128 square meters, were destroyed. He also  reported the destruction of 5,109 poppy plantations covering  5,446 square meters, and of another 2,907 kg of marijuana, as  well as the incineration of 30 kg of the same grass already  packed.    Moreover, he cited the incineration of 152.45 kg of  marijuana  seed, and 140.61 kg of poppy seed.    Perez Casanova remarked that, during these same operations,  11 persons illegally carrying firearms for the exclusive use of  the Mexican Army and Air Force were captured. He specified that  seven long-range and 10 short-range weapons were seized in the  activities.    In conclusion, he commented that, although the incidence of  marijuana and poppy growing in Veracruz State is low,  reconnaissance and inspection flights are nevertheless being  made constantly to establish the sites for destructive  operations when plantations of these drugs are detected.</p>

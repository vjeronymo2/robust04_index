These funds were remitted by Sunset to the DOE to settle possible pricing violations with respect to Sunset's sales of refined petroleum products during the period August 1, 1979 through January 27, 1980. The DOE determined that the funds will be distributed in accordance with the DOE's Subpart V refund procedures. Applications for Refund will be accepted from customers who purchased controlled refined petroleum products from Sunset during the period covered by the settlement. The specific information to be included in the Applications for Refunds, which must be submitted by June 1, 1995, is included in the Decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Refund Application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Charter Company/California, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->  09/15/94,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> RM23&hyph;270 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting a Motion for Modification filed by the State of California in the Charter Company second stage refund proceeding. In its Motion, California proposed to reallocate $850,000 of previously disbursed Charter monies to fund four transportation-related energy conservation projects. In accordance with prior Decisions, where we have noted the benefits of similar plans involving public transit and traffic synchronization systems, the DOE approved California's Motion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Marie-Goretti Uwibambe] </F>   [Excerpts] Kigali, 22 Feb (AFP) -- Rwandan politicians  prepared to set up a transitional administration including  former rebels on Tuesday [22 February], despite the overnight  murder of a government minister and street protests against the  plan. Public Works and Energy Minister Felicien Gatabazi, a  leading member of the opposition Social Democratic Party, was  shot dead late Monday, Radio Rwanda reported.    Paramilitary police said Gatabazi was assassinated outside  his home by gunmen waiting nearby. The killers, who have not  been identified, escaped after the attack.    A spokesman for the UN Assistance Mission (UNAMIR) in the  troubled central African nation declared, however, that the  inauguration of the transitional government and parliament was  set to go ahead Tuesday despite the violence. "We are still  invited (to the ceremonies) at 2:00 P.M. (1200 GMT)," the  spokesman said.    Supporters of political parties opposed to the transition  plan meanwhile threw up barricades on several of Kigali's main  thoroughfares, while schools and administrative offices were  closed. [passage omitted]    Violence in the run-up to the new administration saw five  people killed here on Sunday, "two or three" during an  opposition demonstration and the others by bandits, according to  a UNAMIR spokesman.    The radio said police had to intervene late Monday to rescue  around 30 officials seized at the Foreign Ministry during a  demonstration organised by the Coalition for the Defence of the  Republic, a group claiming to represent the interests of Hutus.  The formation of the transitional administration has already  been delayed three times.    Gatabazi, a government minister on two occasions in the  1980s, returned to office in 1990, and was his party's candidate  for the post of public works and energy minister in the  government to be inaugurated Tuesday.</p>

			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Spices The pepper market was more active this week as more buyers tried to cover neglected positions, reports Man Producten. White pepper remained very steady. Selling pressure was limited because of the Chinese year. Spot white was quoted at USDollars 2,900 a tonne and nearby shipment at Dollars 2,750 cif. Black pepper prices continued to rise as reports from India indicated that the new crop was even worse than expected. It remains to be seen whether there will be much pepper left for export purposes because India's consumption must be at least 30.000 tonnes and the crop may fall short by some 40.000 tonnes. In response to the Indian situation other producers increased their prices or withdrew completely. Spot black No. 1 was offered at Dollars 1,600-Dollars 1,650 a tonne, with forward positiomns commanding premiums.</p>

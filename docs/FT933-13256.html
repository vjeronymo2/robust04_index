			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Status of France Telecom to be changed MR GERARD Longuet, the French minister for industry, post and telecommunications, yesterday announced plans to transform the state telephone company, France Telecom, into a joint stock company with majority state control. A statement from the industry ministry said that the change in status could help the company expand internationally and forge alliances with international telecom companies. The move is also designed to prepare France Telecom for the liberalisation of the European telecoms market due to take place on January 1 1998. Telecoms analysts said Mr Longuet's decision partly reflected concerns that France Telecom had failed to clinch an alliance with MCI, the US telecoms company. France Telecom and Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, its German counterpart, lost out to the privatised British Telecom which bought a 20 per cent stake in the US company last month. 'It was a failure to lose MCI,' Mr Longuet said in an interview with Les Echos, the French financial daily, earlier this month. 'We were beaten to the post by BT.' Mr Longuet has also expressed his belief that Deutsche Bundespost Telekom is 'a natural partner on the European continent'. Mr Marcel Roulet, president of France Telecom, has indicated in several statements since the beginning of this month that he foresees crossholdings with the German telecommunications operator once the statutes of France Telecom have been changed. Until 1991, France Telecom was an 'administration', or a branch of the government. It then changed to become an 'autonomous operator under public law'. The process of changing the status of France Telecom, which will require legislation, is expected to take several months.</p>

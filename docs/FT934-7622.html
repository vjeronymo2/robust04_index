			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Inflation still enemy of US economy, says OECD: Report views policy today as stimulative rather than neutral, even as it forecasts moderate growth THE Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's advocacy of higher US interest rates may seem surprising given its relative optimism about the US inflation outlook and its projection of growth, moderate by the standards of past business cycles. The Paris-based research body of the industrialised countries is forecasting a slight decline in US consumer price inflation to 2.7 per cent next year against 2.8 per cent this year. Gross domestic product growth, meanwhile, is expected to accelerate slightly, to 3.0 per cent against 2.8 per cent this year. This would reduce the jobless rate (on the present definition) to 6.4 per cent by the end of next year, high enough by most economists' reckoning to sustain downward pressure on wage inflation. Had the OECD been using the US labor department's new series for unemployment, however, it might have forecast a jobless rate of close to 7 per cent by the end of 1994. Many economists will argue that such an outlook does not warrant more than a light touch on the monetary brakes. Yet OECD officials say the Federal Reserve should raise short-term interest rates from 3 per cent today to close to 5 per cent by the end of next year. Much of the increase, moreover, should occur in the first half of next year. The OECD starts from the assumption that inflation of about 3 per cent is too high. Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, is taken at his word when he says he wants to reduce inflation to the point where it no longer influences business decisions. That, argues the OECD, means a rate of about 2 per cent. Reducing inflation significantly while a business upswing is under way requires a significant tightening of monetary policy. OECD officials argue that US policy today is stimulative rather than neutral. They estimate that inflation-adjusted short-term interest rates have averaged about 1.25 per cent since 1960. A neutral monetary policy would thus require short-term rates of about 4.25 per cent rather than 3 per cent. The issue is thus when to 'rein in the stimulus'. Then there is the problem of policy lags. The US needs to raise interest rates, argues the OECD, not to fight inflation next year, but to ensure that it does not get out of hand in 1995 and 1996. The longer the Fed postpones a policy adjustment the larger will be the required increase in rates. Economists at the OECD argue that if short-term rates are raised to about 5 per cent by the end of 1994 and held there for a year, no further tightening would be needed. The peak of interest rates in this cycle would be a relatively benign 5 per cent, compared with about 9 per cent in the late 1980s. A reduction in rates might be feasible in 1996 - which would be politically convenient as that is an election year. The OECD's overall assessment of US trends is positive. It notes that projections of 3 per cent growth and only a modest decline in the jobless rate will strike many Americans as disappointing. But 'it is actually rather satisfactory, given the weakness of export markets and the ongoing structural adjustments that must be faced . . .'. It expects a cyclical increase in the US current account deficit, from 1.1 per cent of GDP in 1992 to 2 per cent in 1994, but does not view this with alarm because it reflects faster growth of demand in the US than elsewhere. Despite the bigger deficit, 'the very favourable cost position of US manufacturers ought to boost the US share of export markets'. The OECD praises the Clinton administration's efforts to reduce the budget deficit, but it warns that the big increase in tax rates on high earners may raise less revenue than expected. And it notes that the ratio of debt to GDP will continue to rise. In 1997, when the economy is expected to be at full employment, the deficit will be 'disappointingly large, at over 2 1/2 per cent of GDP'. In a lengthy assessment of US productivity trends, the OECD concludes that the US is still easily the world's most productive economy. But it warns that 'the US productivity standard is likely to be surpassed in the next decade or so by a number of countries' because most other industrial economies are saving and investing more of national income than the US. The OECD claims there is no convincing evidence as yet that the recent wave of corporate restructuring has significantly raised the US trend rate of productivity. And it warns that 'growing skill-based disparities in employment and earnings have the makings of a major social problem'.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US ECONOMIC OUTLOOK (% change in volume from previous period, seasonally adjusted at annual rates - 1987 prices)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            1992   1993   1994      1993        1994                                                 I    II     I    II  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Private consumption         2.6    3.2    2.8   2.6   3.5   2.6   2.6 Government consumption     -0.1   -0.6   -0.3  -2.6   1.4  -0.9  -0.7 Gross fixed investment      6.2    9.5    9.2  11.0   7.1  10.0   9.7   of which:   Residential              16.3    7.4    8.6   5.4   5.5  10.0   8.8   Non-residential           2.9   10.4    9.4  13.2   7.7  10.0  10.0 Final domestic demand       2.5    3.4    3.2   2.9   3.7   3.1   3.1 Stockbuilding*              0.3    0.2    0.1   0.5  -0.3   0.3   0 Total domestic demand       2.9    3.6    3.3   3.3   3.4   3.4   3.1 Exports of goods and   services                  6.4    3.1    4.9   1.8   3.4   5.1   5.9 Imports of goods and   services                  8.7    9.3    7.3  10.5   6.3   7.7   7.5 GDP at constant prices      2.6    2.8    3.0   2.3   3.0   3.0   2.9 GDP at current prices       5.5    5.6    5.4   5.5   5.1   5.5   5.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Memorandum items Private consumption   deflator                  3.3    2.8    2.7   3.1   2.2   2.9   2.8 Unemployment rate           7.4    6.8    6.5   7.0   6.7   6.6   6.4 Three-month Treasury   bill rate                 3.4    3.0    4.1   3.0   3.0   3.7   4.5 Ten-year Treasury note rate 7.0    5.9    5.5   6.1   5.6   5.5   5.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Net lending of general government   Dollars bn               -269   -244   -195   Per cent of GDP          -4.5   -3.8   -2.9 Current account balance   Dollars bn                -66   -107   -135   Per cent of GDP          -1.1   -1.7   -2.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * The yearly and half-yearly rates of change refer to changes expressed as a percentage of GDP in the previous period.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: OECD estimates  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

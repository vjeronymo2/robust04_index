			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Former managers to aid pit areas REDUNDANT and retired managers are to be recruited for a 'timeshare' scheme piloted by Recharge North East, an initiative launched yesterday to help regenerate former coalfield areas in north-east England, Chris Tighe writes. Recharge will employ managers on part-time contracts, placing them in small and medium-sized enterprises on tasks aimed at helping companies survive and grow. Recharge's director, Mr Danny Sharpe, a former deputy director of the Department of Trade and Industry in the region, said many smaller companies lacked spare management capacity to implement the advice they were given. The Pounds 3m, three-year Recharge initiative is funded by the DTI, British Coal Enterprise and the European Community's Rechar programme for declining mining areas.</p>

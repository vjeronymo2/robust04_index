			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / This Week: Music Another fruitful venture into the EMI archives has resulted in a vibrant new collection of works by Sir William Walton, all conducted by the composer. The Walton Edition, a four-CD set of remastered recordings which have never appeared before on CD, includes a stirring account of the composer's First Symphony; both the violin and viola concertos performed by Yehudi Menuhin; and the Johannesburg Festival Overture. Those looking for patriotic fervour will enjoy the recording Walton made with Sir Laurence Olivier of scenes from Henry V, its first complete appearance since it was released on 78. Joe Jackson's first album for three years, Night Music (Virgin), is a continuation of his excursions into alien - for a traditional pop star  - territory, featuring a pleasing variety of styles and compositional approaches. While there is a touch of pretension about an album containing four 'nocturnes', there is little doubt that Jackson has always been a more legitimate cross-over artist than most, showing little regard for fads. And now for something . . . Python mania shows no sign of abating, with the release of the six-CD box set The Instant Monty Python CD Collection by Virgin. If you think that is a little over-the-top, The Ultimate Monty Python Rip-Off contains highlights, though it is hard to imagine how anyone can keep getting a laugh from listening to the Lumberjack Song over and over again. Briefly: the Cambridge Singers celebrate four centuries of music written for multiple choirs on A Banquet of Voices (Collegium), including works by Allegri, Bach and Brahms; Martin Souter tackles another set of Bach chorale preludes on the famous 1696 Noordbroek Schnitger organ (Isis); Bon Jovi continue to wave the flag for hard rock with a collection of their greatest hits, Cross Road - The Best of Bon Jovi (Mercury); and Elton John and Tim Rice collaborate on the sound-track to Walt Disney's The Lion King (Mercury).</p>

			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY EARNINGS: HUNTWAY REPORTS LOSS OF $1.6 MILLION IN 4TH QUARTER  </P> <P> Huntway Partners, a Valencia-based producer of liquid asphalt, said it lost  $1.62 million in the fourth quarter of 1989 despite a 35% jump in revenue.  </P> <P> The loss in the quarter that ended Dec. 31 compared with a $441,000 loss a year  earlier, and reflected lower profit margins due to severe price competition in  the liquid-asphalt industry, Huntway said.  </P> <P> Liquid asphalt is derived from crude oil, and the rise in oil prices in the  quarter helped lift Huntway's revenue to $24.2 million from $17.9 million.  </P> <P> For all of 1989, Huntway lost $1.78 million compared with a $3.16-million  profit a year earlier, and its revenue rose 8% to $89.5 million from $82.8  million.  </P> <P> Huntway went public in November, 1988, and used the proceeds to reduce its  debt. Its 1988 financial results are on a pro forma basis: that is, they  reflect what Huntway's results would have been had Huntway gone public and  reduced its debt at the start of 1988.  </P></p>

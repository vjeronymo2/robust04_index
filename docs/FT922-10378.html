			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Second half puts Filofax in black FILOFAX wiped out its first half loss to record a pre-tax profit of Pounds 493,000 for 1991, compared with a deficit of Pounds 1.55m. Mr Robin Field, chief executive, said the improved performance - the second half produced Pounds 1.1m - was the result of the international market for ring binder organisers remaining strong, success of new products introduced in the second half of 1990 and in 1991, and the fruits coming through of work done on the international distribution network. The outcome reflected an improvement in gross margins - turnover came to Pounds 10.7m (Pounds 11.1m) - as well as the strict control of overheads. Earnings per share worked through at 2.5p (losses 9.5p). Reorganisation and restructuring costs of Pounds 602,000 (Pounds 1.3m) were provided. Those were the last exceptional charges directly resulting from the new strategy. US sales for 1991 were 14 per cent ahead in dollar terms despite an overall decline in the stationery market.</p>

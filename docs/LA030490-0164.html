			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE SHERIFF'S ACTIONS  </P> <P> The "silent majority" is sick and tired of Sheriff (Brad) Gates' errors in  judgment. He continues to cost we taxpayers excessive amounts of monies for  attorney fees, court costs and settlement damages.  </P> <P> Why should the County Board of Supervisors authorize these payments? Let him be  responsible for his own actions and surely he'll be far more careful.  </P> <P> DAN BROWN  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / UK Company News: YRM falls 40% and sees no sign of improvement YRM, the architecture and building design company, announced a 40 per cent contraction in interim profits as the recession in the construction industry continued to bite. The pre-tax outcome for the six months to October 31 amounted to Pounds 534,000, against Pounds 888,000 last time, on turnover down to Pounds 10.2m (Pounds 12.3m). Mr Tim Poulson, chief executive, said: 'the year ahead will be as difficult as any we have faced so far, but we are in good shape to face it.' The group has fared better than some of its competitors, partly because it is broader based and partly because it has cut costs aggressively. Staff numbers have been reduced by about 30 per cent since 1990. It has been appointed consultant for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London, and has also won the commission for the New Museum of Scotland. Directors hope that overseas business, which accounted for 3 per cent of turnover, could be lifted following the opening of an office in Berlin and a joint venture in the Middle East. Mr Poulson said overseas earnings would increase to 5-10 per cent of total turnover this year. The company has a longer term target to lift that figure to 25 per cent, he added. Earnings dropped to 2.54p (4.1p) but the interim dividend is maintained at 1.65p.</p>

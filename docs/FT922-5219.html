			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Justinian: A trespasser in the skies If a helicopter hovers over X's house for five to 10 minutes in order to take photographs for the purpose of publishing them in a national newspaper, what remedy (if any) does X have against the newspaper and the photographer? That question might currently, or in the recent past, be found in an examination paper for budding lawyers or journalists. It provides one of the quiddities of media law, which continues to intrigue students of the invasion of privacy. The problem was given an airing last week in an adjudication from the Press Complaints Commission. It rejected a complaint against the Daily Mail, which had published a story with photographs (obtained aerially from a helicopter) of the home of Mr David Sullivan, the publisher of Sunday Sport. The newspaper was held not to have invaded Mr Sullivan's privacy and, in any event, the newspaper was entitled to defend itself on the ground that its story was a matter of public interest. In acquitting the newspaper, did the commission have one eye firmly on a recommendation made by Lord Calcutt's committee two years ago which so far has not found favour with either government or parliament? The Calcutt committee, in rejecting the idea of providing a civil law remedy for the invasion of privacy, was keen nevertheless to see some remedy introduced into the criminal law in order to deter the worst journalistic excesses involving physical intrusion into people's lives. The committee identified three situations: the physical entry into private property for the purpose of obtaining personal information for publication; the placing of bugging devices on private property for that purpose; and the photographing of individuals or the recording of their voices on private property for that purpose - in each case without the individual's consent. A defence to the proposed offence of criminal trespass would be that the act was carried out to prevent, detect or expose the commission of any crime or other seriously antisocial conduct, or for the protection of public health or safety or 'under any lawful authority'. The committee rejected the idea of making it a further offence to publish any photograph, information or recording obtained by illegal methods. It was circumspect about creating an offence of publishing material where the point at issue would be how it was obtained, rather than the content. The proprietor or editor could always be prosecuted as an accessory to the proposed offences, or for conspiracy. The essence of the proposed criminal offences is the motive of the 'trespasser'. Fifteen years ago, Lord Bernstein, the founder of the Granada entertainment group, brought an action in the high court against a company engaged in the business of taking aerial photographs of properties, without the owners' consent, and then offering the product to the owners for sale. A single photograph taken by a helicopter which flew over Lord Bernstein's country estate was offered, and contemptuously turned down, at a price of Pounds 15. The trial judge dismissed the action for trespass on the ground that Lord Bernstein did not own the air space over his land. As Lord Wilberforce once pronounced in a different legal context, to suggest that 'land' means the whole of the space from the centre of the earth to the heavens was 'so sweeping, unscientific and impractical a doctrine' that it would not appeal to any legal, let alone a non-legal, mind. But what about an invasion of privacy? The judge held that the mere taking of a photograph was not unlawful. It was not possible, therefore, to transform an act which was not a trespass into one, in the absence of a law of privacy. In Lord Bernstein's case, however, the photographing was distinctly not for any journalistic purpose. The judge warned that he did not wish his judgment to be understood as deciding that in no circumstances could a successful action be brought against an aerial photographer to restrain his activities. If an individual was subjected to the harassment of constant surveillance of his house from the air, accompanied by photographing of his every activity, the court might regard that as an unwarranted invasion of privacy and an actionable nuisance for which the court would give relief. But the single act of photography, restricted to one short period, would be unlikely to arouse the ire of the law to the point of classifying it as a nuisance. Hence the Calcutt committee's desire to fill the gap, by creating three offences of criminal trespass exclusively where a journalistic purpose was being effected. The route that legislators might take, in the light of the Press Complaints Commission adjudication, is to provide a civil remedy, rather than contemplate the risk of putting a journalist or an editor in the dock. Aerial surveillance is more susceptible to abuse and invasion of privacy than ground surveillance. And helicopters, with their virtually unlimited manoeuvrability, are particularly likely to intrude unreasonably upon private activities. Perhaps a single amendment to section 76 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 (dealing with the liability of aircraft for trespass, nuisance and surface damage) would suffice.</p>

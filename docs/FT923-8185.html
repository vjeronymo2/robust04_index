			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / North American Free Trade Agreement: Disagreements subjected to speedy conciliation - Disputes procedure THE Nafta agreement's mechanism for settling trade disputes builds on what has become one of the most successful elements of the 1989 US-Canada free trade agreement (FTA), writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. It also proposes several important changes, however. The binational panels empowered to review anti-dumping and countervailing duty decisions will be extended to cover complaints by Mexican companies. This is a big concession by the Mexicans because the panels will replace judicial review by the Mexican courts. Another departure from the FTA is the creation a Nafta Trade Commission. Prior to any panels being set up, disputes will have to be referred to the commission, which is to use 'good offices, mediation, conciliation or other means of alternative dispute resolution' to find a solution. Only if the commission fails to hammer out an agreement will a binational panel be set up. Unlike FTA practice, where all panel members are either US or Canadian officials, the Nafta provides for trade or legal experts from non-Nafta countries to be on the roster of potential members. In a further pursuit of impartiality, each side to a dispute will choose two members from the roster supplied by the country of the other party. The president of the panel will be chosen by mutual agreement or by drawing lots. One reason for the success of the FTA panels is that each stage of dispute settlement is subject to strict time limits. Nafta proposes an even speedier process. A panel will be required to provide a confidential initial report within three months of its selection. Parties to the dispute will then have two weeks to submit their comments. The panel will have to issue its final findings within 30 days of the initial report. The draft treaty allows for retaliation against a country which refuses to implement a panel's recommendations or fails to reach some other agreement within 30 days of the panel's report. Complainants will be allowed to choose between Nafta and Gatt dispute settlement procedures. Having chosen one, they may not use the other. The draft Nafta agreement also provides for a committee to be set up to consider arbitration procedures in disputes between private investors and any of the three Nafta governments.</p>

			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] A recent visit by Prime Minister Vaclav  Klaus to major Latin American countries emphasized the continued  efforts by the Czech Government to expand the republic's  exports. Economics Minister Karel Dyba also promoted trade links  during his late April visit to Taiwan.  <H5>  Latin America Trip </H5>   According to the 27 April issue of HOSPODARSKE NOVINY,  Klaus's visit, which included a large delegation of businessmen,  confirmed the growing Czech interest in Latin America. As Klaus  explained, "In this market we are achieving the highest sales in  value-added products; three times more machinery and machine  tools are going to South America than to industrially developed  countries."    Milos Sklenka, a HOSPODARSKE NOVINY correspondent who  accompanied the delegation, said that Klaus's tour of Latin  America, as well as his visit to Mexico last year, demonstrated  that the rapidly developing markets on the Latin subcontinent  could be very advantageous to the Czech Republic. Sklenka noted  that during Klaus's stay in Buenos Aires, Santiago de Chile, and  Brasilia, he proposed removing tariff and nontariff restrictions  and increasing mutual trade, eventually leading to the  establishment of a free trade zone.    Sklenka also reported on the Latin American hosts' reaction  to the visit, pointing out that there was substantial interest  in the Czech model of privatization and macroeconomic policy.  Argentina appeared to be particularly enthusiastic about the  proposal, asserting that it could be implemented within three  years. Chile's response was relatively reserved, although  Chilean leaders did not reject the proposals altogether. Brazil,  meanwhile, appeared to be pressing for more regional trade  liberalization.    According to Sklenka's report, Klaus's talks with the  Argentine President Carlos Menem and Economic Minister D.  Cavallo concluded with a memorandum of understanding between the  two countries on preparing an agreement for a future free trade  zone. The participants in the meeting expressed hope that it  will eventually lead to free trade between Central European  markets and the South American Mercosure (Argentina, Brazil,  Uruguay, and Paraguay). New agreements are to be concluded on  investment support and guarantees, dual taxation, and visa-less  diplomatic travel. In the 22 April issue of HOSPODARSKE NOVINY,  Sklenka published an interview with Cavallo, who said that  "while Argentina should become a gateway for Czech products to  South America, we would like the Czech Republic to become a  catalyst for the expansion of Argentine trade in Central and  Eastern Europe."    In Chile, Sklenka reported, Klaus led the negotiations with  President Eduardo Frei and Finance Minister Eduardo Aninate on  greater trade liberalization between the two countries. During  the last year, Czech exports to Chile ($5.6 million), which were  three times higher than imports, consisted mainly of iron and  steel, tractors, trucks, and textiles. Meanwhile, Chile exported  to the Czech Republic mainly fruit and vegetables, but also some  cotton, raw materials, and cattle feed. This trade had come to a  virtual halt during the Pinochet government from 1973 to 1990.  <H5>  Taiwan Trip </H5>   Karel Dyba was accompanied to Taiwan by the president of the  Industrial and Transportation Chamber, Stepan Popovich, and  several industrial representatives. According to the 25 April  issue of HOSPODARSKE NOVINY, Czech "industry captains" spent  five days negotiating trade relations with the Taiwanese  semigovernmental organization CENTRA, which provides assistance  to Taiwanese foreign trade. It is expected that a text of an  agreement with the Taiwanese CNFT (Chinese National Federation  of Industry) would be approved. The agreement is to cover  information exchange, support of business exchanges, mutual  trade stimulation, and production cooperation. The Chamber vice  president, Pavel Prior, stressed to the Chinese the advantages  of investing in the Czech Republic and expressed hope that the  Taiwanese would help them penetrate the Asian markets.    In the same issue of HOSPODARSKE NOVINY, Pavel Prior noted  that competition in Asia is very keen. The Czechs recently lost  a bid to build a metro for the Japanese, and apparently the  Taiwanese expect better banking terms than the CSOB [Czech  National Bank] seemed to be willing to offer.</p>

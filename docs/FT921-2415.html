			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (53): Coping with rapid changes in the insurance industry - User View CHARLES TAYLOR shipping insurance works in a business where demands constantly change, writes Claire Gooding. Dealing with that change - according to Gordon Groves, director of information systems - was the main motivation for considering a new database, and, he hopes, will be the main benefit of the new Informix database now running on a Unix-based MIPS 6280. 'One of our problems is a two-year development backlog: another was that information couldn't be shared internally. The insurance market changes so fast that we need to keep abreast of changes, and I hope we'll be able to offer an improved service to our existing clients.' Charles Taylor's previous system was a DEC-based, with applications written in DEC Basic. Gordon Groves was keen to move to open systems: other items on the shopping list were SQL, for easy applications development, a relational database, and a fourth generation language, (4GL). Both of the short-listed solutions, Unify/Accel and Informix, were set the same problem. TIS, the supplier of the chosen MIPS hardware, according to Mr Groves, 'solved it more easily, with an elegant, quick and more flexible solution.' The contract, worth Pounds 300,000 for the computer, and Pounds 500,000 for the software, went to TIS and Informix, with TIS doing initial training, and Informix providing more specialised training on its most recent products. Eventually, the installation will support more than 100 users, all of whom will have direct access through the end-user language.</p>

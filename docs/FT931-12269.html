			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Cambodia's ambitious prince wins out: Sihanouk has bent the UN's most expensive peacekeeping mission to his will THE FACT that yesterday's meeting of the Cambodian Supreme National Council was held 3,000 miles away from Cambodia - in Beijing - was only the latest indication of how the volatile Prince Norodom Sihanouk has bent the UN's most expensive peacekeeping mission to his will. Prince Sihanouk says he needs to stay in Beijing to be tended by his Chinese doctors, and is thought to have suffered a minor stroke recently. But this has not stopped the 70-year-old prince from cajoling and in some cases strong-arming the five permanent members of the UN Security Council into accepting his plan to have him elected Cambodian president. Cambodian elections, threatened by continued violence and intimidation of voters, were one of the main topics of discussions in Beijing yesterday between the four Cambodian factions, the UN, and various governments. The Cambodian peace accords signed in Paris in October 1991 provided for a general election to be held in May this year under UN auspices, part of an operation costing about Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn). Yesterday's meeting agreed that the election would take place between May 23 and 25. The accords made no mention of a presidential poll, but Prince Sihanouk has persuaded most of the signatories that his presidency will be vital for the stability of Cambodia, particularly while the soon-to-be-elected national assembly works to approve a constitution and form a government. Another reason, frequently repeated by the prince in private, is his desire to win a popular mandate for his leadership and blot out the ignominy of his overthrow in a coup by Lon Nol in 1970. France, Russia and China were content with the idea of Prince Sihanouk becoming president before the general election. The US, Britain and the UN were not. The prince forced them to agree: by retiring to Beijing and sulking, by briefly carrying out a threat to cease co-operating with the UN, and by refusing to sign agreements for much-needed loans from institutions such as the World Bank (in his capacity as SNC chairman). UN officials and western diplomats muttered 'blackmail', but yielded to the prince, leaving only the timing of the presidential election unresolved. The risks involved in alienating the ambitious prince - revered by peasants as Cambodia's 'god-king' - were evidently too high. But diplomats involved in the negotiations over Cambodia are painfully aware that there are dangers in making him president. First, they fear that his authoritarian tendencies, amply demonstrated in the past, will come to the fore in an office whose powers cannot be defined until there is a Cambodian constitution in August. There is already worried talk of 'a new Sangkum', a reference to a movement created by the prince in 1955 which defeated his long-established political opponents with considerable help from a campaign of intimidation and repression. Second, there is concern that Prince Sihanouk's weaknesses will be ruthlessly exploited by the Khmer Rouge, the extreme left-wing group blamed for the deaths of 1m Cambodians between the overthrow of Lon Nol in 1975 and the Vietnamese invasion of 1978. The Khmer Rouge has repeatedly violated the Paris accords by breaking the ceasefire and refusing to allow the UN access to its territory, although it signed the agreements in 1991 and is one of the four factions represented on the SNC. It has rejected the elections and is not among the 20 parties that applied for registration before the Wednesday's deadline. Yet, like almost any Cambodian leader, Prince Sihanouk will be so appalled by the idea of a divided country after the elections (most of it under government control and the rest in the hands of the Khmer Rouge) that he might be tempted to invite the Khmer Rouge into some form of coalition to reunify the country. The Khmer Rouge would thus have achieved political legitimacy - while ducking the blow to their credibility which would have come from doing badly in an election - and retained control over their territory, their people, their gems and their timber in the remote north-west. As one academic who studies Cambodia put it recently, the problem is that 'Sihanouk thinks he can manipulate the Khmer Rouge, and the Khmer Rouge think they can easily manipulate him.' At present, most of the diplomatic energy directed at Cambodia is focused on a dispute over the date of the presidential election. Typically, Prince Sihanouk has made three consecutive and contradictory statements: first he said it should be before the general elections; then he said it could be simultaneous; and then he said it should be afterwards. It is an open secret that what he actually wants is an early presidential poll to allow him to take charge as soon as possible, but those who were reluctant about the whole idea in the first place fear he would try to declare a 'Cambodian solution' and cancel the general election if he were made president too soon.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Need For Revision of Rules <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to Departmental Regulation 1512&hyph;1, the Forest Service has reviewed 36 CFR Part 261_Prohibitions and 36 CFR Part 262_Law Enforcement Support Activities to determine their current applicability in view of new and changing laws, conditions, and other factors affecting the management of the National Forest System, employees, and the general public. By letter of September 8, 1987, the Chief of the Forest Service asked each Regional and Washington Office staff unit to review the current rules and to make suggestions on any needed revisions. This Service-wide review has revealed a need to revise the rules in order to more effectively respond to recent changes in laws, regulations and policy, and emerging law enforcement issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Protection of Forest Users and Visitors <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Without exception, Forest Service regions cited an inadequate regulatory basis for conducting law enforcement activities in certain areas when State and local authorities are unable to provide law enforcement services associated with violations of State or local law occurring on the National Forest System. This situation occurs as a result of a number of factors, one being the inability of small local law enforcement agencies to respond quickly to all but the most violent of crimes against users (murder, rape and other assaults). Many local law enforcement agencies find that their limited personnel, the distant location of Forest Service areas, and the seasonal nature of use these areas receive are impediments to rapid response to crimes committed on the National Forest System. When State and local law enforcement units cannot respond promptly, and trained and equipped Forest officers are at a location where persons need help or encounter criminal activity affecting those persons, the Forest Service should be in a position to render emergency assistance. Because Forest officers generally cannot enforce State laws, the agency needs rules which will make certain State crimes violations of Forest Service regulations. The authority provided by 16 U.S.C. 551 allows regulating occupancy and use even if such regulation is not necessary for the protection of forest resources ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hymans,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 463 F.2d 615 (10th Cir. 1972)). To prohibit, for example, the theft of visitors' personal property is a reasonable regulation of the use of the forests and should help to keep visits to the national forests enjoyable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Expanded Forest Service Law Enforcement Authority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There is a need to revise the regulations to reflect expanded authority granted by statutes enacted since the rules were last revised, specifically, certain provisions of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 (18 U.S.C. 3559, 3571), and the National Forest System Drug Control Act of 1986 as amended (16 U.S.C. 559b&hyph;g). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Technical Corrections <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There is a need to make technical corrections in terminology and citations in several places in the rules, including revising the Authority citations for both parts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Felony Case Prosecution Requests <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There is a need to incorporate certain statutes contained in the Federal Criminal Code into agency rules to facilitate enforcing such statutes as misdemeanors rather than as felonies. This will help reduce agency felony case prosecution requests presented to the U.S. Department of Justice as well as provide for a speedier resolution of certain cases. Examples of these kinds of cases include intimidation and impersonation of Forest Service employees, use of controlled substances, unauthorized use of Forest Service computer systems, and thefts of certain government property or resources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

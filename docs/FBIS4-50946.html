			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing] </F>   [Text] In denying a Western news agency's report that  dissident Wei Jingsheng was about to be indicted on charges of  treason, China's Public Security Ministry went by the book --  literally.    The Public Security Internal Work Handbook, published last  July, contains a whole section on how to deal with media reports  "unfavourable to the public security departments" and the  methods to be used in evading sensitive questions raised by  reporters.    "When reports are not accurate or twist the truth the Public  Security Bureau (PSB) shall not keep silent instead it shall  take immediate action to tell the truth and demand the news  organisation corrects its mistake," the handbook states. "If  you express no views or make no protest, it means that you will  have acquiesced in the report," it adds.    Last Friday, the ministry issued a strong denial of a United  Press International report that a ministry spokesman had  confirmed the authorities had decided to start legal proceedings  against Wei, saying the report had been fabricated with ulterior  motives.    In cases where a report is "accurate but leaves your unit in  a bad situation because it only reports the mistakes of an  individual PSB unit or officer", the handbook says, the unit  should "modestly admit" the mistake and express willingness to  correct it. "It will be a major error of judgment if you make  no response or refuse to admit your mistakes or even threaten  the news organisation," it says. However, the handbook warns  that when PSB officers grant interviews to reporters they must  "always keep in mind the need to protect secrets", something  which would include the impending trial of Wei.    "In order to get what they think to be important  information,  reporters may ask one question after another or talk in a  roundabout way so as to get to the bottom of something.    "Some may even try to establish a relationship with you or  invite you to dinner. In such circumstance, you must be on your  guard, make acute responses to questions, avoid making  indiscreet remarks and never leak secrets for profit," it says.  But no mention is made of what should be done in the event that  secrets are accidentally or inadvertently leaked. The handbook  does however, contain useful tips for PSB officers on staging  press conferences and avoiding those "harsh questions"  journalists sometime ask.    Officers can use various tactics to "get out of trouble" at  press conferences such as delaying evading, admitting, denying  and returning the question, the handbook says, and even offers  some stock phrases to be used in awkward situations. For  example: "This is not a matter of yes or no" "that depends on  your point of view", or "to understand this question, one must  first understand the background".    The 800-page handbook covers everything from handling top  secret documents to how to answer a telephone call from a  superior officer.</p>

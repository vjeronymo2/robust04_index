			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LEGAL SEMINAR TO HELP ALIENS WITH HIV VIRUS  </P> <P> The Downtown Legalization Project in Los Angeles is conducting a training  seminar for attorneys and immigration advisers on how to prepare an HIV waiver,  which is needed by some immigrants to become U.S residents under the  Immigration and Naturalization Service's Amnesty Program.  </P> <P> The waiver is a 30- to 50-page document in which applicants who have tested  positive for the human immunodeficiency virus may explain why they should not  be denied legal status. HIV causes AIDS.  </P> <P> The Immigration Reform and Control Act states that amnesty applicants testing  positive for specific infectious diseases -- including AIDS -- are subject to  automatic denial, INS officials said.  </P> <P> Individuals who test positive for HIV have been exposed to AIDS but may not  have contracted the disease.  </P> <P> J. Craig Fong, an attorney at the Legalization Project, said the waiver allows  those who test positive to have their cases reviewed further, rather than  automatically denied.  </P> <P> Approximately 10%, or 30,000, amnesty applicants are likely to test positive  for the virus, a Legalization Project spokesman said.  </P> <P> The training session will be held from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday at the office  of public counsel, 3535 W. 6th St. For information call 747-4097.  </P></p>

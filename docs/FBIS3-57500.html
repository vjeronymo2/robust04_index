According to him, the replacement of individual  members of the Cabinet of Ministers does not in any way signify  a replacement of government policy, because it is determined  personally by President Boris Yeltsin. Replying to a question  from journalists on whether the present composition of the  government was a coalition one, the deputy prime minister  confirmed this. At the same time, he pointed out that  previously, too, there were differing points of view on topical  problems among members of the government, but nevertheless they  succeeded in working out a common line. Aleksandr Zaveryukha  gave it to be understood that the government reshuffle had been  necessary after the recent Federal Assembly elections at which a  considerable proportion of the electorate had come out against  the shock therapy methods and had voted for representatives of  the opposition.</p>

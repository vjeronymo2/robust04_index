			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Perot group in pledge drive against Gatt deal United We Stand, the network of activist citizens groups established by Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire, has launched a far-reaching drive to get House and Senate candidates to sign a pledge to delay passage of the Uruguay Round implementing legislation. They are claiming two successes thus far: Senator Frank Lautenberg, a New Jersey democrat, and Senator Harris Wofford, a Democrat for Pennsylvania. Both have in their states large numbers of blue collar voters, who are inclined to view trade liberalisation with suspicion. Administration vote counters believe they have the votes to pass the legislation this year. But they are nervous about the anti-Gatt efforts and are urging US businesses to intensify their lobbying efforts as the mid-term elections approaches. One official, who has been on the campaign trail, said the anti-Nafta forces - populists on the left and right - have now 'coalesced' behind the Gatt. United We Stand headquarters in Dallas, Texas, has recommended that local groups urge consideration of the legislation in January 'to allow for a full and open debate of Gatt/WTO's impact on jobs and sovereignty'. This would make impossible the proposed launch of the World Trade Organisation by January 1, 1995. Mr Perot ran as an independent candidate for president in 1992 and is expected to run again. He took the lead against the North American Free Trade Agreement, debating Vice President Al Gore and in a performance widely seen as hurting his cause. In this battle, Mr Perot has thrown the thousands of citizen activists who still flock to his banner. Although he has recommended that they vote for Republicans, Democrats in tight races might well be inclined to take up the anti-Gatt pledge in the hope of gaining - or at least neutralising - opponents' advantages. The 'Perotistas'' pledge does not ask for outright opposition to the Gatt deal. Instead opponents are asking that Congress 'honour its own budget responsibilities and provide full funding for any law it passes' a feat which has been deemed politically impossible. The administration was unable to raise the Dollars 40bn in programme cuts or tax increases, required under Senate budget rules, to pay for lost tariff revenue over 10 years. It found funding for the first five years but it is being forced to ask for a waiver of the Senate rule, which would require 60 votes.</p>

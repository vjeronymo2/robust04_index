			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / RiverBus halted as liquidators move in THE 60 staff at London's RiverBus company will be told their fate today. Robson Rhodes, the accountancy firm, was at the company yesterday preparing to take over as liquidators. Mr Michael Davies, business manager, confirmed that services had been terminated and that no purchaser of the business was in prospect. RiverBus, which operated over 10 miles of the Thames between Chelsea, the City, Docklands and Greenwich, ran its last service on Friday. It has been in jeopardy since Olympia &amp; York, the Canary Wharf developer which was its main underwriter, went into receivership 15 months ago.</p>

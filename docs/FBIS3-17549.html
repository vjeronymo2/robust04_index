			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: By Diplomatic </F> correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy  Trubetskoy, and others]    [Text] The international sanctions against Iraq could be  softened and later lifted if Iraq "stated in clear and  unequivocal terms that it recognized the sovereignty,  territorial integrity and independence of Kuwait and accepted a  marked Iraq-Kuwait border," a highly placed official in the  Russian Foreign Ministry told Interfax.    He said that the Iraqis insisted that they were honoring the  disarmament conditions of UN Security Council Resolution 687.  "For the Kuwaitis, however, Iraq's disarmament is less important  than its abandonment of plans to take over Kuwait. This  approach is quite reasonable," the official said.    He also said that the UN Security Council discussed the  extension of sanctions every two months. "The Security Council  chairman stated recently that the Council decided to keep the  sanctions in place. This time, incidentally, there was no  question of lifting or alleviating the sanctions (lifting the  oil embargo -- IF). We thought that the Security Council  chairman's statement could be read as admission that positive  changes could be detected in the Baghdad's activities which  suggested its intention to comply with what the international  community wanted. Iraq had taken steps to implement the  Security Council resolutions on destruction of missiles and  other weapons."    According to the diplomat, "Russia wanted a certain test  period to be imposed on Iraq. UN Security Council resolution  715 enables imposing a long-term monitoring. Certain  installations could be subjected to an extended technical and  visual supervision under that resolution. Russia wanted to give  Iraq, say, six months. If all disarmament conditions of  resolution 687 were met during that time, then, in compliance  with item 22 of that resolution the issue of lifting the oil  embargo could be raised."    The diplomat said, "Iraq must comply with all UN Security  Council Resolutions. But Iraq should be given a chance to see  light at the end of the tunnel."</p>

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Spanish jobless up to 3.05m THE SPANISH government has been shaken by an official survey showing that unemployment reached a record 3.05m people at the end of 1992, with nearly half a million jobs lost during the year. The report said the jobless rate seemed to be quickening. The figures put Spanish unemployment at 20.06 per cent, the highest in the European Community, and will fuel a simmering row in Spain over whether the EC president, Mr Jacques Delors, was correct to warn recently that Spanish unemployment could put a brake on the country's progress towards economic and monetary union. Mr Carlos Solchaga, finance minister, said the national statistics institute survey's results were 'saddening and surprising'. The figures catch Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's socialist government at one of its worst moments in more than 10 years in office. An election has to be held by the end of November and polls show the socialists losing support to both the Left and Right, with incipient divisions in the party out in the open.</p>

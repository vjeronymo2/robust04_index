			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The House debated legislation to raise the minimum wage, with Democrats who  long have sought an increase praising President Bush for supporting a raise but  saying the amount he has suggested is too low. "It is the first positive sign  of cooperation on this issue that we have seen in eight years between the White  House and the Congress," said Rep. Austin J. Murphy (D-Pa.), who managed the  floor debate for the Democrats. "Democrats and Republicans have made an honest  effort to work out our differences." The Democratic-controlled chamber is  expected to vote on the measure today. The legislation would raise the minimum  wage from its current level of $3.35 an hour to $4.65 by 1992, but Murphy plans  to offer an amendment today scaling back the final target to $4.55.  </P></p>

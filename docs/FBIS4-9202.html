			<p>BFN     [Text] Zagreb, Apr 21 (TANJUG) -- Josip Manolic, president  of the Croatian parliament upper house, has accused President  Franjo Tudjman of a plan to merge with Croatia the southern part  of the ex-Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    This plan was the core of Tudjman's policy over the last two  years, said Manolic, who has become leader of a new party -- the  Croatian Independent Democrats (HND), a breakaway faction of  Tudjman's ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ).    Manolic, in an interview to the Zagreb GLOBUS weekly,  accused  Tudjman of having succumbed, in his expansionist policy, to the  strong influence by Croat mps from southern Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Manolic said "a division of Bosnia may lead to one of  Croatia," but "history would never forgive" Tudjman any such  "strategic mistake."    Manolic laid all blame on Tudjman for a one-year  Croat-Moslem  war in Bosnia-Herzegovina which ended under U.S. pressure last  month when the warring sides agreed on a Croat-Moslem federation  to be set up in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The new party, HND, would strengthen the opposition in  breaking Tudjmans power monopoly as the "biggest obstacle" in  the way of what he called the "functioning of democratic  institutions" in Croatia.    Tudjman was responsible for the split in his party (HDZ),  from which the HND originated, said Manolic, the ex-chief of the  secret police, because, "with the HDZ as it is now, it is quite  impossible" for Croatia to become "a genuinely democratic  state."</p>

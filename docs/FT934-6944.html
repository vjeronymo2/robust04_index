			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Russian PM wins reformers' backing A consensus that Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin should remain Russian prime minister after the elections next month is emerging among Russian reformers, including leaders of Russia's Choice, the party led by Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime minister and economics minister. Mr Mikhail Poltaranin, a colleague of Mr Gaidar in Russia's Choice and head of the Federal Information Centre, said he could see Mr Gaidar remaining the 'engine of reform' while Mr Chernomyrdin 'stood on the captain's bridge'. Mr Chernomyrdin said in a weekend interview: 'I feel the full support of the president in carrying out my duties.' He called for reforms to take a more 'social direction'. Other pro-reform blocs, such as the Party of Unity and Accord led by Mr Sergei Shakhrai, have urged Mr Chernomyrdin to remain as prime minister. Mr Alexander Shokhin, a deputy prime minister and leading member of Mr Shakhrai's party, said last week that Russia's Choice would soon endorse Mr Chernomyrdin. Mr Sergei Yuzhenkov, Mr Poltaranin's deputy and a leader of Russia's Choice, said yesterday the group's position was to leave the choice of prime minister to the president, and make no nomination themselves. But if Russia's Choice, at present leading in the polls, does well in the elections, Mr Gaidar and his supporters may feel themselves strong enough to insist on his being chosen. Against this, Mr Chernomyrdin is now regarded by reformers as having changed his view on crucial issues - as on privatisation - and to now be an enthusiast for many of the measures Mr Gaidar himself wishes to bring in. A former energy minister, he is regarded as less abrasive than Mr Gaidar.</p>

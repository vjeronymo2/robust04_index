			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CUOMO FAILS TO WIN BUSH APPROVAL TO DISMANTLE NUCLEAR POWER PLANT  </P> <P> New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo tried and failed Tuesday to change the federal  mind and win presidential approval for his plan to dismantle a new nuclear  power plant.  </P> <P> "I don't think anything was done to change the governor's mind. I don't think  anything was done to change the President's mind," Deputy Energy Secretary W.  Henson Moore said.  </P> <P> President Bush, Moore, White House chief of staff John H. Sununu and Bush aide  Andrew Card met with Cuomo for nearly an hour Tuesday after Cuomo said he  wanted to see the President personally to make his case for dismantling, rather  than mothballing, the Shoreham plant 50 miles east of New York City on Long  Island's northern shore.  </P> <P> The Energy Department argues that Shoreham is needed to ease possible power  shortages in the Northeast.  </P></p>

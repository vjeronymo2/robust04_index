			<p>BFN     [Text] "The Northern League is the leading political force  in the country, and especially in the Chamber of Deputies. So  we must act as if we already had an objectively effective  mandate from the president, who must give the mandate to form a  government to whoever is chosen by the Right Honorable Umberto  Bossi who, in any event, has already indicated the Right  Honorable Roberto Maroni for some time."    This was contained in a note read out by Simonetta Faverio,  Bossi's new spokesperson. It also said that tomorrow the  Northern League would start consultations with the various  political forces, starting with their electoral allies.</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPANESE INVESTMENT  </P> <P> Catherine Collins' article is to the point and she is absolutely right. She  should be commended for her fortitude in expressing publicly a notion that is  very unpopular with the real estate industry and, alas, our government.  </P> <P> In an article of mine, published in the January, 1989, issue of the National  Real Estate Investor magazine, I expressed similar views.  </P> <P> As a concerned citizen, I followed up by writing to some of our elected  government officials asking them to give this point of view serious thought and  consideration. So far, it would appear, my appeal fell on deaf ears.  </P> <P> I hope Collins' article might achieve better results.  </P> <P> ALEX LISTON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P>  Liston is president of Continental Brokerage Co. Inc.  </P> <P> </P></p>

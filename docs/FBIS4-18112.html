			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["pra"-signed report: "Stammheim at the Bosporus?"] </F>   [Text] The political reaction to the Kurdish protest has  lost all perspective. The Kurds are accused of breaking the  law. The deportation at any cost, which is propagated by the  FRG interior minister, is nothing else -- namely the  announcement that international agreements will be violated. To  what extent the rule-of-law self-poisoning has progressed is  shown by the plans that were discussed at the level of ministry  officials in Bonn: The German Kurds are to be imprisoned in a  special prison in Turkey, some kind of prison for terrorists.    Minister Kanther has denied that he is tending toward such  ideas. Nevertheless, such considerations are a symptom of the  time because they take the unscrupulousness of the official  policy to its end. Turkey is interpreting this (not without  justification) in its own way, namely as follows: Bonn supports  our war against the Kurds.    If the Lower Saxon farmers block the A-1 highway for a day,  this is despair. If the Kurds block the highway, this is a  serious violation of the law relating to civil disorders and  rioting, dangerous interference with road traffic, and  resistance. If German truck drivers block the border  checkpoint, the politicians express understanding and share  their concern for their economic existence. However, if the  Kurds despair because of the killing of their families in  Kurdistan, they are killed as terrorists.    The point is not condoning crimes. Rather, the point is to  punish them appropriately. Bonn politics does something else:  It uses the Kurdish protests to fan the mood for destroying the  remnants of a humane aliens and asylum law.</p>

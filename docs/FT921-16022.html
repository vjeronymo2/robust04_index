			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / International Company News: Orix to securitise part of its income ORIX, the largest leasing company in Japan, will securitise the income from part of its business in the domestic market to diversify ways of raising cash, Reuter reports from Tokyo. This will be the first time for a non-bank to sell securities directly in Japan without the help of financial institutions. The first securities, totalling Y3bn (Dollars 24m), will be sold to investors through an Orix subsidiary yet to be established. The subsidiary will sell to investors the right to the income from a particular leasing contract which Orix has signed with a client. The investors will then receive the income from the contract. The minimum security will be Y50m. Orix hopes to start selling the securities within a few months. Some Japanese leasing companies now securitise part of their assets through trust banks and are searching for new methods of raising funds to ease financial tightness.</p>

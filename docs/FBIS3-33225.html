			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Patricia Rodriguez] </F>   [Excerpt] Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli denied  reports stating that the Colombian Army of National Liberation  (ELN) is receiving economic and military support from Venezuelan  merchants.    The rebels are allegedly creating border commandos to  operate  along the border separating Venezuela and Colombia. "I have no  idea what the reports are based on and I am going to ask where  they are coming from. This is all based on supposition," he  said.    The Colombian daily EL TIEMPO said that certain documents  seized from the ELN indicate that the rebel group, with the  support of Venezuelan merchants, is trying to create a permanent  military force. Their purpose is to intensify their terrorist  strategy in Colombia against the state and against Japanese,  European, and U.S. multinational corporations. The documents  held by the Colombian newspaper, describing the guerrilla  organization's military plans and the support they receive from  Venezuelan merchants, reveal the complicity of a large chain of  Venezuelan stores in the planning and execution of several  kidnappings near the border for the ELN. Military intelligence  analysts, quoted by the Colombian daily, indicate that the ELN  formed logistics commandos, which have been channeling financial  resources from Venezuela into Colombia since August 1993. The  operation is coordinated by a committee the rebels call "Border  Coordinators" [Coordinadores de la Frontera], which are in  constant contact with the Venezuelan liaisons promoting the  insurgent movement.

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / US cautious over progress in talks with N Korea US officials expressed caution yesterday that the latest talks between Washington and Pyongyang would find an acceptable solution to North Korea's suspect nuclear programme. The open-ended negotiations resumed last Friday after a month's suspension following the death of North Korea's President Kim Il-sung. Mr Kang Sok-chu, North Korea's first deputy foreign minister, said on Monday his government was prepared to freeze its nuclear activities in return for being given light water nuclear reactors. These are more proliferation resistant than North Korea's graphite moderated reactors which produce plutonium that can be used to build atomic bombs. However, a senior US official involved in the talks said yesterday that, while the West had an interest in helping North Korea switch to a less proliferation-prone nuclear technology, any help was conditional on Pyongyang's full compliance with international nuclear inspections under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This would include checks on two storage sites which the International Atomic Energy Agency suspects may hold enough undeclared weapons-grade plutonium to make a bomb. The official said North Korea continued to oppose inspection of these sites, at the Yongbyon nuclear complex north of Pyongyang, claiming it has 'suspended the effectuation' of its NPT membership. 'The North Koreans have an obligation to fulfil their safeguards agreement' with the IAEA, the official said. 'The world shouldn't have to pay for that.' North Korea, which first indicated interest in LWRs during talks with the US in July 1993, says it needs 1,000MW of nuclear generating capacity, about half its power needs, at an estimated cost of Dollars 2bn. LWR technology is widely available in the west and in Russia, and the US has already sounded out Japan and South Korea for help with funding the programme. To obtain the LWRs, North Korea would have to agree not to reprocess the fuel rods already withdrawn from its small experimental nuclear reactor, which the US fears could provide enough plutonium for four atomic weapons. It would also have to agree not to reload the reactor with fuel and to halt construction of two bigger graphite moderated reactors with capacities of 50MW and 200MW. Mr Kang indicated on Monday that Pyongyang would seek compensation for the power supplies lost as a result. He also said North Korea had put forward proposals for treating the 8,000 spent fuel rods now corroding in a holding pond at Yongbyon 'in such a way that can make the international community feel easy about it'. The official said he thought Pyongyang was negotiating more seriously than before as a result of the US push in June for United Nations economic sanctions against North Korea. But 'they are difficult people to talk to, these are complex issues to deal with, and I can't say I see the light at the end of the tunnel'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station reporter Hsiao Chin-wei's report; from the "Hookup" </F> program]    [Text] In a bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade [GATT], government departments are making active  efforts to amend relevant regulations to meet GATT standards.    With respect to intellectual property rights [IPR], the  Ministry of the Interior will amend the Copyright Law so that it  conforms to specific trade-related regulations in the IPR  agreement. As far as our application for GATT membership is  concerned, the international community always treats us as a  developed country.    According to GATT regulations, the Copyright Law should be  amended within one year after application has been submitted to  join the world trade organization. In other words, the  Copyright Law should be amended by 1 January 1996. The most  important revisions will be the need for mandatory authorization  before foreign works can be translated, and the lease rights of  movies.    According to Wang Chuan-lu, chairman of the copyright  committee, the mandatory need for translation rights  authorization in the Copyright Law is based on educational  needs. He added that certain writers who cannot find copyright  owners can also translate and disseminate their works. While  this is not in line with (?GATT) regulations, in reality there  has been no application for authorization of translation rights  since the Copyright Law went into effect two years ago. The  experience in Japan has been that there have been very few  applications for authorization of translation rights. This  being the case, the effects of the amendment will be limited.    As for the lease right, it currently applies only to  computer  software and audio tapes. The amendment will cover all  audio-video products. And movies may not be leased until [word  indistinct] authorization from the primary copyright owners. In  other words, movies cannot be leased until fees have been paid  twice. Consequently the cost of leasing movies will increase by  a great margin.    Besides this, the amendment's greatest impact will be seen  in  the substantial broadening of the area which the Copyright Law  will protect. In addition to copyright owners in Britain, the  United States, and Hong Kong, the copyright of owners in all 114  GATT members must be protected. Foreign works will have to used  even more cautiously.    This is Hsiao Ching-wei reporting from the Ministry of the  Interior.</p>

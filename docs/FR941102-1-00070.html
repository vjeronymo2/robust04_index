			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Occurrences of average protein level and other nonfat solids  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level of milk moving in opposite directions appears to be an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exception rather than the rule. Evidence presented in ``Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Component Levels and Somatic Cell Counts in Individual Herd  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Milk at the Farm Level, 1992, Upper Midwest Marketing Area'',  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicates that about 60% of the variation in solids-not-fat is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> caused by variation in protein, and that higher protein levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are positively correlated with higher solids-not-fat levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Data presented in this and other documents show that the level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other solids in milk tends to be relatively constant with,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally, small month-to-month variation. Thus, when a handler  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchases milk with higher than average protein levels, he will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also, generally, be purchasing milk with higher than average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels of solids-not-fat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the sum of the value of the protein and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solids under this recommended pricing plan equals the value of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the total nonfat solids. The value of total nonfat solids,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, is a weighted average of the quantity and price of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protein and the quantity and price of the other nonfat solids  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contained in the milk. Analysis based on the average tests of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the five markets shows that under the recommended pricing plan,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the value of total nonfat solids would range from approximately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $.002 per pound below the current value to approximately $.008  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per pound above the current value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This estimated price difference is certainly not the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant increase that is claimed in the briefs. In hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testimony, the Galloway witness stated that an analysis of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect of the CMPC proposal on the Galloway Company showed a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nine-cent increase per hundredweight in the cost of Galloway's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> milk only when the CMPC somatic cell adjustment was included.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Without the somatic cell adjustment, the analysis showed that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost of milk to Galloway would be reduced under the CMPC multiple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component pricing plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is appropriate to include all Class II products in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multiple component pricing system being proposed here. All  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Class II products derive benefit from butterfat, protein and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other solids in the milk. The benefit may be in enhanced yield,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as protein for cottage cheese, or a combination of protein  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and other solids (i.e. the solids-not-fat in the milk) in many of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the other Class II products. Or, the benefit may be in some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other area. For example, the NAJ dairy chemist witness testified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about the importance of protein in the functionality of many of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these products, such as in ice cream, whipping cream, and yogurt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some testimony even went so far as to discuss the importance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protein in fluid milk, in terms of the nutrient content and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mineral carrying content of the milk. However, since there was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no substantial support for including Class I milk in the multiple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component pricing system being proposed here, only Class II and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Class III products will be priced on multiple components.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Orders To Be Included <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A proposal to incorporate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multiple component pricing plan adopted in this proceeding in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nebraska-Western Iowa and Eastern South Dakota Federal milk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> orders as well as in the Chicago Regional, Iowa, and Upper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Midwest orders should be adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The witness for Land O'Lakes (LOL), proponent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal, listed a number of reasons for including the multiple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component pricing plan in the Nebraska-Western Iowa and Eastern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> South Dakota orders as well as in the orders proposed by NAJ.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The witness explained that all five orders are similar in that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their predominant use of milk is for manufacturing Class III  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products. He testified that the primary organizations that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supply the Nebraska-Western Iowa and Eastern South Dakota markets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also are major participants in one or more of the Chicago  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regional, Iowa, and Upper Midwest order marketing areas. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> witness stated that inclusion of the Nebraska-Western Iowa and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eastern South Dakota orders in the multiple component pricing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan would allow those organizations that have producers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market milk in multiple orders to standardize their payrolls and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> billings, thus maintaining uniformity and reducing confusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> among producers and handlers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The decision to include additional orders in this decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should not be made entirely on the basis of convenience to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parties marketing milk on the various orders. The decision is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on whether inclusion of the two orders would tend to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectuate the policy of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act. Certainly, including the Nebraska-Western Iowa and Eastern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> South Dakota orders in this decision will contribute to orderly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marketing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The data supplied by the market administrators' offices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> describing the milksheds of the various orders shows a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considerable overlap of milksheds. For example, many South  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dakota counties have milk pooled on three of the five orders  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the same month. In the absence of uniform pricing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions between the five orders, disorderly marketing could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occur, particularly when orders have overlapping milksheds, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one order were pricing milk on a skim and butterfat basis while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> another order was pricing milk on the basis of its components.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a producer's milk tests high for nonfat components but is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pooled under an order that prices milk on a skim-butterfat basis,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the producer would attempt to maximize returns by changing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market under which his milk is pooled to benefit from his high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component levels. The opposite situation would occur if the milk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a producer testing below average for nonfat components is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pooled under an order with MCP provisions. Such a producer would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximize returns by changing the order under which his milk is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pooled to one with skim-butterfat pricing. This shuffling of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> producers in the same geographic area because of nonuniform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pricing provisions would not constitute orderly marketing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the inclusion of the Nebraska-Western Iowa and Eastern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> South Dakota orders in the multiple component pricing decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would tend to reduce disorderly marketing in the region, benefit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handlers by allowing a standardized payroll, and there was no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opposition to their inclusion, multiple component pricing should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be adopted for these two orders as well as the other three.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

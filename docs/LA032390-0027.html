			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: HE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS FUNNY, SO HE SUPPLIED A PUNCH LINE  </P> <P> Bruce Jenkins of the San Francisco Chronicle recalled one spring at Vero Beach,  Fla., where Sandy Koufax and Reggie Smith were playing lob-toss.  </P> <P> "Reggie was coming off shoulder surgery and he could barely get off a 20-foot  throw," Jenkins wrote.  </P> <P> "Nearby, a couple of shirtless men, maybe 20-22 years old, were watching the  scene, working on a six-pack of beer. One of the guys got a little belligerent  and started riding Smith. 'You're throwing like a girl,' he said.  </P> <P> "After another nasty remark or two, Reggie calmly set down the baseball, walked  over to the foul-mouthed one and floored him with one brutal punch. On with the  show."  </P> <P> Trivia time: Elgin Baylor, Jerry West and Wilt Chamberlain were the only Lakers  to have their numbers retired before Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. What were their  numbers?  </P> <P> Golden touch: Announcer Tom Kelly, telling Tom Harmon stories at Riviera  Country Club, said that the inebriated fan who tried to tackle Harmon in the  1940 California-Michigan game at Berkeley was saved from the hoosegow when  Harmon asked the cops to bring him to the Michigan locker room.  </P> <P> "The guy turned out to be the president of an insurance company," Kelly said.  "Harmon wound up being a spokesperson for the company and made a ton of money."  </P> <P> Great stuff: Wrote Larry Guest of the Orlando Sentinel when Fred Couples  returned to Orlando, Fla., after his victory in the Los Angeles Open: "Freddie  was proudly brandishing his most-cherished new possession. The tournament  trophy, you say? Nahhh. Freddie seemed proudest of a hockey stick autographed  by Wayne Gretzky.  </P> <P> "It seems, several (PGA) Tour pros took in a King game one night while in L.A.  and were ushered into the locker room afterward to meet the Great One."  </P> <P> Look out: From Philadelphia forward Charles Barkley: "New York is my kind of  town because I have a gun."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Baylor 22, West 44, Chamberlain 13.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Atlanta forward Dominique Wilkins, scoffing at claims that Larry  Bird is over the hill: "Bird is still the only one who actually gives me a  headache."

			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / International Company News: Merlin Green asking for split capital status MERLIN International Green Investment Trust is proposing a restructuring in an attempt to eliminate the discount to net assets at which its shares trade. Under the proposals Merlin will become a split capital trust, with new classes of zero coupon preference and ordinary shares, and a wind-up date of 2001. The hope is that investors will be attracted by the tax advantages of the new shares and this, combined with the prospect of a wind-up date when assets will be repaid, will eliminate the discount. Its shares traded at an average 23 per cent discount last year; many split trusts trade at a premium to net assets. The zeros will pay no income but will have first claim on the assets, and offer the prospect of capital gain. Based on an illustrative initial value of 57.5p and redemption value of 112.3p, gross redemption yield will be 8.6 per cent. Ordinary shares will receive all the income but will only be repaid after the zeros have been met in full. They are, therefore, a highly-geared investment. The expected initial dividend yield will be 11.3 per cent gross. Existing shareholders will be offered units on a one-for-one basis; each unit will comprise one zero and new ordinary share. Terms of the existing warrants will be changed so that warrant holders will be entitled to subscribe for one unit at 100p. The proposals will need the 75 per cent approval of shareholders and warrant holders at a meeting on February 16; Merlin already has support from 46.5 per cent of the shares and 20.7 per cent of the warrants.</p>

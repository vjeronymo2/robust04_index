			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by Defense Ministry and General Staff </F> Command spokesman; place and date not given]    [Text] Even as the homeland was still recovering from the  bloody wounds of the regrettable 'Imran tragedy, which was  caused by the gang of apostasy and secession in the Yemeni  Socialist Party leadership as part of its criminal scheme to  fragment the homeland, and instead of learning a lesson from  that tragic incident in which the homeland lost some of its best  army personnel and was the biggest loser, that gang continued to  escalate the military situation, fabricating and inflaming  tension in the homeland without the least sense of  responsibility or remorse. It is currently issuing orders to  move and mass forces in the direction of the old border areas.    Yesterday, 3 May, it moved the 'Abbas, (Tasyir), and Milhim  Brigades toward the former border areas in the Shabwah axis.  This is a new link in the chain of escalation and tension which  reveals the aggressive ambitions of this criminal gang and its  hostile stand toward the Yemeni people and Yemeni unity. It  barricaded itself behind these military units over which it  practices its hegemony, turning them into a sword brandished  against Yemeni unity. It did so after obstructing all sincere  efforts to merge the Armed Forces and rebuild them on national  and scientific bases, prevent party affiliations within their  ranks, and keep them away from party and regional influences and  political conflicts. It refused to apply the law banning party  membership in the Armed Forces, considering these forces a  national institution and the property of all the people as well  as a shield that protects the homeland and its unity. It sought  to sabotage the institutionalized and disciplinary structure of  the Armed Forces through a series of unpatriotic and  irresponsible acts. It enlisted into the Armed Forces  party-affiliated groups who had nothing to do with the military.  They were given grants, rank, and promotions in a haphazard and  illegal manner and were instigated and wrongly indoctrinated to  split national ranks.    The source added: Today, we call on the heroes of the  valiant  Armed Forces in the units over which the party maintains a tight  grip and in whose ranks the party exercises the process  deception, charlatanism, and forgery, to express their national  and responsible stand in favor of the people, homeland, unity,  and constitutional legitimacy. Exposed are the worn-out,  aggressive, and criminal gang and its diabolical scheme through  which this secessionist group seeks to implicate the comrades in  arms and companions of duty and struggle in bloody and  destructive fratricide. They did this not in defense of the  homeland, its sovereignty, security, and stability or to  safeguard its democratic system and gains or the accomplishments  of the September and October revolutions, which were watered  with the blood of martyrs and sacrifices of strugglers and the  people's sweat and hard work, but to maintain the seats of  power, the parochial interests, and selfish and destructive  whims.    Therefore, they are beating the drums of war and pushing  the heroes of the Armed Forces to fight. They are doing so when  the blood of the martyrs of our people and Armed Forces in  Abyan, Shabwah, Dhamar, and 'Imran is not yet cold.    The valiant fighters of those military units, who are pushed  by the renegade and separatist gang of the Socialist Party to  instigate infighting to destroy the homeland and fragment its  unity, will live up to their national responsibility and natural  position. They will be in the right trench alongside unity to  defend it and the homeland and to ward off the advocates of  separation and wars. They will stand against that separatist  gang which seeks to dismantle the homeland and takes money in  payment for the souls of the innocent martyrs.    Out of a sense of responsibility and sacred duty, in  appreciation of the sacrifices of the martyrs, and in order to  spare the homeland the inferno of death and destruction, we call  on those brave heroes to reject all orders issued by that  oppressive gang that defies the homeland, constitutional  legitimacy, and the people's genuine morals and values. That  gang views the homeland only through its narrow interests. It  deals with the people only through its adventurous ambitions and  crazy desire to oppress the people through the tools of death  and destruction of everything beautiful in this beloved homeland.    May God, the people, and the public opinion be witness that  we have warned against the gravity of those reckless  stupidities. We appeal to the rational ones in the command of  the Socialist Party to responsibly assess the situation, resort  to reason, heed the calls of peace, brotherhood, and love, to  maintain the security and stability of the homeland and  citizens, and not to be dragged into the fabricated lies which  seek to trigger new bloodshed and tragedies for the public.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] With the visit of Mr Fedorov, managing director of  Irkutsk Aircraft production association, which manufactures the  frontline Russian combat aircraft Soyuz-30, the most advanced  Russian military aircraft are being offered at favourable terms.    A deal on MiGs, including sale of 30 MiG-29 fighters and  upgrading MiG-21s by fitting it with an air-to-air missile, has  been finalised by the two sides. It only needs to be formalised  after settling the details of delivery schedules and payments.    Now Mr Fedorov has offered to sell and manufacture 20  Soyuz-30 fighter aircraft under licence by HAL [Hindustan  Aeronautics Limtited]. This dovetailing will be facilitated by  the ongoing collaboration between HAL and Irkutsk aircraft for  production of MiG-27 aircraft in India.    However, the production of MiG-27 has to be phased out  within  two years. This will render the production capacity at HAL idle.  It has been suggested by Mr Fedorov that the vacuum at HAL can  be filled by producing Soyuz-30 under licence.    The Soyuz offer creates a new situation in which Indian air  defence planners can exercise a choice by going in for the most  effective fighter aircraft in line with Indian needs, while  obtaining the transfer.    In obtaining the Russian set-up, the MiG and Soyuz design  bureaus function independently and each has the authority to  enter into sales or collaboration agreement with their foreign  counter-parts. Thus, while the MiG design bureau has been  finalising arrangement for MiGs with India's defence ministry,  the Soyuz has now entered the scene with an offer through  Irkutsk Aircraft producers, handling the manufacture and sales  of Soyuz fighter planes.    Defence experts hold the Soyuz-30 to be an effective fighter  aircraft capable of taking on the American F-18 fighters. While  MiG-29 is lighter, and therefore more manoeuvrable, Soyuz-30 has  a longer range. In terms of the Indian environment, the MiG-29's  range covers Pakistani targets right up to NWEP, while Soyuz-30  could go much further.    Experts also feel that MiG-29 and Soyuz-30 could form an  effective combination.    The Soyuz-30, however, is far more expensive in its  maintenance costs against the MiG-29, it is stated. The pricing  of the plane can be attractive, in view of the keenness of the  Irkutsk to have a big deal with Indian for Soyuz 30. Attractive  commercial credit is also learnt to have been offered,  presumably to settle the deal during tne Prime Minister, Mr  Narasimha Rao's visit to Moscow.</p>

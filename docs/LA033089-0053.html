			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 2 CAR FIRMS, TARGETED IN FRAUD PROBE, ARE CLOSED  </P> <P> Two auto sales companies, whose combined sales once dominated the local market  but withered amid allegations of fraud, have been closed under the direction of  a federal bankruptcy trustee.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, car carriers were loading inventory from Grand Chevrolet Inc. to  transport the vehicles to an auction. Bankruptcy officials said the cars were  being repossessed for liquidation by General Motors Acceptance Corp., the car  maker's financing company.  </P> <P> The Department of Motor Vehicles failed last year in a bid to revoke the sales  licenses of both Grand Chevrolet and Grand Motors Inc., members of a related  chain of auto brokerages.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Owner Has Vanished  </P> <P> Eminiano (Jun) Reodica, who owned the companies, vanished as his business  empire collapsed. He is believed to have fled to the Philippines.  </P> <P> Department of Motor Vehicles investigators alleged that Reodica's companies had  inflated sales figures, duped customers into signing documents that added extra  charges, and processed loans through more than one lender.  </P> <P> According to police, Reodica's sales force included members of a Filipino gang  who occasionally strong-armed employees into cooperating with the fraudulent  sales practices.  </P> <P> Grand Chevrolet, which in 1987 ranked as the nation's third-largest auto  dealership in sales volume, and Grand Motors both declared bankruptcy in  August. Two other companies, a car financing arm and a real estate company,  also closed.  </P> <P> After two months of inactivity, the auto sales companies started selling cars  under the direction of bankruptcy trustee Irving Sulmeyer, who took over after  the companies filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors.  </P> <P> During the reorganization, the companies set a monthly sales target of 300 to  350 cars, about half the number the Grand companies reportedly sold each month  before the collapse.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Total Debt 'Many Millions'  </P> <P> "We fell substantially below the estimates," Sulmeyer said in an interview  Wednesday. "Apparently, the community did not support the operations to the  extent we had hoped . . . and the operations were not profitable."  </P> <P> Pending the results of an audit, Sulmeyer said that he could not estimate the  companies' total debt, but that "it obviously runs into the very many millions  of dollars."  </P> <P> Until late last year, the companies had experienced rapid growth under the  direction of Reodica, a Philippines native who built an automotive sales empire  catering to immigrants. The companies became known for their liberal lending  practices -- extending loans to people with credit histories that other auto  dealers would not consider -- and for their multilingual sales force.  </P> <P> Grand Chevrolet grew to be the largest minority-owned business in Southern  California.  </P> <P> But in the aftermath of the collapse, several savings and loan firms and about  1,000 individual investors in Reodica's companies were out tens of millions of  dollars which they may never recover. More than 400 employees once were  employed by the companies.  </P> <P> Representatives from various investors have claimed that they have more than  $42 million tied up in the companies. Imperial Savings &amp; Loan Corp. of San  Diego, the largest creditor, bought $174 million in Grand car loans, $20  million of which company officials have said may be uncollectable.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Losses to City Cited  </P> <P> Glendora stands to lose about $750,000 in annual sales taxes -- about 20% of  the city's total sales tax revenue -- and will have to cut back on its budget  for capital repairs and the purchase of new equipment, Larry Schroeder, city  finance director, said.  </P> <P> "We're going to make it, but it's been a rough year," he said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CZECHOSLOVAKIA'S VACLAV HAVEL  </P> <P> Havel told Congress that the best way the U.S. can help Eastern Europe is to  help the Soviet Union on its "immensely complicated road to democracy."  </P> <P> But at the same time, Jeffrey Garten (Op-Ed Page, Feb. 20) claimed that "our  national mood could become defensive, protectionist, even xenophobic" and that  "the pace of change may have outstripped the ability of our leaders to deal  with it."  </P> <P> If this is true, then we could lose the chance of the century to heal the  wounds of a 45-year-old Cold War! Suddenly the Soviets and East Europeans admit  that communism is a miserable failure, and what do we do? We sit on our hands  when we should be busy encouraging every conceivable kind of interaction:  tourism, business, religious, cultural, scientific, medical, sister city, etc.  </P> <P> "The night is far spent, the day is at hand . . . " (Romans 13:12). It's time  to wake up, America!  </P> <P> MARK C. BIEDEBACH  </P> <P> Seal Beach  </P></p>

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Police storm Algiers mosque More than 50 police stormed an Algiers mosque yesterday and arrested about 100 supporters of the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), according to witnesses, Reuter reports from Algiers. They said police surrounded the Es Sunna mosque in the fundamentalist bastion of Bab el-Oued during Friday prayers and fired warning shots as they went into the building. The FIS was banned in March after elections it was set to win were cancelled. The government has blamed its supporters for a wave of violence since then.</p>

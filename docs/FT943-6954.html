			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / CBI reports rise in output but warns on prices UK manufacturing output and orders are growing at their fastest rates since the late 1980s, according to the latest Confederation of British Industry monthly trends inquiry, but expectations of higher prices are increasing. For the first time since April 1989, more companies believe their order books are above normal, than below. The findings appear to confirm official statistics earlier this week which showed that the rate of economic growth was accelerating and would beat the Treasury's 2.75 per cent forecast for 1994. CBI surveys deduct those reporting a decrease from those reporting an increase to produce a percentage balance. The balance of those expecting an increase in output over the next four months is 30 percentage points, the highest figure since September 1988, while the balance of those reporting above normal order books is 4 percentage points. Financial markets are likely to watch the figure on price expectations with the most interest, as it is seen as an important indicator of inflationary pressures. The balance of companies expecting to raise prices over the next four months has edged steadily up from April, and reached 15 percentage points in August, from 12 percentage points in July. Some analysts predicted the price expectations balance would fall from July's figure and the increase may renew fears of a rise in base rates. However, the CBI points out 65 per cent of companies still believe that prices will be unchanged over the next four months, and only one in four expects to make an increase. The CBI also produced its revised economic forecast for 1994 and 1995. It has upgraded its expectations for gross domestic product growth this year from 2.4 to 3 per cent, although that forecast does not take account of the strong GDP figures published earlier this week. The CBI believes economic growth will slow in the second half of this year, as the full impact of tax increases hits consumer spending, and GDP growth in 1995 will drop back to 2.5 per cent. The CBI believes there is no need for an immediate rate increase following the next meeting between the chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, and the governor of the Bank of England, Mr Eddie George, on September 7. It expects to see inflationary pressures leading to a quarter or a half percentage point rise in base rates before the end of the year, and its forecast assumes a further increase to 6.25 per cent by the middle of next year.

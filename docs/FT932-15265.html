			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: Coca-Cola turns in 18% advance COCA-COLA, the Atlanta-based soft drinks group, yesterday unveiled a 21 per cent improvement in earnings per share during the first quarter of 1993, and an 18 per cent advance in profits, before accounting-related charges, to Dollars 454m after tax. Earnings per share advanced to 35 cents, compared with 29 cents. Sales in the three-month period were also up by around 10 per cent, at Dollars 3.05bn. Mr Roberto Goizueta, chairman, suggested the first-quarter results 'support our very bullish outlook for continued strong performance in the remainder of the year'. Coca-Cola shares - which, like others in the consumer products sector, have been hit by fears of brand erosion in response to the recent Philip Morris/Marlboro announcement of price cuts - slipped by Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 39 1/8 at the close. The company said worldwide gallon shipments of soft drinks, concentrates and syrups increased by 6 per cent in the first quarter. International concentrate shipments were up by 7 per cent, while US shipments rose by 3 per cent. Meanwhile, unit case volume rose by 4 per cent, with international volume up by 5 per cent and US volume up by 3 per cent. At the operating level, the volume increases, coupled with margin improvement, led to an 18 per cent advance in profits, to Dollars 677m. The earnings-per-share advances also reflected a share repurchasing programme: Coca-Cola bought in 2.5m shares in the first quarter, and has bought in another 1m in the first eight days of the second quarter. The company aims to acquire up to 100m shares between now and 2000.</p>

Kirpichnikov, under the rubric "Budget": </F> "Draft Budget: Not Bad, but No Good: Government Not Insisting on  Duma Approval"]    [Text] Yesterday's hearings in the State Duma on mutual  relations between the federal budget and the budgets of  federation subjects were representative: participating were  Deputy Finance Minister Sergey Aleksashenko, Deputy Economics  Minister Andrey Shapovalyants, and Central Bank Deputy Chairman  Tamara Paramonova, as well as the leaders of the "economic"  committees of the lower chamber.    The representatives of executive power emphasized that for  the first time a real, as opposed to declaratory, system for a  trilevel budget had been proposed--federal, territorial  (federation subjects), and local. The draft budget for 1994 has  three basic divisions: income, expenditures, and transfers--from  the federative into local budgets. Already a large part of taxes  accrued is being sent to the locales: 37 percent of the  value-added tax (VAT), 63 percent of the profit tax, 100 percent  of the income tax, and so on. There is nothing fundamentally new  about the expenditures division: federal spending for defense,  debt support, and the implementation of Russia-wide programs  eats up about 75 percent of the federal budget, leaving  practically nothing to share with the territories.    The greatest number of innovations is in the transfers  division. The creation of a financial support fund for the  territories has been proposed in the amount of 22 percent of  what comes in from the VAT. Three categories of territories are  distinguished: those in need of help from the center, those in  special need, and those not in need. Upon classifying the  territories in a transfer class, the population's income and  expense structure will be taken into account. Investments are  planned only for unfinished sites of unusual economic or social  importance. Assistance will be given to regions that have  suffered from radiation, as well as areas of the North and the  Kuriles, on principle.    The optimistic speeches of the three deputy ministers,  however, met with approval from the deputy body and guests at  the hearings only in the sense that finally at least some steps  were being taken to meet the regions halfway. Critics were  incomparably more numerous. It was pointed out that the Duma had  not been presented with a consolidated budget broken down by  regions, and therefore to talk about real changes in budgetary  policy and their specific consequences was impossible. It was  pointed out that a financial support fund of 22 percent is  relatively less than the 35 percent from the federal budget  allocated for the same purpose in 1993. Attention was drawn to  the fact that the division of regions into three classes had not  been fully thought out, that it insults the raw-materials  territories that provide the country with its main hard currency  income, and that it could give rise to interregional conflicts.    Numerous speakers from the floor emphasized the  poverty-stricken situation with their budgets, differing in  their definitions of how the necessary financial assistance  should be applied, but agreeing that the draft budget as a  document is incomplete and that it contradicts the Constitution.  Representatives of the unions of cities complained that the role  of the budgets of these points of settlement had been  underassessed and insisted on the need to protect them from  attempted incursions by oblast or kray authorities. Villagers  expressed themselves likewise. Finally, the issue was touched on  of the obligatory cancellation at the government level of the  promises of indexation, loans, and other preferential outlays  that the government and president had promised in resolutions  and edicts but had not provided the money for, addressing those  desiring local budgets. Tax rates, state guarantees, and much  else was debated.    In the end, the hearings showed that, in its current form,  the draft budget for 1994 is not going to win Duma approval.  Hearing organizers consoled deputies with the fact that the  government itself does not seem likely to insist on the  document's passage, being aware of its incompleteness. It all  came down to the fact that there is no point in simply returning  the draft to the Council of Ministers; it is essential, however,  to form with government representatives a joint group to  complete work on it.</p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Investment fund of Dollars 50m planned for Caribbean A Dollars 50m INVESTMENT fund for the Caribbean is being planned by the Caribbean Economic Community (Caricom). The community's 13 member-governments have invited finance houses in Europe and North America to make proposals for setting up the fund, which is to invest in equities of companies in all Commonwealth Caribbean countries. Government officials say there has already been a show of interest from some companies, including the Crown Agents and John Govett of the UK, and some financial services conglomerates in the Caribbean. Institutions such as the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank, the Inter-American Investment Corporation, an arm of the Inter-American Development Bank, and the European Investment Bank are also said to be interested. The move to deregulated economies in the region has created many new investment opportunities, said Mr Vivian Brown, executive director of the policy review unit in the office of the Jamaican prime minister. The sponsors of the fund, to contain both quoted and unquoted companies, will be expected to raise capital through methods such as private placements with institutional investors. The community will decide in July which finance house has been approved. Companies in the community have had only moderate success in attracting capital, and depend on commercial and development banks. Some governments are unhappy that the sale of state enterprises has given new foreign investors control of companies in the region. Bankers say the fund would be a more palatable method for financing divestment and business expansion. Caricom is offering a range of incentives for the fund, including the ability to remit dividends and capital gains free of withholding taxes.</p>

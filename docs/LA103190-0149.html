			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SHERMAN OAKS FUTURE  </P> <P> The headline Oct. 6 should have been: "All of Sherman Oaks seeks 2-story height  limits," not, "Yaroslavsky to Seek 2-Story Height Limit."  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks, to more people than possibly several Sherman Oaks Homeowner Assn.  members, is not just the blocks between Columbus Avenue and Beverly Glen  Boulevard along Ventura Boulevard.  </P> <P> The character of Sherman Oaks is what brought it to its present ambience. The  character of Sherman Oaks and all other areas is the product of blending all  groups, all concepts of aesthetics and architecture, all of the day-to-day  changing views of those who travel through, to and within, especially those who  walk, work, shop and live here.  </P> <P> Zev, how quickly and eagerly you continuously limit the rights and options of  one section of the community -- how forthrightly you impose upon a community  the future monotony of architecture without the pleasing aesthetics of  variation and texture. You tell me: What is the character of Sherman Oaks and  what do the people of Sherman Oaks believe the character of their community is.  Poll us -- then let's go from there.  </P> <P> A community's character like its people should be changing, vibrant, alive and  different -- yet the same. There should be room for variations of a theme.  </P> <P> Zev, relax, listen to the old Zev who fought for self-expression of people not  for restriction after restriction.  </P> <P> HOWARD S. RAPHAEL, Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

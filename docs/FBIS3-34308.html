Following is the text of the statement:    A joint Statement issued by Tariq 'Aziz, Iraq deputy prime  minister, and Ambassador Rolf Ekeus, the executive chairman of  the Special Commission, at the conclusion of high-level talks in  Baghdad from 2-5 February:    1. The progress that was achieved in relations between Iraq  and the Special Commission in July 1993 has been augmented  during the latest round of high-level talks that was held in  Baghdad from 2-5 February. At their initial stages, the talks  were attended by an IAEA representative.    The current talks reviewed the steps that have been taken by  the two sides to establish the frameworks for the continued  monitoring and verification system after Iraq's acceptance on 26  November 1993 of UN Security Council Resolution 715 of 1991. In  this regard, the talks have augmented the great progress that  has been achieved since last July in both the political and  technical fields, specifically the high-level talks held in New  York and Baghdad in September, October, and November 1993.    2. The two sides expressed their readiness to expedite the  process of setting up the continuous monitoring and verification  system in a spirit of goodwill for the sake of realizing their  common objective, which is specifically the submission of a  report to the Security Council by both the Commission and the  IAEA at the earliest reasonable time, indicating that Iraq has,  in their opinion, adopted all the required measures in  accordance with Paragraph 22 of Security Council Resolution 687.    The Commission noted that, within this context, the phase of  intensive inspection operations which have already started in  all areas of its jurisdiction will continue. For its part, Iraq  noted that it will welcome all these inspection teams and  facilitate their work.    3. Technical talks regarding a number of issues were also  held. These talks were held in a businesslike and professional  manner and produced positive results.    4. An agreement was reached to hold another round of  high-level talks in the first half of March 1994 so as to  maintain the momentum which has been added to this process in  this round of talks as well as in the previous rounds.</p>

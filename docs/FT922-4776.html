			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Midland battle intensifies THE battle for control of Midland Bank grew fiercer as Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) launched an increased and final offer valuing Midland at Pounds 3.9bn, or around 470p a share. The timing surprised dealers who responded by hoisting Midland 31 to 452p. Exceptionally heavy trading, after the increased bid terms were announced, triggered stories that another large corporate buyer had moved into the market, but traders said the buying represented nothing more than big US arbitrageurs manoeuvring for position as the battle moves into its final stages. 'There was no evidence of any large blocks of Midland shares changing hands,' said one dealer, as turnover reached 29m shares. Mr Mike Fesemeyer, banks analyst at Nomura, said the move by Hongkong Banking was 'extremely well timed' and had a 'good chance of succeeding'. He pointed out that the closing date for the bid was July 7, and the outcome of the investigation by the Monopolies Commission into the proposed bid by Lloyds Bank would not be known until August 25. Mr Fesemeyer added, however, that Lloyds may well signal its intention of making a much higher bid, possibly in excess of 550p a share when its Board makes an expected announcement on Friday. Glaxo reverse The fortunes of Glaxo shares varied sharply yesterday as an early morning rise, prompted by broker support, was reversed after worrying figures from the US. French stockbroker Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull had taken its cue from a survey in the US financial press which listed Glaxo as the third most popular stock in a table of those expected to perform best over the next 12 months. Strauss turned 'mildly positive' on Glaxo at its morning meeting arguing that US investors were likely to return to the pharmaceutical sector. The shares jumped 21 but in the afternoon US group Bristol Myers Squibb came out with a projection of single figure earnings per share growth for the second quarter. The new projection resulted from reduced inventories by wholesalers, particularly of cancer and heart drugs. Some felt that the price discounting could spill over into the anti-ulcer drug market, thus affecting Glaxo's Zantac, which is responsible for around 65 per cent of profits. It would also affect SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet. Glaxo closed 4 1/2 off at 770 1/2 p with 5.3m shares traded. SmithKline eased a penny to 924p. Cellular radio group Vodafone, badly mauled in recent sessions by reduced valuations and worries about increased regulation by Oftel, rallied strongly amid hints that the group is about to launch a new digital cellular radio system, simultaneously in Germany, France and the UK. The shares moved up strongly to touch 385p, before closing 9 higher at 383p, on good turnover of 5.2m shares. Henderson Crosthwaite were said to have been heavy buyers of Vodafone, as were UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the company's broker. Disappointing figures from Allied Colloids prompted a slide in the shares. Profits of Pounds 42.1m were up by Pounds 3.2m on last year but the market had expected Pounds 44m and the shares were marked down by 20p. There was some reconsideration after the company's meeting with analysts and the shares recovered to close 8 off at 205p. Hoare Govett was, however, unimpressed and shifted its stance from a hold to a sell, arguing that the stock was rated too highly. Clinical laboratory JS Pathology jumped 16 to 170p after Corning of the US announced that its subsidiary CLSI was making an offer worth Pounds 23.1m, or 175p per share, for all the Pathology stock. Lloyds Bank fell 7 to 432p, awaiting the bank's response to HSBC's increased offer for Midland. Specialists said that if Lloyds failed to win control of Midland it was most unlikely that it would move against TSB or Royal Bank of Scotland. An offer for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the highly regarded building society, was one option that was put forward. Nevertheless, speculators chased Royal Bank of Scotland, which closed 5 higher at 204p on turnover of 3.2m. TSB edged up 2 1/2 to 144 1/2 p, on heavy turnover of 6.3m, after news that the bank is buying out the minority 49 per cent interest in TSB Channel Islands. The latter soared 93 to 246p on the news. Standard Chartered plummeted to 476p before stabilising to close 17 off at 481p in the wake of fears that the bank may have to increase provisions against losses incurred by its Indian branches. Dealers said it was unlikely that Standard would have to increase provisions of Pounds 50m already announced. Fears about the future of a European Fighter Aircraft project on which British Aerospace is the lead contractor, weakened the shares, and they ended 5 lower at 345p. A meeting for institutional investors is being planned by the company's brokers next week. An analyst's forecast cut accompanied by a gloomy outlook for the company caused a retreat in IMI. The shares fell 6 to 290p after Smith New Court reduced its 1993 profits forecast for IMI by Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 90.1m. The current-year figure was left at Pounds 80m. Caution by County NatWest on the industrial conglomerates sent several leaders lower. These included BTR, which shed 3 to 478p, while Cookson Group gave up 4 to 160p. International drinks group Guinness improved 5 to 608p, supported by conversion of loan stock and preference shares into ordinary shares, amid suggestions that French cognac and luxury goods group LVMH must buy more Guinness shares if its agreed 24 per cent cross stake is not to be diluted. Unilever was 8 higher at 915p in active trading of 2.3m shares, as the market reassessed some of the more defensive stocks neglected in the euphoria following April's general election. Mr Carl Short, food manufacturing analyst at Nomura, pointed out that Unilever has underperformed the market by 10 per cent in the last three months and as a quality stock is due to recover. Albert Fisher, 3 1/2 lower at 73 1/2 p, suffered from speculation that takeover opportunities may be limited in future, and was also hit by suggestions of a profit downgrade from Kleinwort Benson.

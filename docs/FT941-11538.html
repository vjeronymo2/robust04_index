			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: The dark side of emerging markets The first month of the new year has seen the flip side to investment in the world's emerging markets, a salutary reminder that these markets remain extremely volatile. Turkey dived nearly 35 per cent in dollar terms over the week after the currency crisis that saw the lira devalued by 12 per cent, and ultimately led to the resignation of the central bank governor. Poland's bubble was pricked - it remains to be seen over the next few trading sessions whether or not it has finally burst - although this has yet to show up in the IFC data printed on this page. In Latin America, Brazil lost 10 per cent in dollar terms: however, the story here remains uncertain until a decision one way or the other on the fiscal package. Pakistan took a knock, but commentators say this was due mainly to profit-taking, particularly in the cement, chemical and pharmaceutical sectors. It is worth noting that India benefited from Pakistan's loss, as foreign investors switched portfolios. The performance of these markets in recent days tends to support the view that they have seen a much needed correction in overbought conditions, as opposed - with the exception, perhaps, of Poland - to a freefall. Turkey remains unsettled, down 7 per cent yesterday, although foreign investors have come in as bargain hunters; the market's fall was provoked by domestic selling. Brazil, meanwhile, has soared by almost 20 per cent in local currency terms this week. Investors could be in for another rollercoaster ride.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- EMERGING MARKETS: IFC WEEKLY INVESTABLE PRICE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                      Dollar terms                  No. of       Jan 28   % Change     % Change Market           stocks         1994   over week   on Dec '93  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina          (25)     1,054.64        +4.3         +6.1 Brazil             (57)       295.26       -10.1        +26.9 Chile              (25)       631.09        +0.5        +14.4 Colombia1          (11)       765.94        +3.3        +18.8 Mexico             (70)     1,063.83        +2.1         +6.3 Peru2              (11)       138.87        +7.1        +14.8 Venezuela3         (11)       610.30        +2.8         +3.1  --------------------------------------------------------------------- East Asia China4             (18)       131.86        -0.9        -11.7 South Korea5      (156)       126.65        +8.2         +7.2 Philippines        (18)       291.13        -9.3        -14.5 Taiwan, China6     (90)       133.08        +1.0         -1.6  --------------------------------------------------------------------- South Asia India7             (77)       141.00        +7.8        +21.1 Indonesia8         (37)       127.10        +0.8         +1.9 Malaysia          (105)       274.57        +0.5        -19.0 Pakistan9          (15)       375.95        -9.2         -3.1 Sri Lanka10         (5)       203.98        +0.3        +15.1 Thailand           (55)       426.15        +7.5        -10.8  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Euro/Mid East Greece             (25)       265.51        -5.4        +16.6 Hungary11           (5)       252.22       +14.8        +51.3 Jordan             (13)       171.19        +0.9         +3.4 Poland12           (12)     1,184.79       +18.5        +44.9 Portugal           (25)       128.25        +3.0        +12.7 Turkey13           (40)       168.92       -34.8        -20.5 Zimbabwe14          (5)       197.05        +0.7         -2.5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                               Local currency terms                        Jan 28    % Change      % Change Market                   1994    over week    on Dec '93  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina          647,154.25         +4.4          +6.1 Brazil          180,825,375.1         -2.2         +77.9 Chile                1,087.48         +0.3         +14.1 Colombia1            1,109.51         +3.7         +19.7 Mexico               1,425.14         +2.1          +6.2 Peru2                  185.12         +8.1         +16.4 Venezuela3           1,494.18         +2.8          +5.1  --------------------------------------------------------------------- East Asia China4                 144.91         -0.9         -11.7 South Korea5           134.57         +7.9          +7.2 Philippines            384.66         -9.3         -13.4 Taiwan, China6         132.30         +1.4          -1.1  --------------------------------------------------------------------- South Asia India7                 155.93         +7.8         +21.1 Indonesia8             146.08         +1.1          +2.6 Malaysia               280.07         +1.4         -16.9 Pakistan9              513.73         -9.2          -2.7 Sri Lanka10            219.23         -0.1         +14.8 Thailand               432.16         +7.4         -10.6  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Euro/Mid East Greece                 450.34         -5.8         +17.1 Hungary11              308.42        +15.8         +52.8 Jordan                 249.34         +1.0          +4.1 Poland12             1,629.39        +18.9         +47.6 Portugal               154.60         +2.3         +11.9 Turkey13             1,366.15        -25.4          -6.1 Zimbabwe14             245.31         +0.3         +14.8  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Indices are calculated at end-week, and weekly changes are percentage movement from the previous Friday.

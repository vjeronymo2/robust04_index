			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Economics: Major faces trade figures hurdle in election run-up POOR economic data during an election campaign is never good news for the incumbent party, but trade figures are especially unwelcome. They have contributed towards upsets on many occasions, the February 1974 election campaign to name but one. A current account deficit of Pounds 312m for January was announced just two days before the actual election. Mr Edward Heath, the sitting prime minister lost. So the Conservative party will be waiting in some trepidation for today's trade figures even if they do come almost three weeks before polling day. Once they are out and absorbed, John Major can breathe a sigh of relief, for there will be no more significant UK economic data announced before the election. Highlights of the week ahead, with the median of City forecasts in brackets from MMS International, a financial information company, include: Today: UK, February visible trade balance (Pounds 900m deficit), February current account (Pounds 450m deficit); Japan, February money supply (up 2.2 per cent on year); Sweden, fourth quarter GDP; Canada, January retail sales (up 0.9 per cent).

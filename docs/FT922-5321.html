			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / International Company News: Arco's 17.5% Wytch Farm stake up for sale THE 17.5 per cent stake in the Wytch Farm oil field owned by Atlantic Richfield (Arco), the US oil group, is to be offered for sale. It could fetch between Pounds 180m and Pounds 200m, according to oil analysts. Dorset-based Wytch Farm is the UK's largest onshore oil field, producing around 60,000 barrels of oil a day. The sale of the Arco stake will be carried out by Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank. Other stakes in Wytch Farm are held by BP (50 per cent), Premier Consolidated (12.5 per cent), Clyde Petroleum (7.5 per cent) and Purbeck Petroleum (7.5 per cent). Purbeck Petroleum was set up by a syndicate of banks last year to manage some of the assets of Kelt Energy, the oil group which ran into severe problems in financing its debts. Kelt is believed in trade circles to have turned down a bid of Pounds 80m for its 7.5 per cent stake in Wytch Farm in 1991. Arco inherited its 17.5 per cent stake in Wytch Farm following its takeover of Tricentrol in 1988, during a period of intense takeover activity in the UK oil industry. Arco had originally targeted Britoil, but lost out in the battle for control of the latter to BP. There was speculation yesterday that British Gas may be interested in acquiring Arco's Wytch Farm stake. British Gas discovered Wytch Farm in partnership with BP, with each holding a 50 per cent stake in the oil field. However, British Gas was forced by the Government to sell its holding in the late 1980s. Arco is also putting up for sale other of its European oil and gas assets, including its interests in the Amethyst and 'V' fields in the North Sea. The US group is embarking on a plan to reduce its capital spending by 20 per cent over the next five years.</p>

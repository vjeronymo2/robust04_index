			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CORPORATE STRATEGIES AIM TO CATCH 'AGE WAVE';  </P> <P> HEALTH-CARE, OTHER INDUSTRIES REALIZE THERE'S GOLD IN THEM THAR OLD FOLKS  </P> <P> Investing for one's old age is always a good idea. But investing in the aging  of the nation as a whole can mean big profits.  </P> <P> If projections are correct, the current "age wave" in this country is just a  ripple compared to what is coming. More than 75 million Americans who helped  make up the '60s generation are approaching a different sort of 60s decade.  </P> <P> Although the typical horizon of U.S. business tends to be measured in years  rather than decades, companies catering to the graying masses are proliferating  as the realization grows that this wave of older Americans is building.  </P> <P> Few industries are as securely assured of a piece of the market as the health  field. The figures behind the industry's growth are staggering.  </P> <P> More than 30 million Americans are older than 65 -- more than the total  population of Canada. The fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population is 85  and older. And within 30 years, nearly one in four Americans will be at least  65.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Difficulty Keeping Pace  </P> <P> Economists estimate that a 100-bed nursing home would have to be built every  day for the next 40 years just to keep pace with demand. The amount spent in  this country each year on personal health care -- which excludes money spent on  research and the like -- is expected to reach $1.4 trillion in the year 2000,  up from $443 billion in 1987.  </P> <P> And nearly all segments of the health-care and medical fields are expected to  take part in the explosive rate of growth.  </P> <P> How does an investor, then, take advantage of these burgeoning industries?  Carefully, analysts say.  </P> <P> Although no one doubts that these goods and services will be needed in the year  2012 -- when the first of the baby-boom generation pass the age of 65 -- few  know where the money will come from to pay for the medical care.  </P> <P> "The elderly represent about one-third of health-care spending," said Gerard  Anderson, director of Johns Hopkins Center for Hospital Finance &amp;  Management. "Of course it's a significant impetus (for business). But it's  unclear whether Medicare and the Social Security programs will have any money  to cover them in 2010 or 2020."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Government Share to Increase  </P> <P> The federal government picks up slightly more than one-fourth of the amount  spent in this country on personal health care each year through Medicare and  Medicaid payments. That figure is expected to increase to nearly one-third, or  $460 billion, of total medical costs by the year 2000.  </P> <P> At that time, however, there will be just two workers paying into the nation's  coffers for each Medicare recipient, instead of the current four workers per  recipient, according to estimates from the Health Care Financing  Administration, the federal agency that runs the Medicare program.  </P> <P> Analysts warn that there is a race of sorts taking place in the industry. New  and expensive medical technology, which is blamed for much of the skyrocketing  cost of health care, also has the potential to reverse that trend.  </P> <P> "Ultimately," said Jonathan W. Osgood, a health-care analyst at the Baltimore  investment firm of Alex. Brown &amp; Sons, "the answer to the health-care cost  spiral is technology -- technology that actually results in prevention (of  illnesses), rather than just treatment. But will we be able to afford the  advances in technology until it gets that far?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Investors Optimistic  </P> <P> In the meantime, investors appear to be optimistic.  </P> <P> At a recent conference sponsored by Alex. Brown in Baltimore, dozens of  companies in the health-care and biotechnology fields gathered to present to  potential shareholders and other industry executives the science and products  that are changing the face of health care. Participants described the mood of  those attending as showing "a renewed interest" and "upbeat."  </P> <P> Although the fate of just a handful of the companies was tied directly to the  elderly, virtually everyone realized that the aging population would increase  the markets for their products. And in turn, those executives can thank the  growing markets for persuading others to invest in their companies.  </P> <P> Few companies attending the conference did not have at least one product that  would be used predominantly by the elderly.  </P> <P> Synergen Inc. of Boulder, Colo., discussed its research into new drugs for  arthritis and emphysema.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Diagnostic Tests Developed  </P> <P> Centocor Inc. of Malvern, Pa., is developing diagnostic tests for a range of  cancers and for hardening of the arteries.  </P> <P> Privately held U.S. Bioscience in Blue Bell, Pa., a 2-year-old spinoff of U.S.  Healthcare Inc., has developed a drug for the treatment of breast cancer,  particularly prevalent in post-menopausal women.  </P> <P> Marion Laboratories Inc. discussed Cardizem, the largest-selling cardiovascular  drug in the United States. Cardizem is used to treat angina and hypertension  and is being evaluated for other cardiovascular problems.  </P> <P> And Athena Neurosciences Inc., a private company in South San Francisco, is  developing diagnostic and therapeutic products for Alzheimer's disease. "It's a  sobering thought that probably 10 to 15 people in this room today will succumb  to this disease someday," the company's president and chief executive, John  Groom, told the 100 or so people in the audience.  </P> <P> The nursing-home industry is perhaps the most striking example of both the  potential growth and financial uncertainties facing the health field.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Elderly as an Untapped Market'  </P> <P> "At one time," said Deborah Cloud, spokeswoman for the American Assn. of Homes  for the Aging, a group representing not-for-profit nursing homes, "the  nonprofits were about the only ones interested in care for older people,  because it wasn't perceived as a lucrative market for commercial businesses.  Now, almost any commercial enterprise that sees the elderly as an untapped  market are trying to tap them."  </P> <P> There are about 1.5 million nursing-home beds in this country, according to the  American Health Care Assn. (AHCA) in Washington. That figure is expected to  more than double in the next few decades.  </P> <P> While that sort of demand, under normal circumstances, would mean unbridled  expansion and profits, analysts said, the current financial position of the  industry has been slipping for years.  </P> <P> In 1985, the industry peaked, with an average pretax income of 7.4% of  revenues, according to an AHCA economist. The ratio slipped in 1987, when the  industry lost an amount equal to 1.6% of total revenue. And last year was even  worse, the group said, and stock prices sagged.  </P> <P> Still, the industry has total revenue of more than $40 billion each year, and  that figure is expected to triple by the year 2000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coverage Shifted  </P> <P> Thanks to the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act that took effect this year,  government reimbursements for nursing home care have increased substantially,  as many elderly nursing home patients are now covered by Medicare rather than  Medicaid, which principally targets the poor.  </P> <P> A recent report from Prudential-Bache Securities said: "With Medicare revenues  reimbursed on a cost basis and running about double Medicaid payments -- and  about 20% to 25% higher than private fees -- we see major revenue and income  benefits to many in the industry."  </P> <P> Among those poised to take advantage of the good news is Manor Care Inc. of  Silver Spring, Md. The company, with 157 homes with 21,000 beds across the  country, has added two dozen new facilities in the last two years.  </P> <P> Manor Care intends to open between eight to 10 new homes annually, representing  1,200 to 1,400 beds, in the next few years, said James A. MacCutcheon, the  company's chief financial officer.  </P> <P> "There is very little substitute for this service," he said. "What is it that  is going to keep people out of nursing homes? There really is not a whole lot.  There is always going to be a need for skilled nursing care."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Marriott Pushes Into Industry  </P> <P> Marriott Corp. apparently shares that view. The company began pushing into the  long-term care industry in 1987 after extensive market research.  </P> <P> The company, through its Marriott Senior Living Services division, now manages  more than 2,000 beds in nine facilities. Eight new projects are either under  way or planned, including one community at Fort Belvoir, Va., for retired Army  officers.  </P> <P> Brian C. Swinton, vice president of product development, sales and marketing  for Marriott Senior Living unit, said the company recognized that the people  filling Marriott's large chain of hotels would eventually need lodging of  another kind.  </P> <P> He said the company's thinking went like this: "All of a sudden -- wait a  minute -- what we really have to do is cater to the older population. That is a  natural extension of what we do well."  </P></p>

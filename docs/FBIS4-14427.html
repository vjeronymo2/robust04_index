			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS] </F>   [Text] Moscow 30 Mar, TASS -- The lower house of the  Russian Parliament is making efforts to reach stabilisation in  society which meets the support of Moslem believers in Russia,  said the speaker of the State Duma, Ivan Rybkin, at a meeting  with Moslem leaders of religious denominations of the Russian  Federation on Tuesday.    The meeting was attended by the chairman of the Central  Department of Moslem Communities of Russia, the European Part of  the CIS and the Baltic States (MDEC), Talgat  Tadzhuddin-Sheikh-ul-Islam, members of the MDEC presidium, Ravil  Gainutdin and Dzhafar Bikmayev.    During the talks the sides discussed problems of cooperation  between the state and Moslem organisations in reaching civic  peace and accord in Russia, problems of imposing fundamentalism  and extremism on Russian Moslems by foreign Islamic  organisations and the assistance rendered by the state in the  restoration and construction of mosques and education of priests.    During the talks religious leaders raised the question of  setting up a special state department for religious affairs.  They also touched upon unfair distribution of air time on  television, which prefers foreign missionaries, infringing on  the rights of traditional religious confessions in Russia.</p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / GPA Group's Aborted Global Issue: Market takes the cancellation in its stride THE MOST cheerful interpretation that analysts could put on the sudden cancellation of the GPA Group flotation yesterday was that it removed one source of supply of new stock. Money earmarked for the issue could be diverted elsewhere in the equity market, which is beginning to suffer indigestion from the weight of new paper being sold. But as less optimistic strategists put it, hardly any UK investors had earmarked cash for GPA anyway. The announcement that the issue had been pulled at the last moment was certainly a factor in the 35.7 point fall in the FT-SE 100 index to 2,562.7. But the market had already coped with the postponement of the 3i flotation until next year. Strategists feel the stock market has more to worry about than delayed flotations. Overnight falls in New York and Tokyo, due to pressure on corporate profits, were more frequently cited as reasons for nervousness in the UK market yesterday. The dampening of hopes for economic growth in the UK and the prospect of further downgradings of earnings estimates were also viewed as more serious concerns. As one strategist put it: 'GPA barely makes it into the top 10 of reasons to be bearish.' The market could become more concerned, though, if there were suggestions that the cancellation of the flotation put GPA's financial position into doubt. A well-publicised, last-minute, cancellation like GPA's - unlike 3i's issue which was still some way from the market - cannot help sentiment towards other issues in the pipeline, but it may have little real impact. The UK market is experiencing the greatest run of new issues, apart from privatisations, since the 1987 stock market crash. Wellcome Trust, the majority shareholder in Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals group, which is planning a Pounds 4bn secondary offering, said that GPA's cancellation 'in no way changes or affects our plans.' However, Wellcome's shares fell 26p to 919p yesterday. Like GPA, the Wellcome sale is a big international offering. But corporate financiers agreed the GPA flotation was so distinct from the Wellcome issue that the latter should not be seriously affected. They noted that Wellcome's sale structure was more flexible than GPA's had been, allowing it to direct shares to areas of stronger demand. Further, the group is more readily comprehensible to investors, and is part of a well-researched sector of the market. Wellcome is also putting a great effort into educating investors through a massive international road show. And since it is a secondary offering, it is being priced against an existing share quote, whereas GPA's pricing was a much more difficult exercise. Other issues in train, such as MFI and Kenwood, are not expected to be seriously damaged by GPA's decision. More worrying for them is the general fall in the stock market over recent weeks, which will be reducing the prices vendors can expect for the shares.</p>

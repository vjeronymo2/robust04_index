			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHUTTLE COMPUTER OK; ATLANTIS CLEARED FOR LIFTOFF  </P> <P> A spare engine computer checked out Saturday and NASA cleared the space shuttle  Atlantis for a Tuesday launch with the Jupiter-bound Galileo probe.  </P> <P> Officials said the countdown, interrupted after a previous computer developed a  problem, would resume at 9:01 p.m. PDT today, aiming for liftoff during a  26-minute period starting at 9:57 a.m. Tuesday.  </P> <P> The faulty computer, which forced postponement of a planned Thursday launch,  was removed and a spare was installed Friday. Testing of the new unit was  completed Saturday and workers began closing up the engine compartment,  removing work platforms and reinstalling heat shields.  </P> <P> The 230-pound, $6-million computer controls all functions of one of Atlantis'  three main engines during launch. Its failure could lead to an engine shutdown  and an emergency landing.  </P> <P> The five astronauts who will fly the mission returned here from their training  base in Houston. They had gone back there after the Thursday launch date was  scrubbed.  </P> <P> The crew members are commander Donald Williams, pilot Mike McCulley and mission  specialists Ellen Baker, Franklin Chang-Diaz and Shannon Lucid.  </P> <P> During the five-day mission, the astronauts are to release the nuclear-powered  Galileo spacecraft on the start of a six-year journey to Jupiter. The craft is  to shoot a probe into the Jovian atmosphere and orbit the planet, examining it  for 22 months.  </P> <P> A federal judge on Tuesday rejected a request by three environmental groups to  halt the flight for fear that the Galileo could scatter plutonium, its nuclear  fuel, over Florida if the shuttle exploded. The groups have appealed.  </P> <P> A long-range weather forecast said conditions on Tuesday will be 70% favorable.  Weather officials said there was a 20% probability of showers or thunderstorms  and a 10% chance of winds from the southeast exceeding the launch limit of 23  m.p.h.  </P></p>

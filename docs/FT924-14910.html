			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brittan clears reform of Milk Marketing Board PLANS TO reform the Milk Marketing Board for England and Wales by turning it into a single voluntary co-operative were yesterday cleared under the EC's competition rules of the risk of creating or strengthening a monopoly. However, Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, said in a letter to Mr John Gummer, UK agriculture minister, that he would have preferred the statutory board to be succeeded by 'a number of successor organisations rather than a single voluntary co-operative'. The MMB welcomed the acceptance of its plans. Mr Bob Steven, chairman, said: 'This announcement is a significant step forward in the process of establishing a successful co-operative.' The Agriculture Ministry said yesterday it expected to table legislation on reforming the MMB early next month. The MMB's plan to end its 60-year-old monopoly has come under vigorous opposition from the dairy industry. Last month Mr Biran Smith, president of the Dairy Trade Federation (DTF), said he could not understand how a government that believed in a free market could support its plans. However, the latest MMB plans bear little resemblance to its original ambitions. Sir Leon 'noted with approval' that they were 'considerably less restrictive of competition than were earlier proposals'. In particular Dairy Crest - the MMB's wholly-owned subsidiary with a 25 per cent share of the UK's manufactured dairy products - is to be hived off. Sir Leon also made it clear that 'given the element of uncertainty' over the full details of the plans, his department would be carefully monitoring the initial period of trading by the new co-operative. Mr Smith of the DTF pointed out yesterday that the EC had been 'sufficiently alarmed as to insist on prior changes to the board's plans. The Commission has vindicated recent warnings from the dairy trade, consumers and retailers that an unregulated monoply was in the making.'</p>

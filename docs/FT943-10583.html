			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / BCCI fraudster is jailed for 3 years A former senior employee of Bank of Credit and Commerce International was jailed for three years at the Old Bailey yesterday in spite of unprecedented pleas by US prosecutors. Mr Imran Imam, a former accounts officer in the bank's London offices, was convicted last week of helping to boost the failed bank's profits fraudulently by Dollars 250m. He achieved this by falsifying records relating to bogus loans to customers from which BCCI claimed fee and interest income. The jury found him guilty of charges including conspiracy to conceal or falsify documents and furnishing false information to the bank's auditors. Mr Imam's sentencing followed highly unusual pleas in mitigation from US prosecuting officials who argued that his co-operation with them had resulted in the recovery of Dollars 730m of missing BCCI funds. Mr John Moscow, assistant New York district attorney, and Mr Richard Small, counsel with the Federal Reserve, gave evidence to the court praising Mr Imam's role in their investigations. Mr Imam's co-operation with the US authorities started when the bank collapsed in July 1991 and included his giving evidence in two criminal trials in the US. Imprisoning Mr Imam, Judge Pownall said the assistance he had given to US investigators meant he was entitled to a substantially shorter sentence. The judge also said he could understand why Mr Imam might have felt 'hard done by' when the UK authorities decided to prosecute him. During a pre-trial hearing lawyers for Mr Imam said that while he was co-operating with the US authorities he had been led to believe that he would not be prosecuted in the UK. The Serious Fraud Office has denied ever giving such an assurance to the US authorities. The judge said, however, that the BCCI fraud was a 'stupendous' one in which Mr Imam had played 'a dishonest and not inconsiderable part'. He accepted that Mr Imam had acted under the instructions of Mr Swaleh Naqvi, the former BCCI chief executive, and that others had been more responsible for the fraud. However, he said Mr Imam had played a larger role in the fraud than he had asked the court to believe.</p>

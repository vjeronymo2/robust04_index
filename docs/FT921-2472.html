			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Falkands farmers import rams to improve wool FALKLAND ISLANDS sheep farmers, who are selling their wool at below the cost of production, are aiming to return to profit by improving the quality of their production, writes David Blackwell. They are establishing a new stud flock based on 650 sheep imported from Tasmania. The islanders want to change the genetics of the Falklands' 650,000 sheep by supplying the 90 sheep farms with rams producing finer wool. Councillor Kevin Kilmartin, who owns Bluff Cove farm on East Falkland, said in London this week that Falklands wool was being sold at Pounds 2 a kilogram clean, while production costs were about Pounds 2.50 a kilogram. At the moment the islands' government is subsidising the sheep farmers with some of the revenue generated by the issue of fishing licences. The introduction of the Pounds 260,000 stud flock is expected to reduce the diameter of Falklands wool fibre by 3 microns on average over a period of three years. Most of the islands' wool is between 25 and 29 microns at present, and is sold to the clothing industry. But finer wools fetch a higher price. Mr Kilmartin pointed out that below 20 microns clean wool is fetching Pounds 8 a kilogram.</p>

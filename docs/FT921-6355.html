			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / An English solution to an Irish problem: But Dublin must now find its own answer to the abortion dilemma THE YOUNG women demonstrators who scuffled with police outside the Irish parliament this week waved banners saying 'Get your rosaries off our ovaries.' The plight of the 14-year-old rape victim, who is finally to be allowed to travel to Britain for an abortion following a Supreme Court ruling on Wednesday, has produced a dramatic backlash against Ireland's strict anti-abortion laws, to the point where a growing number of Irish politicians may be ready to countenance legalising abortion in certain circumstances. Ms Mary Harney, minister of state for the environment, said this week: 'If it is all right for the 14-year-old girl to go to London, the logical conclusion is that we should provide limited facilities (for abortion) in this country. . . . A lot of people, including church people, accept she should be allowed to go to Britain for an abortion. . . . If she can go to London, we cannot avoid the hypocritical situation of saying it is an English solution to an Irish problem.' Mr Dick Spring, leader of the opposition Labour party, said: 'I think the political courage is there for change.' Underpinning this about-turn is the radical change in Irish society during the past decade. While the law has become stricter, as a result of a 1983 constitutional amendment, the number of abortions has increased and the numbers of unmarried and lone mothers has grown dramatically. More than 4,000 Irish women obtained abortions in Britain last year, according to figures based on those who gave Irish addresses, and this, says Ms Valerie Richardson, a lecturer in social administration at University College, Dublin, represents only 'a half to a third' of the true number. If one assumes that others gave British addresses, then, on the basis of about 53,000 live births a year in Ireland, the rate of terminated pregnancies was probably 10 to 15 per cent. And, as the figure is growing annually, it may be approaching the level in England and Wales - about 21 per cent, according to the British Family Planning Association. While about 72 per cent of British women practice contraception, only 20 per cent of Irish women do, according to research by Ms Richardson at Dublin's main maternity hospital. This included 'natural' means such as the rhythm method and withdrawal. Government statistics say that more than 75 per cent of live births to women in the under-24 age group last year were to unmarried mothers and that the figure for the under-20 age group was nearly 90 per cent. Twenty-five per cent of their children go for adoption. The number of lone mothers in Ireland is officially estimated at 30,000, and that, says Mr Tony McCashin of the National Economic and Social Council in Dublin, 'is a significant underestimate'. He says the real figure is difficult to obtain from official statistics, 'but what can be said very definitely is that, as a sub-group in the population, they are growing very rapidly.' The reason, says Ms Richardson, is that 'marriage as a solution for young mothers has stopped being a way out for them.' Marriages have dropped from almost 23,000 per year in the early 1970s to 17,500 in 1990. Such social changes - driven by higher living standards, a growing number of women in the workforce, emigration and Irish women looking at the greater freedom of choice afforded their peers in other European Community countries  -have been far more powerful than the Catholic church-supported laws designed to contain them. Politicians are now being called upon to recognise that fact.</p>

Approved implementation schedules for FFYs 92 and 93 are not disturbed and remain in effect until amended. In general, HUD expects that funds allocated in a FFY will be obligated within two years and expended within three years of approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Another HA asked that changes to the time frames reflect the particular needs of HAs with over 10,000 units. For these large authorities, it was suggested that the time frames should remain as they currently are.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  HUD disagrees that a longer period is needed for larger HAs. HUD recognizes the concerns of the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) and other HAs with over 10,000 units. HUD wants to point out that section 14 of the Act does not differentiate between the types of submissions to be made by HAs participating in the CGP due to their size. Nevertheless, HUD believes that the NYCHA and other large HAs will be benefitted, along with all other HAs participating in the CGP, as a result of the simplified requirements contained in this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  HAs also suggested that the way to improve expenditures is not to shorten the time but to make changes in HUD regulations including procurement, HUD oversight, pre-qualification of vendors, use of state and local government purchasing contracts, use of previous participation forms which would be valid for 2&hyph;3 years, training of HUD staff, expediting of Davis-Bacon issuances, and an increase in the administrative costs cap.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  HUD will address these issues under the heading ``Miscellaneous Issues'' below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> PHMAP Scores Relating to Obligation and Expenditure of Modernization Funds <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  CLPHA mentioned in its comments that HAs on the average nationwide now spend 80% of their modernization funds within 3.25 years from the time they receive their ACC amendment. In a large proportion of cases, the remaining 20% of the funds are held up for a variety of reasons beyond the control of the HA ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  unsatisfactory performance by contractors, litigation, unforeseen problems with lead-based paint, asbestos, other hazardous materials or site problems). CLPHA recommended that PHA's PHMAP scores be based on the time it take them to obligate or expend 80% of their modernization money, since this is much more within the control of the PHA. Another commenter objected to the all or nothing bases of PHMAP. Although no suggestions were made, the PHA suggested as an overall recommendation that a PHA's performance be based on whether they have accomplished the scope of work stated in their work plan as opposed to whether they have residuals resulting from this plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  HUD has referred these comments to the PHMAP working group for consideration in the development of a revised PHMAP rule. If a HA can demonstrate that a longer implementation schedule is necessary, e.g., size of grant, complexity of work, HUD may approve a schedule that exceeds the National guideline. PHMAP is based on whether they are performing under the HUD-approved or extended schedule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Alternative Management Strategy <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  While commmenters appreciated the mechanism of a prior corrective action order with appeal rights that the proposed rule offers, the parameters were found to be too vague. The following improvements were suggested: (a) Prior to imposition of this penalty, the agency must have been declared mod-troubled for at least one year; (b) The mod-troubled authority must be failing to meet the objectives set forth in its Memorandum of Agreement; and (c) At least six months prior to imposing the penalty, a team consisting of HUD personnel and better performing CGP agencies should be sent to the affected authority to try to assist the agency in getting its program in order. Some commenters agreed that a HUD alternative management strategy may be imposed as long as the HA is given a voice in the strategy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. General Considerations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To facilitate the testing of new policy approaches to social  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problems the Department will_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Work with States to develop research and demonstrations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in areas consistent with the Department's policy goals;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Consider proposals that test alternatives that diverge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from that policy direction; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Consider, as a criterion for approval, a State's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability to implement the research or demonstration project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the Department expects to review and accept a range of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposals, it may disapprove or limit proposals on policy grounds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or because the proposal creates potential constitutional problems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or violations of civil rights laws or equal protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. The Department seeks proposals which preserve and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enhance beneficiary access to quality services. Within this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overall policy framework, the Department is prepared to_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Grant waivers to test the same or related policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> innovations in multiple States, (replication is a valid mechanism  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by which the effectiveness of policy changes can be assessed);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Approve demonstration projects ranging in scale from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonably small to state-wide or multi-state, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Consider joint Medicare-Medicaid demonstrations, such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as those granted in the Program for All-Inclusive Care for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Elderly (PACE) and Social Health Maintenance Organization (SHMO)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrations, and Aid to Families with Dependent Children  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (AFDC)-Medicaid waivers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Duration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The complex range of policy issues, design methodologies,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and unanticipated events inherent in any research or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstration makes it very difficult to establish a single  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department policy on the duration of 1115 waivers. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department is committed, through negotiations with State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicants, to_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Approve waivers of at least sufficient duration to give  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new policy approaches a fair test. The duration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waiver approval should be congruent with the magnitude  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and complexity of the project (for example, large-scale  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statewide reform programs will typically require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waivers of five years);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Provide reasonable time for the preparation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meaningful evaluation results prior to the conclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the demonstration; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Recognize that new approaches often involve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considerable start-up time and allowance for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation delays.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is also committed, when successful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrations provide an appropriate basis, to working with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State governments to seek permanent statutory changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporating those results. In such cases, consideration will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be given to a reasonable extension of existing waivers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The BAAQMD more recently has collected ambient monitoring data that show no violations of the ozone NAAQS (See discussion in Section III.1 below). Accordingly, on November 12, 1993 California requested redesignation of the area to attainment with respect to the ozone NAAQS and submitted an ozone maintenance SIP for the San Francisco Bay Area. The three co-lead agencies in the San Francisco Bay Area under section 174 of the Act, the BAAQMD, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC), and the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), delegated authority to the Joint Air Quality Policy Committee (JAQPC), which is composed of representative board members from the three co-lead agencies, to hold a joint agency public hearing on the redesignation request and maintenance plan. On August 18, 1993, JAQPC held a public hearing on the redesignation request and maintenance plan. The plan and redesignation request were subsequently adopted by the BAAQMD, MTC and ABAG on September 1, 1993, September 22, 1993 and September 16, 1993, respectively, at regularly scheduled agency board meetings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All SIP submittals to EPA must meet certain minimum administrative and technical criteria as set forth in 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (the ``completeness'' criteria) in order for the Administrator to review and take action on the submittal. Section 110(k)(1) of the Act describes the mandatory timeframe for EPA's determination of completeness and rulemaking action on plan submissions. In accordance with section 110(k)(1)(B) of the Act, the San Francisco Bay Area's ozone redesignation request and maintenance plan was deemed complete by operation of law on May 12, 1994. Thus, the submittal is considered complete as of November 12, 1993, the date it was submitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 21, 1994, CARB sent a letter to EPA requesting ``parallel processing'' of certain revisions to the San Francisco Bay Area's ozone maintenance plan and SIP, including new contingency measures in the maintenance plan, a 1990 emissions inventory, emission statement rule, new source review rule, and amendments to various VOC RACT regulations. The parallel processing request contained draft copies of the SIP revisions that the BAAQMD will adopt this year. The parallel processing provision of 40 CFR part 51, appendix V allows EPA to propose action on the draft revisions prior to submission of the locally adopted SIP revision by the State. At the time of final EPA action, the complete revisions must be submitted to EPA by the State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Evaluation Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 1990 Amendments revised section 107(d)(1)(E) to provide five specific requirements that an area must meet in order to be redesignated from nonattainment to attainment: (1) The area must have attained the applicable NAAQS; (2) the area has met all relevant requirements under section 110 and part D of the Act; (3) the area has a fully approved SIP under section 110(k) of the Act; (4) the air quality improvement must be permanent and enforceable; and, (5) the area must have a fully approved maintenance plan pursuant to section 175A of the Act. Section 107(d)(3)(D) allows a Governor to initiate the redesignation process for an area to apply for attainment status.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Review of State Submittal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The California redesignation request for the San Francisco Bay Area meets the five requirements of section 107(d)(3)(E), noted above. Following is a brief description of how the State has fulfilled each of these requirements. EPA's technical support document (TSD) contains a more detailed analysis of the submittal with respect to certain of these evaluation criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Attainment of the Ozone NAAQS <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> A. The Ozone Standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Attainment of the ozone NAAQS is determined based on the expected number of exceedances in a calendar year. The method for determining attainment of the ozone NAAQS is contained in 40 CFR 50.9 and appendix H to that section. The simplest method by which expected exceedances are calculated is by averaging actual exceedances at each monitoring site over a three year period. An area is in attainment of the standard if this average results in expected exceedances for each monitoring site of 1.0 or less per calendar year. When a valid daily maximum hourly average value is not available for each required monitoring day during the year, these missing days must be accounted for when estimating exceedances for the year. Appendix H provides the formula used to estimate the expected number of exceedances for each year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

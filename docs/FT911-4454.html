			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Blue Circle Blue Circle has certainly displayed some nifty financial footwork of late. The net interest charge on Pounds 260m of net debt was a mere Pounds 1.1m last year, thanks mainly to round tripping on transatlantic interest rates and the benefit of a one-off tax rebate. Gearing is comfortable even when the convertible capital bonds are treated as debt, and with cash flow running strongly the company can be justly satisfied with its performance at this stage in the cycle. The immediate difficulty for investors is getting the timing of the upturn right. It comes as no surprise to hear that profits will slide further this year; but bulls of the stock will be disappointed that the board was not prepared to forecast recovery before mid 1992. UK cement did well to claw back market share in the second half, but there is still a question mark over how far the 7 per cent price increase will stick. Hopes for the home products side must be tempered by the group's strong exposure to the commercial property market. In the longer term, much will depend on the calibre of the management. Blue Circle's recent acquisition record is hardly inspired, even if Birmid finally looks to have been sorted out. Latest evidence - an excellent five month result from Ceramica Dolomite and disappointing figures from Aalborg - is mixed. At least there was no speculative rights issue with yesterday's results. Investors ought to look carefully at the intended target when a cash call comes.</p>

			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / International Company News: French win German gas deal The privatisation of eastern Germany's gas sector has been completed with Gaz de France, the state-owned French monopoly, buying the production and storage facilities of Erdol-Erdgas Gommern from the Treuhand privatisation agency. The sale also ends a long struggle between Vereinigte Elektrizitatswerke Westfalen (VEW), the Dortmund-based utility company which tried to acquire EEG, and Gaz de France. The French group earlier this year pipped VEW to the post by putting in a higher cash bid to the Treuhand. Mr Michel Bellec, head of Gaz de France in Germany, declined to disclose the precise size of the cash payment. 'This purchase is part of our programme of internationalising the company,' said Mr Bellec. Gaz de France is the world's largest gas company, selling an annual 36bn cubic metres of gas. Last year, it recorded DM350m (Dollars 213.4m) profits on turnover of more than DM15bn. The purchase contract, which involves the French company investing over DM720m and guaranteeing 600 jobs in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, gives Gaz de France a potential foothold in the region's gas sector. Eastern Germany's gas sector is run by Verbundnetz Gas (VNG). Ruhrgas, which enjoys a 70 per cent market share in western Germany, holds the majority of shares in VNG. However, Gaz de France may want to use EEG more as a storage facility than as a production outlet, as the gas produced in eastern Germany is low quality. Known as Altmark gas, it contains about 70 per cent nitrogen and needs special burners and changes at a gas turbine before it can be burned. EEG has contracts to supply gas to VNG until 2005, although experts say Gaz de France has inherited unfavourable contracts because the delivery price is too low. VEW made the same point during its negotiations to acquire EEG. Altmark gas delivery contracts cost about 95 pfennigs per kWh, and are priced at a 25 per cent discount from H-gas, the natural gas Germany imports.</p>

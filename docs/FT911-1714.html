			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Rates disappointment leaves Nikkei easier Tokyo SHARE PRICES were mixed on position-squaring ahead of the long weekend and on disappointment that the Bank of Japan did not follow the US lead in cutting interest rates, writes Seth Sulkin in Tokyo. The Nikkei average lost 11.14 to 26,477.86, after an early high of 26,648.58 on New York's gains and a low of 26,414.44 later in the afternoon. Many large-capital issues were weak, while small and medium-sized companies were popular with investors looking for strong earnings potential. The Topix index of all first section issues gained 3.04 to 2,001.49, while the second section rose 33.66 to 3,374.63. Volume improved to 380m shares from 350m. Rises led declines by 608 to 348, with 161 stocks unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 2.54 to 1,509.34. Expectations of lower interest rates faded following comments yesterday morning by Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, finance minister, that an easing in monetary policy was not necessary at the moment. Dealers said the market still hoped, however, that the Bank of Japan would reduce the discount rate after the Golden Week holidays. Financial markets will be closed today and on Monday. Mr Craig Chudler, strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said investors were focusing more on earnings and dividend growth potential than on capital gains. Lower-priced shares were also sought, which explained the strong rises on the second section and the over-the-counter market. Big-capital companies, such as steels and utilities, eased. Some financials were stronger on persistent hopes of lower interest rates. Sumitomo Bank, Industrial Bank of Japan and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank each rose Y40, to Y2,410, Y3,910 and Y2,430 respectively. Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical fell Y50 to Y2,930 on announcing a smaller than expected 3 per cent increase in pre-tax recurring profits for the year ended March 31. The company also forecast only a 2 per cent gain in earnings growth for the current fiscal year. The pharmaceutical sector in general retreated on fears of other companies reporting poor results. Toyama Chemical shed Y10 to Y785 on stating it expects to lose Y2.5bn in the six-month period to end-May and lowering its revenue projections. The company's 30 per cent stake in a now bankrupt affiliated concern has hurt earnings and investor perceptions. Nippon Densetsu Kogyo established another record high, closing up Y60 at Y1,970 on continued speculation of increased investment in the rail industry. In Osaka, the OSE average finished at 29,412.16, up 266.76, on volume of 32m shares. Roundup THE Pacific Rim was mixed: Hong Kong was in optimistic mood but Australia was worried by the prospects for Adelaide Steamship. HONG KONG climbed 2.6 per cent in response to the overnight Wall Street advance, hopes of interest rate cuts and expectations of a breakthrough in the airport talks. The Hang Seng index added 94.91 at 3,726.14 in turnover similar to Wednesday's at HKDollars 1.72bn. AUSTRALIA was unnerved by the suspension of Adsteam and two of its associates, after the group abandoned its restructuring plans. The market was also depressed by institutional selling ahead of forthcoming rights issues. The All Ordinaries index fell 12.6 to 1,519.9 in turnover of ADollars 197m, down from ADollars 208m. The three leading listed banks exposed to Adsteam declined: NAB lost 14 cents to ADollars 6.14, Westpac 8 cents to ADollars 4.53 and ANZ 4 cents to ADollars 3.83. NEW ZEALAND firmed on lower interest rates. The Barclays index put on 15.49 to 1,491.55 in turnover of NZDollars 19.6m, against NZDollars 24.7m. Fletcher Challenge stood out with a rise of 6 cents to NZDollars 4.03 on volume of 2.2m. SEOUL rose on speculation that the government would support troubled investment trust companies. The composite index gained 7.88 to 652.27 in trading worth Won341bn. TAIWAN's weighted index declined 73.11 or 1.2 per cent to 5,777.07. Volume shrank to TDollars 59bn from TDollars 92bn.</p>

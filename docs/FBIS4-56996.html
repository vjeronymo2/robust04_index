			<p>BFN     [Text] San Jose, 8 May (ACAN-EFE) -- The presidents of five  of the six Central American nations today analyzed in Costa Rica  the conditions of the coffee and banana markets, agreed to reach  a common agenda for the next American summits, and expressed  their support for the integration of their countries and for the  Guatemalan peace talks. The chiefs of state also agreed to find  common grounds to negotiate a group free trade agreement with  Colombia and Venezuela, because their countries have signed only  bilateral agreements.    Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani, Nicaraguan President  Violeta Chamorro, Guatemalan President Ramiro De Leon Carpio,  and Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina on 8 May had  breakfast with the new Costa Rican president and signed a joint  declaration stating their decision to continue on the path of  integration.    Honduran President Carlos Reina said the Central American  nations "will not go" to the December Inter-American meeting  with U.S. President Bill Clinton "to ask questions"; "we will go  there to discuss the interests of our region in view of the  enormous economic market that has opened among Mexico, the  United States, and Canada," he added.    Reina pointed out that Central Americans will go there  "united and with sound proposals;" he also said the difficult  part is not joining NAFTA (signed by those three countries); the  difficult part lies in the negotiations themselves, because this  agreement "reflects the economic globalization that is taking  place under the current end-of-the-century conditions."    The mini-summit took place following the inaugural of Costa  Rican President Jose Maria Figueres, who took office today.  This mini-summit was held to analyze the advancements in  regional integration and to prepare an agenda for the June  Ibero-American Summit in Colombia and the summit in the United  States.    Salvadoran President-elect Armando Calderon Sol, who will  take office on 1 June, also attended the meeting; however,  Panamanian President Guillermo Endara could not attend it  because of the general elections taking place in his country  today.    Figueres told the media he talked with his Central American  colleagues about such economic issues as maintaining a partial  hold on the coffee harvest by coffee-producing countries to  pressure international markets to pay better prices.    He added they also talked about the banana trade between the  isthmus and the EU. This trade triggered an economic and  political crisis in 1993 when banana import restrictions were  enforced.    In their joint declaration, the presidents called on the  Guatemalan guerrillas to keep negotiating peace with the  government, and according to Figueres, the chiefs of state are  hopeful these peace negotiations will successfully end this year.    The Ramiro De Leon administration and the Guatemalan  National  Revolutionary Unity (URNG) last month agreed, along with  international observers, on a calendar to hold negotiations and  on a human rights agreement to end the last Central American  armed conflict, which dates back to 1960.    The Central American presidents agreed that their foreign  ministers will meet on 23 and 24 May in Guatemala and will draft  an agenda to forge a common front to attend the Ibero-American  Summit in Cartagena de Indias (Colombia) on 14 June.    Figueres emphasized that the presidents will review this  agenda in El Salvador on 1 June, when they will meet to attend  Calderon Sol's inaugural. He also said a similar mechanism will  be adopted prior to attending the Miami Summit that Clinton will  hold in December 1994.    At the end of the meeting, Salvadoran President-elect  Armando  Calderon Sol said that Central American integration is a  well-traveled path that we must continue to follow to give  continuity to the agreements already achieved, mainly economic  agreements.    The mini-summit of Central American presidents took place at  a San Jose hotel shortly before Figures' inaugural.</p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEGION BASEBALL;  </P> <P> WEST HILLS OUTSLUGS RESEDA, 29-19  </P> <P> It all started innocently enough, with each team scoring two runs in the first  inning. Soon thereafter, however, the floodgates opened and the linescore  started to look like a ZIP code.  </P> <P> West Hills scored 10 runs in the bottom of the second and scored in every  inning but the sixth to defeat Reseda, 29-19, Saturday in a District 20 Western  Division game at Chaminade High that was called after eight innings because of  the 10-run rule.  </P> <P>  Forty-eight runs?  </P> <P>  "I don't know if that's a record or what," Reseda Coach Frank DesEnfants said.  "But I am sure of one thing -- they should not be playing Legion games at that  field."  </P> <P> Several players took advantage of Chaminade's right-field screen -- which is 35  feet high and located approximately 240 feet from home plate -- collecting a  total of 10 home runs and 17 extra-base hits. Terry Jenkins and Keyaan Cook of  Reseda (11-11) each hit two home runs and teammate Tom Gibson added one.  </P> <P> For West Hills (6-16), which had 29 hits, Aaron Weiss and Justin Stark each hit  two home runs and Steve Roberts added another. Tony Collatos had four hits and  teammates Bill Blair, Ted Corcoran, Cory Gresham and Stark each had three.  Stark scored six runs and had five RBIs.  </P> <P> In other games:  </P> <P> Panorama City 17, Quartz Hill 6 -- Joe Chaparro homered, had five hits, five  RBIs and pitched three innings of relief to lead Panorama City to an  inter-division win at Quartz Hill High. Adam Clark had three hits, including a  home run, for Panorama City (17-4).  </P> <P> Encino-Tarzana 4-5, Van Nuys-Notre Dame 2-6 -- Bob Bookatz had two doubles and  teammate Justin Bass had a double and a triple for Encino-Tarzana, which split  an Eastern Division doubleheader.  </P> <P> Palmdale 6-8, Newhall-Saugus 3-1 -- Newhall-Saugus could muster only a combined  10 hits in a doubleheader at Saugus High.  </P> <P> Steve Franklin and Scott Boulger hit home runs for Palmdale.  </P> <P> Westlake-Agoura 6, Ventura 2 -- Mike Suarez had two hits and an RBI for  first-place Westlake-Agoura in a District 16 game.  </P></p>

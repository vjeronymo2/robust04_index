			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Letter: Social side of school Sir, Your article, 'Why schools may become obsolete' (November 23) ignores the vital part played by social education in our school system. First, children interact with their teachers, who may have experiences and opinions which differ from those of their parents. Second, they interact with other children. Both of these experiences enrich the individual child, and play a great part in their development. Alan Holme, 16 Hunger Hills Avenue, Horsforth, Leeds LS18 5JT</p>

			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EMA DIRECTOR NAMED TO TOP POST IN COUNTY  </P> <P> Ernie Schneider, a 20-year veteran of Orange County government, marathon runner  and head of the county's powerful Environmental Management Agency, was chosen  Wednesday to be the county's new chief executive.  </P> <P> Schneider, 42, will be formally named as the county administrative officer at  the board meeting next Tuesday. A West German immigrant who arrived in New York  a few weeks shy of his sixth birthday, he won out over four other top county  officials who were finalists for the job. In all, 12 county executives  submitted applications for one of the highest-paying government jobs in  California.  </P> <P> Supervisors, who unanimously selected Schneider after shelving plans for a  national search, hailed him Wednesday as a consensus builder with a keen  knowledge of the intricacies of Orange County government and able to get a  handle on the county's escalating financial woes. Part of Schneider's pitch for  the job included a broad plan to restructure county government, interviews  indicated. But one critic complained that he was too much of an insider and too  close to developer interests.  </P> <P> Board members declined to discuss specifics of his proposals but acknowledged  that his suggestions for streamlining county operations and keeping board  members better informed on fiscal matters played a key role in their decision.  </P> <P> "When you're talking about a budget of $3 billion, we need to have continuing  monitoring of where we've been and where we're going so we don't run into  periods of panic, which those of us in county government are very familiar  with," Supervisor Don R. Roth said, adding:  </P> <P> "I don't want to read in your paper that the county is going to lay off three  or four hundred people. I want to know about it ahead of time. . . . I just  think he's one of the best men for the job."  </P> <P> The other finalists for the job were Transportation Commission Director Stanley  T. Oftelie, Associate CAO John Sibley, Fire Chief Lawrence J. Holms and Chief  Probation Officer Michael A. Schumacher.  </P> <P> Schneider will replace retiring CAO Larry Parrish, who as the  fourth-highest-paid county administrative officer in California, earns $129,910  a year. Schneider's salary is under negotiation as is his official start date.  Parrish is scheduled to retire in mid-December.  </P> <P> Schneider declined to discuss specifics of plans for streamlining county  operations but said his first action would be to meet with the heads of all  county departments. He said he plans to be more of a "hands-on" administrator  than Parrish.  </P> <P> Schneider's selection drew a mixed, though mostly positive, reaction from  environmentalists and community activists, many of whom have dealt with him on  development issues during his three years at the Environmental Management  Agency.  </P> <P> Elisabeth Brown, president of the slow-growth-minded Laguna Greenbelt, credited  Schneider with "opening up the process" at the agency and giving more serious  consideration to the concerns of community activists. Shirley Grindle, a former  planning commissioner who wrote TIN CUP, Orange County's campaign-contribution  and lobbying regulations, also applauded the board's choice.  </P> <P> "I hope he can teach the board to say no" to development, Grindle said. Voters  want a tough stance on development, which they clearly signaled Tuesday when  they rejected Measure M, a half-cent sales tax that would have paid for  transportation projects, Grindle declared.  </P> <P> But Russell Burkett, chairman of the committee that successfully fought passage  of Measure M, expressed dismay at the board's decision to drop a search outside  the county for a new CAO. Burkett criticized Schneider as part of "an ol' boy  network" of powerful developers and their advocates, noting Schneider's history  of acquiring high-paying county appointments.  </P> <P> Schneider was an aide to former Supervisor Bruce Nestande when he was selected  to head the EMA in December, 1986. Schneider, whose salary jumped by $20,000 to  $80,000 a year with that appointment, beat four assistant EMA directors who had  also applied for the job. Schneider was among three supervisors' aides to  receive high-paying county jobs during a 15-month period.  </P> <P> "I just think there's an incestuous relationship of people moving up the ladder  . . . ," Burkett said. "They suffer from a disease called  'don't-rock-the-boat-itis.' They all went to the same school of public  management. They have a degree in getting along with developers."  </P></p>

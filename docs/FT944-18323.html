			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Camellia edges ahead to Pounds 6.65m Camellia, the investment concern with interests including fine art and tea plantations, announced a small increase in pre-tax profits from a restated Pounds 6.49m to Pounds 6.65m in the first half of 1994. However, Lawrie Group, the tea and coffee producer and Camellia's main subsidiary, reported reduced net profits. Mr Gordon Fox, the chairman, said that because of the uncertain outlook for its art galleries and a difficult year generally for tea producers in India and Bangladesh, profits for the full year were likely to be lower than the Pounds 21.6m achieved in 1993. Turnover amounted to Pounds 95.4m (Pounds 83.3m) including Pounds 5.1m from acquisitions. Investment and other income rose to Pounds 821,000 (Pounds 574,000). The interim dividend is lifted to 14p (13p), payable from earnings of 49p (53.04p) per share.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Berezneva article: "A Glimpse at the Situation: </F> Diary of an Underwater Seed Drill"]    [Text] Whichever way you look at it, credits were well  timed for those inundated by flood waters. Literally just a few  days ago, financial support reached Volgograd and Saratov  Oblasts. But given that a floating seed drill has yet to be  invented, agricultural workers in these oblasts got the chance  both to purchase seeds and also to bring in fuel before going  out into the fields. Not that you would envy the Volgograders:  Around 600 square kilometers of territory have been flooded,  and 65,000 hectares of agricultural land are under water.  According to preliminary data, flood damage in the oblast will  come to over 19 billion rubles [R]. If due account is taken of  the fact that the flood is only expected to peak after 25 April,  the sowing campaign there will be seriously delayed, which in  itself will affect the harvest.    As at 15 April in Saratov Oblast, over 100 centers of  population, dozens of bridges, many kilometers of road and power  transmission lines, and thousands of hectares of agricultural  land were flooded. Something in the region of R15 billion will  be required to make good what has been affected by the flooding.    Perhaps only in the Kuban did the sowing campaign begin on  time. Krasnodar Kray's farmers waited expectantly for the  financial support promised by the state, but it reached them  when the winter crops had already been undersown and resown, and  when sunflower seeds were already in the furrow -- in short, the  hard graft was already virtually completed. Had it not been for  the kray administration's declaring a state of emergency, ruling  that agricultural enterprises be sent resources and materials  essential to the sowing campaign without payment up front, it is  unlikely that the grain growers would have gone out into the  field.    In Stavropol Kray, spring was roughly two weeks late  arriving. Unlike previous years, its start according to the  calendar was marked with snow and cold rains. Eventually, the  weather relented, but Stavropol Kray's peasants went out into  the field without any real enthusiasm, like their neighbors, and  without waiting for the arrival of credits and other monies owed  to them by the state for grain supplied last year. And as there  were no funds, they had not prepared properly for the hardest  period of work in the entire year: Machinery was overhauled  less thoroughly than last year, crops were treated with half the  planned amount of fertilizers. According to Yu. Ivanov, expert  from the Kray Agricultural Administration, agrarians are  particularly alarmed by the condition of winter crops -- some 20  percent have already perished or thinned out drastically. And  although the area devoted to grain in Stavropol Kray remains  unchanged, the most optimistic forecasts anticipate obtaining  just over 4 million tonnes of grain here -- 1 million down on  last year.    Spring was also late in reaching the agricultural workers of  the Don. The weather was cold, and alarming. In addition,  small and large rivers alike burst their banks. But as our own  correspondent A. Isayev reports, worse than any natural disaster  was the shortage of fuel, fertilizers, and seed. Don villages  were unable to purchase them on time for the usual reason: The  state has yet to settle up for last year's grain.    Over 80 percent of Russian private farmers no longer rely on  the state for help. Today, one-third of them are without fuel,  seed, or machinery. A few have received credits in time for the  sowing campaign, but under crushing interest rates of over 200  percent. Forecasts by the leadership of the Association of  Russian Peasant (Private) Farms and Agricultural Cooperatives  [AKKOR], which addressed journalists a few days ago, are  depressing: 30 percent of the lands belonging to private  farmers will be left unsown. And in the Central Urals, this  figure is even higher -- over 40 percent. As S. Teterin,  chairman of the Association of Peasant Farms of this region,  told us, 300 of the 3,500 Ural private farmers have declared  themselves bankrupt, and very soon this number may double or  even treble.    Today, field work is under way in the Northern Caucasus, in  southern oblasts, in the Central Chernozem Region, and in some  areas of the Volga Region, where seed drills have managed to  "wade out" into the furrows. But the late spring, the flooding,  and the shortage of equipment, fuel, fertilizer, and seed caused  by there being no money, are preventing work from progressing at  last year's pace as yet. For instance, only half the amount of  winter crops were top-dressed. And the sowing of spring crops  is 500,000 hectares behind schedule.    The Federation Council Committee for Agrarian Policy  believes  that "it is possible that the production of cereal crops in  Russia will fall to 80 million tonnes" this year. This is 24  million tonnes fewer than the average for 1986 through 1990. At  the very least, the production of sugar beet, sunflowers, and  flax fiber will drop by 10 percent.    Last fall, the sown area for winter crops shrank by 3.3  million hectares (21 percent) compared to fall 1992. This means  that spring crops will now have to be sown over an area 21  percent larger. Only 66 percent of the necessary fallow land  was plowed in the fall. Therefore, this spring the workload per  tractor increases by almost half. Meanwhile, machinery has been  poorly prepared. There is no farm in Russia which will have  managed to purchase all the necessary spare parts, or, more  especially, to renew vehicle and tractor fleets.    So it is quite likely that grain production in the country  will not hit even a modest 80 million tonnes. And, you know, it  is not yet known how nature, which is not always generous with  good weather, will behave. And it is not clear what state  policy will be -- a state where to this day reform is  progressing without an agrarian program....    Incidentally, today in the Don (and not only there) silos  are  crammed with grain from last year and even the year before.  Unclaimed by anyone, it sows gloomy thoughts in the minds of the  sowers themselves: Is our work required at all? This year, as  we know, there will be no compulsory grain deliveries. Some  600,000 tonnes of grain will have to be surrendered to the  Federal Fund of Rostov Oblast -- this is significantly less than  in the recent past. And the sower, who once puzzled over where  to get fuel and spare parts, is now thinking about who will buy  how much of his grain this fall. Or, indeed, will it be  purchased at all?</p>

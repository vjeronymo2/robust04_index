			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / People: Naylor leaves MAM for a pizza the action James Naylor, who has been running MAM Leisure, the amusement machines business which parent Chrysalis Group has decided to wind up, is moving to City Centre Restaurants, the operation that includes Deep Pan Pizza and Garfunkels. He becomes chief executive from the beginning of October. 'The timing was absolutely appalling for me,' agrees Naylor, stressing that he was approached by the restaurant group in May and had decided to go well before Chrysalis's decision to close MAM. Naylor, 47, steps into the shoes of Phillip Kaye, who is 61, and has decided to give way to a younger man. Kaye will, however, stay on as an executive director, something Naylor claims he welcomes. 'He is someone I have long admired from a distance. He has even more experience in the leisure business than I do and I think I've got a lot to learn from him.' Naylor's past experience includes First Leisure, where he was joint managing director until 1988, Forte and Thorn EMI. Kaye, who dreamed up Golden Egg and Strikes as well as Garfunkels, Deep Pan and Chiquitas, will continue to be closely involved with new business development. Naylor's spell at MAM had only lasted a year. He came in 'largely in a company doctor role, to see what could be done. When Chrysalis decided it did not want to continue underwriting the losses, it was hard to gainsay that,' he comments. Before MAM he had set up Whitegate Leisure with an ex-colleague from Columbia University MBA days, Nick Oppenheim. He parted company with Oppenheim, with whom he says he now has little contact. 'An unfortunate act of timing,' is how he describes the decision to set up Whitegate just as the 1980s boom was ending. Kaye on the other hand is not concerned by the Whitegate experience: 'We did investigate it very carefully and we concluded that no blame attached to him.'</p>

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Lotus car losses triple to Pounds 15.8m GROUP Lotus, the UK sports car maker and automotive engineering consultancy, suffered a pre-tax loss of Pounds 14.7m last year, as the losses of its car operations more than tripled to Pounds 15.8m. The scale of the losses, revealed yesterday in the company's annual report, has forced General Motors of the US to increase its financial commitment to its troubled subsidiary. GM took over Group Lotus for Pounds 22.7m in 1986. It has been forced to pump in Pounds 18m to repair the Lotus balance sheet during 1991 including the provision of Pounds 11.5m in new equity with the remainder coming in subordinated debt. The company has been hit by recession in its two main markets, the UK and the US, but the biggest blow has been the commercial failure of its Lotus Elan sports car. Two months ago Lotus announced it was ceasing production of the Elan, its main product, less than two-and-a-half years after the car was launched. Group Lotus losses have grown from Pounds 2.1m in 1988 to Pounds 4.4m in 1989, Pounds 12.7m in 1990 and Pounds 14.7m last year on a turnover of only Pounds 87.5m. According to the annual report the losses of the car operations jumped from Pounds 4.6m in 1990 to Pounds 15.8m last year on a turnover of Pounds 43.2m. The cutbacks of the car operations masked the success of the Group Lotus engineering consultancy and vehicle testing operations which increased profits to Pounds 5.95m, from Pounds 1.56m a year earlier, on a turnover of Pounds 44.3m, largely thanks to increased work from North America. The scale of the overall group pre-tax loss was reduced by exceptional profits of Pounds 5.5m (of which Pounds 3.53m was credited to the profit and loss account) arising from the sale of its Millbrook Land subsidiary for Pounds 7.8m in cash. It also took a pension contribution holiday throughout 1991. The exceptional profits were offset by redundancy costs totalling Pounds 2.3m. The withdrawal of the Elan will lead to around 350 redundancies from the company's 507-strong Lotus Cars workforce in Hethel, Norfolk. In the first six months of this year Lotus car output has dropped by two thirds to only 505 from 1,559 in the same period last year. Production totalled 2,240 in the whole of 1991.</p>

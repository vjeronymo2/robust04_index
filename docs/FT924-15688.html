But steel exports in August were down 3.6 per cent from July's 1.68m metric tons. Year-to-year steel exports rose 7.5 per cent in July, 3.1 per cent in June and 2.6 per cent in May. The US was the biggest importer of Japanese steel products in August, with shipments to the country surging 40 per cent from a year ago, to 257,000 metric tons.

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Gardening: Time to dally in dahlias - September is just heavenly for gardens I have just been surveying autumn as it should be, spread out before us in central London. The great autumn flower show in the Royal Horticultural Society halls has none of the extravagance of Chelsea; on Tuesday and Wednesday, it drew discerning crowds who knew they could not see these exhibits under canvas in mid-May. September is heaven in my horticultural book, especially when it alternates between sun and rain. The older gardening authorities skate over this excellent month, moving from buddleias to autumn colour with only a sideways glance at Michaelmas daisies. But, in the past 10 years or so, its horticultural scope has broadened beyond recognition. If you miss the autumn shows, you are the sort of gardener who starts thinking far too early about Christmas hyacinths. You are also one of the class who runs a mile from dahlias. No, I would not want them in an average small-town garden; yes, the dahlia varieties in popular offers are frightful. But if you look for the best, you see a depth of colour and shape which will lift a rural border out of autumn rust and mildew. At Powis castle, on the Welsh borders, they have no qualms about dahlias; and anyone who saw yet another prize-winning show from Ayletts of Hertfordshire this week will have vowed to follow Powis's example next spring. The best varieties of dahlia have such remarkably clear colour and well-defined flowers: Dahlia Charles Taylor was a front-runner this year with scarlet flowers like an inward-curving paeony, while Vicky Crutchfield remains a first choice among the pinks with flowers like waterlilies. These prize dahlias are in a different league to those balls of mauve flower which turn up among the French marigolds in the gardens of visual vandals. The flowers are not lost in heaps of coarse leaves and they are not impossibly shaggy. There are six months until the season for starting new dahlias in April; but if you want to prolong a border in September, and double up on cut flowers and height, you cannot ignore the first-class forms in the family. Ayletts itself is the tops although that authoritative guide, The PlantFinder, still omits it. Elsewhere, the way to civilise an autumn exhibit nowadays is to pack in the crocosmias. Many of you already grow the bright crimson varieties of these corms, especially the Lucifer variety which has long been an FT favourite. Exhibitors now upstage it with the clear, soft yellow Solfatare, the flowers of which beat the other commercial forms in shades of yellow and orange and are matched enchantingly with the blue of aster King George or the blue and silver-grey perovskias. Bags of Solfatares were changing hands to keen visitors, but they ought to remember that it is not the hardiest in the family and needs to be top-dressed with a protective layer of debris from November until April. This protection is worth the bother because this delightful form goes so well with white anemones, early Michaelmas daisies and the first of the autumn crocuses. An autumn show faces in two directions: backwards, to the best of the season's half-hardy plants in their final phases; and forward, to bulbs, daisies and shrubs which will not go under at the first sign of frost. Among the season's tender pot plants, I made yet another mental mark for the white form of mimulus called Popocatepetl; this flowers profusely in pots and sunny borders, having earned its reputation in California. Brian Hile in Wallington, where London's far southern suburbs meet the M25, is one of the few suppliers so far. These evergreen mimulus are future stars for terrace and courtyard gardening, and he helped me to understand the cause of their only failure. Sometimes, a stem will go brown and die back, a fault which I have attributed (wrongly) to over-fertilising. The real reason is that its faded flowers have not been dead-headed, and fungus enters their stem if they turn brown and are allowed to hang around. Ten years ago, the only familiar form was the orange variety, which was so famous as a centrepiece in the red and orange garden at Sissinghurst, Kent. But we now have white, pale orange, lemon yellow and shades of pink waiting to spread in frost-free seasons from America's west coast. Among the frost-proof permanencies, the autumn bulbs are a spectacular sight, reminding me not to overlook them when their catalogues turn up in the rush of next spring. The best of all are the white colchicums, like huge crocuses with no clothes on because they flower before the leaves. The leaves appear in spring, usually to a bad press, but I now agree with the keen eye of expert grower Graham Thomas who values them as a foil for yellow daffodils against grass in early spring. The best variety is Speciosum Album, although its price is a discouragement. A few bulbs go a long way, and there is no question of needing to plant them with the same profusion as the crocuses of spring. The shrub growers had the luxury in their exhibits of pretending that the drought had never existed. The hydrangeas looked fresh and newly-watered, whereas mine have been burnt miserably along the edges of their leaves. As often, the most ambitious stand came from Burncoose Nurseries of Redruth, Cornwall, which continues to proclaim its fondness for despatching by mail order. I would have sent away for its oak-leaved hydrangea Quercifolia on sight, but I know that it is so much better in damper and deeper soil. A show plant is fun, but misleading. The delicate aster Pink Monster looked more accommodating and not at all monstrous, and I wish I could combine it with those marginally hardy relations of mimosa which the nursery shows so well. At a different level of hardiness, you could have rounded off with a remarkable array of hollies put on by the unstoppable Morris Mason from his broad private acres near King's Lynn, Norfolk. Long before the season for berries, he had collected a superb range of shining green and beautifully-marked varieties, reminding us that nurserymen do not have the monopoly on major families and that gardeners are still much too slow to exploit what this family can offer. The extremely spiny leaves of the various hedgehog varieties are best kept as individual specimens, but his display of variegated forms of ilex aquifolium reminded me of the elegance which we overlook because we are all too afraid of prickles. The fresh, golden-yellow marking of forms like Flavescens would please anyone. Egged on by this autumn exhibit, I intend to use them to fill out and brighten the places which need an evergreen but which will not suit anything of doubtful hardiness. Whatever the winter throws at us, the hollies will come through it, an idea from the autumn shows which will still be around in subsequent summers.</p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / EC says Britain can ban porn TV THE UK government has the power to take immediate action against Red Hot Dutch, the pornographic TV channel transmitted to Britain via satellite from Denmark, a top European Commission official said yesterday. Mrs Colette Flesch, director-general of the EC's audio visual, information, communication and culture group, told a Financial Times conference in London: 'We in the Commission firmly believe that the UK authorities have the means to suspend and stop such a broadcast.' Red Hot Dutch, which recently changed its name to Red Hot Television, broadcasts after midnight to a subscription-paying domestic audience. It is, however, unlicensed in the UK although it is believed to have 25,000 subscribers around the country. Speaking at the FT Cable and Satellite conference, Mrs Flesch said the Commission regarded Red Hot Dutch as being effectively established in the UK. 'So far as we are concerned the situation seems clear. It's up to the responsible authorities (in the UK) to take whatever steps they consider right and applicable,' she said. The government said yesterday that it was actively exploring ways of taking action against the pornography channel but that it did not share Mrs Flesch's interpretation of the EC directive. If the British government decides it has the power to take action against Red Hot Television under UK law it could take action against those supplying the decoders and other services in the UK. The subscriptions and the decoders, which unscramble transmissions for fee-paying viewers, are sold by Continental Television, a Manchester-based company registered in the Netherlands and licensed by Continental Television BVio, a Dutch registered channel. Lawyers for Continental Television have written to the National Heritage Department threatening legal action if any action is taken to suppress Red Hot Television. The letter argues that Community law has already decided that freedom of communication within the Community requires that any restrictions be imposed by the country from which broadcasts are transmitted. Under the European directive on cross-frontier broadcasting, it was assumed it is legal to broadcast any channel that is acceptable to the country from which the signal originates. Separately, Sir George Russell, chairman of the Independent Television Commission, told the conference that an early re-advertisement of a Channel 5 licence under similar terms to last time was an option that had not been ruled out.</p>

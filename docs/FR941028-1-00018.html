			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under proposed &sect;36.2(a)(4), the Commission contemplates that a broad array of contracts would be eligible for section 4(c) contract market transactions. Thus, the following are examples of potentially permissible section 4(c) contract market transactions in that they are cash-settled and can reasonably be distinguished from currently designated futures and options contracts: (1) Newly-issued 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds, which are cash-settled based on either cash transaction prices or firm quotes obtained from electronic information vendors; (2) six-month London interbank offered rates (LIBOR), which are cash-settled based on a survey of British Bankers Association rates; and (3) two-year interest rate swaps, which are cash-settled based on a survey of swap dealers to obtain the rates they are willing to pay or to receive for fixed-rate payments on generic two-year swaps, given a specified notional amount. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission notes that while these specific, hypothetical contracts can reasonably be distinguished from currently designated futures and option contracts and therefore permitted to trade under these proposed rules, that may not necessarily be true at the time a board of trade applies to trade a specific section 4(c) contract market transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, proposed &sect;36.2(a)(4) provides for certain specific contracts to be eligible section 4(c) contract market transactions. First, flexible commodity options, which trade under contract market option rules, but are not separately designated, may trade as section 4(c) contract market transactions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In addition, contracts in foreign currency known as Rolling Spot <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> TM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Contracts, the subject of the CME's petition for exemptive relief, as well as five- and ten-year interest rate swaps contracts, and foreign currency forward futures contracts and options thereon are specifically eligible to trade as section 4(c) contract market transactions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 25 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Under the proposal, when such options become regular options, they would no longer qualify to trade as section 4(c) contract market transactions, and the full panoply of the Commission's regulatory requirements would apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 25 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Eligible swaps contracts include the contract markets of the CBOT which the Commission designated in cash-settled three- and five-year interest rate SWAP (IR-SWAP) futures contracts on January 29, 1991. Options based on those futures contracts were approved by the Commission on February 26, 1991. On September 4, 1992, the Commission approved amendments submitted by the CBOT to convert the three-year IR-SWAP contracts to 10-year IR-SWAP contracts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, proposed &sect;36.2(a)(5) provides that any transaction subject to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 2, including stock index futures contracts, is not within the scope of the exemptive rules. Because of special considerations applicable to such transactions, including the approval procedures of Section 2(a)(1)(B), the Commission believes that such contracts may not be appropriate for exemption under the proposed rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission requests comment on whether the proposed restrictions on section 4(c) contract market transactions are appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Section 4(c) Contract Market Trading Rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Section 36.3, which permits a board of trade to submit for Commission approval trading procedures for section 4(c) contract market transactions, is intended to facilitate trading in section 4(c) contract market transactions which do not comply in all respects with certain Commission regulations setting forth trading standards and related recordkeeping requirements for an open outcry double auction trading environment. In general, Section 36.3 is intended to permit, subject to certain conditions, section 4(c) contract market transactions to trade pursuant to innovative trading strategies which may not satisfy existing competitive trading requirements and other trading standards relative to the exposure of orders and trades. In proposing &sect;36.3 the Commission intends to provide the flexibility for transactions in a section 4(c) contract market to occur either on the exchange floor, off the floor, or in both locales subject to immediate post-trade reporting and clearing requirements. The Commission regulations for which exchange alternatives could be submitted include Regulations 1.35, 1.38(a), 1.39, 155.2, 155.3, and 155.4, 17 CFR 1.35, 1.38(a), 1.39, 155.2, 155.3 and 155.4 (1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed Section 36.3 represents a substantial change in the assumptions underlying the method of trading futures and options contracts. Section 4c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6c(a), enumerates certain trading practices which are prohibited, namely, wash sales, cross trades, accommodation trades, and fictitious sales. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 26 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission has viewed the ``common denominator'' of the abuses prohibited by Section 4c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6c(a), as the ``use of trading techniques that give the appearance of submitting trades to the open market'' while in reality ``negating the risk or price competition incident to such a market.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 27 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Commission Regulation 1.38 explicitly requires open and competitive execution. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 28 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The primary purpose of Rule 1.38 was summarized as follows in a Senate Report issued in connection with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act of 1974:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 26 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6c(a), provides that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) It shall be unlawful for any person to offer to enter into, enter into or confirm the execution of, any transaction involving any commodity *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) if such transaction is, is of the character of, or is commonly known to the trade as, a ``wash sale'', ``cross trade'', or ``accommodation trade'', or is a fictitious sale; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) if such transaction is used to cause any price to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reported, registered, or recorded which is not a true and bona  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fide price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 27 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> In re Collins, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  [1986&hyph;1987 Transfer Binder] Comm.

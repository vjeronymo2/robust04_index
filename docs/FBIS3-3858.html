We received the reply yesterday  afternoon.    The full text of Beijing's reply to this newspaper is as  follows:    (The letter sent by the Urban Council to Beijing has never  been made public)    Your newspaper raised several questions to us: 1) What  promises has the Hong Kong Film Festival breached so that the  Film Industry Administration decided to withdraw copies of two  movies? 2) Why did the Film Festival have to make these  promises? 3) Why does the Chinese side oppose showing the two  independently produced movies: "Red Beans" and "The Days"?  These movies are only short stories about romantic love,  without any political content. 4) "Blue Kite" was shown at the  Tokyo Film Festival. At that time, the Film Industry  Administration withdrew only its delegation, but the movie was  still shown. Why have both the delegation and the movies been  withdrawn this time? 5) Will this incident affect future  cooperation?    Now, our brief answers to these questions are as follows:    1. Last September, the 18th Hong Kong International Film  Festival wrote a letter to the Film Industry Administration  asking to be allowed to send its personnel to Beijing to select  movies. In our reply letter, the Film Industry Administration  unequivocally said that "according to the regulations of our  country, all Chinese entries in international film festivals  (including movies produced in cooperation with the outside) must  be screened and authorized by the Ministry of Radio, Film, and  Television. Only movies authorized can enter international film  festivals." "If personnel of your festival come to Beijing to  select movies, our administration will give our support and  assistance, but the scope of movie selection and movies to be  shown in the film festival should be movies provided by us.  Movies to which the Ministry of Radio, Film, and  Television has not given consent for their showing in the  International Film Festival are not within the scope of  selection." The Hong Kong Film Festival replied on 8 November,  saying they consented to the conditions and promised that "they  will follow this practice." After that, our administration  agreed to receive and help Miss Wong Oi-ling, one of the program  planners of the Hong Kong Film Festival, to select movies in  Beijing. In our conversation with Miss Wong before the formal  movie selection, we once again told her that we hoped the Hong  Kong International Film Festival would respect our views when  selecting movies and would not select movies without our  administration's screening and authorization or programs  unfriendly to our country or even willfully vilifying our social  system and policies, and that only with mutual respect and equal  treatment can both sides continue to cooperate with each other  on a long-term basis. Miss Wong Oi-ling gave her consent to our  views right away. Meanwhile, we also specially briefed  Miss Wong on which movies -- such as "Blue Kite" and "Beijing  Bastard" -- were taken out of the country illegally to enter the  Tokyo Film Festival and other film festivals, as well as on our  position and attitude, hoping that similar problems would not  arise again in the Hong Kong International Film Festival. In  this connection, Miss Wong also indicated her understanding of  and respect for us. The two movies -- "The Days" and "Red  Beans" -- have not been screened by our administration and have  been taken out of the country without going through exit  formalities in accordance with our relevant customs regulations.  The fact that these two movies were invited to enter the film  festival very obviously has breached the original promises made  by the Hong Kong Film Festival and Miss Wong. Our requests are  fair and reasonable and we do not have any alternative.    2. We have discussed this point in the section above. We  consider the selection of movies to enter a film festival a  matter of mutual support and respect, rather than an imposition  of one party on the other. Moreover, we ought to uphold the  relevant regulations on the administration of our film industry.  Since these situations have emerged in the Tokyo Film Festival  and other film festivals, we do not want them to recur in the  Hong Kong Film Festival. Hence, it is reasonable to ask our  cooperators to make promises. This is common sense. If you  have different views, you also can give voice to them. However,  since an agreement (be it oral or written) has been reached,  both parties should observe and fulfill it.    3. We have never said that these two movies had any  political problems. The key lies in the fact that movie  producers have violated our relevant existing regulations. It  is natural for us to handle these cases in accordance with  relevant regulations.    4. Regarding the fact that the international film festival  is going to show movies illegally produced without our  administration's screening, our attitude toward and principle of  handling this matter is consistent.    As the Hong Kong Film Festival has breached its promises, we  can no longer cooperate with them. Hence, we have decided not  to enter the current Hong Kong Film Festival. Since three  Chinese movies were shown in the Tokyo Film Festival when  negotiations were going on, it was insignificant to withdraw the  movies.    5. You should raise this question with the person in charge  of the Hong Kong Film Festival. Over so many years in the past,  we have always taken a positively supportive and sincerely  cooperative attitude toward the Hong Kong International Film  Festival and never have done anything that violated any  regulations laid down by the film festival. However, unhappy  events have occured for three years in a row (N.B.), which  cannot but cast a shadow and bring about a certain impact on our  future cooperation. How great the impact will be must depend on  the way the Hong Kong Film Festival handles this incident.    N.B. Apart from withdrawing movies this year, the  unhappy events for three years in a row refer to an American  independent producer's documentary called "Compassion in Exile,"  which was about the life of the Dalai Lama of Tibet. In the  documentary, scenes were shown of Tibetans being beaten by  People's Liberation Army soldiers, scenes which were shot  secretly by Western journalists. At that time, the Chinese side  lodged a protest with the Hong Kong Film Festival and asked for  the banning of this documentary, but the film festival took no  heed. This incident was widely covered by foreign news agencies.    This year, two independently produced movies have been  selected by the Hong Kong Film Festival. Although the Chinese  side has not lodged an official protest with the film festival,  it may be considered one of the unhappy events mentioned in the  letter.</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (2): World energy producers on trial - David Lascelles previews next month's 'green' summit in Rio de Janeiro THIS summer's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro has important implications for the electricity industry. But although this portentously named event is less than a month away it is far from clear what practical results it will have. The final preparatory meetings have tended to widen rather than narrow differences between the more than 160 countries who are planning to attend. Mr Maurice Strong, the Canadian organiser of the UN-sponsored event, originally hoped to secure approval for a global action programme not merely to clean up the environment, but to stabilise it for the next century. He may only achieve worthy statements of intent. One reason for this unpromising outlook is that the Rio agenda ran hopelessly out of control during the two-year preparations. All the participants were encouraged to put forward their ideas, and did. The action programme expanded to nearly 1,000 pages, leaving delegates drowning in words and lacking a clear focus. Another reason is that the participants quickly polarised into a clash between the rich countries of the north and the poor of the south over who was to blame for environmental degradation, and who should pay for it. The UN organisers calculated that the South would need Dollars 70bn a year from the North, in addition to existing aid, to overcome its environmental problems. The North agreed that extra money would be needed, but to the tune of only a tiny fraction of this sum. A third reason is that the industrialised countries failed to agree, even among themselves, on the seriousness of the threat to the environment, or on the measures needed to deal with it. The reluctance of Mr George Bush, the US president, to commit himself to attend the Rio meeting indicated doubts about its value. Whatever happens, though, energy will loom large during the 12-day event. The threat posed to the planet by global warming and climate change has occupied much time in the preparatory meetings, and many participants are keen for action of some kind to curb harmful gaseous emissions from vehicles, power stations and factories. But the debate in the run-up to Rio has done little to crystallise a world view on the dangers of global warming. Many people, including senior government figures on both sides of the Atlantic, doubt that the threat is as serious as some scientists are claiming, and this has weakened the political will for early action. The question is whether the Summit will try to set global deadlines for curbing emissions of carbon dioxide, rather as the Montreal Protocol of 1987 did for the CFCs that are eating up the ozone layer. The EC countries, which (with the exception of the UK) aim to bring CO2 emissions back down to 1990 levels by the year 2000, want a clear timetable. But the US has rejected this approach, and this obvious split between the countries emitting the greatest amounts of harmful gases has removed any incentive for other countries to make any commitments of their own. Another question is whether the Summit will advance the cause of a carbon tax, which some countries are advocating as a means of curbing consumption of oil, gas and coal. The chief crusader for this cause is Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the EC environment commissioner, who has been trying to promote a tax on energy and carbon within the Community. EC ministers are due to meet on May 25, days before Rio begins, to decide whether to back a tax. If they do, Mr Ripa will go to Rio brandishing a proposal which he hopes will set an example for other countries to follow. But there are deep doubts among EC members about the wisdom of adopting a tax unless other countries follow suit, and neither the US nor Japan intends to do so. A third energy-related issue has to do with the spread of environmental technology. The Summit was supposed to draw up plans to encourage the transfer of technology from the advanced countries to the developing. The fact that Third World power stations tend to use old and dirty equipment was frequently cited in the discussions in support of the case for more aid. Thus the chances of specific action being adopted at Rio to curb or control energy use seem very remote. There is a conspicuous lack of consensus among participants both as to the size of the threat to the environment and the best means of dealing with it. At its worst, Rio could be a huge anti-climax, and greatly weaken any chance of international co-ordination. But if it succeeded, Rio could add to the overall political momentum building up for action on the environment anyway. Even if the result is only a generalised declaration of green aims, the fact that leaders from dozens of states signed it would be a palpable achievement. It would be a conspicuous political act, and could provide a basis for more specific action later on. One aim of the conference will be to set up machinery to keep up the pressure.

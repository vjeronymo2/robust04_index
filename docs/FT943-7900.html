			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Study finds no link between nuclear power stations and leukaemia No link has been found between nuclear power stations and childhood leukaemia, according to a study published in this week's British Medical Journal, David Lascelles writes. In a research project, which was assisted by funding from Nuclear Electric, Dr John Bithell and Dr Gerald Draper looked at the incidence of childhood leukaemia within 25 kilometres of 23 nuclear sites in England and Wales. In no case did they find an incidence greater than would be expected by chance. They said the well-documented instance of six excess cases at Seascale near the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant was an isolated finding. It might be due to chance or to infection following an influx of people to the area when the site was established. Dr Dick Taylor, Nuclear Electric's operational and safety policy manager, said the study added conclusively to the already overwhelming evidence that there was no general increase in leukaemia in children living close to nuclear power stations.</p>

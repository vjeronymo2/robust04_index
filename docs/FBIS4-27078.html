			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Robert MacPherson] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, June 29 (AFP) -- Governor Chris Patten's  plans to strengthen democracy in Hong Kong ahead of the 1997  handover to China were in danger of collapse Wednesday as  Beijing-leaning opponents gained ground at a marathon sitting of  the territory's assembly. Eight hours into the debate in the  Legislative Council, the outcome of an historic vote on the last  and most complex part of Patten's reforms was too close to call.    "Nothing is certain. We won't know until it comes to the  vote. It's that close," Liberal Party deputy leader Selina Chow  told AFP during a break in the proceedings.    Local radio station Metro Plus estimated that as many as 29  legislators might vote to back Patten's original blueprint --  with another 29 going for the Liberals' version, aimed at  appeasing Beijing, which takes back the British colony on July  1, 1997. With one member, Jardine Matheson executive Martin  Barrow, promising to abstain, a 29-29 outcome would force  council president John Swaine to make a rare tie-breaking vote.    The Liberals are hoping that by boiling down Patten's  proposals by limiting the popular vote, China would be less  likely to scrap any changes, as it has vowed to do when it takes  back Hong Kong in 1997. "Society has been destabilized (by the  governor's proposals). There have been ups and downs," Liberal  Party leader Allen Lee, who has close contacts with Beijing's  Communist Party leaders, said. "Our ultimate target is not to  opt for radical changes," he said.    But the Liberals' move was condemned by pro-democracy  legislators, including Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce  representative Jimmy McGregor, who condemned it as a "convoluted  nightmare." "It's a dog's breakfast and dinner that the Liberal  Party is serving up today," he said. If the Liberals' amendment  is passed, the spotlight will shift to Patten to see if he would  accept such a radical change to the proposals that he first  spelled out in October 1992 to Beijing's fury.    Fourteen amendments were on the order paper, including a  long-shot attempt by independent firebrand Emily Lau for all 60  seats to be directly elected -- even though China has vowed to  scrap any electoral reforms after 1997. The Legislative Council  has already adopted an earlier part of the reforms, which, among  other aspects, enshrines the principle of British-style,  first-past-the-post elections -- in lieu of proportional  representation, which many say would help usher in pro-Beijing  politicians.    In favor of Patten's reforms Wednesday were the United  Democrats, Hong Kong most popular political group, whose  vice-chairman Yeung Sum called Wednesday's vote a last chance  for true democracy. "We should make use of the present  opportunity," he said. "We already have the basic conditions  for democracy."    Besides setting aside 20 seats for direct election in 1997,  Patten's reforms would give almost every man and women -- about  2.5 million altogether -- the chance to vote for 30 seats known  as "functional constituencies." Such seats are set aside for  special interest groups and business sectors, and now are filled  by corporate voting, which Patten feels are open to manipulation  and corruption. The remaining 10 seats would be decided by an  electoral college that itself would be directly elected.    Launching the debate, Patten's second in command, Anson  Chan,  repeated the governor's oft-stated position that only his reform  package can guarantee human rights and the rule of law in Hong  Kong after 1997. "It is essential for the protection of the  fundamental aspects of Hong Kong's way of life that it holds so  dear," she said. She added: "Whether China will dismantle (the  reforms) is a question only China itself can answer."</p>

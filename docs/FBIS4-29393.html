			<p>BFN     [Text] In connection with the task force on Yomitan  Auxiliary Airfield, which the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee agreed  to establish in a 16 June meeting, Masanori Yoshimoto,  lieutenant governor of the Okinawa Prefectural Government,  issued a comment.    In the comment, the lieutenant governor said the task force  is mandated to make a technical study of how to secure an  alternative cite for the current parachute drop training ground;  the possibility of relocating Sobe Communications Station; and  ways to handle various problems arising from the Yomitan  Auxiliary Airfield.    In his comment, Lieutenant Governor Yoshimoto also said: The  return of Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield is important for promoting  the industry of Yomitan town and stabilizing the livelihood of  residents there. The Okinawans have strongly demanded the  return of the airfield. The Okinawa Prefectural Government  intends to strongly ask both the Japanese and U.S. Governments  to have the airfield returned in a visible way before 1995, when  the 50th anniversary of the end of the Pacific War and battle  for Okinawa is marked.</p>

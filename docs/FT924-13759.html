			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Procter &amp; Gamble cancels claim in cosmetic advert PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE, the US consumer product group, has retracted an advertising claim that could have been understood to suggest that one of its products - Clearasil, a medicated moisturiser - would leave every user spot-free. The magazine advertisement claimed: 'Moisturisers left me with spots; New Clearasil moisturiser leaves me spot-free', and was subject to a complaint that was upheld by the Advertising Standards Authority in its latest monthly digest of complaints. The ASA report said P&amp;G 're-examined their documentary evidence before receiving the complaint' and 'recognised that it was insufficient to support the impression that the product would necessarily leave every user spot-free and they had discontinued the advertisement'. The ASA upheld complaints against a number of other advertisements in the health and dietary sectors, including promotions for products tackling baldness, obesity and arthritis. Complaints against Canon UK and Minolta, both on performance claims for cameras, were upheld, as was a complaint against the London-based Institute for Independent British Business. The institute had taken out press advertising aimed at redundant and early-retiring executives, claiming that annual income of Pounds 36,000 could be obtained, on a 12-month contract. The advertisement failed to specify that the contract was available only to those who participated in a development programme costing Pounds 6,227.50 and that, once employed, 20 per cent of the advertised annual earnings would be payable to the advertisers.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the Keidanren  [Federation of Economic Organizations of Japan], called on Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata at the prime minister's official residence  on the morning of 30 May. He asked Hata to resolutely implement  deregulation after getting the fiscal 1994 budget bill passed by  the Diet. In response, Hata showed a positive attitude toward  promotion of deregulation, saying: "Unless deregulation and  market opening are thoroughly carried out, yen's value will  further appreciate."    Toyoda, who took office at a Keidanren general meeting on 27  May, made a courtesy call on Hata. During the meeting, he  explained his program of activities as the new chairman, saying:  "Our slogans are bold concepts -- steady implementation,  reform, creation, and trust. We act not for the major companies'  interests but for those of the whole nation."    Toyoda further told Hata: "We would like the government to  carry out deregulation particularly. Likewise, we would like to  request the improvement of Japan-U.S. relationship,  strengthening ties with Asian countries, political reform, and  especially, enactment of the redistricting bill for the  electoral system." In response, Hata said, "Although we are a  minority government, neither the political reform nor the  administrative reform are issues the opposition parties can  oppose. Concerning tax system reform, there is also the basic  agreement between the ruling and the opposition parties." He  thus showed his strong resolution to implement these policies.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Andrey Kirillov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 15 Jun -- If the world community introduced  sanctions against North Korea this would be an extremely  unfavorable turn of events, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev said today answering an ITAR-TASS correspondent's  questions after meeting the Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen  Manh Cam.    The head of the Russian foreign political department  recalled  that Russia had put forward a proposal to convene a multilateral  conference on the security and non-nuclear status of the Korean  peninsula, and it is currently being debated along with other  ideas. There is a proposal to introduce sanctions. We believe  that, unfortunately, this can happen but this would be an  extremely unfavorable turn of events, as much as the DPRK's  complete break with the nuclear nonproliferation regime, the  Russian minister said.    That is why, he continued, we propose to hold a conference  so  that one does not have to resort to these extreme measures,  although, of course, the situation is very alarming and the  announcement of the DPRK leaving the IAEA is a highly negative  event.    I must say, Kozyrev added, that IAEA guarantees are  enshrined  in the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons and not  in an agreement with the IAEA itself. I do not think that  everything has already been lost and hope that the door is still  ajar. That is why we think that the conference might give an  opportunity to all its participants, including the DPRK, to find  a better solution than the decision to break the  nonproliferation regime, which will make confrontation with the  world community unavoidable.</p>

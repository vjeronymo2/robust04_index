			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt Yields on German government bonds ended 1993 close to an historical low. This reflects investors' clear expectations that the Bundesbank will continue with its programme of cuts in 'official' short-term interest rates during 1994. The first chance for the Bundesbank to cut rates will come at the meeting of the central bank's policy-making council scheduled for Thursday this week. A public holiday in some parts of Germany means that many regional banks will be closed, so for that reason alone it is unlikely that the Bundesbank will cut the Lombard and discount rates from 6.75 and 5.75 per cent respectively. But if January 6 is difficult from a timing point of view, so is January 20, the council's second meeting in 1994. At around this time the January inflation figures will appear. The annualised inflation rate is likely to be 3.6 per cent - unchanged on the previous month as a result of tax increases - and the Bundesbank is said to be unlikely to send the wrong signals by making a cut in its headline rates. Should monetary policy ease in January, it is likely to be via slow, small cuts in the securities repurchase rate - the repo rate - with which the Bundesbank guides money market rates.</p>

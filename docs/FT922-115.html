			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Buying burst lifts LME metals to fresh highs AN UNEXPECTED burst of enthusiastic buying yesterday boosted all prices on the London Metal Exchange. Copper's price touched its highest level for 14 months; zinc was at a 20-month high, while tin reached a 29-month peak. Traders suggested nothing had changed in the fundamental outlook for metals so the very high volume of business had taken most people by surprise. Some trading was technically-driven as prices moved up through technical resistance levels and triggered 'buy' signals to computer-linked trading programmes. Speculators were attracted by the sudden activity. Analysts said the speed and size of the price increases would probably lead to some profit-taking and retracement today and prices would almost certainly diverge again to reflect each underlying fundamental situation. Mr Angus MacMillan, analyst with Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, said: 'The market was looking to go up even though there was no good reason, so it was seizing on every bit of potential bullish news.' He thought copper's present price could be justified and any fall would probably attract more buying. But there was no good reason for aluminium or nickel prices to be buoyant. Both these markets were suffering because of substantial imports from the CIS. Zinc was a special case, said Mr MacMillan, because it was ignoring the fundamentals and was in the grip of a long-running LME technical squeeze.</p>

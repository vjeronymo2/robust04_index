			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Arts: Brecht par excellence - A look at a new, exciting 'Threepenny Opera' Play it as cabaret, and it swoons with ragtime nostalgia. As theatre, it is sharp, anti-bourgeois satire. As a musical, it is easy escapism. It can be sentimental, witty or a critique on German society: for all these reasons Brecht's Threepenny Opera is the most popular piece in the German repertory. The latest staging from the Dresden State Theatre is the most thrilling I have seen. Its genius is to harness Weill's music to a vivid and original psychological reading of the play. This adds a new satiric edge to both songs and drama and pulls them together in tight artistic cohesion. Given life and form by impeccable ensemble playing and a set which is pure theatrical magic, it is vintage Brecht and proof that the Brechtian traditions which inspired East German theatre for decades are still thriving. What a revelation to see Brecht's characters taken beyond the usual stereotypes - the whore, Jenny, the criminal, Mack the Knife, the innocent girl, Polly - into rounded, changing people whose relationships drive the action. Best is Polly, played with every nerve and muscle by Anna-Katherina Muck. At first, she is a God-fearing girl hardly able to breathe for the ecstasy of marrying in a (stolen) white open-top Trabby, decked-out with plastic flowers. During her wedding night, saxophones and trumpets ominously whirr and wind-down as if their batteries had run out; the next day, Mack flees. In a snatch at worldly wisdom, Polly sings one of Jenny's songs; the orchestral accompaniment - jazzy, up-beat, naive for Polly, languorous and resentful for Jenny - plays out the mocking contrast. Back home, her toddler-tantrum - chubby legs flying, stockings falling down  -as she boasts to her parents of her husband's underworld connections, is the spur for the Peachums to get Mack hanged. The emotional point is that she has married her father. Peachum, the Beggar King (Hans Jorn Weber) and Mack the Knife (Michael Neuenschwander) are both giant, charismatic figures, slick dressers and smooth talkers, one controlling his crooks, the other his paupers, with the same menacing flick-of-the-wrist or twist-of-the-head. The political point, that both are profiteers in collusion with the state, is here a sub-text. Against a stunning tower-block set, the power game works as a formally choreographed dance. A siren shriek and a dozen secret brick-doors burst open to reveal Mack's criminals, pants down, each hiding in a urinal. Seconds later, the doors shut and fly open again, each showing a beggar with his props of wooden legs and eye-patches. Bathed in purple light, the cubicles next become a brothel which Peachum and Mack fight to control. Mack sings the Procurer's Ballad pulling up half-dressed whores from the floor, thrusting at them and then letting them fall. When one of them sings back in the throaty bass of the Streetsinger, there is a whiff of real 1920s decadence. Like the themes of Klaus Dieter Kirst's production, the set keeps opening out on to new levels. A slice of brickwork vanishes and a beggars' chorus appears on a neon ramp. Then, a flood of light, the Peachum apartment shining through a high window and the action leaps to the roof of the stage. In the finale, beggars, tarts, thugs and policemen, all draped in fluorescent grey raincoats and carrying umbrellas and wreaths, snake their way from top to bottom of the set to watch Mack hang. There is the lightest flurry of snow, then the Streetsinger, wearing archangel wings, arrives by bicycle to deliver a happy ending. This brought a standing ovation from the audience at the Brussels Saxony Festival, where I caught this production. Here is a Threepenny Opera, as Brecht hoped it would be, 'so splendid that only beggars can imagine it.' Let us hope it visits Britain soon. The production continues at the Staatschauspiel, Dresden. The Brussels Saxony Festival runs through June.</p>

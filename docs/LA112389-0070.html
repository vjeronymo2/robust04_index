			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VAN NUYS FALLS TO LOCKE, 37-6, IN 3-A OPENER  </P> <P> As if the thrill of playing in the first round of the City Section 3-A Division  playoffs was not enough inspiration for James Fuller, he had additional  incentive -- impressing a rather conspicuous visitor on the Locke High  sideline.  </P> <P> Colorado quarterback Darian Hagan showed up Wednesday night at Van Nuys to root  on his alma mater. The Heisman Trophy candidate was not disappointed as Locke  crushed Van Nuys, 37-6.  </P> <P> Fuller, a Locke halfback, rushed for 187 yards in 19 carries and scored  touchdowns of 85, 31 and 11 yards. He also ran in a two-point conversion.  </P> <P> Fuller started slowly, however, gaining just nine yards in his first five  carries.  </P> <P> "They were keying on me," Fuller said. "But then they forgot about me and I  just cut loose."  </P> <P> Said Hagan of Fuller: "I think he's a bona fide player. He can go to a Division  I school and any school he goes to, he's going to be an impact player."  </P> <P> Van Nuys (5-5), which had not made the playoffs since 1983, had a tough time  making a dent in the Locke defense. Quarterback Roy Vasich completed eight of  27 passes for 121 yards and threw one interception. Diallo Frazier led the  Wolves with 72 yards in 14 carries.  </P> <P> Van Nuys did have its chances, however. Tony Indelicato took a kickoff 90 yards  for a touchdown to trim Locke's lead to 8-6 early in the second quarter.  </P> <P> With a minute left in the first half, the Wolves had a second down on the Locke  one-yard line but self-destructed. They were unable to score after being pushed  back to the 15 by consecutive penalties, however.  </P> <P> Locke quarterback Dewayne Bryant did not complete a pass in the first half but  did inflict his share of damage. He gained 63 yards in 14 carries, scored a  two-yard touchdown and intercepted a pass.  </P> <P> With the help of fullback Kimo Dunn, who was clearly pushing him from behind,  Bryant charged in from the two with 4:18 to play. The score capped a 52-yard  drive. Steven Martin, the holder on the point-after attempt, grabbed a bad snap  and ran in for the conversion -- his second of the game -- that gave Locke  (6-3-2) a 16-6 edge.  </P> <P> Shortly after a scoreless first period, Fuller outsprinted the Van Nuys  secondary for an 85-yard touchdown run. Martin ran in the conversion.  </P></p>

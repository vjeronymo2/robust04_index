			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Japanese angered over Yeltsin cancellation THE Japanese government was left in shock yesterday as political leaders puzzled over the diplomatic significance of Mr Boris Yeltsin's decision to abruptly cancel his visit to Japan, scheduled for this Sunday. Mr Kato Koichi, chief cabinet secretary, insisted that relations with Russia would not change, despite disappointment over the cancellation. Mr Kato also said Japan would not soften its demand that Russia recognise Japanese sovereignty over the four Kurile islands which Soviet forces seized at the end of the second world war. Mr Yeltsin is widely believed to have cancelled the visit because of Japan's insistence the issue be solved before it can extend significant economic aid. Mr Yeltsin's behaviour in the affair has confirmed long-standing Japanese distrust of Russia, which has deep historical roots. The manner in which news of Mr Yeltsin's decision came to light was most embarrassing, with senior ministers rushing to the prime minister's official residence to receive a phone call from Mr Yeltsin, only to have to wait over an hour before the call came through. The fact that Mr Yeltsin phoned President Mr Roh Tae-woo of South Korea to tell him of the cancelled trip before informing Japan was also seen as an unsubtle diplomatic snub. The Asahi Shimbun, the daily newspaper, quoted an unnamed Foreign Ministry official as saying: 'This proves Russia's diplomacy is inept. We should not take what the Russian government says seriously from now on.' On the other hand, there was also plenty of criticism of what appeared to be Japan's diplomatic ineptitude over the territorial issue, in which it pushed Mr Yeltsin into a corner and obtained nothing as a result. Mr Takahiro Yokomichi, the governor of Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost main island, told the Mianichi Evening News: 'The Japanese government aimed at 100 per cent but actually scored zero points even though the Russian government made a special effort to improve the relationship.' Despite government assurances that nothing has changed, there is widespread fear that relations between Japan and Russia, which were only just begining to thaw, have been put back into the freezer. There is also fear that an historic opportunity to cement Russo-Japanese relations and shore up Mr Yeltsin's presidency may have been lost.</p>

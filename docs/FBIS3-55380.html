			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Vanichkin report: "`We </F> Cannot Move the Berlin Wall to the East'"]    [Text] Washington, 5 Jan -- The preparation for the  imminent 10-11 January conference of NATO heads of state and  government and the prospects of expanding U.S.-West European  trade and economic cooperation were the focus of attention  during a conversation in the White House between U.S. President  Bill Clinton and Netherlands Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, who is  here on an official visit.    Speaking to journalists before the meeting began, B. Clinton  said that discussion of his proposed "Partnership for Peace"  concept, which provides for the phased integration of East  European countries in NATO, must be one of the main themes on  the agenda at the upcoming Brussels conference of NATO  countries' leaders. However, according to the U.S. President, it  would be premature to start talking abut the possibility of  giving Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic full membership  status in NATO right now.    "I am not opposed to expanding NATO," the head of the White  House stressed. However, from what he said "there is no accord"  at the moment among the organization members as to the  expediency of accepting East European countries. "Therefore,  following many decades of work to abolish the `boundary'  dividing Europe, we do not want to create the impression that we  are aspiring to a new division of the continent," Clinton said.  "We favor a secure and stable Europe. At the same time, I  believe that sooner or later the `Partnership for Peace' concept  will lead to an expansion of NATO."    When asked whether in his view the implementation of this  concept would lead to the integration of all European states,  including Russia, in the North Atlantic Alliance, the U.S.  President said: "I hope that ultimately all European countries  will clearly and unequivocally put themselves in the hands of a  peaceful, stable, and secure Europe, whose states will respect  each other's borders."    "We cannot simply move the Berlin Wall several hundred miles  to the East," General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the U.S.  Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated at a White House news conference  Tuesday. He warned against "creating a division" in Europe  again, whether "deliberately or unintentionally," and expressed  his opposition to expanding NATO at present by including former  Warsaw Pact states.    Speaking to journalists on the same day, U.S. presidential  national security adviser Anthony Lake stressed that the United  States is committed to the "evolutionary" process and is  avoiding drawing "new demarcating lines" right now between East  and West in Europe. The hasty acceptance of East European  countries into NATO could lead to the destabilization of the  region and "would be an involuntary confirmation of pessimistic  predictions in respect of Russia," was the way he explained  Washington's official viewpoint. This, in his opinion, would not  be in line with "either NATO's interests or the interests of the  states of Central and East Europe." Lake deemed it necessary to  stress that this position enjoys the support of President Bill  Clinton.</p>

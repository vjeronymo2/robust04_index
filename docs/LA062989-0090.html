			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK / SEAN WATERS;  </P> <P> CAMARILLO BASKETBALL A SERIOUS SUMMER SPORT  </P> <P> Camarillo High has had its basketball team on the run since the end of the  school year.  </P> <P> Last week, the Scorpions played nine games in seven days while competing in the  L. A. Summer Games and the Mater Dei Summer Tournament in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> "We spent a lot of time in the car together and got to know each other real  well," junior guard David Harbour said. "It seemed like we had to change the  radio station every five minutes to keep everyone happy."  </P> <P> Camarillo's journey began June 17th and 18th with three games in the Summer  Games at high schools in the South Bay area. The Scorpions beat Hollywood,  61-37, Rubidoux, 46-40, and Dominguez, 40-26.  </P> <P> Next were opening games in the Santa Clara summer league on Monday June 19th  and the Royal summer league two days later.  </P> <P> Camarillo came close to pulling off an upset before losing to Saddleback,  77-76, in the first round of the Mater Dei tournament Thursday. The Scorpions  led Saddleback, runner-up to Southern Section 5-AA champion Long Beach  Millikan, by as many as 19 points in the second half.  </P> <P> Friday, Camarillo rebounded to defeat Trabuco Hills, 94-71, in a consolation  game at Mater Dei.  </P> <P> Saturday's doubleheader began with an 8:30 a.m. game at Mater Dei. The  Scorpions beat Bosco Tech, 79-76. Then it was back in the car en route to an  afternoon game against Rolling Hills at El Camino College in Torrance. They  lost, 62-48, in the championship quarterfinals of the Summer Games.  </P> <P> "It was tough but good for us," Harbour said. "We're playing teams and we're  finding out what it takes to beat the best."  </P> <P> Harbour, 5-10 guard Rick Schnell and 6-5 center Scott Foster are returning  starters.  </P> <P> New Raider coach: Ventura County Community College trustees approved Ken  Wagner's selection as Moorpark College baseball coach Tuesday.  </P> <P> Wagner, coach of the Camarillo High baseball team for the past seven seasons,  was named to a similar position at Moorpark last week. He succeeds Ron  Stillwell, who resigned in May at the end of his fifth season at Moorpark.  </P> <P> Wagner, 43, compiled a 98-63-1 record and his teams won two Marmonte League  titles at Camarillo. The Scorpions were 12-13 this season and finished tied for  fourth in the league with a 5-7 mark.  </P> <P> The Scorpions advanced to the Southern Section 5-A Division finals in 1985 but  lost to Fountain Valley, 3-2.  </P> <P> Wagner will continue to teach physical education at Camarillo and coach at  Moorpark on a walk-on basis.  </P> <P> "I think I'm ready to try something new, so I was really pleased to be  selected," Wagner said. "I've really enjoyed the high school kids, but Moorpark  gives me a chance to work with some different kids."  </P> <P> Wagner said that Mel Bannon, his assistant at Camarillo, and Mario Porto,  former coach at Moorpark High, will join him as assistants. Porto last season  guided Moorpark High to its first baseball playoff berth.  </P> <P> "I coached with Mario in several all-star games and have known him for a long  time," Wagner said. "We're lucky he wants to coach with us. He felt, as I do,  that it was a good opportunity to move up and coach at the college level."  </P> <P> And so the shuffling of Ventura County baseball coaches continues. Last week,  Royal High hired Danny Maye to replace Mike McCurdy and Camarillo selected Jack  Willard, a Scorpion assistant, for the position vacated by Wagner.  </P> <P> Still looking: Athletic Director Don Brockett has seven applicants for the  position of Oxnard College baseball coach.  </P> <P> Brockett said that he expects later this week to name a replacement for George  Peraza, who resigned in May after one season as coach. The Condors finished the  season 16-15, 11-9 in the Western State Conference.  </P> <P> Quick to forgive: Some thought Santa Clara would never be allowed to play in  another Orange County basketball tournament, but there it was entered in the  Mater Dei Summer Tournament.  </P> <P> And involved in another forfeit.  </P> <P> This time the Saints were the benefactors when Camarillo failed to show up for  the consolation championship. The Scorpions, however, notified tournament  officials in advance that they would not appear.  </P> <P> Santa Clara has been prohibited to play tournaments during the 1989-90 season  after forfeiting two games last year in a Christmas tournament at Estancia  High.  </P> <P> Back in action: Center Nichole Ellis and guard Lianne Ishikawa returned to play  their first games for the Buena High girls' basketball team after missing  portions of last season with debilitating injuries.  </P> <P> Ellis, a 5-11 senior, did not play last season after tearing ligaments in her  left knee. Ishikawa, a 5-5 guard, was sidelined half of the season after  dislocating her left ankle and suffering ligament damage.  </P> <P> "It's good to have both of them back in the lineup," Buena Coach Joe Vaughan  said.  </P> <P> Buena reached the quarterfinals of the L. A. Games before losing to eventual  champion Washington, 44-36.  </P> <P> Quick exit: After a slow start, Kurt Schwan expected to have a high-scoring  second half for the South team in the Ventura County All-Star basketball game.  </P> <P> Instead, Schwan spent the second half in a hospital emergency room after  getting five stitches to seal a gash he sustained under his right eye in the  second period of Friday night's game at Ventura High.  </P> <P> Not exactly the way the 6-foot-9 center from Westlake High expected to end his  high school career.  </P> <P> "I will remember it for a long time," Schwan said. "It was the worst injury  I've had playing basketball."  </P> <P> Despite Schwan's absence, the South closed to within two points of the North in  the fourth quarter after trailing, 50-32, at halftime. The North outscored the  South, 40-14, in the last 9:01 to clinch the 111-83 victory.  </P> <P> Bass fishing at its best: Sand bass and calico bass are spawning near Ventura  County waters and that's good news for the sportfishing industry.  </P> <P> Ventura Landing, Port Hueneme Sportfishing and Oxnard Sportfishing are catching  an average of four bass per passenger.  </P> <P> "Right now is an excellent time for bass fishing, as good as you're going to  see it," said Louie Abbott, owner and operator of Port Hueneme. It takes about  three weeks for the waters to warm up and bingo -- the bass start biting like  crazy up here."  </P> <P> Staff writer Ralph Nichols contributed to this story.  </P></p>

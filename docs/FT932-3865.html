			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Denmark to double N Sea gas output NATURAL GAS production from the Danish sector of the North Sea will be doubled to about 7bn cubic metres a year as a result of an agreement signed here. The deal was made between the state's gas distribution company, Dansk Naturgas, and Danish Underground Consortium, a venture between AP Moller, Royal Dutch/Shell and Texaco, which is the licence holder for the country's North Sea gas fields. Most of the additional gas produced will be sold to Germany under the terms of agreement between Dansk Naturgas and Germany's Ruhrgas and BEB for delivery of 2.5bn cu m a year from the end of 1996. The expansion of gas production will require investments totalling DKr17bn (Pounds 1.8bn), said A. P. Moller, including investments of more than DKr2bn by Dansk Naturgas for the processing, transport and storage of the additional quantities of natural gas. Danish natural gas production in 1992 was 3.5bn cu m. DUC had earlier contracted to sell a total of 93bn cubic meters to Dansk Naturgas, of which 20bn has already been delivered. The new agreement does not cover a fixed quantity of gas, but on the assumption that production of 7bn cubic meters a year can be maintained over 12 years, the agreement would cover about 35bn cu m to a value of DKr20bn-30bn, said DUC.</p>

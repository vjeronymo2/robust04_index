			<p>BFN     [Text] As a full-fledged European state, Ukraine should  play a considerable role in the European economic and political  space. Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Minister Anatoliy Zlenko said  this at a joint news conference with Leon Brittan, deputy  chairman of the European Union commission and commissioner for  external economic affairs.    Zlenko emphasized that the legal and treaty basis for  cooperation should be the agreement on partnership and  cooperation between Ukraine and the European Union, which opens  up the prospect for associate membership in this structure. The  minister expressed the hope that the agreement would be signed  by the head of the Ukrainian state. Zlenko also said that the  direction of cooperation with the European Union in the areas of  agriculture, nuclear safety, energy provision, and  macroeconomics had been discussed and that an exchange of  opinions on issues of European security and other international  problems had taken place during the course of Brittan's stay in  Ukraine.</p>

			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Steinhardt bids Dollars 250m to control America West Mr Michael Steinhardt, the New York money manager, has offered to pay Dollars 250m (Pounds 167m) to gain control of America West Airlines, the struggling Phoenix-based carrier which has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the past two and a half years. The investment, which will give Mr Steinhardt 80 per cent of America West, should be enough to allow the airline to emerge from bankruptcy procedure. Other investors, however, may make offers before the February 10 deadline set by a Phoenix court. The move by Mr Steinhardt, who runs Steinhardt Management, a hedge fund with more than Dollars 3bn in assets, follows the withdrawal of a Dollars 150m bid from an investment group led by the Pritzker family of Chicago and the investment bank Wertheim Schroder. The Pritzker-Wertheim bid was said to have been pulled because the group could not reach an agreement with America West's chairman, Mr William Franke. The Steinhardt bid is believed to be supported by Mr Franke.</p>

			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION SOCCER PREVIEW;  </P> <P> HAMPTON BOOSTS TEAMMATES;  </P> <P> SOCCER: ALL-AMERICAN MIDFIELDER HAS BROUGHT THE ABILITIES OF SIMI VALLEY  PLAYERS TO ANOTHER LEVEL.  </P> <P> After Craig Hampton was selected to the 1989 All-American soccer team earlier  this month, some of his Simi Valley High teammates were awed by the senior  midfielder's presence.  </P> <P> But now the Pioneers have not only accepted Hampton's recognition by the  National Soccer Coaches Assn. of America but some of his skills have begun to  rub off on his teammates.  </P> <P> "Some kids, when playing with a national-level player on their team, don't  really shy away from him, they're a little intimidated," Simi Valley Coach Andy  Silva said. "That intimidation carries right onto the field. We had a couple of  players like that . . . it's sort of fading away now."  </P> <P> Silva stressed that playing alongside Hampton has helped his teammates hone  their own techniques.  </P> <P> "Of (Hampton's) play and ability, it has brought the other kids' ability up to  play top-level soccer," he said.  </P> <P> Top-level soccer has been a trademark of Simi Valley teams.  </P> <P> The Pioneers have won seven Marmonte League championships this decade,  including two three-year reigns from 1980-82 and 1984-86. They finished second  in the Southern Section 4-A Division in 1986.  </P> <P> This year, Simi Valley is ranked second behind defending 4-A champion Palos  Verdes; Marmonte teams Royal and Newbury Park are ranked seventh and ninth.  </P> <P> "I think we have a good chance of going a long way in the 4-A," the 11th-year  coach said, "but I don't want to count my chickens before they're hatched."  </P> <P> Eight players return for Simi Valley -- including seven starters -- from last  year's team that advanced to the 4-A quarterfinals before losing to Hawthorne,  2-0.  </P> <P> Hampton, senior midfielder Andre Markarian and junior striker Brian Weaver lead  a potent Pioneer offense.  </P> <P> In its first eight matches, Simi Valley is averaging 3.75 goals.  </P> <P> Weaver has been equally effective at goal-scoring as well as feeding assists.  Senior forward Kenny Greninger also is a frequent contributor.  </P> <P> Simi Valley recorded five consecutive shutouts to start the season as  goalkeepers Angelo Maccano and Mike Jones, a sophomore, shared time.  </P> <P> Defenders Sean Kieldrup and Marc Cargnel head the Valley area's stingiest  defense, which did not allow a goal in the Pioneers' first six games.  </P> <P> Other teams to watch:  </P> <P> Channel Islands -- After a season in which the Raiders won only three matches,  first-year Coach Al Tarazon has the Raiders playing well.  </P> <P> Channel Islands is off to a 6-1-1 record and senior goalkeeper Rosario Pina has  posted four shutouts.  </P> <P> Sophomore Oscar Gutierrez and freshman Francisco Leon provide punch at forward  for the a team dominated by underclassmen, and senior Victor Martinez and  junior Jose Sarabia, both halfbacks, add depth.  </P> <P> Senior twins Gabriel and German Prieto and juniors Lupe Moreno and Francisco  Robles are key defenders.  </P> <P> Royal -- After winning the 4-A title in the 1987-88 season and missing the  playoffs the following year, the Highlanders again are on the upswing, starting  the season 6-0-1.  </P> <P> Senior striker Matt Brinkman, a dangerous offensive player, scored a hat trick  Thursday in a 3-2 win over Santa Paula.  </P> <P> Sophomore goalkeeper Steven Hambly is the cornerstone of Royal's defense along  with Michael Hansen and Daniel Anderson  </P> <P> Marco Todesco is a quarterback-type player, setting up offensive plays from his  midfielder position along with midfielder Kai Schraml.  </P> <P> St. Francis -- First-year Coach Glen Appels inherited the defending Del Rey  League titlist that went 16-1-1 last year and reached the semifinals of the 3-A  playoffs before falling to eventual champion Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> Nine players return, most of whom saw limited action.  </P> <P> Senior David Beall scored six goals in this season's first five games from his  midfielder position, and senior midfielder Erik Franken provides depth.  </P> <P> Appels said that the Golden Knights' strength lies in their defense, for which  he has two solid performers in defender Matthew Hydar and midfielder Mike  Rendon, both seniors.  </P> <P> Burroughs -- Although they had a less-than-stellar season in 1989, Mike  Kodama's Indians have 11 players back. The addition of two forwards and a  sweeper from last year's 16-1-2 junior varsity should spark Burroughs in the  nine-team Foothill League.  </P> <P> Burroughs compiled a 7-9-4 record and finished fifth in league play at 4-6-4.  But with veteran players the Indians, behind their third-year coach, are  already pushing good teams. They were edged recently by defending 1-A champion  La Canada, 3-2, in a nonleague game.  </P> <P> All-league defender Carlos Roque, a junior, is in the backfield along with  sophomore sweeper Ian Goyanes, up from the junior varsity.  </P> <P> Seniors Sean O'Connor and Jeff Gierok, both third-year players, will lead the  Indians' offense from their midfielder and forward positions. Senior forwards  Octavio Alejandres and Jason Pitkin will provide additional support.  </P> <P> L. A. Baptist -- Eleven players return for the Knights -- including eight  starters -- from the team that lost in the quarterfinals of the 1989 Small  Schools Division playoffs to eventual champion Morro Bay.  </P> <P> Senior midfielder Ron Simpson, an All-Southern Section selection, scored 16  goals and had 14 assists in leading L. A. Baptist to a 17-6-1 record.  </P></p>

			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Midland encouraged to lift small business lending MIDLAND BANK will be encouraged to increase its lending to small businesses, a senior executive of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation , its new owner, said yesterday. The plan is to alter Midland's lending practices so that managers place less emphasis on a potential borrower's collateral before deciding whether to make a loan. UK banks have in recent years been forcing small business borrowers to mortgage both their business assets and private assets as a condition of making a loan. Instead Midland managers will take more account of a business's financial projections in deciding whether to make a loan and will not insist that a loan is backed 100 per cent by collateral. Such a change would be welcomed by the small business lobby. There is no intention of encouraging Midland to exploit Hongkong Bank's strong balance sheet by lending at a rapid rate. On the other hand, Hongkong Bank wants to reverse the trend of the past 18 months during which Midland has reduced the volume of loans on its balance sheet. 'We did not buy Midland in order to see it continue shrinking,' the executive said. Separately, Mr William Purves, Hongkong Bank's chairman, said that the parent company's main office would be moving to 10 Lower Thames Street in the City of London. The building on the north bank of the Thames is also occupied by Samuel Montagu, Midland's merchant bank. A number of trading operations are leaving the address, creating space for the parent company's offices. However, most of Samuel Montagu's staff will remain there. Mr Purves said the move was a sign of his intention to give Midland's top management considerable independence, since he would not be occupying Midland's architecturally noted head office at Poultry, also in the City. Meanwhile it emerged that Hongkong Bank's commitment to reduce the ratio of Midland's costs to its income was a long-term aim. Over the next four to five years, it wants this ratio to fall from its present level of just over 70 per cent (excluding the Thomas Cook travel business) to 60 per cent. Hongkong Bank is keen not to create concern among Midland's employees that draconian redundancies are in the offing. A Hongkong Bank executive also said that the bank may have to make a further loan loss provision against its Dollars 768m (Pounds 386m) exposure to Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian property developer which has sought bankruptcy protection. On Tuesday, the bank disclosed that it had made a Dollars 188m provision against the O&amp;Y loan. If the value of the security held against this loan does not rise, the bank could be forced to make a further provision of similar size at the end of the current year.</p>

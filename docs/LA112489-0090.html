			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> $6,388.81 REWARD FOR NIGHT STALKER REMAINS UNCLAIMED;  </P> <P> JUSTICE: ALEJANDRO ESPINOZA WAS 'A BIG BREAK' IN HELPING TO CONVICT RICHARD  RAMIREZ. BUT OFFICIALS CAN'T FIND HIM TO GIVE HIM HIS REWARD.  </P> <P> Alejandro Espinoza: Los Angeles County has a $6,388.81 check for you for your  help in convicting Night Stalker Richard Ramirez.  </P> <P> But authorities don't know where to find you.  </P> <P> "Nobody seems to know his whereabouts," said Larry Monteilh, executive officer  to the county Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> Monteilh said Espinoza filed a claim for a share of the $36,777 reward but  failed to include his address. Shares of the reward pot were given out to  others this week in proportion to how important their information was to  investigators, authorities said.  </P> <P> Espinoza will receive the second-largest chunk of the reward because he  assisted police in recovering property taken from the homes of some of the  Night Stalker's murder victims. Ramirez was convicted Sept. 20 of 13 murders  and faces death in the gas chamber.  </P> <P> Prosecutor Phil Halpin said Espinoza provided the link between the stolen items  and Ramirez.  </P> <P> "My recollection was that this was one of the people who led us to the person  to whom Ramirez was selling stolen property," Halpin said. "That was a big  break in the case."  </P> <P> Halpin said that Espinoza was "an acquaintance" of Ramirez, but officials do  not believe that he was involved in the case. Authorities also do not believe  that Espinoza was dealing in stolen property, he added.  </P> <P> "It seems to me that he had driven (Ramirez) to the location on one or two  occasions where the property was sold," Halpin said. Espinoza "did not know  where the property came from. All he knew is that there was a fellow who fit  the description that had been published (in the media) that he knew, and this  fellow also was apparently selling property that could well have come from the  locations where the crimes had been committed."  </P> <P> Monteilh said law enforcement authorities have been asked to help locate the  missing man.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Homicide Sgt. Frank Salerno, who worked on the Night Stalker case,  said Espinoza's last known address was in downtown Los Angeles. He described  him as a street-wise person who has "contact with people on the street."  </P> <P> "We're told that he has a wife and a small child," Salerno said. Several  sheriff's investigators met Espinoza, face-to-face, when he came forward with  the information. So they would be able to verify his identity, authorities  said.  </P> <P> "We'll continue to hold his money in trust until he shows up," Monteilh said.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Department homicide investigators may be contacted at 974-4341.  </P></p>

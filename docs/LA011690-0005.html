			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPERA REVIEW;  </P> <P> NEW PRINCIPALS IN OPERA PACIFIC 'LA TRAVIATA'  </P> <P> The Opera Pacific production of Verdi's "La Traviata" represents no milestone  of interpretive insight. However, it makes good traditional sense -- a few  directorial quirks notwithstanding -- so long as the three central roles are  well cast.  </P> <P> They were well cast for the opening performance, Saturday night at the Orange  County Performing Arts Center. They turned out to be less well cast at the  Sunday matinee. Such are the vicissitudes in an irrational art that allows  robust but consumptive heroines to sing strenuous arias on their pathetic  deathbeds.  </P> <P> On Sunday, the center of attention among the alternate principals was the brave  young soprano attempting the title role.  </P> <P> Stephanie Friede, originally scheduled for the assignment, withdrew last week  either because of ill health (the official company explanation) or because of  disagreements with the management (the rumor-mill explanation). In her place  came a little known, would-be diva named Brenda Harris.  </P> <P> She is talented, make no mistake. She is statuesque and pretty. She commands an  array of sweet and pure tones that can move about a wide range with  considerable agility. She is a conscientious actress.  </P> <P> She made all the right motions. She even avoided the grotesquerie of painting  crimson circles on her cheeks in the quasi-mad scene concocted by the local  director for the last act.  </P> <P> None of this, alas, made her an instant Violetta. For all her professionalism  and assurance, she did little on Sunday to illuminate the tragedy of the  courtesan who foreswears love in quest of honor.  </P> <P> Whether dealing with rapture, fear, renunciation, hysteria or agony, she  produced the same invariably lovely sounds (up to but not including a squeaky  E-flat unwisely ventured at the end of "Sempre libera"). Ultimately, she gave a  bland, immature performance more notable for promise than for achievement.  </P> <P> At best, she was a Gilda. This was a girl sent in to do a woman's job.  </P> <P> As Alfredo, Rico Serbo acted with convincing ardor and introduced an unexpected  bit of motivation for the hero's desperate swagger in the gambling scene: He is  drunk. Unfortunately, Serbo's dry, nasal, often tremulous tenor tended to  compromise dramatic compulsion.  </P> <P> Andreas Poulimenos, the strong and dark-voiced Germont pere, looked chronically  angry and sounded chronically gruff. Like his colleagues, he paid little  attention to matters of dynamic subtlety.  </P> <P> Otherwise, this "Traviata" followed familiar patterns. Bernard Uzan's staging  scheme remained perfectly functional despite some cheap effects (an itinerant  puppy-dog steals the scene in Act III). Mark Flint again conducted with more  brio than precision, but the orchestra showed signs of improvement.  </P> <P> Incidental intelligence:  </P> <P> Violetta will be undertaken Friday night and Sunday afternoon by a third  soprano, Nova Thomas, who scored a considerable success here last season as  Adalgisa opposite the Norma of Joan Sutherland.  </P> <P> Unlike most opera companies in the civilized world, Opera Pacific allows late  seating and thus spoils much of the first act for those who care enough to  arrive on time.  </P> <P> The audience on this occasion included one non-bel-canto baby equipped with  leather lungs. Early cultural education is very nice, but this is ridiculous.  </P></p>

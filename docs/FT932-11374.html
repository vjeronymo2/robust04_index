			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Anger at criticism of Ilva proposals ITALY'S new industry minister yesterday reacted angrily to a critical European Commission analysis of the restructuring plan prepared for Ilva, the loss-making state-controlled steel producer. Mr Paolo Savona told fellow EC industry ministers that Brussels seemed prejudiced against a plan which had only been submitted on Friday. His call for more sympathetic treatment was backed by Mr Claudio Aranzadi, the Spanish minister, whose plans for restructuring of the Spanish steel industry have still not won Commission approval. Yesterday's stand-off was probably only a foretaste of the fierce debate to come in July, when ministers will have to decide unanimously on the fate of both state subsidy plans. They will also vote then on German proposals - rejected by Brussels - for rescuing east German producer Ekostahl. Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, warned yesterday that Brussels would stick to a consistent and tough line on state subsidies to national steelmakers, to avoid undermining the overall plan for supporting the industry. He estimated that the new Ilva plan would involve the payment of some Ecu4bn (Pounds 3.2bn) in state aids, mainly relating to the write-off of an estimated L8,500bn (Pounds 3.6bn) of debt. Subsidies on such a scale would have to be offset by capacity cuts of up to 3m tonnes. IRI, the Italian state holding company which controls Ilva, argues that the new plan involves no state aid, and that the 'new' steel company it plans to create should not be subject to production cuts.</p>

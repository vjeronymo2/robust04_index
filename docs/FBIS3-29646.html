			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- An industry association  demanded Tuesday [22 February] that the Postal Ministry rescind  its decision to promote the development of a digital  high-definition television (HDTV) system to replace an analog  system developed by Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK).    The Electronic Industries Association of Japan issued a  statement expressing regret over the policy switch by the  Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.    Akimasa Egawa, director general of the Broadcasting  Administration Bureau at the Ministry, announced the policy  switch at a news conference earlier Tuesday, saying that if NHK  stuck to the analog HDTV system, it could become a new source of  trade friction.    The industry group comprises major Japanese electronics  manufacturers, which are already selling analog HDTV systems  based on NHK technologies.    The statement said the ministry decision would cause  unnecessary confusion for consumers and for the electronics  industry.    NHK has been experimenting with analog HDTV broadcasting,  known as hi-vision, since 1991.    The government-backed Hi-Vision Promotion Association said  in  another statement that the hi-vision broadcasts will not be  discontinued in the immediate future.    It urged the ministry to continue promoting hi-vision  broadcasts to protect hi-vision television owners.</p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Letter: Time for Names to speak out Sir, Your story about the Mori poll into the intentions of Lloyd's Names ('Many Names 'ready to quit' ', January 16) was really rather tendentious. Given the losses that the market has experienced and the constant bad-mouthing that Lloyd's has had to put up with, what is truly remarkable in the Mori survey is the finding that 80 per cent of Names have decided to stick with it. The fact that a quarter of these have decided to increase their commitment is the clearest possible demonstration of confidence in what is undoubtedly going to be a very prosperous future. More encouragement comes from the likely dramatic and gratifying reduction in resignations. If in fact 2,000-odd members do leave in the next two years, it will mean the number of resignations per year will be half what it was last year. Where all of us with the future of the market at heart seem to be failing is in our apparent inability to spread the word about the exciting prospects for Lloyd's to others qualified to join us. It is time for the 80 per cent with confidence in the future to speak out. Nicolas Mellersh, 47 Quarrendon Street, London SW6 3ST</p>

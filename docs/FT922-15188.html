			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Israel's Labour doves dominate Leaders of the 'dovish' wing of Israel's opposition Labour party yesterday dominated a poll to rank its candidates for the June 23 general election, sharpening the battle lines with the hardline Likud party on Israel's stance in the Middle East peace process, writes Hugh Carnegy in Jerusalem. Mr Shimon Peres easily won second place after Mr Yitzhak Rabin, who unseated him as leader in February. The results show Labour members opted for Mr Rabin as leader to win the election, rather than for his more cautious approach to peace talks.</p>

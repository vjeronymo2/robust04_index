			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTINGHOUSE CORP. SELLS UNIT TO TCOM  </P> <P> Westinghouse Electric Corp. said it sold its tethered aerostat systems unit to  a limited partnership of Craig Capital Corp. and MH Equity Corp., an affiliate  of Manufacturers Hanover Corp. of New York.  </P> <P> Terms were not disclosed.  </P> <P> The sale to TCOM L.P. involves Westinghouse administrative and engineering  operations in Hanover, Md., and a leased aerostat assembly and test facility in  Elizabeth City, N.C. These units presently employ 120 workers.  </P> <P> "Westinghouse decided to divest its tethered aerostat systems activities  because the systems are no longer in the mainstream of our electronic systems  business focus," said Milton Borkowski, general manager of Westinghouse's  Command and Control Divisions.  </P></p>

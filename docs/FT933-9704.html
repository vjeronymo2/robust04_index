			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Arts: On politicians and poets - Radio BEFORE you went to bed last night, you could have heard the first of Radio 4's 'experimental' series, Rushes. This was SplashPast, a 25-minute trip along the River Trent, local history interspersed with pleasant rippling sounds, just the thing to lull you to sleep. And not long after you get up this morning, at 11 am, there begins the revived series, Talking Politics, where David Walter presents all-round portraits of the new generation of European politicians. Today's is Volker Ruhe, the German Minister of Defence; in the next three weeks come Nicolas Sarkozy, French Budget Minister, who should have a lot to tell us, Ruud Lubbers, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, and Italian Mario Segni. Ruhe, 50, would like to be Chancellor, though Kohl is not keen on it. Like most Hamburgers, Ruhe is outward-looking; As a boy, he did an attachment to Hurstpierpoint College, where, he says, 'he learnt English and rugby'. Formerly a right-wing hard-liner (compared by a colleague to Lord Tebbitt), he melted enough to propose a coalition with the Social Democrats, but has hardened since. He is anxious that Germany should not be bound by the post-war constitution preventing the use of German forces in peace-keeping activities. In Europe, he believes alike in sovereignty and integration. This interesting half-hour concluded that Ruhe, 'the new style German politician', knew well the influence that the past has had on the present, but was no part of that past himself. In The Silver in the Stone (Radio 4, Thursday) Andy Croft suggested that the fate of poet John Clare might still befall ambitious writers from un-literary backgrounds. Clare, a farm-worker, published his first verses to the acclamation of established poets, but was later dropped by his publisher, who thought his work 'too common' and reckoned that the Northampton enclosures were no matter for poetry, especially when ill-spelt and punctuated. Clare went mad. His work is now included in the official curriculum. Croft presented some current writers' comments. A well-thought-of Welsh miner-poet, Mogg Williams, thought it a privilege for people like him to talk with academics: but also vice versa. Rebecca O'Rourke, a working-class Manchester writer, has to fight against judgments like 'minority interest', 'marginal'. Even Melvyn Bragg says that writing about work is 'hard to place'. He is not in Clare's world, though; however deep his concern with his Cumbrian roots, it must have been broadened at Wadham. O'Rourke feels that writing does not betray one's class, but is a duty, to 'give back' what was given by education. A point Croft overlooked is that academics today understand working people's problems when they study them. You could not want more discerning workers' poetry than the 'Bagpipe Music' of Louis MacNeice (Marlborough, Merton). Radio 3's Saturday evening Studio Three play really was experimental this week; Steve May's Testosterone I Sing was set simultaneously on the walls of Troy and on some English village cricket-ground. The events at each place have much in common. Among the Greeks, there is a contest between Ajax and Odysseus for Achilles' armour, and on the cricket-ground there is a dispute about whether Sulk or Breeze shall open the bowling. There is most fun among the Greeks, where Odysseus and his mates spy on Ajax's 'unspeakable' treatment of goats, after a vision of Pallas has questioned his marriage to ugly Tecmesa. Cricketers are content with more usual sexual encouragement. Finally the Chorus, serving both parties, calls for the erection of a memorial to all who take either sport or war too seriously. A just conclusion indeed, and amusing if not too serious comment. Richard Wortley directed.</p>

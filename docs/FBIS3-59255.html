With  President Clinton's election in the United States, the policy  stand that advocates active government intervention in the  economy is on the ascendent, replacing the 1980's laissez-faire  as advocated by former British Prime Minister Thatcher and  former US President Reagan.  <H3>  I. Emphasize Stimulating Economic Growth; Besides Monetary  Policies, Attention Is Focused on Fiscal Policies, Especially  Direct Government Investments </H3>   It began in the United States, Canada, and Britain and was  followed by Japan and Germany -- nations have gone into economic  recession since entering the 1990's. To stimulate economic  recovery, many have lowered the interest rates again and again.  For example, in the United States, the Federal Reserve has  lowered the federal fund and discount rates 17 times between  1990 and 1992. The federal fund rate has dropped from 10 percent  to 3.25 percent and the discount rate has fallen to 3 percent,  the lowest in 27 years. Even Germany, which has always made  controlling inflation its primary economic goal, has been under  pressure from other nations and has lowered its interest rates  six times since last September, and at the end of July, its  discount rate had dropped to 6.75 percent and its collateralized  loan rates had fallen to 7.75 percent. However, because of the  1980's monetary overexpansion, enterprises and individuals in  the West are busy paying off old debts now that interest rates  are down and are not increasing investment or spending, and  therefore this monetary policy has not done much to stimulate  the economy. For this reason, the United States, Europe, and  Japan are seeking help from fiscal measures and increasing  government spending to promote economic growth. Japan took the  lead last August in announcing a 10.7 trillion yen ($86 billion)  government spending plan. This April, it further proposed an  unprecedented 13.2 trillion yen ($117 billion) package to combat  recession: One-half of the money will be invested in the  construction of public facilities. The European Community  ratified an economic revitalization plan worth 42 billion in  Eurocurrency at a summit meeting in Edinburgh last year and at  the financial and economic ministers meeting this April, and in  the summit meeting held in Copenhagen this June, they decided to  add another 3 billion Eurocurrency's worth of investments.  Primarily, they intend to increase government spending on  infrastructure, encourage private investments, and help medium  and small enterprises. To help the U.S. economy get out of the  economic doldrums of the last several years, upon taking office,  President Clinton unveiled a plan to use government investments  to stimulate economic growth. The short-term measures include  government investments of $28.3 billion this and next year. The  money will be spent on the construction of public facilities,  extending unemployment insurance, creating jobs, and providing  tax credits to businesses. Although the Congress has only  approved a very small portion of that plan, the plan itself is  an indication that when it comes to "Clintonomics," the  government will have a bigger role.    Using government investments to stimulate economic growth is  not a new theory or political stand. If we look at the history  of development of this century's Western economic theories and  economic policies, we will find that the period before the  crisis of the 1930's was dominated by Marshall's neoclassical  theory of free market economy. The great depression of the  1930's, a crisis of unprecedented depth, protraction, and scale,  pronounced the bankruptcy of laissez-faire's claim that market  mechanisms could achieve full employment and stability.  Keynesianism which emphasized state interventions gradually  swept the West and became the main theoretical basis for  economic policies in many countries. Keynesian theory on  controlling effective demand led to widespread state  interventions, resulting in "big government, big spending, high  taxes, and expensive welfare." Although it helped the Western  developed nations achieve a high rate of economic growth after  the War and through the 1960's, by the mid-1970's, its defects  became increasingly obvious, manifesting themselves in the  phenomenon of "stagflation," a condition of prolonged economic  stagnation accompanied by runaway inflation. The late 1970's and  early 1980's marked the rise of a new kind of laissez-faire in  the form of monetarism as advocated by British Prime Minister  Thatcher and in the supply-side economics which former U.S.  President Reagan firmly believed in. "Thatcherism" and  "Reaganomics" temporarily halted the stagflation in the West and  helped sustain a fairly long period of slow growth, but they  also left behind the ill consequences of big deficits, large  debts, and high unemployment rate. Eventually in the early  1990's, another serious post-war economic recession erupted,  again putting the theories of laissez-faire in jeopardy. The  Bush administration, which inherited "Reaganomics," had no  remedies and eventually lost the election. With the Democrats in  the White House, the "anticlassical" school of Western economics  is now on center stage. Of course, "Clintonomics" is not a  complete revival of Keynesianism, and Clinton himself said that  he has chosen a "third road" between Keynesianism and  laissez-faire: While increasing government intervention, he  wants to streamline government and reform the welfare system to  cut budget deficits. "Clintonomics" in fact represents a new  direction in today's Western economic policies, that is,  Keynesianism is dead, and laissez-faire has gone through  its rise and fall. Efforts must be made to combine the two to  develop a new kind of economic theory and create new  mechanisms.  <H3>  II. Putting Industrial Policy on the Government's Policy  Agenda </H3>   Industrial policy is the policy a government formulates to  directly interfere in the development of some industries as a  way to supplement the market's inadequate role. In Europe and  the United States, because they believe in a relatively free  economy, unless national security is threatened, they generally  do not advocate government interference in industrial  development. They believe that the government's choice of  industries is often influenced by political interests while the  rise and fall of industries should be determined by the market.  Although some European countries and the United States have at  times adopted policies to help certain industries, they have  mostly been in the form of assistance and not direct promotion,  and they have never been systematic. Since the late 1980's, the  end of the Cold War has made economic competition, especially  competition in science and technology, the focal point of  international relationships. Amid the intense competition,  Japan, which has a clear industrial policy, has seized the upper  hand, and increasingly European and American industries are  unable to compete. This is demonstrated by the large trade  deficits against Japan and the fact that they are gradually  losing ground to Japanese advanced technologies. In 1992, the  United State ran up nearly $50 billion in trade deficits against  Japan, which accounted for more than half of its foreign trade  deficits. The European Community also has more than $30 billion  in trade deficits against Japan. Faced with Japan's overwhelming  offensive, and upon studying the Japanese government's success  with the development of its automobile, electronics, and  computer industries, advocates of European and U.S. industrial  policies believe that the "market economy by itself cannot  nurture industries deemed vital to the national economy, and  therefore the government must intervene." To win in future  economic competition and come out ahead in international  competition, European and American governments have formulated  important industrial development policies and plans, the most  important of which are:    1. Setting up specialized government agencies to lead  and coordinate national scientific research work. U.S.  President Clinton has already proposed the setting up of a  federal science, engineering, and technology coordination  committee to plan government-funded R&amp;D projects. The  committee  will be headed by the President's science and technology adviser  and chairman of the White House Science and Technology Policy  Office. The European Community Committee proposed a new set of  scientific research guiding principles in March of this year  which suggested setting up a technical assessment agency  responsible for coordinating regional, national, and European  Community tasks to strengthen the integration of their  scientific and technical work.    2. Putting the emphasis on high-tech industries.  With the constant development of science and technology, what  determines the comparative advantage of a nation in terms of its  ability to compete is no longer natural resources but scientific  and technological resources. Therefore, a policy on science and  technology has become the core of every nation's industrial  policy. U.S.President Clinton pointed out again and again that  "the key to a nation's economic success lies in taking the lead  in technological invention and commercialization." Soon after he  took office, he went to the Silicon Valley and announced that  the government will try to form a partnership with industries to  build more companies like those in the Silicon Valley which will  introduce even more new technologies to help the United States  maintain its lead. He also proposed specific plans to support  the computer and telecommunications and others in the  information industry and develop high-speed trains and a new  generation of automobiles. In the Fourth General Research and  Development Plan (1994-1998) proposed by the European Community  in April of this year, scientific research outlay was increased  to 13.3 billion in Eurocurrency, which more than doubled that  under the Third Plan. Specifically, three-quarters of the funds  will be spent on information and telecommunications  technologies, industrial technologies, environmental science,  life science, and energy industry.    3. Increasing the propagation and application of the  results of R&amp;D. Superiority in basic science and technology  research is only potential ability to compete. To achieve real  capability, the results of advanced science and technologies  must find commercial applications. Therefore, while science and  technology policy is the focal point of any industrial policy,  the commercialization of the results of R&amp;D is the focal  point  of any science and technology policy. The major policies most  nations have adopted today are: A) Making R&amp;D projects more  practical. The United States has identified that the focus of  federal R&amp;D projects is on new technologies of significance  to  economic growth and has removed the word "Defense" from DARPA  [Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency], changing it to  ARPA, to put the emphasis on civilian technology research. The  European Community meanwhile is prepared to allocate 600 million  in Eurocurrency over the next few years to fund the assessment,  development, and application of R&amp;D results. B) Increasing  the  exchange of information between government and civilians. The  United States will open up its national laboratories to  civilians and is going to raise $80 billion before 1997 to set  up an information network covering the nation's 50 states, so as  to make sure that the government can play a more effective role  in coordinating the propagation of information nationwide and in  transferring the results of R&amp;D. C) Providing financial and  material support to the development of civilian R&amp;D  institutions. The United States has estimated that this step  will cost the government an additional $6 billion over the next  4 years. To guide civilian enterprises in the development and  utilization of advanced technologies, the U.S.government has  also decided to set up a "Critical Technologies Research  Institute" to turn the results of some R&amp;D projects, such as  numerically controlled machine tools and robotics, into products  that can compete internationally within the next two to three  years.    4. Emphasizing education and training. To improve  the workers' technical skills so as to increase enterprise  productivity and competitiveness, Europe and the United States  have implemented educational reform and have raised the level of  basic knowledge while adopting various measures to enhance the  workers' professional training. In the EC's Fourth Science and  Research Development Plan, for the first time, the importance of  education and training was stressed, and 785 million in  Eurocurrency was allocated to education. "Clintonomics" even  emphasizes "putting people first." The federal government plans  to spend $60 billion in the next four years on raising  educational standards and training workers. In his new science  and technology policy, President Clinton proposed implementing  an education and training program to make sure that all American  workers have a chance to continue their education. To make  education and training more technology-oriented, the government  will support the development of computers and telecommunications  equipment used in schools and for professional training in  enterprises.    In addition, they have adopted active foreign trade policies  to create an environment of "fair" competition, and internally  they have amended their antitrust laws to encourage enterprises  to join forces to meet foreign competition.  <H3>  III. Trade Management Has Become the Theme of the West's  Trade Policies </H3>   As the Western nations gradually put their industrial  policies into effect, they also make drastic changes in their  trade policies. Since the end of the War, the world trade system  has been dominated by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  [GATT] whose purpose is to advance free trade. Despite the  constant trade conflicts among nations, up through the Bush  administration, free trade has been the main theme. Since  President Clinton took office, however, he has pursued a more  aggressive trade policy than his predecessors. He fights trade  protectionism on the one hand and emphasizes fair trade on the  other hand. Analysts believe that the developed nations,  led by the United States, are changing their trade policies from  free trade to managed trade. Its characteristics are:    1. More trade conflicts resulting from efforts to  capture "fair" trade opportunities. Unlike protectionism's  building of barriers to keep out foreign competition or the  policy of non-intervention under laissez-faire, managed trade  advocates highly competitive international trade, that is, it  supports opening up the markets but meanwhile it seeks "fair"  trade opportunities and emphasizes active government  participation. Accordingly, while the Western governments  continue to attach importance to mechanisms of multilateral  cooperation, they often adopt unilateral measures of sanctions  and retaliation. As soon as Clinton took office, he immediately  adopted an aggressive trade policy. On 27 January, the Commerce  Department announced the imposition of punitive tariffs on steel  materials imported from 19 countries including those in Europe  and Japan. Subsequently, it put pressure on Europe and Japan  regarding government contracts and the aerospace,  semi-conductor, and automobile industries and so on. At a  US-Japan summit meeting, President Clinton directly asked Japan  to formulate specific goals to open up its markets. Meanwhile,  Europe and Japan have been waging a tit-for-tat battle. On 28  May, the United States announced a ban on several EC companies  from bidding on U.S.federal government projects. In retaliation,  at the 12 nation EC foreign minister meeting held on 8 June,  U.S. companies were banned from bidding on EC member nation  projects. Japan has also openly criticized the United States,  saying that "using managed trade measures and unilateral threats  will not resolve its trade balance problems." All these are  attributable to the fact that since the end of the Cold War,  economic security has become the focal point of foreign  relations for all nations. President Clinton, who has made  revitalizing the U.S.economy his primary administrative goal,  has put opening up foreign markets as his foreign policy goal.  His foreign policy clearly puts economics above all else. In a  series of meetings with heads of states since he took office,  Clinton has without exception put economic and trade issues  first. Because of uneven economic and trade development, and  adding the effects of the recession, it is expected that  economic and trade conflicts among the United States, Europe,  and Japan will further intensify.    2. More non-tariff trade barriers. Under GATT,  nations have gradually lowered their tariffs. Today, the  developed nations are imposing an average of 5 percent tariff on  manufactured goods, and the developing nations' average tariff  is only around 15 percent. For this reason, non-tariff trade  barriers are becoming increasingly important, and governments  too are playing an increasingly bigger role. Non-tariff barriers  fall into five main categories. Besides the usual voluntary  export limits, import quotas, and price controls, there are  quasi tariff measures and administrative measures. The former  measures refers to taxes imposed for the purpose of raising the  price of imports. They include tariff quotas and seasonal  tariffs. The latter refers to administrative measures to control  the import of sensitive commodities. They primarily include the  checking and monitoring of import prices and quantity and  antidumping and antisubsidy measures, and specifically  antidumping measures are most common. Based on GATT statistics,  from July 1989 to June 1990, there were 96 antidumping cases in  the international markets, but between January 1991 to June  1992, there were 237 cases. Some experts believe that  antidumping has become a hidden EC industrial policy. Frequent  antidumping activities have jeopardized GATT's success in  reducing tariffs. It is estimate that if we add the antidumping  tax, the average U.S.tariff on manufactured goods is 23 percent  and not the nominal 6 percent.    3. The formation of regional economic blocs increases  bilateral and regional cooperation. With the inauguration  of the unified European market, the signing of NAFTA, and the  emergence of economic cooperation mechanisms at different levels  throughout Asia, the world economy is gradually separated into  three major economic blocs comprised of America, Europe, and  Asia. Because these three economic blocs control the absolute  majority of world trade, regional economic blocs will dominate  the development of trade policies of all nations. Currently,  there is no consensus on what effects regional economic blocs  will have on the world economy and on world trade, but one point  is certain: The development of regional economic blocs will  cause nations' trade policies to change from the kind of  multilateralism advocated by GATT to those extending mutual  benefits on a bilateral or regional basis. Most developing  nations which have been excluded from the three major blocs will  be at a disadvantage.    4. The scope of commodity management widens. With  the constant improvement in the mix of products being traded,  more and more products are put under trade management. European  antidumping measures which included products such as ethanol,  cement, and aspirin have expanded to cover forklifts and  computers. The United State's agricultural product, automobile,  steel, and semi-conductor industries are constantly putting  pressure on the government for protection. In the 1990's,  managed products not only will include labor intensive products  and agricultural products but will also include labor and  services and high tech products. The developed nations will  especially stress protection of intellectual property rights.  The developing nations will face increasingly greater pressure.</p>

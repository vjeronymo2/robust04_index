			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow tumbles as long bond yield climbs Wall Street US share prices tumbled yesterday as the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond breached the 8.00 per cent mark and held firm, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 36.00 lower at 3,855.30, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 4.06 at 460.83. On the NYSE, declining issues led advances by more than two to one, on moderate volume of 282m shares. Other leading indices were also weaker. The Nasdaq composite was off 4.17 at 761.21 and the American SE composite was down 2.62 at 453.73. There was no fresh economic news released during the morning, allowing stocks to open on a positive note. Sentiment was bolstered by news of a better-than-expected third-quarter performance by Caterpillar, a bellwether cyclical issue. The stock closed up Dollars 2 at Dollars 58 1/4 , but the early optimism inspired by the company had petered out by mid-morning as investors turned their attention to developments in the bond market. Before midday, stocks reversed course as the yield on the benchmark long bond climbed up to above 8.00 per cent, a level at which it had flirted for the past fortnight. When there was no retrenchment during the afternoon, the damage to share prices grew worse. The action in both markets reflected the weakened value of the dollar and heightened expectations of an early boost in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve. Among the Dow components, Alcoa dropped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 86 1/4 , IBM lost Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 73 and Eastman Kodak shed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 47 7/8. In transport, Airborne Freight said its earnings had fallen to 38 cents a share, from 53 cents a year earlier. The stock plunged 24 per cent to Dollars 19 1/8 on the news. Elsewhere, USAir was marked down Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 4 1/4 on disappointing results, while AMR, parent of American Airlines, shed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 5 3/8. Exxon was one of four oil groups reporting third-quarter results. The company exceeded analysts' forecasts by posting net income of 92 cent a share, but the stock dipped Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 59 1/2.</p>

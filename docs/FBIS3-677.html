			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and the ANC [African  National Congress] have said after a third round of talks in  Johannesburg that agreement could be reached soon on  international mediation to end the constitutional deadlock.  Delegates of the two parties will now report back to their  principals.    The talks have taken place despite a statement by  [Afrikaner]  Volksfront [National Front] co-leader Constand Viljoen that the  Freedom Alliance is suspending negotiations. IFP National  Chairman Frank Mdlalose said his party was holding talks with  the ANC apart from the rest of the Freedom Alliance.    IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said earlier in Durban that  he would end his opposition to the interim constitution if  mediation proved his stance wrong.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] There is increasing evidence that the ETA [Basque  Fatherland and Liberty] could be operating in Mexico. New  Spanish Justice Minister Juan Alberto Belloch's priority is to  eliminate ETA terrorism. As for the ETA's presence in Mexico,  the minister said it does exist and that its members could be  active.    [Begin recording] Belloch: We have suspicions. We  and the Mexican authorities have nothing more than suspicions.  We suspect that some of them could be active ETA militants.    Unidentified reporter: What do you mean when you  say active ETA militants?    Belloch: They are persons who have connections  with the criminal organization and are potentially capable of  providing economic support and could even cooperate with other  terrorist groups, both in Mexico and Latin America. They could  be planning to use Mexico as a springboard. The importance of  Mexico in this regard is evident and they could be tempted to  use Mexico as they did France. They may want to create an  operations base with alliances with other forms of terrorism,  adversely affecting both Mexico and other countries of Central  America and Latin America. [end recording]    He added that he wants to visit Mexico to meet with his  Mexican counterpart and exchange viewpoints.    [Begin Belloch recording] There is great interest in  visiting  your country. I would like to have a relationship similar to  the one we currently have with France in the analysis of this  topic. I believe it is appropriate to take preventive actions  instead of waiting for them to consolidate a stable base in  Mexico, which Spain and Mexico both are evidently not interested  in. [end recording]    Belloch said it is not possible for the ETA to carry out  attacks in Mexico today, but if the problem is not dealt with  now, it could do so in the future.    The truth is that since last week, when Spanish Justice  Minister Juan Alberto Belloch traveled to Paris to meet with his  French counterpart, Charles Pasqua [name as heard], the efforts  to fight terrorism have been greatly intensified even though  they had reached a high level in the past few years, especially  since 1984. In the last few days heavy blows have been dealt to  the ETA with new arrests.</p>

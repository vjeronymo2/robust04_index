			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRUG VIOLATORS FACE RENT-SUBSIDY LOSS  </P> <P> Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp, fulfilling his spring pledge  to act to remove people associated with drugs from government-supported  housing, announced Friday that HUD will extend its drug-related eviction policy  to affect recipients of low-income rent subsidies.  </P> <P> Under the new regulation, public housing authorities will be directed to take  action against tenants "involved in the felonious manufacture, sale,  distribution or use of illegal drugs, or any other felonious criminal  activity," he said.  </P> <P> Unlike Kemp's earlier efforts to evict drug users and dealers from housing  projects, the plan to revoke what are commonly known as Section 8 rent  subsidies allows for tenants to receive a hearing on the proposed termination.  </P> <P> The new measure differs also from the public housing eviction process by  allowing "uninvolved family members" to remain in the subsidized unit where  drug activity is alleged to have taken place.  </P> <P> "I am determined that federal taxpayers will not be required to subsidize the  rent of drug dealers and users or violent criminals," Kemp said Friday. "The  only housing subsidies for felons should be provided by local jails and state  and federal prisons."  </P></p>

			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / International Company News: Caisse des Depots head resigns MR Robert Lion yesterday resigned as chairman of the Caisse des Depots et Consignations, the state-controlled bank which is France's largest and probably most powerful investment institution. The French cabinet will decide upon the successor to Mr Lion, 58, a close associate of President Francois Mitterrand, at a forthcoming meeting. Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, head of the French Treasury, and Mr Philippe Lagayette, deputy governor of the Bank of France, have been mooted as likely candidates. Mr Lion, a controversial figure in the French financial sector, announced his resignation yesterday at an executive committee meeting. However, he told President Mitterrand last June of his plans to leave. The chairmanship of the Caisse is one of the most sought-after posts in French finance. The incumbent controls a formidable institution and is virtually unassailable given that the position runs for an indeterminate period. Until his arrival the Caisse, which manages the state savings system and had funds of FFr1,560bn (Dollars 289.42bn) last year, had a relatively low profile. Mr Lion has pursued a more dynamic policy of private sector investment. He hit the headlines in 1988 with his bid for Societe Generale, the recently privatised bank. The bid flopped, thereby unleashing a storm of criticism from Mr Lion's detractors and renewed calls to reduce the Caisse's power by separating its savings activities from its private sector role.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News at Ten" program] </F>   [Text] Special Middle East peace coordinator Dennis Ross  left Amman tonight after talks on the peace process, bilateral  ties, and the siege of al-'Aqabah.    Ross met earlier tonight with Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam  al-Majali, which was followed by bilateral talks between the  Jordanian and U.S. delegations.    Before leaving Amman, Ross said his talks were good and  businesslike, and that he expects the peace talks to resume soon.    Speaking to reporters at Amman airport, Information Minister  Jawad al-'Anani said tonight's talks also covered the resumption  of Jordanian-Israeli bilateral talks in Washington, as well as  economic ties.    [Begin recording] [Al-'Anani] We had very good, serious, and  businesslike discussions today. We covered a range of topics.  Mr. Ross was kind enough to give us an update on the  developments in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. We also  dealt with the issue of bilateral issues, like sanctions in  al-'Aqabah, and also our economic bilateral relations. Well, we  think that some progress is going to take place very soon, and  we are going to see tangible results. We also had a discussion  of how to proceed next on the negotiations, and how to  invigorate the Jordanian-Israeli track when we meet in  Washington, hopefully in April.    [Unidentified reporter] I would like to ask about the  Israelis and Palestinians. They said that they agreed on  international armed presence in Hebron, Gaza, and Jericho. They  said that the United States and Norway agreed to participate in  this. Could you elaborate?    [Ross] Well, the discussions that they had covered a number  of areas, including trying to reach understandings on  security-related issues, and also looking at how one can move  rapidly to conclude the negotiations and move towards an  implementation. I am not going to go into the specifics of what  they are working on right now, because I think their discussions  are ongoing.    [Reporter] I would like to ask you about the siege of  al-'Aqabah. It is affecting Jordan tremendously. Are you  going, and do you have any plans to lift the embargo, when?    [Ross] Well, we had a discussion. As the minister said, we  had a discussion on that. We have been exchanging views on  that. And we are going to be working on that as best we can.  [end recording]</p>

[passage omitted]    According to information gathered at the VIP lounge of the  airport, 'Arafat's visit comes in the framework of inter-Arab  consultation following the recent developments of events in the  occupied territories in the wake of the massacre of Palestinians  performing prayers at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in al-Khalil  [Hebron].    Directly after seeing State President Liamine Zeroual, Mr  'Arafat will leave Algeria, and it is expected that he will be  making a statement in the VIP lounge dealing with the latest  developments in the occupied territories and their effects on  the negotiations process. It will also deal with the PLO's  reaction to the American and French proposals, to the measures  taken by the Israeli administration concerning the Palestinian  demand that Israeli settlers be disarmed, and to the request for  international protection of the Palestinians in the occupied  territories.

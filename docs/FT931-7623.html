			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Funding worry hits ICI CONCERN over the threat of a huge rights issue sent ICI shares plunging yesterday morning and at first unsettled the rest of the stock market. Analysts predicted a turbulent few days ahead for ICI shares prior to the group's results meeting on Thursday where a decision has been promised over the fate of the proposed demerger. Should the move get the go-ahead, the market believes it is likely to be accompanied by a cash-raising offer with speculation in the press that it could be a Pounds 1bn rights issue. There were other suggestions, including a bond issue, as a way of raising the money. Whatever the fund-raising route, ICI shares responded badly to the speculation. The shares slumped 42 to 1076p, although turnover was a moderate 3m. NatWest strong The best individual performance from a generally strong bank sector came from National Westminster (NatWest), scheduled to announce preliminary results this morning. 'The market is looking for some good news from NatWest,' said one leading marketmaker. NatWest shares closed 14 higher at 459p, a rise of 2.92 per cent, against a 1.8 per cent jump in the FT Actuaries Banks Index and a marginal decline in the Footsie 100 index. Turnover in NatWest was a hefty 5.9m shares, well above usual levels of activity. The shares' outperformance came as the market finally disregarded recent suggestions of a heavy rights issue, and instead responded favourably to talk that fund raising via a convertible bond issue could be on the cards. There was also a hint that the bank may well write back provisions previously made. Estimates of NatWest pre-tax profits ranged from Pounds 375m to Pounds 500m, against last year's Pounds 110m. Other banks performed well, with renewed takeover speculation driving TSB up 5 1/2 to 174p on 6.2m traded. Lloyds, one of the market's favourite to launch a takeover bid for TSB, rose 9 to 520p. Barclays, due to announce preliminary numbers on March 4, added 7 to 449p. HSBC, helped again by a good showing by the Hong Kong market, rose 6 to 587p. Abbey National, still boosted by recent broker buy recommendations, climbed 8 to 385p. Hammerson hints The property sector perked up as bid talk was heard around Hammerson, sending the shares smartly forward. Fellow property concern British Land was said to be eyeing the group, with weekend press reports suggesting that an approach had been made through Hammerson's largest shareholder, Standard Life. This had been reportedly rebuffed, but analysts suggested that British Land may have only been temporarily put off. There were other rumours that the focus on Hammerson may have revived US interest in the stock which surfaced in December and boosted the shares. Mr Graham Stanley at NatWest Securities was sceptical over a British Land bid. 'While Hammerson's net asset value is forecast to decline from Pounds 6.37 to Pounds 4.74 this year, and the shares might look cheap, the cash flow implications of the bid at this level have little appeal,' he said. Hammerson A shares jumped 10 to 304p. Elsewhere, Land Securities added 11 to 485p. UBS Phillips and Drew moved from a sell to a hold but retained its negative long-term stance on the stock. MEPC gained 7 to 377p. Rights success There was large turnover in Burton and Asda as the remainder of their rights issues were placed. The placing of the rump of the Asda issue was understood to have been done at 64p by broker Morgan Grenfell, followed by a 27m placing by Cazenove in Burton at 74p. Asda's issue was just over 94 per cent subscribed. Its 3-for-10 at 53p raised Pounds 347m. The shares closed one quarter of a penny off at 64p. Burton's received over 90 per cent acceptances for its 1-for-4 issue raising Pounds 163m. The shares lost 1 1/2 to 75 1/2 p. Welsh Water's Pounds 56m acquisition of Acer Group, the engineering consultants, was well received by the market where Welsh Water shares rose 7 to 519p. Other water stocks moved ahead strongly, responding, according to dealers, to some big buying via yesterday programme trade activity. Anglian jumped 9 to 519p, North West 5 to 497p, Thames 7 to 519p and Yorkshire 8 to 558p. News of Pounds 131m-worth of losses from currency speculation carried out by Royal Dutch/Shell's 50 per cent owned Showa Shell Sekiyu associate, triggered a flurry of selling pressure in Shell stock which retreated to close 6 off at 575p. The selling took place during hectic dealings which saw 5.8m Shell traded. One analyst described the losses as 'a major irritation but not a fundamental problem; the market didn't like this news one bit and it provided some of the sceptics with a good excuse to sell the stock and lock in good profits.' BP, on the other hand, drew strength from the good performance of crude oil prices, the shares settling 4 1/2 ahead at 270p. Specialists ascribed the rise in the share price to another bout of strong buying from US investors; 'I wouldn't be surprised to see the US content of BP shares rising to 24 per cent in the very near future,' said one analyst. Brent crude moved up over 30 cents a barrel to Dollars 18.60, the highest level since before the latest Opec meeting in Vienna. Detailed news on the make up of production cuts in said to be imminent. Lasmo eased 3 to 176p with aggressive activity in the shares attributed to programme trade business rather than speculative business. Continuing speculation that British Airways may soon be forced to have a rights issue weakened the shares and they gave up 4 to 284p. Shares in Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel were wanted and they moved 17 ahead to 497p, on hopes that its long running dispute with tunnel constructor TML may be nearing a settlement. Pipes and fittings maker Victaulic was boosted by favourable weekend press comment. The shares closed 10 up at 364p. Demand was also seen for VSEL and the shares also moved 10 ahead to 600p. Profit-taking halted the recent advance of GKN leaving the shares 5 lighter at 475p, while it was continued fears that a leading customer would soon announce a cancellation of orders that left TI Group 6 lighter at 291p. British Aerospace shed a penny to 261p, ahead of figures tomorrow. A loss of around Pounds 1bn is predicted for the year to December 1992. Shares in engineering company Wheway, which last week became the subject of a Pounds 14.3m hostile bid from investment group McLeod Russel Holdings, hardened a penny to 10 1/4 p, after it was revealed that McLeod had raised its stake in the bid target from 4 to 7 per cent. A buy recommendation from NatWest Markets helped Vinten Group jump 23 to 354p. Hints of imminent news of an expected merger involving Union Discount saw the latter's shares move up 6 to 115p. Cater Allen, which already held a disclosable stake in Unions, jumped 19 to 459p. Gerrard &amp; National raced up 10 to 424p. Royal Insurance attracted keen two-way interest, eventually settling 3 1/2 off at 287 1/2 p ahead of Thursday's preliminary figures which are expected to reveal sharply reduced losses of around Pounds 115m and a dividend total of 5p. Insurance broker Sedgwick managed a minor gain at 170p in front of this morning's preliminary numbers which should see profits in the region of Pounds 55m, down from last time's Pounds 82.4m and a halved dividend. The resignation of Mr Neil Redding, a director of Southern Business Group, following a newspaper article, saw the latter's shares slide 17 to 113p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992/93 NEW HIGHS (141).

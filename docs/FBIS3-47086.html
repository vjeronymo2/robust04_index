			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 8 KYODO -- Former Construction  Minister Kishiro Nakamura, who allegedly received a payment in  1992 from major construction firm Kajima Corp., played a key  role in revising penalties in bid-rigging cases, informed  sources said Saturday [8 January].    The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) proposed in December 1991 to  raise the maximum criminal fine from 5 million yen to more than  100 million yen against firms which violated the Antimonopoly  Law by bid-rigging, the sources said. The FTC was planning the  revision following U.S. criticism of Japan's bidding system in  the Structural Impediments Initiative talks.    Nakamura, then deputy chairman of a panel on the  Antimonopoly  Law in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), and other LDP  legislators, who had close links to the construction industry,  strongly opposed the FTC's plan.    Nakamura allegedly received an undeclared donation of 10  million yen in mid-January 1992 from then Kajima Vice President  Shinji Kiyoyama.    The LDP legislators, including Nakamura, stopped resistance  to the plan in February 1992, the sources said.    The FTC submitted its revision plan on the law raising the  maximum penalty to 100 million yen in March 1992 and the LDP  panel accepted the plan.    A senior member of the LDP panel said the FTC set the amount  after frequent contact with Nakamura, and another member said  disgraced LDP kingpin Shin Kanemaru directed the legislators to  fix the amount at 100 million yen.    Meanwhile, the FTC was investigating a bid-rigging scandal  involving public projects in Saitama Prefecture but in May 1992  the commission announced it would not file a criminal complaint  and ordered 66 companies to stop alleged unfair business  practices.    A local executive of Kajima, one of Japan's three largest  general contractors, reportedly served as head of a "club" of  the 66 construction companies involved in bid-rigging in the  prefecture.    Industry sources said there was a possibility that the FTC  gave up filing criminal complaints in exchange for fixing the  maximum fine at 100 million yen. FTC sources deny such a deal.    Kiyoyama and other top Kajima executives were arrested last  year over the giving of bribes to then Sendai Mayor Toru Ishii  and Ibaraki Gov. Fujio Takeuchi.</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Government proposes law to protect privacy A NEW LAW giving people in England, Wales and Scotland the right to sue for damages up to Pounds 10,000 for invasion of privacy was proposed yesterday by the government. A green paper on infringement of privacy says the right to privacy should now be recognised in law. It proposes a civil remedy allowing an individual to sue for any invasion of privacy that causes substantial distress. Privacy would not be defined precisely in law but would cover a person's health, personal communications and family and personal relationships. A range of defences would be available to the media, banks, credit agencies, government bodies and others accused of infringing privacy. Those defences would include consent, lawful authority, absolute and qualified privilege - as in defamation cases - and public interest. The government does not intend to make legal aid available for privacy cases. Remedies would include damages up to a maximum of Pounds 10,000 and injunctions to prevent publication of material that would result in an infringement of privacy. Launching the green paper yesterday, Lord Mackay, the lord chancellor, said that after years of cross-party study 'the time has come to ensure that the law protects the privacy of everyone'. The proposals had a mixed response from the newspaper industry, to which they are primarily addressed. Mr Andrew Neil, editor of The Sunday Times, attacked them as 'very dangerous proposals' that would 'protect the privacy of politicians but neutralise robust journalism'. They could turn out to be a 'busybodies' charter'. Government aims to slam door on invasions of privacy, Page 8 Editorial Comment, Page 19</p>

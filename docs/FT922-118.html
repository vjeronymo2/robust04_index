			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London COCOA prices moved strongly ahead again. Dealers attributed the advance mainly to a technical correction after last week's slump to the lowest levels since the mid-1970s, and said they would use any extended rallies as a chance to sell. Some technical analysts said September cocoa could rally up to Pounds 580 or Pounds 590 a tonne, but the threat of fresh supply still overhangs the market. SILVER prices fell on the London bullion market after Comex opened below the crucial Dollars 4 a troy ounce level and the dollar came in for more pressure on the foreign exchange markets. 'People are apprehensive that the US economic recovery might not be as robust as they'd thought,' one dealer said. A fall in US new home sales for May compounded fears. Traders said they were surprised GOLD had not performed better with the dollar so weak. Nymex PLATINUM futures shot higher in late trading as the market reacted to the base metals rally and the huge strike in South Africa, the world's biggest producer, over the Boipatong massacre. In Chicago SOYABEAN prices were well down at midsession on expectations of rain in the Midwest later this week. Compiled from Reuters</p>

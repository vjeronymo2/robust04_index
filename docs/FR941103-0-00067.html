			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Act and EPA's I/M rule, the SIP must include a detailed description of the on-road testing program required in enhanced I/M areas, including the types of testing, test limits and criteria, the number of vehicles (the percentage of the fleet) to be tested, the number of employees to be dedicated to the on-road testing effort, the methods for collecting, analyzing, utilizing, and reporting the results of on-road testing and, the portion of the program budget to be dedicated to on-road testing. Also, the SIP must include the legal authority necessary to implement the on-road testing program, including the authority to enforce off-cycle inspection and repair requirements. In addition, emission reduction credit for on-road testing programs can only be granted for a program designed to obtain significant emission reductions over and above those predicted to be achieved by other aspects of the I/M program. The SIP needs to include technical support for the claimed additional emission reductions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The I/M SIP submitted on July 21, 1994 includes a detailed description of its on-road testing program. The testing program will include 0.5% of the subject vehicles. Vehicles with emission readings measured by remote sensing devices exceeding limits defined in the revised rules will be required to obtain an out-of-cycle inspection at a vehicle emission inspection facility. This program will be staffed by the DEP. Data collection and reporting will be done using the general record-keeping and reporting provisions of the I/M program. The legal authority for this program is contained in the Maine I/M rule and the authorizing legislation. The State did not include additional modeling credit for this portion of the program as part of the modeling used to demonstrate that EPA's performance standard was met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> T. Concluding Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A more detailed analysis of the State's submittal and how it meets the federal requirements is contained in the EPA's technical support document prepared for this action. The TSD is available from the EPA New England Regional office listed above. The criteria used to review the submitted SIP revision are based on the requirements set forth in Section 182 of the CAA and in the federal I/M regulations. Based on these requirements, EPA developed a detailed I/M approvability checklist to be used nationally to determine if I/M programs meet the requirements of the CAA and the federal I/M rule. The checklist states the federal requirements, referenced by section of the rule, whether or not the Maine program meets such requirements, and where in the Maine SIP submittal the requirements are met. This checklist, the CAA, and the federal I/M regulation formed the basis for EPA's technical review. EPA has reviewed the Maine I/M SIP revision submitted to the EPA using the criteria stated above. The Maine regulations and accompanying materials contained in the SIP submittals from the State represent an acceptable plan to comply with the I/M requirements and meet all the criteria required for EPA to conditionally approve the SIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Kim Ho-sam: "The United States Must Stop the </F> Maneuver To Deploy the Patriot Missiles"]    [Text] The U.S. imperialists' maneuver to provoke a nuclear  war in South Korea is being taken to a very grave stage.  According to a report, the first Patriot missile unit,  consisting of 48 missiles and some 800 soldiers, will arrive in  South Korea sometime this week and will be deployed in  accordance with U.S. Defense Department orders.    According to another report, the second Patriot missile unit  will soon be dispatched to the Korean peninsula. As it has  already been reported, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry will make a  junket to South Korea this week and will hold discussions with  the South Korean puppet defense minister on the situation on the  Korean peninsula. This shows that the situation on the Korean  peninsula is heading all the more toward the brink of war.    As it is known, the United States and the South Korean  puppets decided to gradually deploy the Patriot missiles to  South Korea beginning in October 1994. Nevertheless, the United  States is starting to deploy them to South Korea from the middle  of this month, six months earlier than scheduled.    What does this show? This shows that the United States is  trying to provoke a nuclear war in Korea without fail by finding  fault with our nonexistent nuclear issue.    As it is known, the U.S. military is drawing up an  aggressive  war plan to bring in 600,000 aggressive forces, over 200  vessels, and over 1,600 airplanes--including two Marine Corps  divisions--from the continental U.S. within 80 days in event of  an emergency on the Korean peninsula.    The South Korean puppets are assuming a posture of attack by  even making public their plan to invade the North under the new  strategy plan 5027 which had been kept secret up until now.    We cannot but take seriously the remarks made by U.S.  Defense  Secretary Perry who openly said that the possibility of a  preemptive military strike on North Korea will not be ruled out  and that he is ready to risk a war. The U.S. Patriot missile  units are arriving in South Korea at such a time.    U.S. military officials are lecturing that the Patriot  missiles they introduced are defensive weapons to prepare  against an attack. That is merely a deceptive talk to disguise  their aggressive nature. The Patriot missiles are of an improved  type and their threat varies with the type of warheads  installed. This proves that Patriot missiles are not simply  defensive weapons but can also be used as offensive weapons to  strike the opponent.    Patriot missiles are being deployed to South Korea at a time  when the United States has moved numerous Navy carriers around  the Korean peninsula, has put them in a ready posture for  immediate deployment at any time, and is trying to conduct the  Team Spirit joint military exercise by all means. This shows  that the risk of a nuclear war in our country is approaching a  visible reality.    There is no guarantee that the United States would not  attack  us with Patriot missiles after putting the South Korean war  maniacs in the front to ignite the fuse of war. Our people  cannot but heighten an equivalent alert regarding the reinforced  commotion of military power buildup in South Korea coinciding  with the U.S. defense secretary's junket to South Korea.    If the United States continues to build up military power  indiscriminately despite our repeated warnings and chooses the  direction of a nuclear war in the end, it will sustain a staunch  punishment [tanhohan chingbol] by our people.    The aggressors will only be met with bitter defeat and  deaths.</p>

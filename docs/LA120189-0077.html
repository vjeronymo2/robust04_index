			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: PSYCHIC OUT OF SPIRITS SINCE PLAZA;  </P> <P> FORCED HER TO MOVE FROM PRIME POST  </P> <P> 'Tis is the season to be psychic. Or: Switching channels for the holidays?  </P> <P> Elizabeth Lee has been tending to the spiritual and metaphysical needs of  Horton Plaza shoppers since March, 1987.  </P> <P> She reads Tarot cards and listens to her channeling voice (an ancient mystic).  She talks of the future and the past and charges $15 to $20 per session.  </P> <P> She has had a pushcart at the top of the escalator near Mervyn's and the  Pappagallo clothing store. It's a choice spot: warm and highly visible.  </P> <P> But now Lee has been involuntarily shifted to a lonely table outside Ernie's  Tavern at the extreme southwest end of the plaza. It's chilly and semi-hidden.  </P> <P> Craig Pettitt, the plaza's general manager, says he wanted something more  festive, more mainstream consumerish for the holiday season. Lee's former spot  is now occupied by a woman selling ties.  </P> <P> Pettitt also says he has gotten complaints likening Lee's specialty to devil  worship.  </P> <P> "We've stuck with her through the years, but she just does not fit into our  holiday theme," he said. "We've gone far beyond what most commercial centers  would have done in accommodating her."  </P> <P> Lee says she has being pushed aside just when shoppers need her most: the  high-stress holiday season.  </P> <P> "My whole purpose is to help people feel better about themselves, to understand  their lives better," she said. "People need me during the holidays when all  types of conflicts arise."  </P> <P> At first, Pettitt wanted Lee to leave the plaza altogether until after New  Year's. She resisted. She found Ernie's.  </P> <P> She's one of 23 independent vendors who rent cart space. The others sell sweat  shirts, T-shirts, jewelry, crafts, etc. Lee is the only one forced to relocate.  </P> <P> She says that, despite her ability to read the future, she was surprised by the  mandatory move.  </P> <P> "Most people in the spiritual business will tell you the same thing: they can't  read for themselves," Lee said. "I was totally shocked."  </P> <P> Councilwoman-To-Be Stands Ground  </P> <P> Word from the political front:  </P> <P> * Councilwoman-elect Linda Bernhardt, who publicly burned a Building Industry  Assn. questionnaire during the campaign, has hired former BIA political  strategist Jean Andrews as a fund-raiser.  </P> <P> Bernhardt needs to retire a campaign debt. But she says her orders to Andrews  are clear: no developer money.  </P> <P> Bernhardt says her slow-growth zeal is undiminished. She has added former  Sierra Club leader Jay Powell to her City Hall staff to deal with land use.  </P> <P> * A poll done after Bishop Maher's edict shows Lucy Killea ahead of Carol  Bentley in their special state Senate race.  </P> <P> Republicans hold a registration edge in the district, but Republicans are  defecting to Killea, a Democrat, because of her pro-choice views on abortion.  </P> <P> Killea sent a mailer to Republicans this week saying she would give the Senate  a pro-choice majority for the first time. The anti-abortion movement would love  to pour money and troops into the Bentley campaign, but they have been told it  would be counterproductive.  </P> <P> * Maher has given interviews to the New York Times, USA Today, Sacramento Bee,  Associated Press, NBC, CBS, ABC, CNN, Time and Newsweek. Also, 30 Days, a  Rome-based Catholic magazine.  </P> <P> He was willing to talk to the Washington Post, Newsday, and the New York Daily  News, but his schedule and the reporters' deadlines didn't match. He turned  down the Donahue show, "Hard Copy" and the CBS "This Morning" show.  </P> <P> Father Knows the Best Punishment  </P> <P> Bail was being set recently for a young defendant in a theft case in downtown  San Diego. His lawyer said he couldn't afford bail.  </P> <P> The defendant's father, a maintenance worker, asked that the youth be released  to his custody.  </P> <P> "I'm not sure what my boy's accused of," he told the judge, "but if I find out  he's really done it, the punishment you'll give him won't be anything compared  to the punishment I'll give him."  </P> <P> The judge replied: "Maybe I should keep him in jail for his own protection."  </P> <P> The judge retreated to his chambers. He came back a few moments later and  granted the father's request.  </P></p>

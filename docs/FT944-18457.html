			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Tobacco crop profits fall in third world Tobacco farmers in developing countries could be better off growing crops such as maize, according to a report by Panos, the independent London-based research institute. The report challenges claims by the tobacco industry that the crop is profitable for the third world. It says tobacco prices have fallen by 50 per cent in real terms over the last decade, assuming annual inflation of 4 per cent. Last year, prices fell by about a third because of over-supply. They have recovered this year, but the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation says global stocks are high, at about 85 per cent of annual output, and expects prices to remain depressed. At the same time, farmers face sharply increased prices for fertilisers and pesticides. 'Falling prices plus rising costs suggest tobacco growing is a poor prospect for the South's farmers,' says the report, published to coincide with an international conference in Paris next week on tobacco and health. Over 40 developing countries export tobacco, but in only two - Malawi and Zimbabwe - does tobacco account for more than 2.2 per cent of foreign earnings, the report says. 'The role of tobacco exports in the economies of developing countries needs to be kept in proportion.' According to the International Tobacco Growers' Association, no sustainable alternative crops would achieve the same level of earnings for most tobacco farmers. The Panos report says such claims are increasingly being disputed and the search for alternatives has been given a boost by the dramatic fall in the auction price of tobacco in Zimbabwe and Malawi last year. In Zimbabwe, maize had become more profitable in terms of money invested and cost less to insure than tobacco. In Bangladesh, potatoes and cotton gave farmers bigger net profits than tobacco. The report argues that the health and environmental costs of tobacco production should also be taken into account. The World Health Organisation says that 7m people will die in developing countries from smoking-related diseases every year by 2025 if current growth in smoking continues. Tobacco crops cause a serious loss of trees, which are cut down for fuel to cure the tobacco, and occupy land for longer periods than alternatives such as maize. 'In semi-arid areas, where tobacco thrives, the loss of trees can make land more vulnerable to desertification and unfit for agriculture.'

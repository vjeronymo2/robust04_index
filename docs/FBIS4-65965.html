			<p>BFN     [Text] Nicosia, May 25 (CNA)--U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus  Richard Boucher denied here Wednesday [24 May] reports in the  Turkish Cypriot press claiming that the U.S. had made promises  to the Turkish Cypriots in a bid to achieve agreement on a UN  package of confidence building measures.    The reports alleged that U.S. State Department Special  Coordinator on Cyprus Robert Lamb had made several promises to  the Turkish Cypriot side in Vienna last week to gain their  acceptance of the UN measures.    The reports said Lamb's promises met many Turkish Cypriot  demands concerning the reopening of Nicosia International  Airport and access to part of the Turkish-occupied town of  Varosha, which will come under UN administration under the  UN-proposed measures.    Boucher's denial was echoed by Government Spokesman Ioannis  Kasoulidhis, who said at his daily press briefing the Government  had no official confirmation of the Turkish Cypriot reports.    Asked to say whether Lamb had made the promises, as these  appeared in the Turkish Cypriot press, Boucher replied "the  reports that have appeared in the press were not true, the  specifics of the reports are not well reported."    However he acknowledged the importance of issues concerning  travelling of Turkish Cypriots and access to Varosha, issues on  which an answer is still awaited from the Turkish side.    He said the Vienna talks focussed on explaining to the  Turkish Cypriot side some points to which it objected, included  in the UN package of measures.    Boucher reaffirmed that the March 21 document prepared by  the  UN remained "the document that is the basis for reaching  agreement."    Kasoulidhis told the press that there was no official  confirmation from the American side of the Turkish Cypriot  reports.    The spokesman said the U.S. assessment of the situation  coincided with that of the UN and stressed that the government  had had no official confirmation from anybody of the press  reports.    UN Secretary-General's resident representative in Cyprus  Gustave Feissel denied categorically the truthfulness of the  reports.    The issues of separate customs offices at Nicosia Airport,  the use of so-called Turkish Cypriot passports, the presence of  Turkish Cypriot police officers in civilian clothes on the  access road to Varosha and the use of the logo of the Turkish  Cypriot illegal regime on their aircraft are points which the  reports claimed were promised to the Turkish Cypriot side.    "It has been clarified to us that no such promises were  given  on these issues," Kasoulidhis said.    "The Greek Cypriot side does not accept the presence of  Turkish troops in the area to be unmanned, south of Varosha,  leading to the town," Kasoulidhis added.    He noted that efforts were still being made on the issue of  access to Varosha and the area of the town that is to be  returned to UN administration, in accordance to the UN measures.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: Static third quarter at Thomson THOMSON Corporation, the Canadian-controlled travel and publishing group, blamed adverse exchange rates and competitive pressures in several of its key publishing businesses for near-stagnant third-quarter earnings. Net earnings edged up to USDollars 226m before preferred share dividends, or 39 cents per common share, from Dollars 221m, or 38 cents a year earlier. Sales dipped to Dollars 1.86bn from Dollars 1.94bn. If exchange rates had remained unchanged from average 1992 levels, earnings would have been 44 cents per share and sales Dollars 2.12bn. Nine-month earnings rose to Dollars 249m, or 42 cents a share, from Dollars 244m, or 41 cents. The brightest spot so far this year has been the travel business. Although UK-based Thomson Travel's nine-month operating profit dipped to Dollars 143m from Dollars 146m, the company said there was an 18.6 per cent jump measured in sterling. Thomson Tours' volumes rose 11 per cent last summer, and sales of winter holidays are 16 per cent ahead of last year. The company said summer 1994 bookings have been 'exceptionally high' since its brochures were launched in late August, leading to a 'significant' improvement in market share. An official ascribed the improvement to a stronger UK economy and last summer's poor weather, which has encouraged many people to book a holiday in the sun. In the publishing and newspaper divisions, there were poor performances by the UK and US professional, business and academic publishing groups, and Thomson's Canadian newspaper chain. But UK regional newspapers' operating profits were well ahead.</p>

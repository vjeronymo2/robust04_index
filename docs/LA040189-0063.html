			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STILL COMING DOWN FROM THE SUMMIT;  </P> <P> AFTER BIG RACES AT SEOUL, SOVIETS SAY THEY WON'T BE SHARP FOR CARLSBAD 5,000  </P> <P> Seems that Steve Scott, whose name has been synonymous with the Carlsbad 5,000  road race over the past three years, is having to share the attention this time  around.  </P> <P> Scott, the three-time champion, could find himself nudged out of the glow of  the spotlight by any one of a number of stars in the men's field -- or by three  Soviet women.  </P> <P> One, Olga Bondarenko, won a gold medal at the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games, setting  a world track 10,000-meter record of 31:05.21. Another, Yelena Zhupiyeva, took  the bronze medal in 31:19.82. The third, Natalya Artyomova, holds the Soviet  track record in the 5,000 meters at 14:54.08.  </P> <P> Impressive accomplishments. But those Olympic feats are actually reasons why  the Soviets might not be in top form right now. They're still recuperating from  the physical and mental exertion they put into training for the Games, which  were held less than six months ago.  </P> <P> Now they're just coasting, or at least that's what they indicated Thursday at  the Carlsbad City Council Chambers, where they were bestowed with BAD 5000  T-shirts, sweat shirts and "coffee" mugs.  </P> <P> Cultural differences being what they are, the Soviets quickly corrected  Carlsbad Mayor Pro-Tem Ann Kulchin after she presented the visitors with the  mugs, telling her that they would probably be used for vodka.  </P> <P> Kulchin protested, offering a compromise that the mugs be used for tea. But the  Soviets just said nyet.  </P> <P> Which, as it turned out, was the answer of the day, especially when the runners  were asked if they were in top shape.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't want to upset anyone," Bondarenko said through interpreter  Aleksander Mineyko, "but please do not expect the most out of me because after  Seoul, with the physical and mental effort put into it, I've been recuperating.  . . . But I'm delighted to be invited here. I'd just like to do my best."  </P> <P> Added Zhupiyeva, "I'm not in solid form. I'm in good shape, but not solid."  </P> <P> Let's face it. Compared to the Olympics, the Carlsbad 5,000 is just another  road race.  </P> <P> "You must understand that this is not the Olympic finals," said Pavel  Litovczenko, the Soviet coach. "But still you're more likely to see their  (Soviet runners') backsides than their front sides. They will do their best,  and if winning comes, then God bless."  </P> <P> Artyomova was more optimistic. "I'm going to go for a good time," she said  after Zhupiyeva indicated that she would not push her time. "And if the times  are good, then perhaps the gods will allow for a good place as well."  </P> <P> Perhaps. Then again, maybe former San Diego State runner Lynn Williams, the  bronze medalist in the 1,500 meters at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and the  fifth-place finisher in Seoul at 3,000, will be inspired by the Russians'  presence.  </P> <P> Williams is expected to be the biggest challenge to the Soviets.  </P> <P> And for these runners, anyone would seem to present a "big" challenge.  Bondarenko stands only 5-feet-1 and weighs 90 pounds. Zhupiyeva is 5-2, 101,  and Artyomova 5-6, 108.  </P> <P> The Invitational for men and women will begin at 9:15. A crowd of 25,000 is  expected to line the streets of Carlsbad to view the race. The starting line  will be the corner of Grand and Jefferson Avenue, the finish at State Street  and Elm Avenue.  </P> <P> Scott is once again favored to win the men's division -- he ran a world road  best of 13:31 here in 1986 and broke that with a 13:30.2 last year -- but he  will be pushed hard on the home course he designed.  </P> <P> Mark Nenow, a late entry, brings with him a world road 10,000 best of 27:22,  set in 1985. Kenya's Julius Kariuki, the gold-medalist at Seoul in the  steeplechase, has guaranteed race promoter Tim Murphy that he need not "worry  about Steve Scott winning for the fourth time in a row."  </P> <P> San Diego's Terry Cotton, who finished ninth last year, is entered, as are  Americans Doug Padilla and Ed Eyestone. Padilla is the U.S. record-holder  indoors in the 5,000 meters, and Eyestone was Track and Field News' 1988 Road  Racer of the Year.  </P> <P> Two British runners -- David Moorcroft and Geoff Wightman -- also could  contend. In 1985, Moorcroft became the first man to finish 5,000 meters on a  track in less than 13:00. Wightman is a miler moving up to the 5K.  </P></p>

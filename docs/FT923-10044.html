			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Lex Service Interim figures from Lex Service should dispel some of the more wildly pessimistic stories about the UK car market. The company's forecast of August car sales slightly higher than last year suggests a national total for the month in the region of 380,000, in line with yesterday's estimate from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. However, it remains unclear what impact the August rush will have on aggregate second-half margins. Overproduction in anticipation of a more solid recovery in consumer spending could still lead to an overhang of inventory on the forecourts come the autumn, which would only be cleared by discounting. Although the industry claims to be more rational than in the 1980s, such lingering doubts may explain the recent lacklustre performance of Lex's shares. Having outperformed the market by 21 per cent between January and May, they have since lost almost all of this advantage. Even assuming a good August, Lex is unlikely to repeat the first-half pre-tax figure of Pounds 16m, especially given the loss of the Volvo concession. There must be some doubt about its ability to continue equity-accounting the contribution from Arrow Electronics which was Pounds 4.6m in the first half. Against this, a more realistic view of residual values allowed the group to make a respectable return on leasing and the integration of Swan National appears to be proceeding smoothly. Assuming the final dividend is held, a prospective yield of 6.3 per cent looks undemanding.</p>

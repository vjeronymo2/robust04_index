			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Business Law: Why lawyers should consider consultancy In the increasingly competitive legal marketplace, lawyers are seeking to extend the range of topics on which they feel qualified and competent to advise. One natural development will be the provision of consulting services in fields of expertise in which competence has already been established within their own firm. If a firm has invested heavily for internal purposes in areas such as information technology, marketing, human resources, training, recruitment and administration, it can recover that expenditure not only through the cost savings and enhanced performance that would normally be expected, but also by selling on that expertise. The potential clients for these services are legal departments of companies, other professional service providers, public sector lawyers, legal advisers in Europe and elsewhere, and even other local law firms. This last eventuality is perhaps the most iconoclastic, in that it may seem wrongheaded to be helping one's competitors. However, the business benefits of advising potential competitors may outweigh the advantages of withholding such advice (given also that the advice will inevitably be obtained from other sources). There is a second and more subtle way in which lawyers might move into consulting - through the provision of legal services proactively, using techniques and adopting a perspective that would normally be regarded as the province of management consultants. Traditional lawyering is reactive, in the sense that clients come to their solicitors with their perceived legal problems and the lawyer then reacts to them. There are two well-known difficulties with this approach: first, by the time the client perceives a problem it may well be too late; and second, it is unlikely that clients will be able to perceive all their legal problems. Increasingly, in recent years, corporate clients in particular have been asking for a more proactive approach. In dispute-oriented work, the theme of proactivity is that of dispute pre-emption rather than dispute resolution; while, in transaction-based activities, lawyers will be retained not just to crystallise in legal terminology a deal already agreed on by the parties, but as advisers on all legal risk management. Many lawyers will claim that they are already proactive. Most are not. Nor can they be until they change their working practices radically. Genuine proactivity goes beyond the ad hoc foresights of a bright lawyer. It requires the deployment of techniques (often based on information technology) similar to the more structured and formalised processes and procedure developed for other tasks by the first-rate consulting practices. Not until these techniques are established and are being injected by lawyers into the hearts of organisations and at key points in the life cycles of all relevant projects can lawyering sensibly claim to be proactive. Comprehensive (often automated) audits and health checks will be compiled to assist in surveying the general effectiveness and efficiency of clients' legal affairs, looking at matters such as exposure to liability, preparedness for litigation, soundness of document management practice, quality of standard form contracts, and the mechanisms in place for the identification of legal problems. Additionally, these audits will assess whether clients comply with relevant regulations (for instance, EC directives). Legal risk management methodologies will also become the order of the day, akin to those already used by consultants in risk assessment generally. These methodologies will stipulate, in advance, when and what legal precautions and measures should be adopted by clients to help them identify, manage and control potential legal risks; and the teachings of these methodologies will be integrated with wider corporate practice. Clearly, a shift towards proactive legal consulting of this sort will require lawyers to reorientate themselves, using a more familiar analogy, from practitioners who cure diseases to those who administer a more preventative medicine. This demands that lawyers release themselves from the confines of considering the particular consequences of highly specific facts to functioning (as legal academics have always done) at a higher level of generality by considering the implications of a wide panoply of potential scenarios, risks and opportunities. Whatever the future of consulting by lawyers, comparisons between the accounting and legal professions are inevitable, not just because the former has borne substantial management consulting practices but also in light of accountants' admirable record of recognising and exploiting commercial opportunities often only loosely related to their core business. There are lessons here for lawyers. One is that the marriages of accounting and consulting practices have not always been entirely happy (in forms firms not least because consulting has not been profitable). Although both accounting and consultancy services tend to be provided under the same corporate label, there are clear cultural differences between the groups that provide the two sets of services and cross-selling and collaboration opportunities are exploited far less frequently than might be expected. More vigilant human resource management by lawyers at the outset may ease such tensions. Another lesson for lawyers relates to the accounting giants' ability to recognise commercial opportunities and to marshal formidable resource in quick exploitation, a capacity of which lawyers have been simultaneously distrustful and envious. Taxation, trusts and insolvency work are the best documented illustrations or markets being taken from the legal profession on the strength of this entrepreneurial flair. But the field of data protection offers a more powerful example: when in 1984 a piece of legislation was enacted governing the pervasive practice of processing personal information electronically, the majority of the legal profession awaited instructions from clients in the time-honoured reactive manner while the market was largely captured by the accounting and consultancy firms who met the real business needs of clients. In a daunting barrage of professional proactivity in a field beyond their mainstream business, these accountancy firms provided consulting services in precisely the way that lawyers can and should today in many other areas of business.

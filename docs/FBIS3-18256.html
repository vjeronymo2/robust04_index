			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Josef Joffe commentary: "An Ultimatum Does Not Yet Make </F> Peace"]    [Text] Almost every day a new play is staged on the  Bosnian stage, and whether all these plays will promote peace is  the prize question of 1994. The latest surprise move once again  comes from Moscow: On Wednesday [24 February] Boris Yeltsin  proposed a summit on the former Yugoslavia at short notice --  and he did not do so via the usual, relatively discreet  diplomatic channels but in front of gathered journalists.    An "interesting idea," London commented succinctly, but one  has not yet received a "formal invitation." What are the United  States, Russia, Britain, France, and Germany supposed to decide  at this one-day summit? This is not known, but even today one  can assume that Yeltsin is not so much interested in peace as in  Moscow's advantage as the one taking the initiative, because in  the same breath Yeltsin complained about the "attempts by some  Western leaders" to "discriminate against Russia." Whoever they  might be -- they will certainly not be happy about the fact that  Chancellor Kohl (as the Bonn Foreign Ministry has let it be  known) has already given his blessing to the Russian summit  project. A common Balkan policy along the Bonn-Moscow "axis" --  this gives rise to unpleasant memories among certain "Western  leaders."    In addition, another problem is putting a strain on Bonn's  Bosnian policy. Since relative calm is now reigning in  Sarajevo, people are turning to look toward Mostar, where it is  not the Serbs but the Croats who are besieging the Muslims.  Therefore, the international community would also have to act  energetically against the Croatian troops in Herzegovina.  However, as a Western diplomat, who wants to remain anonymous,  complains: "We have not exerted any real pressure on the  Croats. We cannot even threaten them with sanctions, because  Germany would prevent them." If this is not only a private  opinion, Klaus Kinkel will have problems with offering his "good  services" in Bosnian diplomacy. Anyone who is identified with  one side in the conflict cannot really play -- as Bismarck in  the past -- the "honest broker."    And what about the Americans? They seem to have lost their  courage again. Could one not extend the policy of threat in  Sarajevo to the other parts of the country, where there are  sieges and attacks? The State Department spokesman waves that  aside: "Sarajevo was a very special case; we do not want to  exaggerate." As regards the other case, NATO must hold  discussions again.    NATO is hanging on the United Nations, and the hinges are  already creaking a lot. When on Tuesday five blue helmet  soldiers were attacked by mortar fire in Tuzla, Sir Michael  Rose, the UN commander for Bosnia, wanted to call in NATO  planes. However, UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] Commander in  Chief Jean Cot rejected the wish -- possibly in consideration  for the UN Security Council in New York, where the Russians are  stubbornly trying to prevent any NATO operations.    Summary: The ultimatum of Sarajevo might indeed remain a  special case. And the war will continue, while the large and  medium-sized powers are struggling for prestige and position.</p>

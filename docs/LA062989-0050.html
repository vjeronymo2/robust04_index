			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA CLARITA RESTRICTS BILLBOARD SIZE, SITES  </P> <P> Continuing its war on urban clutter, the Santa Clarita City Council has passed  a strict ordinance limiting the size and placement of billboards.  </P> <P> The ordinance, unanimously approved Tuesday night, was developed by the  Planning Commission after a year of study. At one point, the commission  considered banning new billboards entirely, said Kyle Kollar, community  development director. The commission eventually decided to allow new billboards  under stringent guidelines, he said.  </P> <P> Under the ordinance, the council could refuse to grant a zone change or a  permit for a billboard if the council decided the advertising would lower  property values or reduce the public's enjoyment of an area. The ordinance also  restricts the size of billboards to 300 square feet. Previously, billboard  companies could erect signs of 800 square feet.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, the council refused to allow advertisements on the side of  municipal buses, saying the advertising contributed to visual blight. This  year, the council passed an ordinance making it illegal to place commercial  handbills on car windshields on private property.  </P></p>

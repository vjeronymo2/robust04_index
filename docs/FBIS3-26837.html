He said: People of all  nationalities are the backbone of the motherland's border  defense. Over the years, party committees and governments at  all levels and people of all nationalities have shown concern  and support for army building.

Abulaidi Amudurexiti, deputy secretary of the autonomous  regional party committee and acting chairman of the autonomous  regional government, thanked the military region for arranging  the visits. He said: Through border defense, troops in the  military region have created a border environment in which the  autonomous region can safely open up its border areas. Various  military units have conducted in-depth education on supporting  the government and cherishing the people; actively promoted  unity between the Army and the government, between the Army and  the people, and among various nationalities; and fostered a  peaceful and stable social environment north and south of Tian  Shan. The vast numbers of officers and men have fully supported  local economic construction, thereby promoting the autonomous  region's economic development. Troops in the military region  have contributed to defending and building border areas, and  people of all nationalities in Xinjiang will never forget this.    On behalf of party committees and organs in the military  region, Fu Bingyao extended Spring Festival greetings to cadres  of all nationalities, workers, and staff members in the Xinjiang  Production and Construction Corps. He stated: The production  and construction corps is an important force in Xinjiang's  defense and construction. As always, troops in the military  region will support the work carried out by the corps, with whom  they will jointly do a good job in Xinjiang's defense and  construction. Jin Yunhui, deputy secretary of the autonomous  regional party committee and commander of the production and  construction corps, noted: In the new year, we will continue to  beef up militia reservists for the corps so as to make new  contributions to bolstering defense reserve forces and  maintaining border security and social stability in the  autonomous region.

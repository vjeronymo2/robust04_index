			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Wobble atop the pillars of state: Quentin Peel and Judy Dempsey on the mounting political pressures facing Germany's Helmut Kohl For Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the man who brought Germany unification, it is a symbolic slap in the face to see his Christian Democratic Union pipped at the polls by the Party of Democratic Socialism, the former east German communist party. Yet that is precisely what happened on Sunday night, when the CDU in the eastern state of Brandenburg saw itself reduced to just over 20 per cent of the vote in local elections, against more than 21 per cent for the communists. It was not a vote against unification itself. 'Absolutely not,' says Mr Lothar Nicht, the Moscow-trained ex-diplomat who is party manager for the PDS in the state. 'We are not opposed to unification. Of course, many of our members wanted it, but in another kind of Germany.' It was a protest vote rather, against Bonn, against high unemployment, against the insecurity of the post-communist world, and against the excessive influence of Wessis - west Germans - in the east. It was a protest vote against all the established parties: the opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD), which is in power in Brandenburg, itself slipped a few points, and looks set to lose the mayor's race in Potsdam, the state capital, to the PDS. It was also, at least in part, a protest against the failure of Mr Kohl to deliver the 'blooming' eastern Germany economy which he promised just three years ago. The official unemployment rate in Brandenburg exceeds 17 per cent, whilst thousands of steel workers and miners are threatened by redundancy. For Mr Kohl, it was the culmination of a terrible 10 days in the life of his coalition with the Free Democratic Party in Bonn. First, he saw his personal candidate for the job of federal president, Mr Steffen Heitmann, withdraw in humiliation from the contest. He pulled out when it became clear that his conservative views and lack of public relations skills meant he would not gain a majority in the federal electoral college which willchoose a president next May. Then one week before the Brandenburg poll, the entire CDU-FDP coalition government in the neighbouring state of Saxony-Anhalt resigned over allegations that ministers imported from the west had unjustly inflated their salaries. Finally, in a flurry of headlines and magazine cover stories, the German media have turned on the embattled chancellor to suggest that after 11 years in office, his days are numbered. Even the died-in-the-wool conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ), normally a loyal supporter of the liberal-conservative government, last week led its front page with a story comparing the state of the coalition to the dying days of the SPD-FDP regime in 1982. It seems that the imperturbable chancellor is finally looking vulnerable. Even if he refuses to panic, his coalition colleagues and partners are showing severe signs of perceiving their impending doom. Mr Karl Feldmeyer, political correspondent of the FAZ, says that the mood of defeatism within the CDU is growing. 'Experienced CDU politicians will privately admit their own despondency, even resignation,' he says. 'They don't see any chance of winning the next federal elections.' Perhaps the Heitmann debacle was the most devastating blow of all, for it showed Mr Kohl to be fallible in the one area on which he has always prided himself as a supreme tactician: the placing of the right people in the right jobs. Mr Kohl was sharply criticised from the back benches of his own parliamentary group when the decision was announced - and not from the liberal wing of the party, which always disliked Mr Heitmann, but from the conservatives who wanted to support him. With no fewer than 19 elections scheduled for the next 11 months, grass-roots officials of the CDU, its Bavaria-based sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the liberal FDP are living in fear of a drubbing at the polls. 'It does not really matter if this coalition collapses now, or if it drags on till next October's general election. We are still going to lose,' says one gloomy local official from Lower Saxony, where the first round of state elections will be held in March. In both elections this autumn - first in Hamburg, in September, and now in eastern Brandenburg - the CDU and FDP have trailed far behind the opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD). Professor Kurt Biedenkopf, the CDU premier of Saxony and, it must be said, a long-standing and bitter rival of Mr Kohl, has stated publicly he believes the SPD will emerge as the dominant party in a grand coalition with the CDU next October. He fears that the loss of only two state elections - most probably Saxony-Anhalt and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, both in east Germany - will give the SPD a two-thirds majority in the Bundesrat, the upper house of the federal parliament. That would give the opposition a stranglehold on all government legislation, even if the CDU and FDP can scrape up a majority in the Bundestag. Mr Kohl flatly and furiously disagrees. Rumours of a coalition collapse, the end of the government, and the demise of the chancellor, were 'wrong three times over', he declared in a tough-talking television interview last night. Nobody could foretell the results of next year's elections, not even Professor Biedenkopf, he said. The question is whether Mr Kohl, with all his immense political experience and cunning, can reverse the downward trend in the polls when the current election arithmetic points, at best, to a grand coalition with the SPD, and at worst, outright defeat for the ruling parties. Up till now, Mr Kohl has been in the enviable position of having no obvious rivals for his job. Within his own party he has disposed of all possible challengers such as Mr Biedenkopf, banishing them to the back benches or the provinces. Only Mr Wolfgang Schauble remains, his able, popular and apparently loyal lieutenant as leader of the parliamentary party. Asked if he would lead a coup against his leader, one party insider insists: 'He knows too well that Brutus never succeeded Caesar.' There is also doubt about his physical stamina - he remains wheelchair-bound, since he was victim of an assassination attempt in 1990. What has caused the muttering in coalition ranks is rather the increasingly impressive performance of Mr Rudolf Scharping, the 45-year-old leader of the SPD. In the five months since June, when he was elected leader of a rudderless, quarrelling opposition, which had failed consistently to exploit the obvious unpopularity of the government, he has succeeded in bringing order to the chaos. At the party conference in Wiesbaden three weeks ago, he won a clear mandate for a tough, conservative financial policy from a future SPD government, and support for a firm law-and-order campaign. Himself a worthy but uninspiring speaker, he has managed to forge an apparently solid alliance with the mercurial but persuasive Mr Oskar Lafontaine as his deputy. The opposition still has a long way to go to prove it is 'fit for government' to a disgruntled German electorate. The last opinion poll by the Allensbach institute, the research organisation, put the CDU/CSU on 35.7 per cent in west Germany, against 36 per cent for the SPD. In the midst of the sharpest economic downturn since the war, the opposition should be doing much better. In east Germany, however, the CDU is trailing far behind the SPD, with just 19.7 per cent against 32.1 per cent for the opposition. And that is where the crunch may come. Mr Kohl has bought himself a little time. He is expecting to lose the state elections in Lower Saxony in March to the incumbent SPD. But he has headed off the danger of a simultaneous poll in Saxony-Anhalt which might have created an unstoppable momentum for the opposition. It now looks probable that the CDU-FDP coalition there will limp on until the autumn. The chancellor's hopes are now pinned on three things: a recovery of the German economy; the desire of electors to return to the familiarity and security of the ruling coalition at national, rather than local, elections; and his own ruthless political instincts in a frantic election year. Neither of the first two can yet be guaranteed. As for the third, Mr Kohl has only survived so long in German politics by being continually underestimated. He is unlikely to make the same mistake about the forces ranged against him.</p>

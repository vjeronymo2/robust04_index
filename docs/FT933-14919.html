			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Survey of Belgium (5): Fashioning federalism - Dick Leonard discusses the constitutional reforms IT TOOK 30 years of campaigning and the painful assembling of a seven-party agreement to obtain the necessary two-thirds majority, but in May the Belgian parliament approved the final steps to turn the country into a federal state. From now on the national government will be confined to carefully delineated powers. These will be largely restricted to foreign affairs, defence, justice, internal security, taxation and social security. All the remaining responsibilities, including economic affairs, the environment, education, cultural affairs, transport, housing, planning, research, agriculture and foreign trade, will be devolved, or already have been, to three regions (Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels) and three language communities - Dutch, French and German. It has been a step by step process, starting in 1980 when the regions of Flanders and Wallonia were established. A third self-governing region - for Brussels - was set up in 1987, when education was transferred from the national government to the language communities. The constitutional changes approved in May, which will not take effect until after the next parliamentary elections, are intended to complete the picture. The changes foreshadow a considerable overhaul of the national parliament, which until now has been an unwieldy and not very influential body, with an almost complete overlap between the powers of the two chambers. Henceforth, the lower house - the Chamber of Representatives - which will be reduced from 212 members to 150, will be the main legislative body. The Senate, the membership of which drops from 174 to 71, will essentially be a revising chamber. Separate parliaments for Flanders and Wallonia will be directly elected, as the parliament for Brussels has been since 1987. The minister-presidents of the three regions will in future be known as prime ministers. The province of Brabent, the only one which has previously been bilingual, will be split into two, leaving Belgium with five French- and five Dutch-speaking provinces. The main inspirer of the constitutional changes was Wilfred Martens, who was prime minister almost continuously from 1979 to 1992. Yet it fell to his successor, Jean-Luc Dehaene, also a Flemish Christian Democrat, to steer the main changes through parliament, a tricky exercise as his left-centre coalition fell far short of the necessary two-thirds majority in both houses. He managed to get the measures through by a judicious mixture of stick and carrot. The stick was applied to the four governing parties - two Christian and two Socialist - who were aware of their unpopularity in the country. A government defeat would have precipitated an early general election. The carrots were offered to three opposition parties, each of whose support was needed. The support of the two Green parties - one for each of the main language groups - was obtained in return for new ecological taxes. The moderate Flemish Nationalists were won over by the introduction of a clause ensuring that residual powers not specifically mentioned in the constitution should revert to the regions. Will the new changes stick or do they merely mark a stage in a process leading inevitably to separation, as in the case of Czechoslovakia? There are some warning signs, notably the press interview given in May by the Flemish minister-president, Luc Van den Brande. He foreshadowed a much more complete autonomy for Flanders, setting a target date of 2002. Mr Van den Brande is a member of Dehaene's own party, and his interview, which was applauded by the bulk of the Flemish press, was embarrassing to the government. Yet the excitement soon died down, and a spontaneous march in Brussels a few weeks later, in opposition to separatism, drew a vast crowd.</p>

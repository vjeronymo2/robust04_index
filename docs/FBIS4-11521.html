			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Gaona and Lucia Domville] </F>   [Text] Herminio Blanco, under secretary for international  commercial negotiations of the Commerce and Industrial  Development Secretariat (Secofi), has said Mexico will not yield  to U.S. Government pressures to expedite tariff elimination of  600 items because currently "it is too early to renegotiate the  chapter on market access" and because conditions for the three  countries to modify the treaty have not changed.    Secofi believes that greater tariff elimination can take  place in one or two years when the dynamics of NAFTA integration  have changed market conditions or when the sectors have made  strategic alliances, joint-ventures [preceding word in English],  or mergers, but not just four months into the trilateral pact.    The topic of tariff elimination has become a "thorny" issue  between the Mexican and U.S. Governments, to such a degree that  Canada's Minister of International Trade Roy MacLaren told EL  FINANCIERO that it is "a bilateral affair."    The United States, in press statements, has said that "it  will exert pressure until it gets the greatest possible number  of tariff reductions" from the list of 600 items published in  the March issue of the Federal Register. Meanwhile, Secofi  Secretary Jaime Serra Puche and Under Secretary Herminio Blanco  agree that "if there is no agreement with private enterprise and  no consensus between the government and businessmen in Mexico,  no tariff elimination will be negotiated."    NOTIMEX reported that the telephone conversation planned  yesterday between U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and  Jaime Serra Puche was postponed until Wednesday. A reliable  Mexican source said decisions are still at a "preliminary"  level, despite the closeness of the established deadline (120  days from 1 January).    Private sector sources say that while the United States is  in  a hurry to gain concessions as soon as possible (before Congress  goes on summer holidays), Mexico does not want to grant any more  concessions until it sees the results of what it has already  negotiated. In fact, they said that U.S. demands -- included in  two lists, the first with 600 tariff items and the second with  more than 1,000 -- are so pretentious that they seek to  eliminate tariffs as if the two countries were operating under  the same conditions. They added that even though the United  States claims that the Mexican tariffs are "too high," they  should not forget that the difference in tariffs represents the  negotiation between an industrialized country and a developing  country.    Jaime Serra Puche warned that Mexico is only interested in  taking to the negotiating table four groups of products: shoes,  fruits, vegetables, and preserves. The United States, however,  wants to negotiate under Article 302, Part 3, their lack of  participation throughout negotiations.    Herminio Blanco explained that they decided to include the  NAFTA clause to give the text flexibility in case there were  future changes in the economic situation, or in the event of  joint-ventures or mergers between the country's industries. U.S.  sources said Herminio Blanco warned businessmen that Mexico "has  no commitment to reduce tariffs" and will only do so if they are  accepted by Mexican production plants. Blanco admitted that "it  is too early to renegotiate the market access chapter," because  in four months of NAFTA operations, conditions have not changed.  Blanco contends that within a year or two the tariff  renegotiating process could become an issue.    U.S. sources commented that within the next few weeks, the  Federal Registry will publish what products are in the first  round of negotiations. They believe that these will be goods  that both countries agree require tariff reductions. This  includes frozen white potatoes, rice, crude sunflower oil,  prepared peaches, wines, tobacco products, chemical and  pharmaceutical products, wood and paper products, shoes,  ceramics, glass, and home appliances.</p>

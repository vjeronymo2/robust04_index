			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Three killed as violence flares again in Moldova THREE people were shot dead yesterday as animosity between Moldova's Romanian-speaking majority and ethnic Russians flared into violence again, Reuter reports from Moscow. Moldova's Interior Ministry said the head of a local Russian-speaking militia was among those killed in a shoot-out with police near a textile mill in Dubossary, in the breakaway Dnestr republic proclaimed by Russian-speakers. The town was the scene of fighting between police and the militia last December in which at least five people died. The Moldovan government, which promotes closer ties with neighbouring Romania, refuses to recognise the region's secession. It said the incident was contrived by 'the leaders of Dnestr's separatist forces backed by reactionary forces' to undermine Moldova's UN application. Tension has run high for the past two years between ethnic Romanians and Russian-speakers who fear they will be overwhelmed if Moldova, a member of the new Commonwealth of Independent States, tightens its links with Romania.</p>

			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Croat-Moslem ceasefire agreed: Fears for civilians taken from besieged Bosnian city of Mostar A CEASEFIRE was due to come into effect in the Bosnian city of Mostar last night after a second consecutive day of Bosnian Croat attacks on Moslem-led government troops, as Sarajevo radio accused the Bosnian Croats of blatant 'ethnic cleansing' of the city. United Nations officials said there were fears for the safety of Moslem civilians, who they said had been taken out of the town in buses after being held in the town football stadium. Moslem-controlled radio claimed yesterday evening that fighting was continuing in the city. Croatian radio reported units of the Croatian Defense Council (HVO) taking control of part of it. Earlier in the day television pictures showed columns of smoke rising from Mostar, already heavily damaged last year in attacks by the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army. It also showed hundreds of Moslems apparently being marched out of the city by HVO troops. A UN statement said Bosnian Croat troops escorted 10 busloads of civilians, including women and children, out of Mostar. The renewed fighting has blocked a key humanitarian aid route to central Bosnia. Unconfirmed reports yesterday said dozens of people had been killed and wounded. Croatian radio said seven Croat fighters and one civilian had been killed in fighting on Sunday. A local priest appealed to all hospitals, which were under HVO control, to treat the wounded equally. Croatia condemned the newest outbreak of fighting between the one-time allies, although Sarajevo radio claimed that regular units of the Croatian Army were backing the HVO assault. The fighting appeared to be an attempt by the Croats to exert full control over the Mostar region, which has been designated as Croat under the Vance-Owen peace plan. Elsewhere, UN observers reached the eastern town of Zepa which is besieged by Serbian forces. They said that thousands of Moslems had fled the enclave and that only 50 people out of an estimated 30,000 remained in the town. UN Protection Force spokesman Commander Barry Frewer, giving details of what the observers had found, said: 'The township itself is almost deserted. The majority of the houses have been badly damaged. 'There has been heavy fighting, heavy shelling, people have fled into the hills,' he added.</p>

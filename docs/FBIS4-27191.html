			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- A gunman threatened former  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Monday with a shot at the  ceiling of a Tokyo hotel in what he called a show of protest  against Hosokawa's past remarks on World War II and economic  policies, police said.    The assailant, identified as Masakatsu Nozoe, 52, a member  of  a right-wing organization, was overpowered and detained by  plainclothes men immediately after the incident in the  third-floor lobby at the Keio Plaza Hotel, witnesses said.    Hosokawa, 56, was unhurt. He was rushed out of the hotel and  into a waiting car.    Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata denounced the attack, saying,  "such an act would destroy democracy." The last known rightist  attack on a politician came in March 1992 when a shot was fired  at Shin Kanemaru, the disgraced kingmaker of the Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP).    Hosokawa was on his way home from a party at the hotel  marking the establishment of the Tokyo chapter of the Japan New  Party (JNP) which he heads. The assailant later told police  that he had become upset with Hosokawa's apologies for Japan's  wartime responsibilities and over his economic policies, police  said.    A shaken Hosokawa reportedly expressed concern for his wife  as he was escorted out of the hotel, saying, "Kayoko is still  here. Please (take care of her)." Hosokawa, who has been  burdened with questions surrounding his financial dealings,  resigned last month as head of a fragile coalition government  which replaced four decades of rule by the LDP. He has since  maintained a low profile, reportedly staying at his Karuizawa  retreat and at Tokyo hotels.    According to party sources, Hosokawa has been threatened by  rightist organizations since assuming office last August over  his apologies for Japanese atrocities during World War II. The  JNP has reportedly taken precautions to protect Hosokawa since  then.</p>

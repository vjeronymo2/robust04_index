			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Kingfisher Last year's 3 per cent advance in profits before tax and exceptional items looks a characteristically resilient Kingfisher performance. There may be room to quibble about the size and nature of the provisions at Comet, and to query a little the defensiveness of Superdrug. But the cash management success - a Pounds 100m reduction in group debt thanks to sound working capital controls, sharply reduced capital expenditure, and net disinvestment ge at this point in the cycle. Kingfisher's shares have been overshadowed of late by fears of discounting in the DIY sector - certainly evident in B&amp;Q's results - and by the perennial rumours of a fresh takeover. An acquisition always remains a possibility, but it has never proved a serious obstacle to the shares in the past and next time is just as likely to be a joint venture with a continental European partner. As for DIY, Kingfisher is surely right to sacrifice short-term gross margins in the cause of keeping down prices and expanding its market share. The company will be a winner in the low-growth environment of 1990s, which sits oddly with its below average rating in the sector. The worry is whether the high hopes invested in the whole retailing sector are justified.</p>

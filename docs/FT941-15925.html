			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks fall back as investors take profits Wall Street Profit-taking saw US share prices ease off from their record highs yesterday as financial markets awaited this week's important inflation news, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. By the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 15.20 at 3,850.31. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index retreated 1.14 to 474.13. The American SE composite, which languished while other indices rallied on Monday, firmed 0.59 to 479.37, and the Nasdaq composite finished 1.17 off at 785.52. New York SE trading volume was heavy at 305.5m shares, while falls led rises by 1,144 to 994. After posting gains for six consecutive days and setting new record highs for four of these, no-one was surprised yesterday when profit-taking led to early declines in share prices. Monday's big 45-point Dow gain was achieved because of growing confidence among investors about the outlook for the economy, and their decision to respond to that brighter economic picture by buying stocks of companies whose earnings are closely tied to the economic cycle. Share prices were also aided, as they have been since the start of 1994, by large inflows of institutional funds as money managers sought to put cash collected in the new year to work in the market. Yesterday's profit-taking was not as widespread as might have been expected after such a strong run, which explains why the day's losses were relatively minimal. Although at one point during the afternoon the Dow was down almost 20 points, there was never any threat of a big sell-off, and S&amp;P and Nasdaq stocks held their own relatively well. Analysts noted that investors were unwilling to sell shares before the release today and tomorrow of the December inflation data. The numbers are expected to be bullish for bonds and equities, and investors were understandably wary yesterday about selling ahead of a further rally in stocks. Auto shares remained in demand but ended below the session's highs. Chrysler added Dollars 3/4 at Dollars 59 1/2, Ford Motor Dollars 1 at Dollars 68 1/4 and General Motors Dollars 1/8 at Dollars 59 3/8. Westinghouse Electric eased Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 14 after the company unveiled details of its previously announced restructuring plan, which includes write-downs, lay-offs and charges against earnings. Toys 'R' Us put on Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 38 3/4 in heavy trading after revealing plans for a Dollars 1bn share buy-back operation and announcing that it would open 114 new stores in 1994. International Paper dipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 73 in spite of reporting fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 100m, an improvement on the Dollars 87m income before special items reported a year earlier. Canada Toronto ended slightly easier after a day of busy profit-taking in most sectors which offset strength in the precious metals group. Traders were not surprised by the market's softer tone after its torrid pace in recent days. The TSE 300 index ended 5.8 off at 4,447.4 and declines led rises by 403 to 388 after volume of 81.8m shares. Golds rose 2 per cent but metals and minerals fell 1.68 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News Patrol" newscast] </F>   [Text] The possibility of establishing a state of  exceptional measures in Guatemala to halt the nationwide wave of  crime, violence, and terrorism continues to be a topic of  discussion between the president and his ministers, but, for the  time being, such a decision has not been adopted, according to  Felix Loarca Guzman, public relations secretary of the  Presidency.    The nation's situation will continue to be studied at future  cabinet meetings, but, for the time being, this measure is on  hold. Although the death of Constitutionality Court President  Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon was one of the arguments used to  raise the possibility of resorting to such a measure, the  discussion at today's cabinet meeting centered on the search for  those responsible for the crime. The government spokesman said  security personnel are working hard on the investigation.    Meanwhile, it has been learned in legislative circles that  Congress, through a resolution, might recommend that the  executive branch decree a state of exceptional measures. At this  time, opinions are divided among legislators about whether a  state of exceptional measures should be established to control  the extreme violence in the country. Deputy Obdulio Chinchilla  Vega has said the government of Ramiro de Leon Carpio should  immediately establish a state of exceptional measures. Congress  President Vinicio Villar, however, does not agree that the  executive branch should adopt such a measure.</p>

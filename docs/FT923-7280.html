			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Iran threatens to sue Siemens over N-plant IRAN is threatening to sue Siemens, the German electrical and electronics group, for refusing to complete a nuclear power plant project. Mr Mansour Haji-Azim, the vice-president in charge of the power stations of Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation (AEO), said last week that Iran would be pursuing its dispute with Siemens in a number of international forums, including in court. The dispute revolves around the failure by Siemens to complete the Bushehr power plant in southern Iran, begun in 1975 as part of the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's nuclear programme. The project, which was planned to include two 13,000MW reactors, was abandoned in 1979 when the plant was about 85 per cent completed. It was later bombed by Iraqi aircraft in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. Iran, which is suffering from an acute shortage of power generation, has been pushing Siemens to complete the project. It also wants delivery of components for the plant for which it has already paid. But Siemens says it is subject to a ban imposed by the German government in June 1990 denying export licences for components of nuclear power plants. In June, Mr Jurgen Mollemann, German economics minister, said on a visit to Tehran that Germany would not help rebuild the plant. Despite the threat to sue by the AEO, Iran has signed a letter of agreement with Siemens for a gas-fired power station in the free trade zone area of Qeshm island in the Gulf. The agreement was penned during a visit to Iran earlier this month by Mr Heinrich von Pierer, managing director of Siemens. The Qeshm Free Trade Authority, formed to encourage inward foreign investment, has been attacked for the agreement. 'The act of the authorities of the Qeshm free trade zone should in fact be considered as a kind of mocking the people,' commented Abrar, a Tehran daily. Asked by a caller on a radio phone-in programme why the agreement had been signed, Mr Haj-Sa'id, AEO research vice-president, blamed it on lack of co-ordination between government ministries. Calling for more co-ordination, he said: 'We can all unanimously decide then whether to sign agreements with Siemens or not.' However, Mr Wolfgang Brieyer of KWU, power generation subsidiary of Siemens, said yesterday that 'the Iranian authorities understand that it is not within the grasp of Siemens to complete the project. We have continually applied for an export licence.' Calls by the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper for a trade boycott against Germany seem impractical. Germany is Iran's largest trading partner with exports of Dollars 4.1bn in 1991 against imports from Iran of Dollars 902m.</p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / ITC to take second look at launching Channel 5 The Independent Television Commission is examining ways of improving the chances of launching Channel 5 as a national channel using existing technology. This is in response to a revival of interest in the concept in spite of the ITC rejection last December of the only bid for the franchise. Time Warner, the world's largest media group, is among those which have submitted expressions of interest in the new channel. A total of 76 submissions were received last month on options for the future of Channel 5, which included using the available frequencies to help launch digital television in the UK. MAI, the financial services and advertising company which controls Meridian Television, is among those which have expressed interest in running a conventional television channel. The ITC foresees two main difficulties in trying to launch the channel envisaged by the 1990 Broadcasting Act. Many of the suggestions call for the use of different frequencies in an attempt to avoid one of the main drawbacks with the original franchise application - the need to retune several million video recorders. Using different frequencies would almost certainly involve negotiations with the UK's closest neighbours. The second potential problem is that few of the companies most interested are able to lead and control a consortium because of regulatory restrictions. Time Warner, as a non-European Union company, cannot hold a majority stake in a broadcasting licence. The ITC is likely to take a decision on whether to advertise a new Channel 5 licence in January.</p>

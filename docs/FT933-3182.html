			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Consumer electronics - future lies in software and facilities (2) Sir, Tony Jackson missed the point about consumer electronics. Television sets are not like cars or cornflakes or dishwashers. They don't do anything. People are not bored with television sets; they are bored with the programmes that come through them. Nobody will spend hundreds of pounds on brilliantly clear, high-definition TV sets that show the same old rubbish. They will spend only if the brilliant new pictures offer brilliant new fun; new sorts of services; shopping and banking; takeaway menus; two-way conversations; access to airlines, medical help and advice. Red hot news and wonderful information, amazing new shows. I'd spend Pounds 1,000 on a new telly for all that. Sony seems to be the only one to understand. It has invested in Hollywood.

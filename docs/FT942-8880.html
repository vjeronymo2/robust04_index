			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: Shake-up at Banesto offshoot Banesto, the Spanish bank acquired by Banco Santander last month in the largest domestic takeover, has announced a Pta12.6bn (Dollars 91m) capital increase for Agroman, the loss-making construction group in which it has a 57 per cent holding. The decision to rescue the group is Santander's first look at tackling Banesto's industrial empire. The fresh funds, which will double Agroman's shareholder capital to Pta25bn, will seek to eliminate the company's heavy financial costs and, according to Banesto, 'put (Agroman's) financial structure on a level with the best companies in the sector'. A recent audit by Price Waterhouse put Agroman losses at more than Pta10bn. Banesto said it was prepared to subscribe the entire capital increase on a one-for-one basis. Analysts said the capital injection amounted to a mere accounting entry on the part of Banesto, and would have a neutral impact on the bank's balance sheet. They said Banesto would be simply capitalising loans to Agroman which had already been provisioned. The move fuelled speculation that Banesto, under its Santander parent, was preparing for the disposal of the construction company. 'The new capital makes Agroman saleable,' said Mr Jaime Mariategui of the Madrid financial consultancy firm Research Associates. Santander eschewed industrial investments several years ago, and its Dollars 2bn takeover of Banesto was aimed at gaining the bank's widespread branch network. It is understood Santander will, over time, sell off the companies within Banesto.</p>

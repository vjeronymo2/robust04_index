			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Smaller retailers 'being squeezed' Intense competition among high street stores is squeezing smaller retailers particularly hard, the British Chambers of Commerce warned yesterday. With consumers still cost conscious, price discounting among bigger stores has become a key issue in retailing this autumn. That message was reinforced by Central Statistical Office figures issued yesterday which showed that the volume of retail sales had risen by a seasonally adjusted 0.1 per cent in October compared with September, and by 3.1 per cent in the year to October. The value of retail sales rose 3.5 per cent in the year to October, highlighting the low level of inflationary pressure in the high street. Mr Richard Brown, deputy director of the chambers, warned that this pattern was squeezing smaller businesses. He said: 'We remain concerned that small retailers are losing the fight for survival through the 'discount culture'.' Meanwhile, the CSO said that in the third quarter of this year the value of sales made by businesses with a 1990 turnover of more than Pounds 3m was 6 per cent above those in the same period a year ago. The value of smaller retailers' sales was 1 per cent lower. In food retailing big retailers increased their sales by 8 per cent during this period. Small food retailers saw their sales fall by 2 per cent. This divergence is greater than last year's. Last year big food retailers increased their business by 7 per cent compared with 1992, while small food retailers saw business shrink by 1 per cent. Some economists believe that the fact that big food retailers may be gaining market share could be distorting the figures, since big retailers may be over-represented in the statistics. This is disputed by the CSO. Nevertheless, yesterday's figures showed food retailers' sales volumes grew 0.2 per cent in October compared with September. In the three months to October food retailers' sales volumes rose 1 per cent compared with the previous three months. The volume of sales by non-food retailers was unchanged, both on the month and in the three months to October compared with the previous three months. Clothing and footwear sales fell 0.8 per cent in October compared with September. The British Retail Consortium said that this was because warm weather at the end of October depressed the sale of winter clothes. Sales of household goods grew 0.2 per cent in the month. Sales by other non-food retailers rose slightly in the month, although they dropped 1.5 per cent in the three months to October compared with the previous three months.</p>

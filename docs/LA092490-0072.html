			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR;  </P> <P> DELIBERATE WILSON RELIES ON EXPERTS, LONGTIME AIDES  </P> <P> Back in the early weeks of 1989, it seemed as though U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson had  consulted half the state of California about whether to run for governor. But  Gayle Wilson still was not sure if her husband would make the biggest move of  his political career.  </P> <P> Finally one night at the dinner table, she told Wilson that if he decided not  to run for governor because he feared she might object, he would regret it and  resent her for the rest of his life.  </P> <P> "If you want to do it, do it!" Gayle Wilson told her husband. "And it really  was 100% go from there."  </P> <P> Deciding to run for governor is hardly an everyday political decision, but the  story is typical of how Pete Wilson goes about collecting information and  making decisions. By all accounts, the 57-year-old senator pursues a process  that is thorough, wide-ranging, painstaking in detail -- and often frustrating  to those who know him best.  </P> <P> There is no particular mystery about the process, developed over four years in  the California Assembly, 11 years as mayor of San Diego and eight years as the  junior U.S. senator from California. Wilson relies heavily on talented and  loyal aides -- mostly white and male -- but also reaches beyond this coterie to  a variety of experts. On occasion, even those closest to him are not likely to  know which way Wilson will tilt on an issue until he announces his decision.  </P> <P> John G. Davies, a former law school colleague who often is described as  Wilson's oldest and closest friend, recalls that he was taken totally by  surprise when Wilson decided to seek his first elective office in 1966.  </P> <P> "I was astounded when he told me he was going to run for the Assembly. I had no  inkling," said Davies, who received his political education with Wilson in  Richard Nixon's 1962 gubernatorial campaign and still counsels the senator on  some issues, including helping screen potential nominees for federal  judgeships.  </P> <P> But these days, there aren't many surprises when Wilson finally decides an  issue, Davies added. "The process is too gradual to contain surprise." With a  deep chuckle, almost a guffaw, Davies added, "He never moves fast enough."  </P> <P> Those who have worked closely with Wilson talk about his demands for the facts  -- all the facts. "He comes not lightly to decisions. Therefore, he does not  come lightly to changes," said Robert S. White, the chief of Wilson's 80-member  Senate staff who has been with Wilson since 1966.  </P> <P> If he is elected governor on Nov. 6, associates say, there will be no elite  "kitchen cabinet" of wealthy California businessmen such as counseled Ronald  Reagan, and no eclectic circle of former seminary classmates and  alternative-politics gurus who engaged in late-night gab fests with Jerry  Brown. Nor would there be the sort of small, mysterious circle -- some in  Sacramento refer to it as a "black box" -- that George Deukmejian seems to draw  on for information and advice.  </P> <P> Wilson may touch bases with old chums and a few wealthy advisers -- the Irvine  Co.'s Donald L. Bren, for example, or San Diego savings and loan executive  Gordon C. Luce. But they say he is more likely to call them to chat about local  political trends than the nuts-and-bolts decisions of government, turning  instead to professionals for expert opinion.  </P> <P> One biographical account of Bren, the reclusive Orange County developer,  described him and Wilson as old Marine buddies and claimed that Wilson would  not have run for governor without the proper signal from him. If so, that would  seem to make Bren a potential power behind the throne.  </P> <P> But Wilson aides insist that Bren has no such influence over Wilson. Wilson  said their relationship dates from the unsuccessful 1974 gubernatorial campaign  of Republican Houston I. Flournoy. "That's what it is: It's a friendship,"  Wilson said. He acknowledged that he might discuss a housing or planning issue  with the billionaire developer but said he did that with Irvine Co. officials  long before Bren took over the firm.  </P> <P> "If there is an inner circle, it's a large one," said Otto Bos, a former  newspaper reporter who has served Wilson for 14 years in a variety of roles.  </P> <P> Bos is directing Wilson's campaign against Democrat Dianne Feinstein for  governor. Were there a club of Wilson insiders, Bos would be one of its charter  members and gatekeepers. So would White and campaign manager George Gorton, who  has been Wilson's chief political sidekick since the first race for mayor in  1971 and is in over-all charge of the 1990 election effort. This, in a sense,  is Wilson's San Diego clique, those who have been with Wilson for 10 years or  longer, going back to his days as mayor and even as a state legislator.  </P> <P> But when it comes to specific issues or problems to be solved, there is a much  larger circle of advisers to which Wilson can be expected to turn.  </P> <P> The campaign has compiled a list of experts and advisers in various fields with  whom Wilson consulted during his years as San Diego's mayor. It contains 69  names, including some Democrats, and ranges from scientists at the Scripps  Institution of Oceanography to a former school board member also identified as  the president of the San Diego Catfish Club. This is not exactly an exclusive  circle and is typical of the wide field of friends, associates and  acquaintances of anyone who has been in politics and government for nearly a  quarter century.  </P> <P> Bos said Wilson may have talked to as many as 200 people as he pondered whether  to pursue the governorship so soon after his 1988 reelection to a second Senate  term.  </P> <P> The process included extensive private briefings in Sacramento by Deukmejian  Administration officials, members of the Legislature, lobbyists and others,  including onetime Assembly Speaker Robert T. Monagan, former head of the  California Manufacturers Assn., and Kirk West, a former state finance official  now president of the California Chamber of Commerce.  </P> <P> Actually, there was little need for Wilson to test the political waters because  he was all but drafted by key Republicans who saw him as the one GOP leader  with a chance to continue the Republican reign in Sacramento.  </P> <P> Rather, the briefings he sought were designed to assess the state of the state,  to find out if the office was worth having -- if California with all its growth  and problems still can be managed by a governor.  </P> <P> In an interview, Wilson said he went to Sacramento in search of "a fairly  candid and cold-blooded assessment. . . . And then I made a decision."  </P> <P> "It was doable," Wilson concluded. "Not easy, but doable. I decided change was  needed and change could be effected and it was going to take someone who was  willing to shake things up and that's when I decided to do it."  </P> <P> Davies believes that Wilson's thoroughness is a legacy of his legal training.  </P> <P> "You don't want to have unknown facts surface later," said Davies. "There's an  abhorrence of that." Yet, when deadlines and demands of government do not  permit the luxury of unlimited study, Davies said Wilson is "perfectly capable  of making an educated guess and saying, 'We've got to go with it.' But he  doesn't like it."  </P> <P> Given the flood of information that swamps senators these days, Wilson puts a  priority on someone who can cut to the heart of the matter. Wilson sometimes  will assemble groups of contenders to hash out an issue, but that is  time-consuming and is not done often. After that, the written staff memo,  ranging from one to perhaps seven pages, is Wilson's preference.  </P> <P> "If it is well-written, it actually saves time," Wilson said. "If it is concise  and really highlights the pertinent information, it spots the issue or issues,  gives the background, what the question is before us, here are the options,  here are the recommendations. That's a good memorandum."  </P> <P> Wilson then smiled briefly and added: "Assuming they're making the right  recommendations."  </P> <P> Wilson's background yields at least one case in which he may have wished there  had been more questions asked, more fact-checking done. In 1973, the mayor's  office was advised that some old bombs had been found in a housing development  built on a former artillery range. Wilson asked the Army to sweep the area to  make it safe. He later was advised that several dozen rounds of spent  ammunition had been found, but military officials urged that "due caution still  be taken" as other shells could work their way to the surface.  </P> <P> In late 1983, after Wilson had moved on to the Senate, two young boys were  killed when an old artillery shell they found exploded. The city eventually  settled with their families on a $2.5-million liability payment. Some critics  said that the Wilson Administration and the housing developers should have been  more diligent in making sure there was no further hazard.  </P> <P> In an interview with The Times early this year, the senator commented: "I would  have to say in hindsight, because a child died, not enough was done, I suppose.  But at the time, I think that the mayor and the City Council, who had asked  that the survey be undertaken, were probably entitled to rely on the assurance  that was given."  </P> <P> But there are few case studies about Wilson being ill-prepared for the  unexpected, his aides say. On the down side, his immersion into facts,  sometimes pushing political ideology into the background, and his relish for  government policy have helped forge Wilson's image as a passive technocrat  rather than a politician who knows how to push the emotional buttons of voters.  This is the sort of man who exhibits a sense of awe as he describes the U.S.  Senate as "an intellectual candy store" because of all the sources of  information at the disposal of senators.  </P> <P> But chief of staff White and others describe a different Wilson. They say he  can be witty and engaging, launching into lively philosophical debates and  sometimes telling old war stories from his Assembly days that he punctuates  with uncannily realistic impressions of long-dead legislators.  </P> <P> "He is certainly willing to get into a discussion when you disagree with him,"  White said. "We have some strong discussions."  </P> <P> When Wilson was called on to remember occasions in which one fact or another  tipped the balance on an important decision, he chose a case that was fraught  with emotion. In this instance it was an intensely personal story rather than a  compilation of the facts that made the difference.  </P> <P> The setting was the Legislature in 1967 and the issue was California's  controversial proposed abortion law, then considered one of the most liberal in  the nation. This was a tough vote for a freshman Republican assemblyman and  Wilson listened carefully to both sides of the issue.  </P> <P> Finally, a man Wilson did not identify came to him with the story of his  daughter who had become pregnant and, in light of existing legal restrictions,  performed her own abortion "in a very inept, amateurish fashion." The parents  learned of it only when advised by the family doctor that their daughter most  likely could never have children.  </P> <P> Wilson said the incident convinced him that the question of abortion was so  personal that government should not be involved and that severe restrictions  would only encourage law-abiding citizens to seek "back-alley" solutions to  unwanted pregnancies. He voted for the statute that greatly liberalized  conditions under which abortions could be obtained in California. The law  remains in effect today.  </P> <P> Yet Wilson opposes the federal government paying for abortions performed on  poor women. He argues that privately funded abortions are available, so his  vote against Medicaid is not limiting a poor woman's access to abortion.  </P> <P> Gayle Wilson, who supports federal funding for abortions, said she is "still  working on him" to change his mind. "He said, 'If you can show me a study that  says poor women aren't getting abortions because there's no funding, then I'd  be willing to look at it differently,' " Gayle Wilson said.  </P> <P> When Wilson broke into politics in California, associates say there were few  women and minorities involved in key GOP positions. And with Wilson, it is  apparent that friendships and associations tend to be long-lasting.  </P> <P> Shortly after winning his Assembly seat in 1966, Wilson was quickly welcomed  into an Assembly leadership group of moderate Republicans. It was here that he  formed a circle of friendships that remains today and may provide a pool for  some key appointees to state jobs or judgeships if Wilson becomes governor.  </P> <P> "When Pete came in in '67, we were immediately attracted to him. He was a  bright guy who obviously had some great future," Former Republican Assemblyman  William T. Bagley said in an interview.  </P> <P> In the nation's capital, there is less unanimity about members of Wilson's  Washington circle. Nearly everyone mentions Sen. Warren B. Rudman (R-N.H.) and  Judge Laurence H. Silberman of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, a  former Honolulu lawyer who became involved in Wilson's 1982 Senate campaign.  </P> <P> Gayle Wilson cited Rudman and Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.). There are reports  that Wilson and Vice President Dan Quayle were relatively close when Quayle  represented Indiana in the Senate, but Wilson does not volunteer Quayle's name  as among the inner circle. Wilson did mention Rudman, and also Sen. Robert W.  (Bob) Packwood (R-Ore.).  </P> <P> "He and I have had some knock-down, drag-out fights," Wilson said of Packwood.  "We've become pretty good friends."  </P> <P> </P> <P> WILSON'S TOP AIDES  </P> <P>  Sen. Pete Wilson's top staff aides are notable among other factors for their  longevity with the senator, who is the Republican nominee for governor of  California. Four of Wilson's top aides have spent a total of nearly 60 years  with him, dating back to his membership in the state Assembly in 1967. Here is  a rundown of his top aides:  </P> <P> GEORGE GORTON, 43, of San Diego, is Wilson's campaign manager with  responsibility for overall direction of the campaign. He attended Munich  University as part of an armed forces-University of Maryland extension program  and is a political science and economics graduate of San Diego State  University. Gorton, a political consultant, first worked for Wilson in his 1971  campaign for mayor of San Diego. He managed Wilson's winning campaign for the  Senate in 1982 and was the lead consultant when Wilson was reelected to the  Senate in 1988. Gorton also has worked in the presidential campaigns of Richard  M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford and George Bush.  </P> <P> ROBERT S. WHITE, 48, of San Diego, has been Wilson's top staff assistant since  1967 when Wilson was elected to his first political office, a San Diego seat in  the state Assembly. When Wilson became mayor of San Diego in 1971, White went  with him as chief of staff. He has been the top aide in Wilson's Senate office  in Washington since 1983, in charge of a full-time staff of about 80. White is  a veteran of the U.S. Coast Guard and holds a bachelor's degree in political  science and journalism from San Diego State.  </P> <P> OTTO BOS, 45, is a native of the Netherlands whose family immigrated to the San  Francisco Bay Area when he was 13. He graduated from San Francisco State  University with a degree in journalism and history. Bos, a Vietnam veteran,  covered politics and government for the San Diego Union from 1971 until joining  Wilson as his City Hall press secretary in 1977. Bos went to Washington in 1983  to serve as Wilson's Senate press secretary, returning to California several  years later to lay the groundwork for Wilson's reelection bid. As director of  Wilson's campaign for governor, Bos is in charge of the day-to-day operation.  </P> <P> WILLIAM D. LIVINGSTONE, 38, is press secretary for Wilson's campaign for  governor, working out of campaign headquarters in San Diego's Old Town.  Livingstone is a 1974 graduate, with honors, in film and television from  Montana State University in Bozeman and did graduate work at USC. After various  ventures in the film business and studies in foreign relations, Livingstone  went to work for the Senate Republican Conference in 1981 and then became press  secretary for U.S. Sen. James A. McClure (R-Idaho). He joined Wilson's Senate  staff as press secretary when Bos moved back to California in 1988 and later  joined the gubernatorial campaign as press secretary.  </P> <P> LOREN KAYE, 34, of Sacramento, serves as campaign research director, as he did  in Wilson's 1982 campaign. Kaye also has worked in the office of Gov. George  Deukmejian, most recently as deputy cabinet secretary. Kaye is the son of Peter  Kaye, a veteran San Diego newspaperman who also served in Wilson's first  campaign for mayor.  </P> <P> ROSALIE ZALIS, 53, of Los Angeles, director of coalitions, is in charge of  Wilson's statewide organizational effort to mobilize women. She also serves as  the campaign's liaison to the Jewish community. Zalis has been a political  writer and analyst specializing in foreign affairs and women's issues. She was  San Fernando Valley co-chair of the Reagan-Bush campaign in 1984 and the Bush  campaign in 1988.  </P> <P> CAP FOR MUG  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIMBAUGH'S HECKLERS  </P> <P> Your silence is deafening. . . .  </P> <P> KFI-AM's infamous Rush Limbaugh appeared on "The Pat Sajak Show" March 30.  </P> <P> As I write this, it is four days later. This is The Times' town. Has the  newspaper lost its voice?  </P> <P> Yes, Rick Du Brow had a short item April 3 in which he used the rather benign  term "hecklers." But it doesn't take much imagination to visualize The Times'  outrage had the victim been a liberal and the hecklers what the media usually  calls "dangerous and fascistic right-wing extremist censors who are destroying  free speech."  </P> <P> ANN NORMAN, Newport Beach  </P></p>

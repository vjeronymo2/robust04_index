			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / People: All change at Woolworths as Barnes departs Woolworths' managing director Mair Barnes, one of the UK's most successful female executives and a former Business Woman of the Year, has surprised the retail world by resigning 'for personal reasons'. Woolworths' parent Kingfisher refuses to comment on the reasons for the departure of Barnes - who had been tipped in the past as a possible successor to group chairman Sir Geoff Mulcahy. She will be replaced by Jonathan Weeks, currently strategy and business development director. Barnes, 49, started out as a graduate trainee at Harrods before becoming the House of Fraser's first woman store manager at Howells of Cardiff. She joined Woolworths, part of the Kingfisher group, in 1985, initially as merchandise director. Later, when she told Mulcahy that she was not happy with Woolworths' direction, she found he agreed and made her managing director of the operation - just two years after she had joined the group. She then proceeded to turn a Pounds 5m loss into a Pounds 45m profit within four years through cutting Woolworths' range and building its strength in children's clothes, sweets, toys, videos and CDs. She transformed what had been seen as a dinosaur of the high street into a success story, and was well-rewarded. A survey last year identified her as one of the UK's 50 best-paid women. The improvement continued through to last year, when operating profits for the year to January 30 reached a record Pounds 77.8m, on sales of Pounds 1.2bn. However, since Kingfisher appointed former Marks and Spencer stores director Alan Smith as group chief executive last year, Smith has shown a particular interest in the Woolworths chain, and is expected to announce new initiatives to ensure the chain's continuing success. He has also shaken up Woolworths' management, bringing in Bharat Patel from Tesco as finance director, and has just appointed Saeed Hatteea, presently with Marks and Spencer, as merchandise director. Barnes' replacement, Jonathan Weeks, joined Woolworths in 1984 as director of distribution, and later became operations director. He was appointed MD of Entertainment UK in 1989, and became a member of Kingfisher's management committee in 1992. He is said to have particular expertise in the operations, distribution and supply chain side of the business. Before joining Kingfisher group, Weeks was managing director of SPD, the distribution subsidiary of Unilever, and previously worked at Hoover, Black &amp; Decker and Bass.</p>

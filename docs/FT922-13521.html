			<p>920411 FT  11 APR 92 / Peruvian jail massacre feared PERUVIAN human rights groups said yesterday they feared an imminent massacre inside a high security prison for Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) guerrillas, after troops and armoured vehicles were seen entering the precinct. One of President Alberto Fujimori's first decrees after overthrowing democracy in a palace coup last Sunday was to put the army and police in charge of Peru's prisons. The wardens were perceived to have lost control inside jails such as the Miguel Castro Castro, which the Shining Path has turned into a no man's land. A heavy crackdown inside Castro Castro would allow Mr Fujimori to claim an early success for his military-backed 'emergency government'. It would boost army morale and raise the president-turned-strongman's already high rating in public opinion polls. In a further indication of a crackdown, the army has requisitioned a large hospital in Lima in apparent anticipation of heavy casualties. The tension surrounding the army's next move has added to the state of limbo that has engulfed the capital following Mr Fujimori's coup. On the surface, little has changed in Lima. The tanks and troops that guard the empty congress and supreme court - which Mr Fujimori has closed - are not unusual in a country accustomed to living under a state of siege. The soldiers look bored. Pedestrians hardly notice them. Lima's chaotic traffic roars by. It is hard to find anyone in the street who mourns the demise of congress. Their reasons are variations on a theme: politicians and judges are corrupt, self-serving parasites in a poor country that could not afford them. They echo Mr Fujimori's relentless attacks against parliament and the judiciary since his election 22 months ago. Snap opinion polls this week gave Mr Fujimori over 70 per cent support for knocking out the two other powers of the state. The president is using his standing in opinion polls to legitimise his actions. 'Congress was not a temple of a democracy, it was a market for bartering laws,' he told a gathering of exporters, promising to excise corruption from all walks of public life. His speech, broadcast live to the nation, was strong on rhetoric and short on concrete plans for government. As he claimed that supreme court judges could be bribed for a mere Dollars 20,000 (Pounds 11,600), several of the sober-suited gentlemen in the audience looked embarrassed. Mr Fujimori on Thursday sacked 13 judges who had been appointed by his predecessor and arch enemy, Mr Alan Garcia. Mr Garcia is in hiding, along with another dozen leading figures of his party, the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance. Several other politicians have been placed under house arrest or detained. The repression has been selective but it has thrown political parties into disarray. Press censorship has been lifted, and one can talk to detained congressmen on the telephone, even as their houses are surrounded by tanks and army units. A large number of the now redundant congressmen met in secret on Thursday night to impeach President Fujimori and nominate a successor, Mr Carlos Garcia Garcia. It was a symbolic action, almost devoid of meaning in the face of so much public indifference.</p>

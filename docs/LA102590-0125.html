			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. JOINS U.N. COUNCIL IN 2ND REBUKE OF ISRAEL;  </P> <P> MIDEAST: THE RESOLUTION DEPLORES JERUSALEM'S REJECTION OF INVESTIGATION OF  TEMPLE MOUNT KILLINGS.  </P> <P> Underscoring growing strains between traditional allies, the United States  voted Wednesday to support a U.N. Security Council resolution deploring the  refusal of Israel to allow a U.N. mission to visit Jerusalem to investigate the  killing of 21 Palestinians earlier this month.  </P> <P> It was the second time in less than two weeks that the Bush Administration has  sided against Israel in the Security Council. On Oct. 12 the United States,  usually a staunch defender of Israel, joined in unanimously condemning that  nation for the killings on the Temple Mount.  </P> <P> The latest vote by the Administration against Israel came as the United States  again was forced to decide between offending the Israelis or keeping the  allegiance of Arab nations aligned against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.  </P> <P> In Wednesday's resolution, the council expressed alarm at the refusal of the  government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to accept a mission from U.N.  Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar. It also said it was "gravely  concerned" about the continued deterioration of the situation in the occupied  West Bank and Gaza.  </P> <P> The council urged Israel to reconsider its decision and insisted that it permit  the mission.  </P> <P> "I am very pleased to see that the unanimity that the council achieved when it  adopted the original resolution has been maintained," said the Security  Council's current president, British Ambassador David Hannay. " . . . I think  it sends a stronger signal when the council adopts a resolution unanimously,  particularly in this area, which so often has been the object of divisions in  the council.  </P> <P> "The principal loser in not receiving this mission will be Israel itself," he  added.  </P> <P> Before the vote, Israel's U.N. ambassador, Johanan Bein, charged that the Oct.  8 rioting in Jerusalem -- in which Palestinians hurled rocks at Jews worshiping  at the Western Wall and police and security forces opened fire -- was  deliberately instigated by the Palestine Liberation Organization as a means of  diverting world attention from the Persian Gulf crisis.  </P> <P> "Something strange has happened. The momentum (against Iraq) has come to a  screeching halt," Bein said during a nearly hourlong impassioned defense of his  government's position. "For the moment, Saddam Hussein has been let off the  hook.  </P> <P> ". . . It happens to be the oldest trick in the book: Blame the victim," Bein  added. "(The PLO) managed to touch off a storm of violence on the Temple Mount  for all the world to see. . . . They knew perfectly well that this was the last  thing Israel needed and the last thing anyone hoping to dislodge Iraq's  aggression could possibly hope for."  </P> <P> Bein met briefly with reporters after the vote. "My basic reaction is we have  seen this film before," he declared.  </P> <P> On Friday, after more than a week of intense behind-the-scenes discussions,  Perez de Cuellar told the council that he would not send a mission to Jerusalem  under the present circumstances. He rejected suggestions by Israeli diplomats  that his report be based in good measure on an independent Israeli commission  inquiry into the Temple Mount violence.  </P> <P> The secretary general's statement set the stage for Wednesday's Security  Council criticism. Colombia, Cuba, Malaysia and Yemen submitted a draft  resolution demanding that the mission be allowed to travel to Jerusalem.  </P> <P> In a last-ditch attempt to head off the Security Council vote, President Bush  had urged Shamir to reverse his position and agree to accept the U.N.  investigation, thus making the latest resolution moot.  </P> <P> State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Bush wrote "that our  preference would be . . . to find a way to let the secretary general's mission  come to Israel." She said the letter, sent from the White House on Tuesday,  mirrored what Bush has said publicly on the subject.  </P> <P> Tutwiler also confirmed that the Security Council's decision to take up the  second Israel resolution at all was a defeat for U.S. diplomacy, which had  sought an early vote on a resolution condemning Iraq for its attempt to starve  out embassies in Kuwait. American officials considered the Israel debate to be  a needless distraction.  </P> <P> "We have got to grapple with this (Israel resolution) first, unfortunately,"  Tutwiler said. "The United States' position has been since last Friday that we  would like to get the focus where it should be, back on the gulf."  </P> <P> At one point in negotiations at the United Nations, the United States had  backed a plan by Hannay that a milder Security Council statement be substituted  for the resolution. But when the resolution's sponsors demanded a vote, the  idea of the statement was scotched.  </P> <P> The secretary general has until the end of the month to report on the violence  in Jerusalem. And even as the council voted against Israel on Wednesday,  diplomatic efforts to find a compromise were continuing.  </P> <P> Some Israeli diplomats suggested that once the internal three-member commission  reports on the events in Jerusalem, that report could be given to a top aide of  Perez de Cuellar, or perhaps the secretary general could send an envoy to  Israel for clarifications.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the slowing of momentum at the United Nations on the Persian Gulf  issue was very much on some council members' minds.  </P> <P> "We want to dispose of this problem of the mission to Jerusalem, and we have to  return back to the main problem that confronts the Security Council," said Yuli  M. Vorontsov, the Soviet ambassador.  </P> <P> U.S. officials in Washington and at the United Nations said American diplomats  are rounding up support for a new series of resolutions attacking Iraq that  will be introduced as soon as the Israeli matter is disposed of.  </P> <P> The first U.S. priority is a resolution condemning Iraq's refusal to permit  embassies in Kuwait to receive food and water. All but three Western nations --  the United States, Britain and France -- have already succumbed to the pressure  and closed their diplomatic missions in Kuwait. But those three nations are all  permanent members of the Security Council.  </P> <P> The U.S. government hopes to follow the resupply resolution with measures  setting the stage for war crimes trials of Hussein and his top aides and  ordering Iraq to pay reparations to Kuwait. All three resolutions are purely  symbolic because none could be enforced without the military defeat of the  Iraqi army. But a senior U.S. official said that a Security Council vote to  begin war crimes trials, for instance, might make Hussein think twice about  additional aggression.  </P> <P> Officials at the United Nations said additional resolutions are being prepared  to cut off telecommunications links between Iraq and the outside world and to  order U.N. members to reduce the number of Iraqi diplomats at embassies  worldwide.  </P> <P> U.S. officials concede, however, that none of the proposed resolutions will  hurt Iraq nearly as much as the trade embargo that was invoked in August.  </P></p>

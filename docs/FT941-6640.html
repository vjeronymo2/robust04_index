			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Management: British David takes on US Goliaths - Meiko is a private UK company in a sector dominated by American rivals It is rare for a small, private UK company to venture into the global market of an industry that is indisputably led by the US, and beat all comers hands-down. But Bristol-based Meiko has done just that. Founded in 1985 by six engineers who specialised in the concept of high-performance computing, Meiko now employs 180 people and has an installed worldwide base of more than 440 systems. The company's key technology is massively parallel processing (MPP), a tiny new supercomputing sector, estimated to be worth Dollars 890m (Pounds 610m) by 1996, with an annual growth rate of 25 per cent. MPP systems combine hundreds or even thousands of cheap commodity chips to create much higher processing power at a much lower price than conventional supercomputers. Meiko has been catapulted into competition with established big companies such as Cray Research, International Business Machines and Thinking Machines. Meiko is estimated to have cornered 25 per cent of the global MPP market and is the industry leader in Europe. The only big UK company in the field, Meiko sees itself as a cosmopolitan contender. 'We are a global company working with global customers in a global market,' insists John Fuchs-Chesney, director of the UK holding company, Meiko Limited of Bristol, and executive vice-president of Meiko Scientific, the US subsidiary based in Waltham, Massachusetts. Meiko's international qualities were a critical component in a bidding match that upset the supercomputing industry in July 1993. Meiko beat all US competitors on their home turf when it won the pitch to supply the government-funded Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, California, with its latest and most powerful machine, the CS2 (Computing Surface 2). 'Were Meiko a purely British operation, we would never have won that contract,' says Fuchs-Chesney. US competitors claimed that national security would be jeopardised, but Meiko had made sure that the terms of sale in both cases satisfied all federal and national requirements for the US and the UK. 'If the guys at Livermore decided that this is what they want, they should be able to buy it,' comments Gary Smaby, a Minneapolis-based market researcher. The indignant clamour from the competition has abated since preliminary acceptance trials run by Livermore proved successful. 'The outcome of the tests was better than we expected,' says Mark Seager, who runs the testing unit at Livermore. 'The acceptance criteria were some of the most stringent we have ever imposed.' Meiko's unpublished revenues are said to have doubled in 1993 with this single Dollars 17.5m sale. Despite this coup, Fuchs-Chesney is reluctant to dramatise the company's success. Whereas the US high-tech industry is prone to taking immature companies public, Meiko is cautious about cashing in on success prematurely. 'These things take time,' says Fuchs-Chesney. 'It may take three to five years of development with a client before they buy into the risk of a new market sector.'</p>

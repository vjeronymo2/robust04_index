			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter He Jingsong (6320 0513 2646)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 13 Apr (XINHUA) -- China's commodity  markets are beginning to take shape. The nation now has over  100,000 commodity markets of all descriptions, and the  ubiquitous spot markets and specialized markets in urban and  rural areas are playing an important role in the national  economic development.    According to statistics, the nation has now 53 national  commodity trade centers and large wholesale markets; over 76,000  urban and rural trade markets, including 1,600 wholesale markets  of agricultural and sideline products; and over 3,000 small  industrial goods trade markets, including 400 wholesale markets.    These markets have created a primary network of all kinds of  markets at all levels. While a main framework comprising  primary, regional, and national markets has been formed for  grain trade, a structure made up of large, medium, and small  markets around wholesale markets has been created for vegetable  and fruit distribution. Under this structure, markets in areas  of production, transshipment, and consumption are coordinated.  For industrial consumer goods, in addition to all kinds of  wholesale markets, there are also meetings for trade  negotiations, commodity trade fairs, and markets which also  provide storage services and engage in wholesale and retail  businesses. Chain stores have appeared in Beijing, Tianjin,  Shanghai, and other large and medium cities. The traditional  integrated and spot markets of capital goods are gradually  developing into specialized markets engaging in intermediate and  long-range contract trade, and they are gradually becoming major  avenues of resource distribution.    As most of China's capital goods and means of livelihood are  being distributed through nationwide networks of commodity  markets, market regulation is gradually expanding both in scope  and proportion. Currently 90 percent of industrial consumer  goods and 85 percent of capital goods are sold at prices  determined by market supply and demand. Meanwhile, collective  and independent enterprises have joined supply and marketing  organs and networks of state-owned distributors and producers in  demonstrating their abilities in the sphere of distribution.  This has created a distribution pattern characterized by the  distribution of all types of commodities and services through  all kinds of channels. While state-owned distributors are fully  market-oriented, enterprises in charge of supplies have geared  over 90 percent of their operations to market forces. Commodity  markets' trading and management are beginning to be standardized  and institutionalized. The management of the large trade  centers and large wholesale markets by administrative  committees, boards of directors, and boards of supervisors has  expedited the commodity markets' healthy development.</p>

			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Council spending curb may be eased RELAXATION of the rules that stop local authorities spending receipts from council-house sales is being considered by the government as a central element in the economic recovery programme promised for the Autumn Statement. Ministers also voiced confidence yesterday that an unconditional offer of private finance by the administrators of the Canary Wharf development would open the way for approval of London Underground's planned Jubilee Line extension to Docklands. The U-turn on capital receipts, which would push up public borrowing but would not count against next year's Pounds 244.5bn public-expenditure target, might help to defuse a threatened political backlash against deep cuts in Whitehall spending programmes. The Treasury is expected to accept at least a temporary relaxation of the rules. Local authorities have more than Pounds 5bn in accumulated receipts which they can use only to pay off debts. Release of a small proportion for housing repair budgets and for house building by housing associations could provide a significant boost for the construction industry. But a cabinet negotiating session later today on overall spending priorities is threatening to develop into a series of interdepartmental battles over the proposed spending cuts. The cabinet will be told that the squeeze might leave some households in southern England facing a rise in their annual tax bills of Pounds 250 as a result of the replacement of the poll tax with the council tax. Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, will warn that the Treasury's rejection of a more generous transitional relief scheme for the new tax might leave many homeowners in the south with an increase of Pounds 100 a year. The proposed transitional scheme has yet to be worked out in detail. Mr Howard is fiercely resisting a Treasury suggestion that any rebates should be based on notional rather than actual bills. The present arithmetic points to those in the top property band for the council tax being forced to meet any rise in bills of up to Pounds 5 a week, those in the middle band up to Pounds 2 a week and those in the lowest Pounds 1 a week. Other senior ministers, however, are likely to set Mr Howard's warnings of a potential revolt on the Tory back benches against their concerns to defend their own budgets. Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, and Mr Peter Lilley, social services secretary, are among those fighting cuts in their budgets. Mrs Shephard faces a reduction in her training budget in spite of the sharp rise in unemployment. Mr Lilley is threatened with a freeze on a number of social security benefits. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, has been told she must accept a cash reduction totalling hundreds of millions of pounds in her budget. Mr John Patten, education secretary, is warning of large-scale redundancies among teachers as a result of planned cuts in his budget. Senior ministers remain divided about public-sector pay, with most arguing for increases to be held to about 2 per cent or slightly less but some still pressing for a freeze.</p>

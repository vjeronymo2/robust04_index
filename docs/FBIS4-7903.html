			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 5 April (MTI) -- As reported earlier,  audience protests disrupted Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza  Jeszenszky's speech to a World War II Jewish Holocaust  conference today. Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky's speech, to  a conference on the Hungarian Holocaust at the Budapest  University of Arts and Sciences, was drowned out by stamping and  slow handclapping from audience members when he drew a parallel  between Communism and Nazism.    A statement sent to MTI by the Hungarian Foreign Ministry  today says Jeszenszky originally did not plan to contribute to  the conference. However, he changed his mind when inspired by  formal greetings, first of all by those of Chief Rabbi Jozsef  Schweitzer, who expressed the hope that the conference would  help people become familiar with justice and promote spiritual  reconciliation.    Moved to contribute, Jeszenszky said he was pleased to  realize that he could identify himself with the overwhelming  majority of views expounded in the opening speeches.    Jeszenszky said it was Nazism that made it possible for  Bolshevism to gain ground in Hungary. It cannot be forgotten  that the liberation of Hungary in 1945 marked the beginning of  another, decades-long dictatorship, he said. The minister  quoted late prime minister Jozsef Antall as saying that both  Nazism and Communism are barbarous ideas which should be  condemned together.    At that point, some people in a corner of the hall started  handclapping -- to prevent the minister from ending his speech  rather than express their approval of his ideas, the statement  says.</p>

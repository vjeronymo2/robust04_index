			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / International Company News: Cemex bid is for 74% only CEMENTOS MEXICANOS, stung by a 17 per cent fall in its shares after agreeing to buy Valenciana de Cementos, Spain's largest cement producer, yesterday revealed it had no intention of buying the whole company. It said it would pay Dollars 1.25bn for just 74.1 per cent of the Spanish company. Earlier pronouncements by the Spanish advisers to Cemex, the world's fourth-largest cement-maker, had said it was taking control of 100 per cent of Valenciana, which would have cost it close to Dollars 1.7bn. The Mexican company said yesterday, however, that 25.9 per cent of Valenciana, held as treasury stock by the Spanish company, would not form part of the takeover offer it has made. Valenciana accumulated the treasury stock earlier this year when it bought full control of an affiliate which, in turn, owned Valenciana shares. The company, by law, has three years to dispose of it. Cemex has so far paid Dollars 419m, privately, for 24.9 per cent of Valenciana held mostly by the Serratosa family that controls Valenciana and by the Scandinavian producers, Akem and Euroc. It has also been promised a further 29.1 per cent by the Serratosas, Aker and Euroc at the formal public offer price of Pta15,075 a share. That will cost another Dollars 496m. The 20.1 per cent of Valencia traded on the markets will cost another Dollars 343m if all the shareholders take up the offer. Officials said Cemex would pay Dollars 500m in cash for the acquisition and the company had been promised financing worth at least Dollars 750m by Citibank. The acquisition will raise Cemex's debt to capital ratio from 38 to 44 per cent, according to J. P. Morgan, who advised on the deal.</p>

After the opposition's failure in parliament today to have a  law on early elections passed, Weiss said that he gave priority  to negotiations by all parliamentary parties on the date of the  elections. He also said that the parliament could bind the  president to calling a referendum on early elections in November.    Weiss expressed the suspicion that Meciar's campaign for a  referendum would be led in such a way so that voters agreed with  the exit from the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) of  those deputies who had infringed party discipline, and would say  no to early elections. Meciar would also try and join in the  referendum the question of the date of the elections and that of  whether deputies who had left the party to which they were  elected should be expelled from parliament, Weiss said.    With this scenario, Weiss said, "difficult" politicians  could  be removed from parliament and the parliamentary support of the  present government coalition would be guaranteed until the end  of the regular electoral term in 1996. However, this idea would  meet with "great resistance" from the public, Weiss said.</p>

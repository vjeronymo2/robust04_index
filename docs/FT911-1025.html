			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Brundtland hopeful of EEA treaty Norway's prime minister, Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, visited Brussels yesterday to dispel the gloom over negotiations to create the 18-nation European Economic Area (EEA), but also to stress that control of fish stocks was of vital interest for Norway as well as Iceland, writes David Buchan in Brussels. After meeting Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, Mrs Brundtland said an EEA treaty was still possible by the target deadline of late June. She would not follow Austria and Sweden in applying for membership, but would launch a debate in Norway on EC entry next year. Whatever happened, Norway would seek close ties with the Western European Union (WEU) in the security field.</p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Steetley on offensive over claims in Spain by Redland STEETLEY, which is fighting a Pounds 600m takeover bid from Redland, the rival building materials group, yesterday moved onto the offensive over allegations that it had over-estimated its Spanish aggregate reserves. Redland, which had hired independent geologists to investigate Steetley's quarries in France and Spain, claimed at the weekend that the reserves of five companies in the Madrid area were much less than Steetley had implied when it bought the businesses for Pounds 24.6m in 1988. Mr David Donne, Steetley chairman, said yesterday that Redland's claims were inaccurate and based on a meeting which had not taken place. He said that the mayor of Velilla de San Antonio had denied having met the geologists as they had claimed. The investigation for Redland was conducted by the Spanish arm of BRGM, the French institute of geology. In a letter to Redland, the geologists had said that their findings had been based on site inspections, geological studies and interviews with local people, including the mayor. They had concluded that the reserves were no more than 30m tonnes and that planning permission was likely to be granted for only half of this because of plans to establish a nature reserve in the area. Mr Donne said yesterday that Redland had conducted an 'over-the-wall geological study and got it wrong badly'. Steetley had commissioned a full study prior to making the acquisitions. This showed that there were 59m tonnes of sand and gravel reserves. When it acquired the businesses in 1988, the group had said that there were 30 years' worth of proven sand and gravel reserves at current rates of production. Redland said that this had implied reserves of at least 48m tonnes. Last night Mr Donne noted that BRGM had also conducted a survey of Steetley's French reserves which had also claimed that they were much lower than had previously been thought. Redland said last night: 'An independent assessment of Steetley's Spanish assets was done at our request. Its findings included the fact that part of these reserves are situated in an area proposed as a nature reserve. This has not been disputed by Steetley and it demonstrates the great difficulty in placing values on these assets.' See Lex</p>

			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAKEOVER NEWS SPURS MARKET; DOW UP 11.95  </P> <P> The stock market rallied Tuesday, extending its gains for a sixth straight  session as news of a fresh blockbuster takeover bid lured bystanders back into  the market.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial index finished up 11.95 at 2,514.61, but that was well  below its high for the day as profit taking eroded some of the market's early  gains.  </P> <P> Gaining issues outnumbered losers by about 8 to 5 in nationwide trading of New  York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 926 up, 579 down and 500 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 171.59 million shares, up from 131.87 million Monday.  </P> <P> Tobacco issues led the advance, buoyed by a $21.2-billion bid for Britain's BAT  Industries PLC by raider Sir James Goldsmith and two of his associates.  </P> <P> The bid for BAT is the largest in British history and second in size only to  another tobacco-giant takeover, Kohlberg Kravis &amp; Co.'s $25-billion bid for  RJR Nabisco, which was completed earlier this year.  </P> <P> News of the bid for BAT boosted tobacco shares by fueling takeover speculation  in the group and highlighting their bargain prices relative to their strong  growth prospects, analysts said.  </P> <P> "The strength started in American Brands and Philip Morris and then spread to  food stocks -- anything you put in your mouth," said Trude Latimer at  Josephthal &amp; Co.  </P> <P> Stock prices closed well below their session highs, however, as the market's  advance spurred investors to take profits and triggered futures-related  selling.  </P> <P> The Dow index previously touched a session high of 2,531.11, a level of strong  resistance.  </P> <P> American Depositary Receipts for BAT, traded on the American Stock Exchange,  jumped 2-15/16 to 14 3/8 on news of a $13.94-a-share bid from Goldsmith's  group. The stock was the most actively traded on the exchange, with 7.07  million shares changing hands.  </P> <P> Tobacco and food giant Philip Morris Cos. rose 2 1/8 to 143 3/4 in sympathy,  while American Brands Inc. gained 1 1/2 to 71 3/8. UST Inc. climbed 1 1/8 to 26  7/8, and Loews Corp. advanced 2 3/4 to 115 5/8.  </P> <P> Another gainer among the blue chips included International Paper, up 3/4 to 47  1/4, which announced improved second-quarter income.  </P> <P> UAL, recently pushed aloft by takeover talk, pulled back by 2 7/8 to 165 5/8.  The American Stock Exchange index rose 1.59 to 366.03, its third-highest close;  trading volume was the heaviest so far this year, with 18.4 million shares  changing hands Tuesday.  </P> <P> Tokyo stocks also closed higher in light trading with institutional investors  staying on the sidelines awaiting signs that Japan's shaky political situation  will be resolved. The 225-share Nikkei index added 70.75 to close at 33,746.77  after slipping 27.95 on Monday.  </P> <P> Stock prices soared in London after the unexpected takeover bid for BAT. The  Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 55.7 to 2,250.9.  </P> <P> Currency  </P> <P> The dollar ended higher against key foreign currencies after major banks again  failed to follow Chase Manhattan Bank's cut in the prime lending rate.  </P> <P> Gold prices eased. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for  current delivery fell $3.10 to $381.50 an ounce. Republic National Bank of New  York quoted a late bid for gold at $379 an ounce, down from $382.50 on Monday.  </P> <P> Also helping the dollar Tuesday was an increase in trading of the West German  mark against Britain's pound sterling and the Japanese yen.  </P> <P> The dollar rose 0.34 yen to 139.62 yen in Tokyo and was quoted at 140.25 yen in  London and at 140.75 yen in New York, up from 130.20 yen Monday.  </P> <P> The dollar was stronger against the British pound. It cost $1.6270 to buy one  pound in London, cheaper than $1.6410 late Monday. Sterling fetched $1.6235 in  New York, down from $1.6390.  </P> <P> Gold eased in London to a late bid of $380.25 an ounce, compared to late  Monday's $381.75. In Zurich, Switzerland, it fell to $379.75 from $383.45.  Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.49 to close at $381.78.  </P> <P> Commodities  </P> <P> Prices of frozen pork belly futures sank below 30 cents a pound on the Chicago  Mercantile Exchange amid renewed concern about the glut of bellies clogging the  nation's commercial freezers.  </P> <P> Hog futures also retreated while cattle futures rose.  </P> <P> On other markets, grains and soybeans were sharply lower, energy futures  advanced and precious metals were mixed.  </P> <P> Frozen pork bellies settled 0.43 cent to 1.80 cents lower, with the contract  for delivery this month at 28.97 cents a pound, matching the nine-year low  reached May 31.  </P> <P> The trading reflected expectations that a weekly exchange report would show no  significant decline in the amount of pork bellies in cold storage outside  Chicago.  </P> <P> The report, issued after trading closed, showed an unexpectedly large drawdown  of 4.6 million pounds, which analysts said could prompt buying of futures  today.  </P> <P> But frozen stocks of bellies, which are cured and sliced to make bacon, still  are believed to be at near-record levels as the end of the heaviest usage  period approaches.  </P> <P> Charles Levitt, chief livestock market analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,  said he expects the Agriculture Department's July 21 cold-storage report to  show about 128 million pounds of frozen bellies on hand as of July 1, which  would be the second-highest total on record for that date and 1 1/2 times the  10-year average.  </P> <P> The July 1 record high was 133.2 million pounds in 1964.  </P> <P> Credit  </P> <P> Most bond prices finished unchanged to lower in thin trading, after an early  advance stalled.  </P> <P> The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond ended down 5/16 point, or about $3  for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite  direction from price, rose to 8.03% from 8% late Monday.  </P> <P> Earlier in the session, the yield briefly had dipped to 7.97% -- the lowest  level since April 8, 1987.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, finished  at 9.188%, unchanged.  </P></p>

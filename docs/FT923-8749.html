			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Former Rothschild manager arrested A FORMER senior manager of Rothschild Bank, the Swiss private banking subsidiary of N M Rothschild &amp; Sons, has been arrested in Zurich for banking irregularities. The Zurich public prosecutor, Mr Marco Ruggli, said the charges against Mr Jurg Heer, formerly in charge of the bank's credit department, involved several million Swiss francs. Rothschild Bank announced last month it would need to transfer SFr63.5m (Pounds 25.22m) from hidden reserves to cover depreciation, provisions and loan losses which quadrupled to SFr99.8m in the year ended March 31, 1992. Yesterday, a lawyer for the bank said that following the arrest Mr Heer had been dismissed. He also said there was no indication that Mr Heer's arrest would lead to any losses for the bank's clients, who tend to be wealthy individuals. The lawyer said irregularities were discovered when the bank reviewed its credit exposure earlier this year. Private banks are not normally in the lending business, except as an occasional service to their clients, and then only on a fully secured basis. Cases of inside irregularities in international private banking rarely come to light because banks fear that the publicity will hurt their image among their sensitive customers. Rothschild's lawyer emphasised that the good standing of the bank was unaffected by this case.</p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIXED MEDIA;  </P> <P> ** 1/2 "CROSSTOWN TRAFFIC" BY CHARLES SHAAR MURRAY, ST. MARTIN'S PRESS  ($18.95): ITEMS IN THIS PERIODIC SURVEY OF POP-RELATED BOOKS, VIDEOCASSETTES  AND LASER DISCS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> "Crosstown Traffic" isn't another Jimi Hendrix biography, but an attempt to  assess the late guitarist's life and legacy in the context of several black  music traditions.  </P> <P> The roots-savvy British critic Murray tackles some provocative themes --  Hendrix the black American in a white British rock world, his sexual wild-man  image vs. the instrumental visionary. But his arguments meander so much at  first that Hendrix becomes more a springboard for Murray's theories than the  central thread whose life linked those issues. Just when "Crosstown Traffic"  seems like a missed opportunity, Murray rallies behind some incisive, caustic  musical analysis, particularly a masterful chapter on Hendrix as  R&amp;B/soulman. Flawed and often frustrating, but worth weathering the rough  stretches. DON SNOWDEN  </P></p>

			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Insurance claims rise starts to slow INCREASES in insurance claims are beginning to slow down but remain at an 'unacceptable' level, the Association of British Insurers announced yesterday. Total theft claims fell in the second quarter of the year, to Pounds 249.5m from Pounds 300.7m. The second-quarter figure is still 10.4 per cent greater, however, than for the same quarter last year. Total claims for the 12 months to June are 39.8 per cent greater than the claims for the previous year at Pounds 1.022bn. Statistics for fire insurance show were gloomier. Claims for the second quarter were at Pounds 284.5m, an increase of 16.1 per cent from the Pounds 245.0m for the same quarter last year. Mr Mike Jones, the ABI's chief executive, said: 'After some miserable figures for thefts and fire damage, there are some signs that the rate of increase is at last slowing down. Even so, the increase in claims remains at an unacceptable level.' He warned consumers: 'Unless all our efforts are successful, further increases in premium rates are unavoidable.' A survey by Which? magazine earlier this year showed that premiums for household contents policies had already increased substantially. Average premiums for a typical building and contents policy in a medium-risk area increased to Pounds 444 this year from Pounds 338 last year. Some increases were much greater. Norwich Union increased premiums in low-risk areas by 93 per cent, according to the survey. The Consumers' Association has claimed that premiums are being increased 'to make consumers pay for past mistakes'. The ABI drew attention to bogus and inflated claims, and also said it was encouraging adequate security measures through its premium structure.</p>

			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Travel: An encounter with the Sakuddai WE HAD been walking three hours since leaving Matotonnan before we stopped to eat. We were entering a labyrinth of steep hills and ridges obscured by the primary rainforest that covers the centre of Siberut Island, off Sumatra, in Indonesia. My dependence on Mang and Syolok, my guide and his helper, was now almost total. I was chewing on sago and the last of our dried fish when I noticed a leech humping up my trouser leg. It was the first I had seen, and rather disappointing - nothing like the creature that spooked Bogart in The African Queen. It was small, thin (as yet) and brown as the mud. Disdainfully, I finished my mid-morning snack before I took out my lighter. Our plan was to cross the island by foot and dugout canoe, walk down the west coast a stretch, go up one river, down another and return to Muara Siberut by powered canoe round the southern cape. In between, we would stay with two clans which still lived in traditional long-houses, the Sakuddai and the Sabeleakek. A 14-day trek, all told, and on the third day we crossed the east-west watershed and entered the territory of the Sakuddai. It took us nine hours to walk from Matotonnan to the closest Sakuddai foraging house. We were greeted by an old crone, her sunken breasts bared, showing extensive tattooing. She had been looking after the children and was now cooking a banana stew for the returning gatherers. As I was washing in the river, a dugout appeared round the corner. In it knelt Aman Uisa Kirei, the clan headman. He paddled over and shook my hand. 'Alelouita,' he said, and held on to me to steady himself in the current. He wore his long white hair in a bun and a headband. The only other thing he had on was a loin cloth, like a sumo wrestler's, made from tree bark. His face, chest, arms, hands, thighs and ankles were tattooed with indigo lines and geometric patterns. He looked at me for a long time, smiling; then, with a nod, he said, 'Mekai' and paddled off downstream. I felt I had met prehistory face-to-face. Life in these parts is based on animism. Everything has a spirit and should be treated with respect. If a taboo is broken, the naturally harmonious relationship between spirits is disrupted, and disaster follows. Complex ceremonies have evolved to influence the spirit world. Whether it is to placate the spirit of a tree before it is felled, strengthen a house spirit or drive evil spirits from the sick, a sakerai (master of ceremonies) must be called in, and a pig killed. These requirements put a cultural check on the rate of exploitation of the tribespeople's resources. Over the ages, they have safeguarded their existence. The Sakuddai follow these beliefs. Their environment has put them beyond the reach of the modern world, whose influence, however, is spreading rapidly along the coasts and navigable rivers. They are remarkably open and gentle people. When the others returned, I was interviewed by Aman Duman Kirei, the clan's sakerai. It was a music hall act which made everyone laugh. 'Alelouita,' I said. 'What?' he said, three times. He had come over all deaf. 'What's your name?' he asked. 'What? Never mind. I've got a new one for you: Toroi Kirei, the king of sightseers. So when I say 'Toroi Kirei', you say 'Oi'.' 'Toroi Kirei,' he said. 'Oi,' I said. 'What?' he said, three times. Supper was brought to us on large metal trays and we ate communally by the light of oil lamps made from old mackerel tins. The meal was a monkey that had been killed with poisoned arrows. I thought it was tough pork, till I asked. With it came sago, boiled bananas, grated coconut and the water the monkey had been cooked in. Afterwards, we bedded down on the porch's bamboo floor, open to the night air and the call of bilou monkeys at dawn. Next day, we moved downstream to the clan's long-house, built within the last year (without nails) and proof of the strength of tradition for the Sakuddai. It was 35 metres long, 15m wide and 10m high. It was raised more than 1m off the ground on thick trunks, and the eaves of its thatched roof sloped down almost to the level of the platform. The Sakuddai are justifiably proud of their homes. I was invited to stay a week, a month, a year. It was even suggested that I marry into the family, but I left two days later. Aman Duman Kirei had tears in his eyes as he said goodbye. It took us another three days to reach the Sabeleakek's long-house. Although this clan lives in much the same way as the Sakuddai, they have had more contact with the modern world. Their hair is cut short, as per local regulations, and the young are not being tattooed any more. Moreover, they are used to money. Trading in scented wood has made them rich. They spend the money on chainsaws and outboards - watches, even, though they never consult them. Yet they would not pay to send the wife of the headman to the hospital in Taileleo. She had had abdominal pains for two weeks when I arrived and an animist healing ceremony took place while I was there. Leaves were selected from the jungle for their spiritual qualities and ground to a paste with which to anoint the invalid's body. There were incantations and muttered spells. One of the participants wore a crucifix. The government's policy of resettling clans into permanent villages and re-educating them puts intense pressure on local resources and removes traditional checks on exploitation. The government has also sold timber concessions covering the whole of Siberut and plans to settle 7,000 of Java's poor on the island within the next two years. Perhaps the Sakuddai built their long-house so large because they believe it will be their last.</p>

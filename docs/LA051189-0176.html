			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION VOLLEYBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> MARINA, CAMERON SURVIVE CHALLENGE BY NORTH TORRANCE  </P> <P> After taking turns giving away the first three games of their Southern Section  4-A wild-card match Wednesday, the boys' volleyball teams from Marina and North  Torrance high schools slugged it out in Game 4.  </P> <P> Marina, powered by 6-foot-5 Duane Cameron, took the game and the match, 15-6,  6-15, 15-3, 15-13. But it wasn't easy. Not in the fourth game.  </P> <P> Marina, which had blown out North Torrance in the third game to take a 2-1  lead, looked to be in great shape when it jumped out to a 3-0 lead. That lead  was 4-2 when North Torrance went on a 5-0 run that gave it a 7-4 lead.  </P> <P> Marina went on an eight-point run of its own to go up 12-7. But North Torrance  came back with a 5-1 spurt that left the score 13-12.  </P> <P> Marina went ahead, 14-13, and then came seven side outs with each team's big  hitter -- Marina's Cameron and North Torrance's Dennis Smith -- coming up with  big hits.  </P> <P> Marina finally won it on Braden Coenen's cross-court spike that landed just  inside the left corner.  </P> <P> "If this is the wild card, I'm not sure I want to go on to the first round,"  said Andy Read, Marina's coach.  </P> <P> But Marina (12-4) will play Santa Monica (14-2), at Santa Monica, Friday.  </P> <P> That seemed a foregone conclusion after Marina blew by North Torrance (13-4) in  the first game, 15-6.  </P> <P> Cameron had seven kills and a block and Dave Park had five kills in the game.  But North Torrance was the main contributor to Marina's first-game victory,  committing seven unforced errors.  </P> <P> In a swift about-face of ineptness, Marina could do nothing right in the second  game and North Torrance won, 15-6. Smith had five kills for North Torrance.  Marina committed seven unforced errors of its own and added six service errors  in the game.  </P> <P> "You saw a lot of tense, nervous kids out there," Read said. "It took a while  for us to settle down."  </P> <P> Marina did more than settle down in the third game. It laid North Torrance out  flat, 15-3. Marina started with a 6-0 run before North Torrance scored its  first point. Then came a 8-0 run to make the score 14-1. Cameron, who finished  with a game-high 27 kills, had six kills in the game. Coenen, who had 19 kills  in the game, added five.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ADDRESSING PROBLEMS IN KINDERGARTEN;  </P> <P> BEHAVIOR: STUDIES SHOW EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS CAN START EARLY. A VOLUNTEER PROGRAM  REACHES OUT TO CHILDREN IDENTIFIED AS HAVING SPECIAL NEEDS.  </P> <P> They are small problems now, the kinds that often get chalked up to being "just  a stage."  </P> <P> But to an increasing number of counselors, teachers and psychologists, some  common behavioral characteristics in kindergarten-age children -- including  aggression, tearfulness or reluctance to play with other children -- can be  warning signals of problems to come.  </P> <P> Many recent studies have looked at reasons children drop out of school, "and  one of the things they found is that a lot of problems could be traced back to  kindergarten," said Alison McAlpine, director of the Los Angeles Unified School  District's Kindergarten Intervention Program (KIP).  </P> <P> "The thinking until now has been that kids would eventually outgrow certain  adjustment difficulties," McAlpine said. "Now we're seeing that it isn't  necessarily so."  </P> <P> Eight years ago KIP was begun in a handful of elementary schools to reach out  to children identified by teachers as needing special attention, but who have  not yet reached a point where counseling has become necessary. Under the  program, volunteers with the district's school mental health office go into  classrooms and work with at-risk students in small groups or one-on-one. The  goal, McAlpine said, has been to help children with adjustment problems feel  good about themselves, and thus their ability to succeed in school.  </P> <P> "When you have 33 children in your class, even if you gave 120% of yourself, it  still wouldn't be enough to reach the children who need that extra bit of  attention," said Tobi Rosen, a kindergarten teacher at Erwin Street School in  Van Nuys for the last 20 years who was one of the first teachers in the San  Fernando Valley to implement the program. "The children get that extra bit of  confidence from the volunteers, and the feeling that someone really cares."  </P> <P> Although only a few schools took advantage of the program a few years ago,  McAlpine said, 44 elementary schools in the Valley now have volunteers who work  in kindergarten classrooms. Since receiving a federal grant two years ago,  McAlpine said, the KIP program, which is affiliated with a similar program at  UCLA, is being expanded into first-grade classrooms.  </P> <P> "We've been able to follow some of the kids into about fifth grade, and there  have been good results," she said, adding that UCLA is doing follow-up studies  to determine the program's effectiveness. "Although it's difficult to say now  what would have happened if there had been no intervention, many of those  children who are identified as being at-risk in kindergarten are doing well."  </P> <P> KIP, which McAlpine said was modeled after a similar program in New York, has  been praised by psychologists. Florence Bienenfeld, a former kindergarten and  educational consultant in Pacific Palisades who holds a doctorate in marriage  and family counseling, said, "It's so good to see that schools are willing to  put money into a preventive program like this, instead of into a mop-up program  for dropouts after the fact. Prevention really is the key for these kids."  </P> <P> The program, however, actually costs schools nothing and is an inexpensive  solution for the district, McAlpine said, since it relies solely on trained  volunteers. Many college students and senior citizens are KIP volunteers.  </P> <P> "We had one senior citizen volunteer who was in a wheelchair," Rosen said. "He  loved the children, but they also really loved him."  </P> <P> Children, though, aren't the only ones who receive assistance from the program.  Parenting workshops, which are held two times at the onset at each elementary  school involved with the program, give parents the chance to talk about  problems they are encountering, as well as to receive advice from the school  mental health staff. Interpreters are provided for Spanish-speaking parents.  </P> <P> At El Oro Way Elementary School in Granada Hills, 16 mothers recently pulled  their chairs into a circle in the school's auditorium to talk about what many  describe as daily battles with their kids. Topics range from aggressive  behavior and sibling rivalry, to getting children into bed at night or up in  the morning.  </P> <P> For most parents, the mere mention of aggression hit a nerve. Each had a story  to tell about angry or hostile behavior and how they had dealt with it.  </P> <P> Susan Moreno, the mother of four children and also an assistant third-grade  teacher, told the group that she was hospitalized two years ago for several  days after undergoing emergency surgery. Frightened and unable to understand  why his mother had left so suddenly, Moreno's son, now 6, began taking out his  feelings of anger on his baby sister.  </P> <P> "He was blaming the baby for my health problems," Moreno said. "I kept telling  him I didn't like the behavior with his sister and that I wouldn't tolerate it,  but it wasn't working."  </P> <P> She began to see a positive effect, Moreno told the group, after she set aside  a specific amount of "special time" each day with her son. During the 10 or 15  minutes they spent together after dinner, she said, "He knew that he didn't  need to compete at all for my attention and that it was our time together. It  took him two years, but I think he knows now that I'm not going away."  </P> <P> Other members of the group shared similar experiences with aggressive behavior  in their children, as well as the benefits of giving children -- especially  ones with siblings -- individualized attention each day.  </P> <P> McAlpine, who lead the group along with two other staff members from KIP,  pointed out another positive aspect.  </P> <P> "As every mother knows, there are some times when you simply are too busy to  stop everything and give your full attention to what a child is saying," she  said. "Instead of saying, 'Not now,' though, you can say, 'I want to hear this,  but I'm very busy right now. Can you hang onto it and share it with me at our  special time?' "  </P> <P> But, as most parents at the meeting attested, competition with siblings isn't  the only source of aggression with young children. Several parents voiced their  concerns over the effects of too much television and the difficulties they  encountered when they attempted to control what shows their children watched.  </P> <P> "My son has been punching a lot, and so he's no longer allowed to watch  'America's Most Wanted' or other violent shows," one mother said. "I don't know  whether that will help, though."  </P> <P> In typical support-group fashion, several mothers offered other suggestions for  helping the boy deal with pent-up anger or frustration.  </P> <P> "Maybe you should try putting a punching bag in the garage," said another  mother. "Let him get it all out."  </P> <P> Terry Fischette, on-site coordinator with KIP, said she gave her son karate  lessons when he began acting aggressively. Instead of becoming more violent,  she said, the aggression actually stopped. "I asked him why he stopped, and he  said, 'Because now I know I don't have to fight. I know that I could.' It  helped him channel energy."  </P> <P> The parenting workshops, though, are meant to be more than just an emotional  swap meet. With the help of school mental health professionals who interject  advice frequently during the sessions, parents learn about the developmental  characteristics of children and ways to promote positive social adjustments.  </P> <P> McAlpine and other staff members encourage parents to use behavior modification  techniques with their children, instead of putting themselves in what they say  often amounts to exhausting, repetitive power struggles.  </P> <P> "Sometimes we get stuck by thinking, 'By God, I'm going to hang in there and  keep punishing him when the undesirable behavior comes up,' " McAlpine said to  the mothers, when the issue of consistency arose. "If something isn't working,  try something else," she advised.  </P> <P> One of the best ways to change unwanted behavior with young children is with a  technique called charting, according to Bobbie Ozar, a kindergarten consultant  with KIP who attended the meeting. Parents sit down with a child and define in  clear terms what behavior they want to eliminate -- whether it is "yelling" or  "hitting your brother." They then tell the child that, for each day the  behavior stops, the child will receive a star on a chart.  </P> <P> At the end of one or two weeks -- any longer, Ozar said, and the child loses  interest -- a reward is given to the child.  </P> <P> "Does that work with getting a kid to wake up in the morning?" one parent  asked, eliciting immediate groans of familiarity from the group. "No matter  what I do, it's always, 'Five more minutes.' "  </P> <P> Moreno said she had success trying a somewhat more creative approach than  nagging. At the suggestion of a friend, Moreno said she went about her morning  routine after her son insisted on "just another few minutes" in bed. When he  finally woke up and realized how late he was for school, Moreno said she told  him to keep his pajamas on all day and stay in bed.  </P> <P> "That was the last time he did it," she said. "Now when I say to get up, he's  up."  </P> <P> McAlpine said she applauds such creative approaches. She recalled one mother at  another group who hadn't been able to stop her young children from fighting in  front of the television. After two warnings the mother sent her children into  their rooms and then proceeded to sit on the couch and watch cartoons with the  volume turned up high.  </P> <P> "She sat there and laughed and laughed for them to hear her, just as though she  was having the greatest time," McAlpine said. "Instead of just being sent to  their rooms, they realized what they were missing out on because of their  fighting.  </P> <P> "It's that kind of approach that can do wonders to change behavior," she said.  "Parents just need to learn that they have more tools available to them than  they may know."  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCKHEED CREATES ESOP TO PREEMPT SIMMONS TAKEOVER  </P> <P> Lockheed Corp., acting swiftly to preempt a takeover by investor Harold  Simmons, said today that it will sell some units, boost its dividend and create  a stock ownership plan that puts 17% of its shares in employee hands.  </P> <P> At the same time, the Calabasas-based defense and aerospace company said it  expects profits to decline 40% in the first quarter and 25% in the year as a  whole. A lackluster earnings performance has been cited by analysts as a key  factor making the company vulnerable to a takeover.  </P> <P> Reacting to the new anti-takeover measures and the outlook for lower earnings,  Lockheed's shares opened 87.5 cents lower at $48.875 today.  </P> <P> Simmons, a wealthy Dallas financier, said Monday that a group he heads has  acquired 5.3% of Lockheed and will consider taking control. Lockheed's shares  Monday jumped to a sharp gain on takeover speculation, even though Simmons said  he has no immediate plans for a buyout.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Like Polaroid's Defense  </P> <P> The maker of such top-secret defense weapons as the stealth bomber and the  Trident missile, Lockheed began preparing a takeover defense in December when  Simmons first said he was buying Lockheed shares.  </P> <P> In the employee stock ownership plan announced today, the company will create  an ESOP with a combined value of about $1 billion by creating 10.5 million new  shares and acquiring 10.5 million existing shares.  </P> <P> The celebrated takeover defense by Polaroid Corp. against Roy Disney's Shamrock  Holdings Inc. successfully employed such a plan and many companies are adopting  them.  </P> <P> In another measure that will reduce its vulnerability, Lockheed said, it will  phase out its Information Systems Group, selling its CalComp, CADAM, Metier and  Lockheed DataPlan units. Analysts have said the information group could be sold  off by a corporate raider to fund part of a buyout. The four units had 1988  revenues of $589 million, out of the company's total of $10.59 billion.  </P> <P> Lockheed said the moves renew its focus on missiles and space, aircraft and  electronics, and place new emphasis on technology services.  </P> <P> "They will enhance our competitiveness in a rapidly changing environment where  premiums are placed on innovation, efficiency and quality and focused  management," said Lockheed Chairman Daniel M. Tellep.  </P> <P> But on another front that analysts see as vital to winning any takeover battle,  the company will find no immediate relief. It said first-quarter profits will  be hurt by the end of its C-5B military transport production program, higher  effective tax rates and expected adjustments for cost increases in certain  aircraft modification programs.  </P> <P> That will slash Lockheed's earnings 40% from the $114 million in the first  quarter last year. Earnings for the year as a whole will be only slightly  better than the first quarter, and are expected to be down 25% from the $624  million in 1988.  </P> <P> Despite the short-term setbacks, Lockheed said it is confident that earnings  growth will resume in 1990 and beyond.  </P></p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / International Company News: Canadian Air chief prefers American link CANADIAN Airlines International's best chance for survival in an age of mega-carriers is through alliance with American Airlines, says Mr Rhys Eyton, the Canadian airline's chairman. This could lead to American buying 25 per cent of Canadian, he said in Montreal, but control of Canadian would remain firmly in Canada. The deal would allow Canadian to cut costs by winning access to American's more sophisticated computer systems, and both airlines will share staff in foreign locations. He dismissed a merger with Air Canada in any form. Merging the two airlines' international routes while remaining separate domestically would be unworkable for competitive reasons. 'Two carriers with 80 to 100 aircraft cannot stand up to the competition from British Airways, Delta, American and United, each of which operate 500 or more,' he said.</p>

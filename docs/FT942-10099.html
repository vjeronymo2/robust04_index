			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Arts: Starry Carmen, withered Faust - Opera in London and Birmingham The Royal Opera is hosting two of the so-called 'three tenors' at present, writes John Allison. Alongside Jose Carreras in Fedora, Placido Domingo has arrived to sing Don Jose - his first performances of the role at Covent Garden since 1973 - in the last four Carmens of the season. Nuria Espert's 1991 production has seen countless changes of cast since it was revived in January, and Tuesday's line-up was a strong one. Domingo was on fine form, conveying Don Jose's unbridled infatuation both vocally and in his acting. His tone remains virile, he can still muster pleasing pianissimos. Domingo has often been criticised for stepping into productions as a guest on little rehearsal, sometimes in parts unsuited to his voice, but he is a veteran Don Jose and knows this production well, having sung in it in Los Angeles and conducted it in Seville. In Los Angeles he appeared opposite Denyce Graves, for whom the title role has become a calling card. Her Covent Garden debut in January, postponed for a few days due to illness, was not reported on this page, and Tuesday's performance explained her reputation as a sultry Carmen. She has smoky tone to match her glamorous looks, but as an actress relies too much on sensuality. The Romanian soprano Angela Gheorghiu made an unscheduled appearance in her first Covent Garden Micaela, replacing an indisposed Marie McLaughlin. Her vibrant singing underlined a portrayal of the character as tougher than usual. Gino Quilico, a preening Escamillo, completed a team of principals who make up as good a Carmen cast as one is likely to encounter. All seemed galvanised by Jacques Delacote in the pit. In contrast to the lumpen account presided over by Jeffrey Tate in January, the music now sounds fiery and exciting. Delacote brings a light Gallic touch that makes even the clumsy production seem less oppressive. The Hispanicised Hose has been corrected to Jose, suggesting that Covent Garden has at last recognised Carmen as a French opera. While the Royal Opera was performing a traditional Carmen, writes Richard Fairman, the City of Birmingham Touring Opera was giving its own very different treatment to another French classic, Gounod's Faust. In the past these slimmed-down productions have been at the cutting edge of opera in England, but this time the sharpness of intellect has become dulled. The outline plan remains the same. The opera is performed by a small team, suitable for touring. There is no chorus, which means losing a proportion of the score (including some favourite numbers). The orchestra is reduced to about 15 players and this time the arranger, Ian McQueen, has not merely re-orchestrated Gounod, but also added ideas of his own. He replaces the original prelude with a more disturbing introduction, to which he alludes at crucial turning-points later in the opera. Horn trills shudder ominously as Faust drinks his potion, while at the end wrenching discords disrupt the comfort of Gounod's saccharine ending. It is arguable what benefit this brings, but McQueen's re-writing is the most striking feature in an otherwise tired evening. The production team (Matthew Richardson producer and Jon Morrell designer) have nothing to offer beyond the stock ideas and bare scenery encountered in any low-budget production. The pacing of the drama is unvaried, at odds with the spirited conducting of Dominic Wheeler. Fortunately there are some decent voices on hand to carry the performance along, notably Jane Leslie MacKenzie's soaring Marguerite and Andrew Slater's able Mephistopheles. Colin McKerracher dutifully sings Faust's most awkward music, but at the price of strangulated tone. Karl Morgan Daymond gets to deliver a hitherto unknown solo as Valentin. Otherwise, like the flowers under the devil's spell, this Faust has unexpectedly withered at the touch. Carmen performances, with further cast changes, on May 14,17, 20 (the last relayed to the Big Screen in the Piazza). Sponsored by Daiwa Europe and The Linbury Trust. Faust: the Bull Ring Centre, Birmingham, then on tour until June 19</p>

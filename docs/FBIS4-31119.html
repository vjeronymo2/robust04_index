			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ivan Horsky: "Signing of Stability Pact </F> Within a Year"]    [Text] The timing of the Conference on Stability in  Europe, which took place in Paris late last week, was by no  means accidental. On 1 July, Germany will become the presiding  country of the European Union, and, immediately thereafter, as  of the new year, this role will be taken over by France. Paris  supposes that, by the end of this year, French diplomacy will  succeed, with Bonn's assistance, in pushing matters forward so  that the Stability Pact can be signed. Prime Minister Edouard  Balladur, the author of the original idea, must score this  success for a quite prosaic reason: He wants to become successor  to President Francois Mitterrand and expects such an  international triumph to greatly strengthen his chances.    For this reason, French diplomacy did everything it could to  ensure the conference's success. This becomes most evident when  we take a look at the changes that the original Balladur plan  has undergone; it really has changed beyond recognition.    What Slovakia as well as other countries considered to be of  the greatest importance was the acceptance of one of the major  CSCE principles--the inviolability of the existing borders. One  could even argue that, if this did not happen, the whole  initiative would probably have gone down in the textbooks of  diplomacy as one of the examples of abortive activities.    It needs to be said--without schadenfreude but, still, with  satisfaction--that the results of the Paris conference signify  the end of the hopes of certain circles in Hungary, and also  abroad, that had hoped for possible revision of the borders with  Hungary's neighbors and, thereby, for a precedent to be set.  This disappointment was to be felt also in Paris in the speech  of [Hungarian Foreign Minister] Geza Jeszenszky, for whom  participation in the conference apparently was his swan song as  the chief of Hungarian diplomacy. Still, even when we use  moderate and diplomatic terms, his words startled and struck the  audience by their confrontational tone, which also met with the  appropriate response. In the end, the overwhelming majority  qualified this as a last attempt to save political face in the  face of one's own fiasco.    The focus of work in the forthcoming period will be on  preparatory negotiations to determine the exact dates of two  regional roundtables. The first will pertain to the Central  European region and will involve Slovakia and Hungary. The  other will involve the Baltic countries. Five areas of problems  are to be discussed, but the agenda could be expanded if new  issues emerge.    In this context, it needs to be stressed again that  representatives of ethnic minorities will not be able to  directly participate in these roundtables. This applies, in  particular, to the Hungarian minority, whose representatives  have demanded this possibility most vehemently, with Budapest's  support. However, as Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik stressed  some time ago and as has been confirmed by [Foreign Minister]  Eduard Kukan, the Slovak Government is not only ready but also  determined to not only brief the minority's representatives  before and after the talks but also to consult them on problems  concerning the minorities. The principle was adopted in Paris  that relations between states are involved, in which only  subjects of international law can participate.    One cannot but express the hope that the work on bilateral  documents that will be a part of the pact, as well as the  roundtables, will be marked by a constructive spirit, even if  polemics cannot be ruled out in advance. However, Bonn and  Paris will quite certainly try to prove their active attitude  toward the problems of Central and Eastern Europe. Therefore,  we can expect a very rapid solution to any disputed problems so  that the final document can be signed no later than in one  year's time. Let us only hope that the signing will not be  accompanied by problems such as occurred while taking the  so-called family portrait, when the quite undiplomatic hustle on  the wooden platform almost caused diplomatic and human tragedy.  However, this was probably the French organizers' only serious  mistake.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava June 30 (CTK) -- Peter Weiss, chairman  of the Democratic Left Party (SDL), said today he believed that  after the autumn elections, his party would not be faced with  any clash due to the allegedly different views of its leaders on  the possibility of the SDL's coalition with the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS).    The SDL is a government coalition party, successor to the  former Communist Party, while the HZDS is in the opposition.  Headed by ex- Premier Vladimir Meciar, it has repeatedly topped  opinion polls and is the SDL's biggest election rival.    Weiss assured journalists that SDL representatives would not  "swallow Meciar's bait." Rumours alleging controversies within  the SDL which the HZDS is permanently airing through the media  are untrue, he said.    "On the contrary, I have information that a right-leaning  HZDS faction intends to use Meciar only as an electoral flag,  which they will put aside later," Weiss stressed.    He said he considered speculations about SDL's coalition  with  HZDS "without Meciar" premature. First he does not want to view  the partnership only in an "interpersonal" dimension, and the  developments after the elections also could be affected by the  absence of any present coalition party in the next Slovak  parliament, Weiss said.    Speculations about a post-election SDL-HZDS coalition have  been appearing in the press for certain time. Observers point  to the possibility of the removal of Weiss by more conservative  SDL members, or of the SDL's split.    Weiss said that real post-election variants would be  considered by the SDL national council on July 9. He stressed  that pre- election polls had also to be taken into account,  according to which up to 70 percent of voters approved Meciar's  dismissal in mid-March, and most of them would not give their  second vote to the HZDS, if enabled to vote for two parties.    According to the latest poll, the HZDS is supported by 29  percent of citizens. The SDL is placed second, supported by one  fifth of voters.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 26 (YONHAP) -- Yi Ki-taek, chairman of  the main opposition Democratic Party [DP], suffered an  ignominious loss of face when the DP's Supreme Council brushed  aside his public suggestion that a pan-national cabinet be  formed to handle the "national crisis."    The chain of events took place as follows.    Yi, hurrying home from a visit to the United States on  Monday, gravely suggested that a national council be formed to  cope with the current crisis arising from the resignation of  Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang.    The suggestion, of course, was meant for President Kim  Yong-sam, who ignored it completely.    Yi then followed up by saying that a cabinet supported by  the  entire nation could be formed.    In less than a few hours, however, the remarks by the leader  of the country's No. 1 opposition party were brushed aside by  his own party's supreme council.    "The suggestion was worth studying," DP Spokesman Pak  Chi-won  told reporters, "but it was not appropriate timing-wise.    "At this juncture, therefore, we have decided not to discuss  the proposal any further."    When Pak's remarks are analyzed carefully, it is possible to  get the drift of what exactly is going on within the party.    What Pak said indicates that most, if not all, members of  the  supreme council might have shared this opinion with their leader  when he suggested setting up a pan-national cabinet.    In fact, this was not the first time Chairman Yi had  suggested formation of a broad-based cabinet. He made similar  proposals twice before -- at his new year's day press conference  and at another press conference marking the first anniversary of  his chairmanship.    In making such suggestions, Yi Ki-taek's point was that  President Kim has lost his ability to govern the nation after  trying to impose "a new authoritarianism" and "one-man rule."    In order to overcome the national crisis resulting from  President Kim's inability to rule, Yi reasoned, a pan-national  cabinet, drawing capable manpower from all sectors including the  political opposition, should be formed.    The supreme council agreed with Yi's diagnosis of the  current  political situation, but said the timing was inappropriate.    According to the council's thinking, the DP ought to keep  pressing its offensive against the ruling party and the Kim  administration by demanding investigations of the Sangmudae  scandal and the resignation of Yi Hoe-chang.    Now is not the time, in other words, for the opposition  party  to come forward and offer help to President Kim by saying "let's  form a coalition force to overcome the 'crisis,' or whatever it  may be."    Proposing to form a pan-national cabinet is "a card"  overused  by past opposition parties. Many supreme council members  believe that Yi Ki-taek has obviously misjudged the current  situation.    The supreme council, in effect, ignored its own chairman's  suggestion. In order to help Yi save face, however, it had  Spokesman Pak officially announce that "it would not be  discussed any further."</p>

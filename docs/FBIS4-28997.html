			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Labor, War Invalids, and Social  Welfare and the UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees] held a  joint conference in Haiphong on 10-11 June to review the task of  receiving and reintegrating repatriated Vietnamese during the  1989-94 period.    During the past five years, more than 62,000 Vietnamese were  repatriated from Hong Kong, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and  Japan.    The Vietnamese Government and international organizations  have provided aid and assistance to these returnees while  creating conditions for them to stabilize their daily life and  to reintegrate themselves quickly into the Vietnamese community.    In Haiphong, Quang Ninh, Ho Chi Minh City, Thua Thien-Hue,  and Quang Nam-Danang about 70-75 percent of the returnees now  enjoy a relatively stable life, 5-10 percent are doing well, and  10-15 percent experience difficulty in finding jobs and living  quarters.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / VAT idea bad news for bookworms: The Treasury may widen tax to increase revenue GLUTTONOUS bookworms who feel the cold and have young families are not looking forward to the March 16 Budget. They could be forced into substantial increases in spending as a result of changes in value added tax being examined at the Treasury. Treasury officials are ploughing through their VAT calculations with an eye to cutting Britain's mounting government deficit. One way to do this would be to extend VAT to items such as food, books, newspapers, heating bills and children's clothing which are exempt from taxation. Important opposing arguments are that to increase VAT when the economy is fragile could damage the chances of recovery. It would also add to inflation and hit the poor particularly hard. About a quarter of all consumer spending goes on goods and services that are zero-rated for VAT. A further 4 per cent is spent on items which are exempt. According to Treasury calculations charging VAT at the full 17.5 per cent rate on all items that are either zero-rated or exempt from the tax altogether would raise an extra Pounds 23.9bn a year. Nobody expects Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to announce such a sweeping measure on Budget day. He is thought more likely to decide to raise perhaps Pounds 3bn by widening the scope of VAT through bringing a few specific items into the tax net at a lower rate - possibly 5 per cent. Increased taxation would help to reduce the growing gap between government revenues and spending. This is thought likely to reach about Pounds 50bn in 1993-94 after Pounds 35bn to Pounds 40bn in the current financial year. One relatively uncontroversial measure on VAT would be to tax domestic energy at the full 17.5 per cent. That would raise Pounds 2.6bn a year and could be presented as a green-tinged measure which would help to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and reduce global warming. Widening the scope of VAT appeals to economists who believe a substantial element of zero-rating for such indirect taxes - which are only seen in western Europe in the UK and the Irish republic - distorts market forces by making certain goods and services cheaper than others. Raising extra money from VAT would fit in with the government's moves in the 1980s to shift the fiscal burden away from taxes on income towards those on spending. The argument is that this encourages people to increase earnings, leading to a more dynamic economy. As a cash-gathering vehicle VAT was, in 1979, the poor relation of income tax. Every Pounds 1 flowing into the Treasury's coffers from income tax was then matched by just 32p from VAT. Last year VAT's corresponding contribution had doubled to 65p. The total raised through VAT was Pounds 37.4bn. According to calculations by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent research group, extending VAT at the full 17.5 per cent rate to all zero-rated goods and services would add 3.7 percentage points to the year-on-year rise in retail price inflation if wholesalers and retailers passed on the full effects of the extra tax to customers. Even a modest move to increase VAT would increase the risk that underlying inflation, now 3.2 per cent, would breach Mr Lamont's target of 4 per cent or less during the life of this parliament. A further disincentive for Mr Lamont is that raising VAT would hit poor families. According to the institute's calculations, bringing all zero-rated goods and services into the tax net would add Pounds 6.97 a week, or about 7 per cent, to the bills of those in the bottom 10 per cent by income. Households with average incomes would have to pay Pounds 9.01 a week more, an extra 3.5 per cent, while families in the top 10 per cent by income would see their weekly bills increase by Pounds 10.81, a rise of less than 2 per cent. Supporters of an end to zero-rating say these effects could be countered by changes in the level of benefits.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------            POTENTIAL RECEIPTS FROM LEVYING VAT ON MORE ITEMS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Food                                                pounds7.0bn Construction of new homes                           pounds1.8bn Domestic fuel and power                             pounds2.6bn Domestic fares                                      pounds1.1bn International fares                                 pounds0.8bn Books, newspapers etc                               pounds1.1bn Children's clothing                                 pounds0.6bn Water/sewerage services                             pounds0.7bn Medicines                                           pounds0.5bn Supplies to charities                               pounds0.2bn Some ships, aircraft                                pounds0.5bn Rent*                                               pounds2.3bn Private education*                                  pounds0.6bn Health*                                             pounds0.3bn Postage*                                            pounds0.4bn Burial/cremation*                                   pounds0.1bn Finance, insurance*                                 pounds2.7bn Betting &amp; gaming*                                   pounds0.5bn Small traders*                                      pounds0.1bn TOTAL                                              pounds23.9bn  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Sums are estimated extra revenues in 1992-93 if VAT at 17.5 per cent applied to spending on these items. *denotes tax exempt; other items are zero-rated  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Treasury  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

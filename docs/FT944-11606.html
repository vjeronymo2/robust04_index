			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Japanese finance markets plea Japan's leading banks are urgently pressing the ministry of finance to accelerate the deregulation of the country's financial markets. In a joint submission to the MoF's banking bureau, disclosed in the Japanese press yesterday, the largest commercial banks called on the authorities to enact a list of 80 deregulatory measures soon. Favoured reforms include an extension of the maximum period for certificates of deposit from two to five years and the establishment of a market in five-year government bond futures. Banks also want the MoF to lift restrictions on the opening of new branches and the installation of cash dispensers outside banks, and are urging an expansion of their own highly circumscribed spheres of business activities to include the sale of investment trusts and insurance policies. The MoF is under growing pressure to accelerate the dismantling of the vast structure of regulations that govern financial markets.</p>

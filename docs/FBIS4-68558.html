For March the  number of citizens not engaged in labor activity increased by  97,200 as compared with the preceding month, and the number of  unemployed--by 94,000, respectively.    On the whole for the first quarter of 1994, the number of  citizens not engaged in labor activity and unemployed increased  by 1.3 times.    Citizens laid off from enterprises, organizations and  institutions comprise 25.1 percent of the overall number of  those not working.    The level of unemployment (ratio of the number of registered  unemployed to the number of the able-bodied population of  working age) comprised 1.3 percent for Russia as a whole on 1  April 1994. For the first quarter of the current year, the level  of unemployment rose by 0.3 percent.    The number of job vacancies reported to the State Employment  Service increased by 14,500 for March, and on 1 April comprised  289,400. Eighty-three percent of the vacancies were for  blue-collar workers, and 17 percent--for white-collar workers.    On the average for Russia there are 4.7 persons not engaged  in labor activity (including 3.7 unemployed) for each vacancy  reported to the State Employment Service. In a number of regions  the pressure on the labor market is characterized by great  tension. For example, in the Ingush Republic there are 180  out-of-work citizens for each vacancy, in the Aga-Buryat  Autonomous Okrug--105; in Yaroslav, Pskov and Sakhalin Oblasts,  the Chuvash Republic and the Nenets Autonomous Okrug--from 30 to  45, and in Bryansk Oblast, the Republics of Mari El, Kalmykiya,  Adygeya, Altay and Buryatiya--from 21 to 27 idle persons.    There were 26,800 persons participating in public works in  March of 1994. On the whole for the first quarter of this year,  the number of public works participants comprised 40,800  persons, which is 1.8 times greater than the same period last  year.    The overall number of citizens undergoing training in a new  profession at the direction of the employment service comprised  88,000 persons in the first quarter of 1994. This is two times  more as compared with the corresponding period last year.    In January-March of 1994, 26,200 unemployed persons  exercised  their right to early retirement, including 8,500 in March.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA note] According to the forecast of the  Government Center for Economic Market Conditions, in May the  number of persons not engaged in labor activity should exceed  the 1.5-million mark, and in June it should reach 1,714,000. The  numbers for unemployed persons are forecast by the center as  being 1,301,000 and 1,425,000 persons, respectively (see table).

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / International Equities: Repsol sets price for global offering REPSOL, the Spanish energy group, last night said it had set the price of its global share offering at Pta2,735, a share, yesterday's closing price in Madrid, and would sell another 35m shares, or 11.7 per cent of the company, to take the government's stake to below 50 per cent from 54.4 per cent. Repsol has been privatised gradually since 1989. In New York, Goldman Sachs said the price of American depository shares in the offering had been set at Dollars 23.68. The equity offering, which has an unusually large international portion of around 85 per cent, is expected to raise nearly Dollars 1bn for Repsol. Investment bankers involved in the offering said an additional 5m shares were likely to be made available for market stabilisation purposes. If the global offering is increased to 40m shares, the total amount raised through the partial privatisation would be close to Dollars 1bn. Few other global share offerings, with exception of Telmex and New Zealand Telecom, have had such a large international tranche. Goldman Sachs is global co-ordinator. Separately, Argentaria, the big state-owned Spanish banking corporation, has filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in New York. This confirms that Argentaria will be placing up to 31.3m shares - or 24.9 per cent of its equity - on the market and that the US tranche will be led by Morgan Stanley, with S. G. Warburg, Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs as co-managers. Morgan Stanley is global co-ordinator. Argentaria's share offering, which could raise as much as Dollars 1bn, will be aimed predominantly at Spanish institutional and retail investors. As much as 40 per cent will be offered outside Spain.</p>

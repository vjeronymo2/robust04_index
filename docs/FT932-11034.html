			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / People: Lazard snaps up Knapton Peter Knapton, the most recent in a long line of senior defections from Invesco MIM, has joined Lazard Investors in the newly created position of chief investment officer. Knapton, 43, who had been managing director of Invesco's wholesale business in the UK, has known Jimmy West, chief executive of the London-based fund management group, since the late 1970s when West was running Globe Investment Trust and Knapton Temple Bar Investment Trust. Both trusts were part of the Electra group of funds. Having joined Invesco two and a half years ago as head of UK equities 'to sort out a particular problem the group had in that area', Knapton is reluctant to talk about the reasons for his departure. David Verey, chairman of Lazard Brothers, says the decision to create the position at Lazard Investors, which manages around Pounds 4.5bn of institutional and private client monies, was 'opportunity-driven'.</p>

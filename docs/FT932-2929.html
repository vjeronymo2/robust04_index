			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (2): New generation in wings - Digital services Over the past decade, mobile telephony has become the fastest growing segment of the dynamic global telecommunications market. Now a new generation of mobile telecommunications equipment, based on digital rather than analogue technology, is poised to deliver a wide range of sophisticated new voice and data services to business and residential customers. The total number of cellular telephone subscribers grew by 43 per cent last year to 23m, according to figures collected by Mobile Communications, the FT newsletter. In the US, the biggest cellular market, subscriber numbers jumped by 46 per cent from 7.6m to 11.1m. By the end of this decade half of all telephone calls worldwide are expected to originate or terminate on a mobile phone - and a growing proportion of those telephones will be operating on the new digital technology. EMCI, the Washington-based market research organisation, has forecast that there will be about 13m digital cellular subscribers worldwide by 1996, accounting for about a quarter of the total cellular market. This expected growth in digital cellular subscribers reflects some key advantages which digital technology can offer over older analogue systems. Among these, digital mobile telephones provide more reliable, clearer and more secure telecommunications. In addition, by converting ordinary sound into computer code, digital services can pack at least 10 times as many calls into the same 'space' in the radio spectrum. But perhaps most importantly they allow telecommunications network operators and others to provide a wide range of value-added customer services. Significantly, although North America led the first mobile telecommunications revolution in the early 1980s, it is Europe that has taken the lead in the move towards the next generation of digital systems. Europe has adopted a pan-European digital telecommunications standard called GSM (Groupe Speciale Mobile). 'The big impact of GSM is that it is a single standard,' says Mr Dean Eyers, an industry analyst with Dataquest's European telecommunications group, 'and this means enormous economies of scale for equipment manufacturers.' In contrast, in the US a dispute between network operators over two rival digital standards, one called time division multiple access (TDMA) and the other called code-division multiple access (CDMA) is threatening to delay the widespread introduction of digital systems. Twenty-three operators in 16 European countries are committed to building GSM networks, and another 20 countries around the world have adopted GSM as the basis for their next generation of cellular services. The first GSM networks were launched last July in Germany, France and Denmark, and similar services are now being rolled out across Europe. Since last July, GSM subscribers have accounted for almost one third of all new subscribers to cellular networks in western Europe. By the end of this year Dataquest is forecasting that there will be 1.1m GSM subscribers in Europe, growing to 8.31m by the end of 1996. In the UK, Cellnet - one of the two analogue cellular network operators - plans to have 60 per cent of its GSM network in place by year-end and will begin to actively market its system to business customers early next year. Vodafone, the other UK cellular operator, launched a limited GSM network in December and plans to have 90 per cent of its system in place by the middle of this year. Vodafone has already reached GSM roaming agreements with Denmark, Finland, Germany and Sweden and expects to sign shortly with France, Italy and Switzerland. These agreements will eventually allow GSM subscribers carrying their personal smartcards to make calls using a GSM phone anywhere in Europe. The GSM standard also includes a mobile data facility which will eventually enable mobile terminals, such as portable computers and fax machines, to communicate through a GSM handset at speeds comparable to the best of today's fixed telephone data links. It is also compatible with the emerging integrated services digital network, or ISDN. 'As GSM digital networks roll out across Europe and other parts of the world they brink with them a whole new range of features, says Mr Dominic von Trotha Taylor, marketing manager at Vodafone's sister company, Vodata. One of the most significant of these is the GSM Short Message Service which enables GSM handsets equipped with small LCD screens to receive messages like pagers. In December, Vodafone, working with Sema Group's telecom division, became the first GSM network operators to successfully test the short message service feature. This allows an alphanumeric message of up to 160 characters  -twice as long as the typical maximum length paging message - to be displayed on the handset. The messages are sent via the short message service centre and when they arrive at the mobile they are stored in the user's SIM (smart) card ready for retrieval. SMS's unique features include the ability to send or receive messages at the same time as speaking or sending data, an alert feature for informing a third party when a mobile re-registers on the network, the ability to store a message and forward it to the mobile when it is switched on, and acknowledgement of successful message delivery. Mr Martin O'Byrne, managing director of Sema's telecom division, believes that SMS and other features like it will provide network operators with a way of differentiating service offerings. However, GSM and other new premium-priced digital services will not replace the older analogue networks immediately. Existing analogue network operators believe there will be a slow and gradual migration to digital services. 'Analogue systems will be with us for some time,' says Mr Eyers of Dataquest. The pace of transition from analogue to digital cellular systems will vary from country to country. In those countries such as the UK which have well-established analogue systems which are not capacity constrained, the growth of GSM is likely to be relatively slow. Analogue technology will also continue to play a key role in developing countries, including those of eastern Europe where cellular systems are already providing a relatively cheap alternative to dilapidated or non-existent fixed-wire telephone systems in many countries. Elsewhere, fixed-wire telephone systems could also face a challenge - but from other new mobile digital cellular services which are just around the corner. For example, in the UK Vodafone plans to launch a second service on the back of GSM called the Micro-Cellular Network, or MCN, which will be a low-cost digital portable telephone service aimed at domestic customers. Local MCN call charges are expected to be significantly cheaper than GSM services, putting the service in direct competition with fixed telephone networks. MCN is due to be launched in the south-east of England later this year in direct competition with another digital system aimed at the mass market called the personal communications network (PCN). One-2-One, - previously Mercury Personal Communications - a joint venture between Cable and Wireless and US West, plans to launch its PCN service in the London area this summer, expanding throughout the south-east to reach a quarter of the population by April next year. Hutchison Microtel, a joint venture involving Hutchison Telecom UK and British Aerospace, is also building a PCN network but is not expected to launch its service before next year. Elsewhere in Europe, PCN networks are likely to be built in Germany, France and Spain. Some countries have also licensed call-only Telepoint services, such as Hutchison's Rabbit service in the UK and France Telecom's recently-launched Be-Bop service in Paris. In the office environment, cordless systems have been somewhat slower to take off than expected - perhaps because until recently they offered few if any advantages over the fixed-wire systems they were supposed to replace. However that could be changing. Two competing digital alternatives have been developed, one based on the established CT-2 'telepoint' standard and the other built around the emerging Digital European Cordless Telecommunications (Dect) standard for private cordless telecommunications. Dataquest expects 10 to 15 per cent of office telephone systems to be cordless in five years. Certainly, research suggests there is a market for cordless pbx systems. About 60 per cent of business calls fail to reach their intended recipient on the first attempt causing annoyance and expensive games of 'telephone tag.'</p>

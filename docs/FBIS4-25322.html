			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 8 (XINHUA) -- China's coal industry  is actively attracting foreign funds and importing advanced  equipment and techniques to increase productivity.    An official with the Ministry of Coal Industry told XINHUA  that over the past ten years, a total of four billion U.S.  dollars in foreign capital has been used to upgrade China's coal  mines.    This sum includes Japanese energy loans, World Bank loans,  government loans from Sweden, Italy and other countries, and  direct foreign investment.    The official said the Japanese energy loans, granted by the  Japanese Ex-Im Bank, were the principal source of foreign funds  China obtained to build mines and import equipment.    Three installments of the Japanese loans have already been  contracted for the building of coal-production capacity  amounting to 38 million tons, he added.    China began seeking foreign funds for its coal industry, the  country's prominent supplier of energy, in 1982. Acknowledging  this sector's long construction period, huge capital demand and  low investment return, the state has been managing the use of  the foreign loans.    However, the ministry has decided to expand the scope of  foreign capital use, attracting foreign businessmen to directly  invest in the industry by forming joint and cooperative ventures.    These ventures will center on more lucrative projects  involving the construction of mines, pit-mouth power stations,  coal-gasification plants, cement factories and pipelines for  coal transportation.    The ministry believes that drawing foreign capital directly  toward these projects will help to restructure the industry.  "with limited capital sources, the state is unable to allocate  massive investment in this regard," said Han Ying, vice-minister  of coal industry, "so appropriate use of foreign funds is  needed."    Negotiations are under way for a number of initial projects,  including coal-gasification engineering in Henan Province,  opencast mines and power plants in Inner Mongolia, pipeline for  coal transportation from Shanxi to Shandong, two neighboring  provinces in northern China.    The import of advanced equipment and technology started even  earlier. In the 1970s, more than two hundred sets of fully  mechanized mining equipment were introduced from western  countries as well as some from Eastern European.    This effort was strengthened in the 1980s to equip coal  mines  with more advanced imported facilities, such as shearers,  road-headers, hydraulic supports and high-capacity conveyers.    Now the index of mechanized mining in key state-run mines  stands at 72 percent with fully-mechanized mining at 44 percent,  the official said.    He said China plans to introduce more equipment and  technology from abroad in the coming years to further upgrade  the production level as well as the productivity of the coal  industry.    China produced 1.14 billion tons of coal last year, ranking  first in the world. Estimates show that by 2000, the coal  output will reach 1.4 billion tons, providing 69 percent of the  country's primary sources of energy.    The official said that an international meeting to attract  foreign funds is scheduled for autumn this year. "new channels  will be opened and more foreign capital used to shore up coal  enterprises' capability of financing and promoting the  development of the industry," he added.</p>

			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> NO CHARGES FILED IN NEWBORN'S DEATH  </P> <P> The Orange County district attorney's office will not prosecute a 15-year-old  high school honor student whose newborn son drowned in a campus toilet minutes  after birth. Prosecutors initially had sought to file murder charges against  the girl, who gave birth Nov. 28 in a bathroom stall at Santiago High School in  Garden Grove, and later considered involuntary manslaughter or child  endangerment charges. But after interviewing the girl and consulting with  physicians, prosecutors concluded the student was close to blacking out after  giving birth and therefore unable to respond to the infant, Deputy Dist. Atty.  John Conley said. "The way she described it, she never even thinks of picking  up the baby," he said. The girl apparently never told anyone about her  pregnancy and tried to hide her condition under loose-fitting clothing. The  girl's parents only learned of her pregnancy after the birth, authorities said.  </P></p>

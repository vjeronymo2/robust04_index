			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: UK gilts The Bank of England may come to regret remaining aloof to the commercial fortunes of the gilt-edged market makers. It could not stop the government rushing into last month's interest rate cut in the middle of a gilts auction. But that should not lead it to belittle the losses incurred by market makers as a result. The gilts market has shown a consistently poor return on capital since Big Bang. Even allowing for recent arrivals such as Deutsche Bank and Nikko, capital committed to the market declined from Pounds 600m in 1986 to little more than Pounds 400m last year. In the days of public sector debt repayment, that was hardly a concern. But set against the Pounds 50bn government borrowing programme in 1993-94, the gilts market looks thinly capitalised. That will cramp the authorities' funding style. Under the Bank's own prudential rules, the market-makers in aggregate are forbidden from running long positions much in excess of Pounds 5bn from one day to the next. Even allowing that institutional investors can place bids direct, there is little scope for replacing the current ad hoc combination of medium-sized auctions and taps with a more predictable timetable of large auctions. That will disappoint reformers. Giant auctions which result in large and therefore liquid individual issues might attract foreign money. While the conduct of UK monetary policy remains so unpredictable, though, there may be virtue in necessity. The failure of a large auction -  even for a reason beyond the Bank's control, such as an unexpected rise in interest rates - would blow a serious hole in the funding programme.</p>

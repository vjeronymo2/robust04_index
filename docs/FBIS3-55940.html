The authority of Viktor Luchin, as well as that of Valeriy  Zorkin, was suspended December 1, 1993, due to accusations of  political activity, which is inadmissible for CC judges. In  particular, Luchin was accused of his participation in the  congresses of Russia's communist party, at the congress of  former People's Deputies, and in the election campaign waged  last autumn. However, last November 15 Luchin removed his  candidacy from lists of the Agrarian party, and there have been  no congresses of the communist party or former People's Deputies  of the USSR in the course of the previous year. Luchin believes  that there are no grounds to suspend his authority.    According to Moyseyenko, Luchin intends to continue his  hunger strike until the court passes a decision. As far as  Valeriy Zorkin is concerned, he disapproves Luchin's decision,  reported Moyseyenko.</p>

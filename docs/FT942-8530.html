			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Wounded Maoists remain armed and dangerous: The Huallaga valley, where the Peruvian armed forces are mounting an assault on Shining Path guerrillas Fourteen years since the left-wing Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso) movement erupted from clandestine political agitation into overt military action in Peru, army chiefs and the pro-government press claim that the 'final offensive' against the Maoists is under way. The principal 'battle zone' is deep in the semi-tropical jungle, on the left bank of the Huallaga river, 300 miles north-east of the capital and long notorious as being near where most of Peru's coca leaf, the raw material for cocaine, is grown. Reports of hundreds of troops mobilised, of helicopter attacks against the civilian population and of fleeing terrorists have dominated Peru's newspapers for the past three weeks. Human rights organisations, meanwhile, have presented testimony alleging rape, torture and summary execution of civilians by government troops. Visits to the zone by journalists and the Congressional commission forhuman rights have failed to clarify the picture. In this inaccessible and lawless area, the truth is hard to discover. But several facts do emerge: first, the military operation involves no more than a couple of hundred soldiers, a similar number of guerrillas and a maximum of two elderly helicopters; second, the combat area is sparsely populated, making large-scale air attack impossible; third, there have been innocent victims. This is a low-technology conflict, largely entrusted to 16- and 17 year-old recruits who must foot-slog through mud and dense undergrowth for perhaps a week before encountering the enemy. In this terrain, which they have controlled for a decade, Sendero guerrillas have the upper hand. Jungle paths are mined and ambushes easily laid. The wounded must usually be carried out on stretchers. The left bank of the Huallaga is now one of the last real bastions for Sendero, severely weakened since the capture in September 1992 of Abimael Guzman, the movment's founder and leader, and the subsequent arrest of most of its known, high-ranking leaders. Along the Huallaga, Sendero has sustained a long and profitable co-operation with drug traffickers and coca-growers, many of them migrants from the impoverished Andean highlands. Sendero's war chest, swollen with proceeds of protection rackets and landing charges for drug traffickers' flights from small airstrips, has allowed the guerrillas to acquire relatively sophisticated arms, including rocket-propelled grenades and Soviet-made machine-guns. Now, for the first time, the Peruvian government is making an attempt to clear the area. Prior to operations, a massive propaganda campaign - via leaflets dropped by helicopter, radio and television broadcasts - called on subversives and sympathisers to 'repent'. Many residents of the small, Sendero-controlled towns on the right bank of the river saw the security forces regaining the upper hand and complied. Entire villages have turned themselves in and been given a clean bill of health by the army. Much of this repentance, of course, is false. 'Sendero would come around sometimes and demand food,' said one tearful local shopkeeper. 'You have to help them or they kill you. But why should I have to repent for that?' Repentance, and the safe-conduct pass which comes with it, helps the security forces to distinguish friend from foe. But many locals say they are 'friends' from necessity, complaining meanwhile of widespread army abuses, including petty theft, rape and other physical maltreatment. Arrepentidos (those who have repented) with more clout get lenient treatment in return for surrendering weapons and informing on former comrades-in-arms. Some, though, like 17-year-old Comrade America - now a guide for the army at Tingo Mara - seem genuinely disillusioned: 'It's an awful life with Sendero  -you sleep in the undergrowth and eat like an animal. If you lapse from party discipline three times, they kill you. They pull out your tongue with pliers.' Battles in the backlands of Peru against similar, well-established pockets of resistance may be expected for some time. At the national level, the government of President Alberto Fujimori can point to numerous successes in counter-subversion. Statistics show that political violence continues to decline. This year so far, both the number of guerrilla attacks and the death toll have dropped to about a third of last year's already reduced levels. Another indicator of enhanced security is the number of foreign miners and geologists moving freely throughout remote Andean areas considered no-go zones 18 months ago. Some of this success is due to the creation of rondas, armed community self-defence groups supported by, and sometimes directly under the control of, the army. The capture of Guzman, however, has not resulted in the hoped-for final capitulation of Sendero. He has said he is ready to 'negotiate'; Mr Fujimori has insisted on full surrender first. Guzman clearly wields power over other imprisoned party leaders but no longer controls those still at large. Recent Sendero documents show him still revered as an ideologue but, as several sources underline, 'an imprisoned Maoist is a dead Maoist'. The mantle of logistical command has fallen to Oscar Ramrez Durand, known as Comrade Feliciano. His faction, now widely called Red Sendero, seems incapable of large-scale, co-ordinated action, but remains dangerous. (Black Sendero is what they call the members in jail.) The government and the armed forces stick to what Mr Fujimori calls 'the radical change in counter-subversive strategy - winning over the population'. According to the president, 'the war is not yet over (but) the situation is under control'.</p>

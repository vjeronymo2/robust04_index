			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANTS / MAX JACOBSON;  </P> <P> CHINESE DINING EXPERIENCE IS EASY ON THE EYE, LESS SO ON PALATE, POCKETBOOK  </P> <P> The gentrification of Chinese food has reached new heights of absurdity. Take  Five Feet Too, a high-sheen, more finished version of Laguna Beach's Five Feet.  This is the sort of place that attracts glossy Newport Beach types who don't  seem to mind snuggling up to kung pao chicken at $17 a plate.  </P> <P> I do admit, however, that the restaurant has a striking design -- lots of  jutting, angular cornices; an all-steel open kitchen; designer chairs; floor  cacti taller than NBA centers and a collection of modern art (most of which is  for sale) that could rival some small museums. Trendy stone-block tables are  embellished with fresh orchid petals in little, pool-like candleholders, and  long, thin, black-lacquer chopsticks offset by white napkins.  </P> <P> A brilliant visual sense also dominates the food here. Colorful purees get  dribbled onto plates, and fan-cut vegetable garnishes, rounds of goat cheese or  mounds of raspberries turn up where you least expect them. But many of the  dishes that chef-owner Michael Kang prepares feed the eye at the expense of the  palate. The well-seasoned kitchen staff at the original Laguna Beach location  might be able to bring off Kang's exotic attempts at contempo Chinese, but the  inexperienced Newport team makes you long for anybody else's 5 combination with  sweet-and-sour pork.  </P> <P> On my ill-starred first visit, I let Kang's creative impulses affect my better  judgment. I should have guessed the consequences, for instance, of ordering a  smoked-chicken-and-goat-cheese won ton with an apple-raspberry-shallot coulis.  Or the smoked Peking duck quesadilla: It came swimming in a funny, sourish  pineapple relish and tasted no different than any soggy Mexican version.  Furthermore, the duck might as well have been ground beef.  </P> <P> Another annoyance turned up that night in the service department: The waitress  informed us that she couldn't order our appetizers until we decided on our  entrees. (I'm bothered by rules that put the restaurant's own convenience above  customer wishes.)  </P> <P> My advice is to avoid any dish that looks overtly precious. Daily specials are  the worst offenders. Sauteed swordfish with a toasted almond sesame fig crust  and a citrus butter is the kind of dish that could send nouvelle Chinese  cuisine back to the Ming era. Worst new idea? Vegetable moo-shu with a tomato  fondue -- and that's on the regular menu.  </P> <P> Dishes similar to those at the original Laguna restaurant are a drastic  improvement, but not quite as good as those at the source. Mama Kang's pot  stickers with a ginger-soy vinaigrette are somewhat bland, but fun to eat. And  the restaurant's signature dish, a deep-fried whole catfish, is excellent as  usual, but comes in a braised tomato citrus sauce not nearly as good as the  original ginger sauce.  </P> <P> I had better luck on my second visit. Our first dish, curried spring rolls in a  papaya mayonnaise with a lean filling of curried beef, had a delicate crunch  and left a sweet, pleasant sensation on the tongue. The evening's soup -- a  puree of wild mushrooms and fresh herbs -- had a terrific grainy, persistent  flavor. And I liked the smoked trout salad with baby greens and papaya  interestingly balanced by a vinaigrette flavored with basil, fennel and lemon.  </P> <P> Still, some basic flaws in the kitchen just can't be glossed over: Tough, dry  rice; Fruits misused in sauces and salad dressings. And the irksome habit of  serving wok-fried meats in cigarette-package-sized hunks, making them unwieldy.  Mongolian lamb loin with shiitake and green onions, for instance, would have  been delightful if it had been easier to eat. On the other hand, bite-sized  portions wouldn't have eliminated the chewy texture of veal loin in a dish  called Veal Chinois (it came with Sonoma sausage, squash and sun-dried  tomatoes).  </P> <P> I did enjoy Kung Pao Three, mostly chicken and peanuts with a few shrimp and  scallops thrown in. The dish isn't necessarily better than one you'd find at  your local mom-and-pop Chinese cafe, and it's probably three times the price.  That may offend my wallet but not my taste buds. This restaurant could use a  few of these more familiar dishes.  </P> <P> Desserts at Five Feet Too are surely the restaurant's most consistent course.  One night I had a fine cheesecake with a rich, nutty crust. Another I had a  smooth, velvety chocolate-hazelnut torte and a cocktail glass filled with fresh  berries and a homemade white chocolate raspberry ice cream. The dessert chef  knows how to use the humble raspberry. Take note, Mr. Kang.  </P> <P> Five Feet Too is expensive -- too expensive. Appetizers range from $5 to $9.  Entrees are $15 to $24.  </P> <P> FIVE FEET TOO  </P> <P> 1145 Newport Center Drive (in Fashion Island), Newport Beach  </P> <P> (714) 640-5250  </P> <P> Open daily from 11:30 to midnight.  </P> <P> All major credit cards accepted.  </P></p>

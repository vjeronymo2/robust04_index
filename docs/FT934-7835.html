			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Courtaulds hit by China squeeze COURTAULDS, the chemicals and fibres group, yesterday warned that the Chinese credit squeeze had hit sales of three of its most important businesses. The company explained that European and US prices had been affected by Asian production being diverted from the slowing Chinese market. The shares fell 44p to 432p. Pre-tax profits rose 9 per cent in the six months to September 30, from Pounds 88.4m to Pounds 96.4m, helped by a Pounds 24.4m net gain on disposals. Operating profits fell from Pounds 92.5m to Pounds 86.4m on turnover of Pounds 991.7m, against Pounds 911.7m. The results were flattered by currency changes. At constant exchange rates, turnover and operating profits would have been Pounds 46m and Pounds 5.8m lower respectively. Courtaulds warned it would make a restructuring provision of Pounds 35m-Pounds 45m for its north American and European coating operations. Capital spending would also be considerably higher in the second half. Mr Sipko Huismans, chief executive, said the anti-inflation drive in China had serious knock-on effects. 'Production of acrylics and acetate tow that were previously going to China have been diverted to Europe, although some Chinese acrylic buying has lifted prices a bit.' Surplus viscose from China had started reaching the US and would adversely affect second-half sales. Mr Huismans said he was not overwhelmed by the recovery in the US economy. 'Consumer confidence has returned . . . but you need confidence to sanction capital projects.' Mr Huismans said sales of Tencel, its innovative fibre, were constrained by capacity. The board announced it would invest Dollars 134m (Pounds 90m) in a new 30,000-tonnes-a-year plant in Alabama. Another plant would be built, at Kelheim in Germany or Grimsby in the UK. Net borrowings were down from Pounds 300m last September to Pounds 183m. Net interest was, however, up from Pounds 5.2m to Pounds 15.4m, partly due to a lower pension fund credit and less return on sterling deposits. There was a net cash inflow of Pounds 35.9m compared with an outflow for the same period last year of Pounds 66.5m. Earnings per share rose from 18.1p to 19.5p. The dividend was raised from 3.8p per share to 4p. Lex, Page 22 London SE, Page 50 Details, Page 26</p>

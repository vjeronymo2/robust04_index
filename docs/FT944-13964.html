			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium price rise too fast for comfort, say analysts Sharply rising aluminium prices are putting intense pressure on companies to re-start production capacity that was shut down following the international trade agreement reached in February, analysts suggest. Some trade delegates at their next meeting to monitor the trade deal - in November - will be arguing that capacity should be re-started, suggests Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial services group. He adds, however, 'this does not mean that the (arrangement) is about to collapse. But it does suggest to us that it is starting to crumble well before its end-1995 deadline'. Mr Tony Bird, of the Anthony Bird Associates consultancy organisation, also warns: 'If (aluminium) prices continue to rise inexorably in the short term the (trade agreement) would collapse quickly and chaotically; there would be no easing at all of the flow of Russian metal (to the west); consumers would be deterred from using aluminium; London Metal Exchange stocks would begin to rise again. Put another way, the higher prices go, the harder they will fall'. Both analysts suggest that aluminium companies are unhappy about the recent surge, which has taken prices to levels they did not expect until the middle or end of 1995. Mr Arnold says, in Merrill's latest monthly metals report: 'Although most consumers, merchants and dealers are that we speak to are looking for Dollars 1,800 a tonne in early 1995, some producers will tell you, strictly off the record, that they don't want to see prices go that high. The higher prices go above the Dollars 1,800 a tonne level, the more uncompetitive the aluminium can becomes against plastic in the US and steel in Europe'. In his latest 'Aluminium Analysis' publication, Mr Bird suggests that aluminium companies 'are not showing any great confidence in current price levels'. Prices will have to fall, he adds. In the 1984-87 metals boom aluminium prices rose too quickly in the early days and then fell by 30 per cent over three years, he points out. 'The correction this time is most likely to take the form of a decline to about 67 cents a pound (Dollars 1,477 a tonne) by the fourth quarter of 1995, followed by a steadier and more sustainable price rally in 1996 and 1997.' Mr Bird suggests that the 'cost justified' price today is 64 to 66 cents a pound (Dollars 1,410 to Dollars 1,455), rising to 74 cents (Dollars 1,631) in today's money in the medium term.</p>

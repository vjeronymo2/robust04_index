			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAKE FOREST;  </P> <P> FLYING METAL KILLS MAN AT HOUSING SITE  </P> <P> A Riverside man was killed at a construction site Monday when a small piece of  metal from a bulldozer snapped off, flew 30 feet and struck him in the chest,  authorities said.  </P> <P> Jerry Steven Bechel, 31, was pronounced dead at the scene, Sheriff's Lt.  Richard J. Olson said.  </P> <P> Olson said the accident occurred shortly before 10:30 a.m. at the Foothill  Ranch housing development in Lake Forest, an unincorporated area near El Toro.  </P> <P> Workers were folding one of the metal tracks on a large bulldozer with a  forklift when part of the track snapped off, according to Jim Johnson, vice  president of McCoy Construction Co. of Calabasas, the contractor providing the  grading for the development.  </P> <P> Bechel, a driver for McCoy Construction, was standing by his truck 30 feet from  the bulldozer when he was struck in the chest by a piece of metal "about the  size of a fingernail," Johnson said. The metal pierced a blood vessel in his  chest, causing him to bleed to death, Johnson said.  </P> <P> "This was an extremely freak accident," Johnson said. "It has nothing to do  with construction. . . . It was one of those things that if you were in there a  thousand other times it wouldn't have happened."  </P> <P> Bechel was the first McCoy employee killed on the job, Johnson added.  </P> <P> Jim Brown, district manager for Cal/OSHA in Anaheim, said the accident was  being investigated.

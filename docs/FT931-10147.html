			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Business and the Environment: Sceptical ears are deaf to old refrain Destruction, deterioration and degradation of the environment is the refrain of the 10th edition of State of the World, the annual bible of the Worldwatch Institute, a Washington DC-based think tank known for its gloomy forecasts of the world's future. The institute and its founder, Lester Brown, have built a considerable international reputation on the back of this annual compilation* of reports and essays, translated into 27 languages. But despite this year's emphasis on the economic costs of environmental damage, the book is part of that broad stream of environmental writing likely to be of interest mainly to the converted. The collection - each of the nine chapters by a different author - bombards the reader with warnings of disaster and exhortations to action, from reviving coral reefs to 'rediscovering rail' and 'preparing for peace'. This apparent lack of discrimination between problems is particularly marked in Brown's opening chapter, which crams a reference to most environmental issues into 17 pages. The problems have never been greater, he claims, while faith in science to solve them has shrunk. Assumptions are presented as fact in sub-clauses such as ' . . . given the deteriorating state of the planet . . . ' along with other highly debatable views. One of his central claims is that 'the environmentally destructive activities of recent decades are now showing up in reduced productivity of croplands, forests and fisheries . . . in rising health care costs for cancer, birth defects, allergies, emphysema, asthma'. However, these sweeping assertions ignore the argument that increased incidence of cancer in industrialised societies is partly due to people living longer - by many standards a success. Nor do they question how much food production in Africa or the former Soviet Union has been affected by political disruption. His most ambitious claim is perhaps that we have arrived at 'the end of rapid GNP growth', and that the 'worldwide' recession he has identified is caused partly by 'environmental degradation'. His study quotes scientific reports suggesting that annual 'losses' from sulphur deposits on European forests could be Dollars 30bn (Pounds 20bn) a year. However it does not attempt to offset these against the extra costs that would fall on industry from cleaning up, and so is able to reach the conclusion that such pollution is causing a 'heavy economic toll'. A reluctance to recognise successful responses to threats is also detectable in statements such as: 'In Rio (at last year's Earth Summit) the risks to life posed by the loss of stratospheric ozone were on everyone's mind, a threat not even imagined in 1972.' But treaties to phase out ozone-depleting chemicals were in place at that point, which gave many Rio delegates hope that more complex problems of climate change could be successfully tackled. When pressed on these questions face to face, Brown gives clearer answers than his text, and ranks population growth and global warming as the most important threats. Many would agree with those priorities, including the new Clinton administration, which has just indicated that it will restore public funding for the United Nations Population Fund, curtailed in the 1980s because of domestic objections to work involving abortion. Although reluctant, like many environmentalists, to welcome nuclear power as a solution to the carbon dioxide problem, he says: 'Our objections are not for ideological reasons but for economic ones - it doesn't look to us as though nuclear is going to make it.' He also argues: 'I'm not saying there aren't solutions for environmental problems, just that we can't keep on doing what we're doing.' However, few of those qualifications have made it into print. This year's Worldwatch report is dispiriting because of what it suggests about the state of environmental debate, rather than the state of the world. *State of the World, 10th anniversary edition, Worldwatch Institute, Earthscan Publications, 120 Pentonville Road, London N1 9JN. pp268, Pounds 9.95.</p>

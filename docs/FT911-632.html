			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Major considers plan to improve public services - Citizens' Charter MR JOHN Major hopes to set out this summer his plans for improving public services via a 'citizen's charter' which could see the introduction of performance-related pay for many civil servants, Whitehall officials said yesterday. Wide-ranging proposals are being considered by the Downing Street policy unit following the submission of ideas by government departments. Ideas include paying compensation to consumers if services  - such as rail travel  -are un-satisfactory or giving bonuses for improving quality. The provision of education, health services and state benefits are believed to be of particular concern to Mr Major. One official said the proposals were 'in the spirit' of the government's existing health service reforms. Details of the schemes have yet to be finalised, however, and could be watered-down before publication. In particular, any proposals for rewarding high performance teachers could clash with the government decision in April to set up a independent teachers' pay and conditions review body. Mr Major, as a former chancellor, is thought to be particularly attracted to the possible economic benefits of performance related pay. Labour has proposed similar schemes for enhancing citizen's rights across a range of public sector services, including the possibility of compensation for aggrieved consumers. The government's plans, to be published in a white paper, could also be extended to include privatised companies, such as British Telecom, which are subject to the control of regulatory authorities. Officials denied, however, it was an admission that privatisation had not improved the service offered by former nationalised industries. Mr Major offered his 'citizen's charter' to Conservative party activists in a speech in Southport in March as part of his plans for extending the policies of his predecessor, Mrs Thatcher. Officials said yesterday his plans were more than just a likely manifesto commitment. Legislation could be introduced in the Queens speech this Autumn if necessary. Mr Major is likely to reiterate his enthusiasm for the scheme when he addresses the Scottish Tory conference in Perth today. Many public services are controlled by local authorities. They could be given incentives, via the system of central government grants, to re-negotiate contracts with private contractors so as to incorporate rights of consumers. The government will also want to be sure any changes to pay contracts of civil servants will not lead to inordinate increases in public spending. It may also decide performance measures are too bureaucratic, particularly when it comes to measuring the output of teachers or health service workers. One suggestion for council workers, such as refuse collectors, was that performance could be measured according to complaints received.</p>

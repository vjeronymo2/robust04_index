			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Yoshihisa Komori] </F>   [Text] Washington, 25 Jan -- With the Japan-U.S. framework  trade talks still deadlocked, criticism has begun to emerge  among officials in some quarters of the Foreign Ministry,  including the Japanese Embassy in the United States, against the  hard-line attitude the Japanese Government is currently taking  in the trade talks. The officials admit it was a mistake for  the Japanese Government to turn its back on the "general idea"  that clearly admits to the low level of market openness in  Japan. They feel that Japanese negotiators have lost sight of  the broad trade issues involved and have been forced to focus  their attention on countering U.S. negotiators on the  "particulars" of the issues. The officials are concerned that,  as a result, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's planned visit to  the United States will achieve nothing. Their views apparently  reflect such concerns.    Vice ministerial talks were held in Washington on 25 January  to discuss the issues, but both sides refused to make any  concessions. At this rate, it has become increasingly unlikely  that there will be practical results from the 11 February talks  between Prime Minister Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton.    With such grim prospects in view, officials in some quarters  of the Foreign Ministry, including the Japanese Embassy in the  United States, who watch Japanese-U.S. relations closely, have  reportedly deepened their "concern about the growing feeling of  distrust between Japanese and U.S. negotiators."    In the framework trade talks, the United States has argued  that the microeconomic (individual) sectors of government  procurement, insurance services, and automobiles and auto parts  in Japan "are less open than the U.S. and European markets, and  the concept of horizontal international specialization (in which  nations mutually import and export industrial products to  supplement each other) is still underdeveloped there; therefore,  it is necessary to resolve the problem by increasing imports in  services as well as products to correct the imbalance in  bilateral current account payments." The Japanese Foreign  Ministry officials noted above feel this argument is essentially  correct.    Meanwhile, the Japanese Government officials directly in  charge of trade negotiations have been at odds with U.S.  negotiators. They have presented the following three principles  to the Americans: 1) market access should proceed on a two-way  basis; 2) the setting of numerical targets should be rejected;  and 3) the scope of government responsibility must be clarified.    The critical Foreign Ministry officials noted above complain  that "although it is undeniable that the issue of Japanese  market access has been taken lightly by Japanese negotiators, it  seems they have devoted themselves to refuting U.S. arguments on  the `particulars' of the three principles and rejected the  `general idea' itself."    Japanese negotiators have also demanded the United States  abolish government control of insurance services and government  procurement on the basis of a "two-way traffic" principle. The  Foreign Ministry dissenters say: "Japan should actively deal  with the government procurement system and insurance business  market access as problems in themselves. Taking up U.S.  problems could make the Americans think Japan is trying to avoid  the real issues." The officials also say: "If demands on the  United States are not kept to a minimum, the whole purpose of  the framework trade talks will be lost."    Such criticism has also been presented to Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata in the form of a statement of opinion. It has  resulted in the unusual situation of bureaucratic domination of  the trade talks being condemned by bureaucrats. The dissenters  have also urged Japan to make more concessions on automobiles  and auto parts, saying: "Although it is true there has been a  lack of effort by U.S. automakers to export to Japan, there is,  on the other hand, room for Japanese car dealer organizations to  improve the closed nature of the market and understanding of the  regulations involved."    Among these critical Foreign Ministry bureaucrats, are some  who feel no real progress in the framework trade talks can be  made before the Japan-U.S. summit meeting. As a result they  suggest that Prime Minister Hosokawa should take the opportunity  to formally reexamine the improper attitude Japan has taken in  the bilateral trade talks. Among the unfair claims Japan has  made in the past are: "Japanese snow is different (so  foreign-made skis cannot be imported)"; "there are no  differences in prices between Japan and abroad"; "U.S.-made  metal baseball bats are dangerous (so they cannot be imported)";  and "foreign drugs are too strong for the Japanese (so they  cannot be imported)."    The critics say Prime Minister Hosokawa should frankly  admit that such a narrow-minded, erroneous approach has been  taken solely by bureaucrats themselves. They also say that in  certain circumstances, Hosokawa should even express an  "apology," stressing the difference between "administration" and  "bureaucracy" by clarifying that he does not intend to support  such bureaucrats or their ideas. The critics feel that if  Hosokawa can appear to have such a bold understanding and  positive attitude toward market opening, the atmosphere in the  United States would considerably improve even if concrete  results are not achieved in the framework trade talks. They  feel this would act as a "stop-gap measure" for several months  and help put off the crisis.</p>

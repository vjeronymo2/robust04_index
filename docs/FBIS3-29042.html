			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Feb. 5 (ANTARA) -- Foreign Minister Ali  Alatas Tuesday that it is not unusual for the international  media to raise stories on East Timor ahead of the United Nations  Commission on Human Rights Convention in Geneva. "These  sensational news stories are aimed at attracting world attention  on East Timor," he told the press after accompanying the  visiting German state minister of foreign affairs, Ursula Seiler  Albring, to a courtesy call on President Suharto.    The Australian SYDNEY MORNING HERALD recently published a  report of an "Orgy of Killing" in East Timor following what came  to be called the "Dili incident." The daily was quoting a BBC  documentary producer whose original footage of the Dili incident  helped incite international condemnation on Indonesia's  treatment of its youngest province. The British Broadcasting  Corporation film maker said he had lived illegally in East Timor  for 3 months. On that claim, Alatas said: "Without our notice,  it would be very impossible for him to stay there for almost  three months." When asked about a foreign journalist's  application to produce a film in the province, Alatas said his  ministry was still considering the request.    On the occasion, the minister also disclosed his plans to  visit Myanmar [Burma] and Laos at the invitation of the two  countries.    He said his visit to Myanmar was aimed at finding out the  latest development in the country, including discussing matters  for the next Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  ministerial meeting.    Commenting on China's protest over the recent "vacation  visit" of Taiwanese President Li Teng-hui to Bali, Alatas said  no other official protests were lodged after the end of Li's  stay. He reiterated Indonesia's "one-China policy" and said that  Jakarta recognised only mainland China as a nation and state. He  stressed that ties between Indonesia and Taiwan were maintained  at economic and trade level.</p>

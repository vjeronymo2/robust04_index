			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Sun Alliance drops bid to buy ECGD insurance offshoot SUN ALLIANCE, the UK insurance company, has withdrawn from the bidding for the short-term credit insurance business of the Export Credits Guarantee Department. The decision leaves only three of the original six potential bidders still in contention. Sun Alliance, long conspicuous for its lack of aggression as a bidder, said prospective net premium income, estimated at Pounds 22m, did not justify the resources required to integrate ECGD into its other operations. The company was also concerned that the reinsurance arrangements being negotiated by the government with the private sector might lack 'robustness' in the longer term. It had decided therefore that the acquisition of the business would not fit in with either its domestic activities or its expansion plans for Europe. Its decision to withdraw will come as a further blow to the government, which has been struggling to push the sale through against strong opposition from the export industry. Eagle Star and Cobac, the Belgian credit insurance company, have already withdrawn. Bids for the business must be submitted by noon today. Trade Indemnity, the UK company that dominates the domestic market for credit insurance; NCM of the Netherlands; and Assicurazioni Generali of Italy are expected to bid. Insurance market specialists said the chances of the Italian company's likely bid being successful have improved recently. Although it lacks the direct experience of credit insurance of the other two contenders, it has a strong balance sheet and the overall size of its operations give it much influence in the vital reinsurance market. Trade Indemnity lost Pounds 29m last year as the UK recession brought a series of claims on bankrupt companies. Brokers said it would need to persuade its reluctant shareholders - mostly other insurance and reinsurance companies - to subscribe to a rights issue to create the resources to bid for ECGD. The company declined to comment yesterday. NCM, which also acts as the official export credit insurer for the Dutch government, is profitable at present, with net profits for 1990 up 18 per cent to Fl 33.6m (Pounds 10m). It said last week it believed it had a good chance of winning the contest.</p>

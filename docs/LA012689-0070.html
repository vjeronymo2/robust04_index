			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEEF BUNDLES GIVE MOM THE NIGHT OFF  </P> <P> This idea for Beef Bundles is an ideal way to give Mom the night off. Let the  children help prepare the packets, then just whisk the packets into the oven.  </P> <P> Cut 1 pound top round steak into 4 serving-size portions. Dust each with  mixture of 2 tablespoons flour combined with 1 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon  thyme and dash black pepper and dash paprika. Place each portion in center of  12-inch, double-thick square of heavy-duty foil. Combine 1 cup sliced carrots,  1 cup sliced zucchini and 1/4 cup sliced green onions and place even amounts of  vegetable mixture in meat packets. Fold foil over and seal edges tightly. Roast  at 325 degrees about 1 hour or until steak is tender.  </P></p>

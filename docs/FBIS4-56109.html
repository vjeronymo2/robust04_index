			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov  is already at the National Assembly rostrum and Prime Minister  Lyuben Berov is in the Assembly hall. Everything is ready for  the official announcement.    [Yordanov] I call upon Mr. Kiril Zhelev to announce the  results of the voting on the confidence motion in the cabinet of  Lyuben Berov.    [Zhelev] A secret vote took place today at the request of  the Council of Ministers to receive a vote of confidence.  [passage omitted] Some 221 National Assembly deputies voted.  Some 125 cast their ballots in support of the confidence  motion, with 95 against. One National Assembly member cast an  empty vote. There were no invalid ballots. On the basis of the  results, the National Assembly of the Republic of Bulgaria,  based on Article 112, Paragraph 1 of the Bulgarian Constitution  and in connection with Article 83, Paragraph 4 of the  Regulations on National Assembly Activity, has decided to grant  confidence in the government in connection with its Program of  Intent Until September 1994.    [Yordanov] Mr. Prime Minister, you may take the floor.    [Berov] Esteemed Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, and  People's Representatives: It is usually customary on such  occasions to express gratitude. However, I think that even  those who, because of various reasons, oppose me would hardly  envy me for the task that has been bestowed on me for the next  three and a half months. This task is to steer the ship on  which all of us are traveling through troubled voters, near  dangerous rocks, and toward some safe port. This is a difficult  task and this is a contradictory country. I promise to make  every effort to implement my task and steer the ship toward a  safe port. Thank you. [applause, jeers]    [Yordanov] Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. I now hand the  floor over to Mr. Vasil Gotsev, who will speak on behalf of the  Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] parliamentary faction.    [Gotsev] Esteemed Mr. Chairman, esteemed ladies and  gentlemen, People's Representatives, and Mr. Professor Berov,  who, after everything that has happened, I cannot calmly call  Mr. Prime Minister:    We have witnessed another parliamentary farce, which took  place in this hall last week. [passage omitted] After being  supported by only 25 members of the National Assembly in last  week's no-confidence motion proposed by the SDS, the prime  minister failed to do what a prime minister should do in every  democratic state where the parliament and the Constitution are  respected -- resign. [passage omitted] Instead of doing this  -- devoid of any political and human dignity, pardon the  expression -- this prime minister forced us to vote confidence  in connection with this government's plans until September 1994.  [passage omitted]    Only 25 deputies gave you their vote of confidence last  week.  This means you did not receive a vote of confidence for what you  have done so far. Why then did you ask for a vote of confidence  until September? What parliament prolonged the life of this  disgraceful cabinet by giving it their confidence?    Indeed, what actually took place today behind closed doors  --  on the one hand, at the meeting of the Bulgarian Socialist Party  faction, where long discussions were held and where prudent  people certainly said that we must proceed toward early  parliamentary elections and, on then other hand, in your room,  Mr. Dogan? You implemented the instructions of the ambassador  of a foreign state, the very same state that under the name of  the USSR dictated everything that took place in our country.  Today you obeyed the orders of [Russian] Ambassador Avdeyev.  This shows the civilized world your true colors.    Ladies and gentlemen and people's representatives, we are  witnessing the agony of our state, not just the agony of this  government. All of you who supported a prime minister that  disregarded the Constitution, the principles of  parliamentarianism, and the interests of the Bulgarian people  contributed to this agony. However, despite your desire to rule  until the end of your life at the early elections, the Bulgarian  people will cast their votes for those who today did not support  you. [applause]    [Yordanov] Thank you, Mr. Gotsev. I close the session. The  next session will take place tomorrow at 0900.</p>

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Age crisis for compact discs Nothing lasts forever, and videocassettes and compact discs are no exception. Researchers at The Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) believe that CDs may stop producing sound after about 30 years because the pits in the metal surface will have oxidised. Video recordings are at risk because they are gradually deleted as the tape is demagnetised. Random checks from Dutch video archives showed blue-tinged and striped images often after three years. It seems that even CD-Rom, the latest electronic storage medium, has only a limited lifespan. TNO plans further experiments to find out just how durable contemporary sound and image storage media are. TNO: Netherlands, 3115 694975.</p>

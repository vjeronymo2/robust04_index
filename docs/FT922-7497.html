			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / CBI Distributive Trades Survey: Retailers report highest sales for two years BRITAIN'S hard-pressed retailers made their highest sales for two years in April, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday, but a strong high-street recovery is still a long way off. According to the CBI's latest quarterly survey of the distributive trades, retail sales volumes last month were above the levels of a year ago. After a poor performance in March, they resumed the upward trend in sales growth experienced since the middle of last year. Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, said: 'These are the best results we have seen for two years but there is a long way to go before any trader would describe today's conditions as a high-street boom.' The survey, which covers more than 15,000 retail and wholesale outlets, showed considerable differences within the industry. In spite of the improvement on a year ago, retailers said sales remained poor for the time of year, while wholesalers described them as average. Fortunes were very mixed in the retail sector. Mr Whittaker said: 'For every retailer reporting good sales, two say they are still poor for the time of year.' A balance of 20 per cent - the percentage responding 'up' minus the percentage responding 'down' - said sales in April were up on a year ago. That was slightly lower than at the beginning of the year. The survey says: 'This suggests that while sales did improve after the ending of election uncertainties, it was far from a mini-boom.' Grocers, chemists, confectioners and carpet and furniture stores reported sales well up on a year ago. Sellers of electrical and other household goods said sales growth was more moderate, while sales were down for clothing stores, off licences, booksellers and stationers compared with a year ago. Retailers expect the underlying improvement in sales to continue, but said stocks were still too high in relation to expected sales. April sales growth for wholesalers was slower than in March, but orders remained up on April last year. Sales volumes are expected to rise in May but more slowly. Stocks remained too high relative to expected sales. Motor traders reported that sales were still poor but had improved considerably for the time of year since last month. They expected sales volumes to show annual growth in May for the first time since April 1989. Orders were down on last year but falling more slowly than in March. The Week Ahead, Page 12</p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Shergar damages case fails Shareholders in the kidnapped Derby winner Shergar yesterday failed in a High Court attempt for Pounds 200,000 damages over their failure to recover an insurance pay-out for the loss of the horse. Racehorse trainer Mr Vincent O'Brien, his wife Jacqueline, Mr John and Mrs Susan Magnier, and Mr Robert Sangster's Swettenham Stud, as joint owners of the Coolmore Stud in County Tipperary, bought three Pounds 280,000 shares in Shergar, prized as a breeding stallion, when he was syndicated by the Aga Khan in 1981. They had paid the first instalment of Pounds 100,000 each when the horse - valued at Pounds 10m - was kidnapped in February 1983, probably by the IRA, from Ballymany Stud Farm, County Kildare. The horse has never been recovered. Insurers at Lloyd's of London refused to pay out under a Pounds 200,000 policy covering two-thirds of the initial instalments because the horse had been covered only against death, not theft. The Coolmore shareholders brought a damages claim against bloodstock agent BBA (Ireland), which had arranged the insurance, and Lloyd's brokers Hughes-Gibb, which placed the cover with underwriters. They claimed negligence and breach of duty in failing to ensure that the cover included theft. But Mr Justice Rattee ruled that Coolmore had never asked for such cover and the defendants were not negligent in failing to obtain it. The action was dismissed and the Coolmore shareholders were ordered to pay the defendants' legal costs.</p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Plans advance for single European credit rating agency MOVES to establish a single European credit rating agency look set to be stepped up following the announcement this week of merger talks between IBCA, the London-based agency, and Euronotation of France. If the two parties can agree terms, the merger will bring together the French agency's coverage of the domestic corporate sector with IBCA's international coverage of banks and UK corporations. It remains unclear whether the merged Anglo-French agency will be able to reach agreement with a German consortium which is close to finalising plans for a pan-European rating agency. The consortium of German banks, corporations and institutions has been working on the project for three years. According to Mr Olivier Eveling, member of the project committee, full plans for an agency will be announced by the year-end. 'There are large areas of similarity between our methodology and that of IBCA,' he said. There remain differences between the approach favoured by the German consortium and the way in which IBCA has built its business. In particular, IBCA undertakes some unsolicited ratings based only on published information, without access to confidential material from the company rated. The German approach favours an agency which only makes solicited ratings. If the IBCA/Euronotation merger goes ahead it will receive equity backing from Centenaire Blanzy, the French holding company with interests ranging from publishing to market research. The German project is still looking for an equity backer. Mr Eveling said the consortium which financed the study is unlikely to provide equity finance for a fully-fledged agency. There could be a conflict of interest if the agency was asked to rate a shareholder, he said. Funding is more likely to come from outside the financial sector, possibly from a publishing firm. Both sides agreed that a European rating agency is desirable to provide competition for Moody's Investors Service and Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agencies which dominate the fledgling market. 'It is crazy that an industry as important as credit rating should be dominated by two companies, however good they are,' commented Mr Robin Monro-Davies, managing director at IBCA. Earlier attempts to challenge the dominance of Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's in Europe have ended in failure. In 1989, Fitch, another US rating agency, closed its Euroratings subsidiary following four years of losses.</p>

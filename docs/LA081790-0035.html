			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> DOMINGUEZ HILLS GOALIE FAILS TO SHOW  </P> <P> The Cal State Dominguez Hills soccer team began fall practice Thursday  afternoon without goalie Jose Castenada.  </P> <P> "We're looking for another goalkeeper," said Coach Marine Cano, who was  counting on the Mexican National to be in goal this year. "He didn't show to  the team meeting the day before so I assume he decided not to come. Therefore,  I have to find someone fast."  </P> <P> The Toros open the season Sept. 1 against San Diego State.  </P> <P> Cano, who is also the backup goalie for the Los Angeles Heat, said he hopes  there is a former high school goalkeeper in the area who wants to attend  college and play for Dominguez Hills. No one on the roster has experience at  the position.  </P></p>

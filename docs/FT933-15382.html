			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / UN team due in Iraq to seal missile sites: Rockets become focus of new confrontation with Baghdad THE UNITED Nations last night despatched a team of ballistic missile experts to Iraq with orders to seal equipment and facilities at two rocket testing sites that have become the focus of a new confrontation with Baghdad. Mr Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the UN's weapons inspection commission, announced the measure, which he called an interim one, in response to Iraq's refusal to permit the installation of monitoring cameras at the sites. While describing the move as a way 'to open another door' for Iraqi compliance, he also stressed that 'a very serious situation' would result if the Iraqis broke the seals. These would be applied in order to ensure that no tests could be conducted until UN cameras were in place. The Security Council, to which Mr Ekeus reported behind closed doors yesterday, has already warned Baghdad of the serious consequences of continued intransigence. The council is committed to the employment of all necessary measures to ensure Iraqi compliance with its directives. But the commission chairman said there was a 'mindset' in the Iraqi leadership not to give up their ambitions. He had detected no inclination to disperse weapons personnel or provide data sought by the UN about sources of supply. Mr Ekeus withdrew his inspectors earlier this week after the Iraqis refused to allow the installation of cameras, on political grounds. Baghdad's objections were termed political. However, Iraq backed down after first refusing to deliver to the commission for destruction chemical weapons production equipment and 'precursor chemicals.' Mr Ekeus reported that all of the equipment had been destroyed under UN supervision and the precursors would soon follow. As for the missile testing programme, he disclosed that air and ground surveillance on Wednesday determined that at one site the metal superstructure of a test stand had been dismantled and the parts distributed around it. According to experts, all could be reassembled and operable within the space of a few days. The facilities and equipment would enable the Iraqis to test rocket motors for missiles up to the permitted 150km range, as well as a prohibited range in excess of that limit. The team of experts due to arrive in Baghdad tomorrow had an inventory of the equipment at both sites, which Iraq was forbidden by a UN resolution from moving without commission consent. Mr Ekeus renewed an invitation to Iraq to enter high-level technical talks with the UN planned to be held in New York next Monday with the aim of sorting out a number of problems encountered by the commission. Meanwhile, UN and Iraqi delegations continued talks yesterday on the possible resumption of oil exports by Iraq. The Security Council agreed almost two years ago to permit shipments of Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.06bn) worth of oil over a six month period. According to Britain's Sir David Hannay, the current Security Council president, a new resolution would be necessary to make effective any accord that the two sides might work out.</p>

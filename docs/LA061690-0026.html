			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT KIND OF ROLE MODEL IS THIS FOR THE CHILDREN?  </P> <P> Nolan Ryan's sixth no-hitter . . . big deal. If he were a real baseball player,  he'd have several illegitimate children, a drug/alcohol/gambling problem or a  criminal record.  </P> <P> Much has been written about his bionic pitching arm. But what about a man that  characterizes what a superstar figure should be -- a polite family man who  knows how to stay out of trouble.  </P> <P> LARRY GELFOND  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PASADENA PAROLE OFFICE FLAP HAS 'BITTER IRONY'  </P> <P> The objection by city fathers to locating a parole office in east Pasadena has  a bitter irony to it (Times, June 1).  </P> <P> Not long ago, the same Board of Directors steamrollered through a facility on  South Raymond in the commercial west side that would feed 150 people, but has  space for only 40 of them to sleep. Where will the other 100-plus sleep between  dinner and breakfast?  </P> <P> Those who live on the west side of town predicted that this would cause  problems, and officials from the Police Department testified that crime would  increase. Sound familiar?  </P> <P> It is only fitting that the board and the people it represents may be getting a  taste of their own medicine.  </P> <P> MARK C. MADDEN  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

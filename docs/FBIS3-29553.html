Tee: "Move on Khmer Rouge Positions Continue"] </F>   [Excerpts] PHNOM PENH -- The Royal Army's concerted push  towards Khmer Rouge positions through out the country is  expected to continue until April when several key guerilla  positions are to be captured.    Defence Minister Tie Banh told The CAMBODIA TIMES that the  Royal Army was pushing forward to all of the Khmer Rouge  positions in the country and not just Anlung Veng. It was  learnt that the push has resulted in severe casualties on both  sides, although most of the government soldiers were injured by  mines, booby traps and other hazards in addition to accidents.    At least 70 government soldiers have been admitted to the  army hospital in the capital here with injuries suffered mainly  from mines and booby traps. Very few of the soldiers were  injured in the exchange of fire with guerillas. Although  military sources said that guerilla casualties were very much  higher, it could not be determined as to what the actual figures  are. Most of them were either dragged away by comrades or were  left in dense foliage.    Morale among the government troops were also reportedly high  when the initial push reportedly met with little resistance. In  this instance, the government was right when it said that there  was no large scale clashes but mere skirmishes. [passage  omitted] Diplomatic sources said that the outcome of the battle  depended very much on the morale of the troops, the command  structure, as well as how cohesive the various armies which  merged into the Royal Army.    It is no secret that some of the guerillas are fighting hard  and have been in high spirits as they have been well paid and  fed by their commanders. Although the same is probably true  with the Royal Army, it is certainly more difficult given the  strength of the army and the Royal Government's own financial  constraints. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Personal Pensions (23): With care, you can pass some of it on - The beneficiaries / Most personal pensions are set up under the provider's universal trust scheme. A form with the application invites you to say whom you would like the death benefits to go to If you do not have access to a company pension scheme, the investments accumulated under a personal pension or its predecessor, a retirement annuity pension, are likely to represent your most important asset. While the primary purpose of any pension plan is to provide the maximum income in retirement, most people would also like to pass on as much of the pension fund as possible to the next generation. There are two distinct stages to consider here, namely: the contribution period during your working life, when you are building up your fund; and the benefit period in retirement, when you are drawing the pension income. The contribution period Personal pensions usually have a clearly identifiable value at any given time up to retirement, and most providers guarantee to return the full fund value on death before retirement. This is paid tax-free to the nominated beneficiary. Under a unit linked or unitised with-profits policy, where the contributions buy units in a pooled fund, the value of your fund is simply the value of your units. However, 'traditional' with-profits funds, still used by a few personal pension providers and the most common choice for retirement annuity pensions, were not unitised. Here the value of your fund on death before retirement may be calculated in one of several ways. Some providers return the value of contributions with interest paid at various rates from 3 per cent to 9 per cent. Others return the value of contributions without interest or make no return at all. However, if you have one of these policies, do not automatically assume you have been cheated. Low-return or no-return policies usually offer a higher return in order to provide better pension benefits, while separate life assurance is often sold to provide the death benefits. Tony Tollerton, senior technical manager at Sun Life, warned: 'It is important to maintain that life cover, even if you stop paying in to the policy; otherwise, if you die, your dependants may receive little back from the pension provider.' Tollerton advised individuals with older policies to check the death benefits, and if necessary take out further life assurance to top up the tax-free lump sum for dependants. It is also important to check that your policies are written under trust. Pension plans established in this way avoid potential inheritance tax (IHT) liabilities, because any death benefits can be paid direct to the nominated beneficiary rather than pass through the deceased's estate. Even where you intend to pass on everything to your spouse, which normally would not involve IHT, if you both die at the same time or within a short period of each other, then your children may have to pay IHT on the benefits from the pension plan. Most personal pensions automatically are set up under the provider's universal trust scheme, and an expression-of-wish form is included with the application, which invites you to set out who you would like the death benefits to go to. Under these trust schemes, the life office acts as trustee and has discretionary power to make the payments to the appropriate person in the same way as occupational pension scheme trustees operate. Your beneficiary does not have to be a spouse or a dependent child, and if you are unmarried you can nominate your mother or your common-law partner, for example. However, Ian McKenna, partner with independent financial adviser Blyth McKenna, stressed: 'It is vital to review the beneficiary form at regular intervals. We have had cases where the original nomination was not changed when a client got married and had children, so that when he died the nominated beneficiary was still the client's mother or former girlfriend.' Normally in these cases the trustees would try to sort out the most suitable beneficiary, but this could be a long, complex and potentially acrimonious process, particularly where the individual had been married several times or had children by more than one partner. While universal trust schemes are common practice today, this was not the case with retirement annuity pensions. If you have one of these older policies, check whether you have nominated a beneficiary and, if not, ask your adviser or provider to sort out a trust arrangement for you. The retirement period When you reach retirement, the bulk of your personal pension or retirement annuity fund must be used to buy an annuity from a life office which guarantees the regular pension income. If you contracted out of the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps), the element of the fund which was built up from rebates of national insurance contributions, known as 'appropriate rights', must be used to buy an annuity that includes a spouse's pension if you die. It is up to you what level of dependant's benefits you secure with the annuity purchased by the rest of the fund, but any extra guarantees, such as a spouse's pension, will reduce the annuity income by up to 16 per cent. Apart from buying a spouse's pension, it is also possible to protect your fund. Under a basic annuity, once you hand over your lump sum, it is gone for good, even if you die shortly afterwards. The alternative is to buy a guarantee that, if you die within the first five years of retirement, the balance of your pension fund will be paid to your beneficiary. A five-year guarantee is likely to reduce the annuity income by about 1.6 per cent, while a 10-year guarantee, offered by some providers, would reduce your pension by about 6 per cent. There are other options at retirement for those who do not want to be locked into a conventional annuity and wish to keep the fund fully invested.</p>

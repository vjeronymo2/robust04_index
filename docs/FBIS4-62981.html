			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] President Mircea Snegur is reported to have praised  a government-proposed new five-year plan spread over a period up  to 1999. The government is given 10 days in which to amend the  paper before it goes to parliament. In an interview with  INTERFAX, Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli was speaking about the  main guidelines of the country's social and economic reforms.    IF: What exactly are the Moldovan Government's priorities?    SANGHELI: Well, these include the consolidation of the  country's statehood, its political and economic independence and  creation of an effective advanced economy.    We will be seeking to the Republic's incorporation in the  world economy, ensure decent living standards and protect more  vulnerable sections.    IF: Is it possible to say that the government is firmly  committed to a market-led economy?    SANGHELI: Yes. At the same time, we are working on a  premise that market economy should not be an end in itself, but  a means of improving production efficiency and living standards.  The planned reforms and transition to market relations combined  with government regulation will be carried out with an eye on  the country's traditions and specifics, the structure and  distribution of the workforce, cultural and social factors.    The government is seeking to enlarge the social basis of  reforms by swaying support from broader sections of the  population. I do not think the state and government must be  perceived as forces acting against the public. That is why we  intend to pursue a coherent and economically measured social  policy.    Although international aid, investment, credits,  technologies  and expertise are only too welcome, Moldova must rely only on  its own potential.    IF: The economic situation in Moldova remains unstable.  Since early 1990's, its GDP and national income has fallen by  46.5 and 44.7 percent respectively with industrial and farm  output dropping by 30.3 and 29.8 percent. True, there are also  positive trends, but these are not too many. How is the country  going to reverse those negative trends?    SANHGELI: Nothing short of effective economic reform  measures, stimulation of production and social security  safeguards can help to do so.    Last year, the government launched a nationwide  privatization  program including stock taking and evaluation of the state  property. Bonds (similar to Russia's privatization vouchers --  IF) were distributed among Moldovan citizens. By now, more than  300 state enterprises have been turned into stock holding  companies. The process of demonopolization is now under way in  retail trade, catering and services.    With the first stage of land reform now completed, a total  of  284,000 ha of land has fallen into private hands. The second  stage will allow rural residents to share in the land or assets  of state farm producers.    IF Note: The country's privatization land fund runs at about  two million ha or 62 percent of the country's total. By now, 60  percent of those entitled to land ownership have received  appropriate land titles.    The process is under way of transforming state or collective  farms into stock holding companies, farm cooperatives or firms  and private farms. The number of farmsteads runs at nearly  10,000.    To promote entrepreneurial business, a support fund was set  up to help promote private enterprise and small-size business.  Similar government programs are to be approved soon. The  private sector units about 34,000 economic entities, with more  than 15,000 of them emerging last year.    IF: What sort of financial, taxation and crediting policy is  the government planning to pursue in the next few years?    SANGHELI: We will embark on a moderately tight financial and  crediting policies. This provides for an increase in government  revenues by improving taxation and financial discipline and  combatting tax evasion. We also plan to raise revenues at the  cost of state, lease and stock holding companies as well as  proceeds from the sale of state property, utilization of natural  resources and land rent.    Plans are also in progress to issue short-term bonds and  securities at attractive conditions in an effort to achieve a a  deficit-free budget.    The government sets great store by the decentralization of  the budgetary system which will create a real economic basis for  local self-management. It is planned that individual,  corporate, property and local taxes and duties will be levied to  help form local budgets.    Decentralization of the budget and greater economic  independence by the regions can help defuse tension between the  center and local government bodies, including Transdniestria  [Transdniester] and Gagauzia.</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Observer: Rich pickings It has its problems, but Mexico still spawns dollar billionaires, according to Forbes magazine, which reckons there are now 24 Mexican billionaires, against 13 last year and just two in 1991. Topping the list, weighing in at an estimated Dollars 6.6bn, is Carlos Slim Helu, head of the national telephone company. He's closely followed by Emilio Azcarraga, Dollars 5.4bn, chairman of the principal television network. Not far behind is the Zambrano family - Dollars 3.1bn - which controls Cemex, Mexico's main cement company, followed by a new entry, the Peraltas - Dollars 2.5bn - who have just sold a chunk of their cellular phone business. Forbes' annual rich list is not universally adored; some of its Mexican members believe it saves Mexico's kidnappers from doing their own research. One irate member describes it as 'total stupidity'. Not that he was afraid, he added - the bandits would be far better informed than Forbes.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Legitimate Fedayeen Operation"] </F>   [Text] Fedayeen operations in the occupied Arab  territories are escalating to avenge the killing of the martyrs  of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron. A week after the  'Afula suicide operation, as a result of which seven Israelis  were killed and 50 others wounded, a Palestinian fedayee belong  to Hamas carried out another suicide operation in Hadera, north  of Hebron. As a result, six Israelis were killed and 30 others  wounded, some seriously.    The recent operation came while Israel was celebrating the  anniversary of its establishment at the expense of the  Palestinian people and their territory. It also coincided with  the date set for the completion of the Israeli forces'  withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area in  accordance with the Oslo agreement stipulations.    Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin is responsible for  every  drop of Palestinian or Israeli blood. Because the policies he  has pursued, whether in running the negotiation process or in  suppressing the intifadah inside the occupied territories, have  encouraged extremism and subsequent violent operations,  especially from the Israeli side.    At the negotiating table Rabin used the method of  procrastination and evasion, thus voiding the peace process of  any substance and putting the PLO in a very embarrassing  situation. With regard to repression, more than 160 Palestinians  have been martyred by Israeli troops' bullets since the signing  of the Oslo agreement.    However, Rabin could have rescued the bilateral negotiations  from their impasse when he assumed power, just before the eighth  round. But he did not. He wanted them to revolve in the same  vicious circle and with the same negotiating team for a further  four rounds.    When the PLO opened the secret Oslo channel and reached an  agreement stipulating withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, the  mentality of a fanatic Zionist general dominated that of a  politician. And Rabin did his utmost as a former general to  prevent the implementation of the agreement through impossible  demands and by drowning the Taba and Cairo negotiations in minor  details that inspire no assurance or trust.    Any fedayeen operation in the occupied territories can only  be seen in the framework of the Palestinian Arab people's right  to resist in order to get rid of the occupation. It is a  legitimate right which all the other peoples have exercised,  including the French people during the Nazi occupation and the  U.S. people during their revolution against the British  occupation under the leadership of George Washington. As long  as the Israeli occupation continues, and as long as the Rabin  government continues to encourage settlement building the  occupied territories and to use rocket launchers to shell the  homes of intifadah activists, the resistance and fedayeen  operations will continue, regardless of the human and economic  losses suffered by the people of the occupied territories.    The Palestinians -- moderates or extremists -- have had  enough as a result of the Israeli repressive policies seeking  both the land and conducting a constant starvation process for  them. The moderates have been frustrated since the Rabin  government's refusal to comply with the first date for its  forces' withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho on 13 September. And  the extremists had no option but to step up the fedayeen  operations in retaliation to the settlers' provocations, which  did not begin with the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and will not  end with the murder of a woman, three months pregnant, in  Ramallah the days before yesterday evening.    The United States, sponsor of the peace process, shoulders a  major part of the responsibility for the deterioration of  conditions to this point. Because it has always preferred to  overlook the Israeli murder operations against the Palestinians,  refusing to provide international protection for the people of  the occupied territories when the issue was referred to the  United Nations and its Security Council.    The only solution to get out of this cycle of violence lies  in ending the occupation and removing the settlements. As for  trying to deal with conditions in the occupied territories as a  security issue, not as an issue of a people deprived of their  legitimate right to self-determination, it will lead to nothing  except the escalation of resistance inside Palestine and further  instability in the region.</p>

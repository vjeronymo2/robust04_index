			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FLORIDA;  </P> <P> MIAMI JURY RETIRES; JUDGE CALLS FOR CALM  </P> <P> The jury in the Miami manslaughter trial of officer William Lozano, accused of  firing on a motorcycle and killing two black men, adjourned for the day at 6  p.m. after two men and four women deliberated for nine hours. Rumors swept the  city that the Latino policeman, whose actions last Jan. 16 set off three days  of rioting, had been found innocent or was about to be found innocent, court  officials said. Dade County's highest-ranking state judge went on live  television to deny the rumors and call for calm. The jury, which got the  racially sensitive case after almost seven weeks of testimony, was due to  resume deliberations today.  </P></p>

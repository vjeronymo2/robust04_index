			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> WHERE'S THE BEEF?;  </P> <P> FELINES FIND FAULT WITH SOVIET SAUSAGES  </P> <P> Angry meatpackers are suing a newspaper for an article that said their sausage  was so bad that even cats can't stomach it, but editors said they turned to a  furry, four-legged jury that proved their point.  </P> <P> "Twenty-four sausage experts don't eat it at all; five only eat high quality  sausage or out of extreme hunger. Only one, the 2-month-old kitten Mura, you  can say actually sits down to the sausage," the weekly Literaturnaya Gazeta  said in announcing the feline findings.  </P> <P> The dispute started with the literary weekly's story on June 15 titled "The Cat  Doesn't Know . . ." and was brought up recently in the Dzerzhinsky regional  people's court.  </P> <P> In a complaint signed by Yu. M. Luzhkov, chairman of the Moscow agroindustrial  complex, officials demanded a retraction of the newspaper's report that  producers were breaking the law by putting protein additives in the sausage,  known in Russian as kolbasa.  </P> <P> Because of a shortage of meat in many Soviet stores, finding good quality  sausage has become a fixation for many people. A cartoon in an October edition  of the satire magazine Krokodil showed a line of shoppers standing outside a  theater, not to buy tickets, but to buy the sausage for sale in the theater's  buffet.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Aggressive Reporting  </P> <P> The case also shows that the more aggressive style of reporting by the Soviet  press under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's encouragement of greater openness  is likely to get it into occasional legal trouble. The Tass news agency said  recently that a court had dismissed a lawsuit against a film producer by a  biochemical plant near Leningrad that objected to his documentary about  pollution.  </P> <P> Literaturnaya Gazeta reported about its dispute with the sausage manufacturers  in an article titled, "May the Cats Judge Us." It gave no indication that the  case had gone any further than the initial complaint.  </P> <P> It said that using the permission of state quality control officials to add  protein additives, the factories were grinding up the skin and bones of cattle  and throwing them into the sausage.  </P> <P> Animal blood, protein paste, blood plasma, starch, flour, and emulsions of  protein and fat also were part of the gray, unappetizing mixtures churned out  by the factories, Literaturnaya Gazeta said.  </P> <P> "Blocks of frozen meat weren't unfrozen or washed before being chopped, and  were happily thrown in with knots of wool and even the trademarks of the  factories that produced these blocks. Nails, sand and glass have fallen into  the sausage," it said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fauna Cat Lovers' Club  </P> <P> To judge the validity of its first story, the newspaper said it sought out the  Fauna Cat Lovers' Club in the Dzerzhinsky region, where it is being sued.  </P> <P> Boris Berenshtein fed some sausage to Kuzya, his 2 1/2-year-old cat, "but Kuzya  didn't find any joy in it. Just the opposite, he gave a look like a person  saying, 'What's that for? What did I do that was so bad, master?' "  </P> <P> It said another cat, Gavrila, tests the sausage for the whole family of Maria  Klyueva. If Gavrila eats it, the whole family will. If she turns up her nose,  so does the family.  </P> <P> In the end, out of 30 cats, only Mura the kitten eats the sausage regularly,  Literaturnaya Gazeta said.  </P> <P> "All kitties, like Mura, must loyally love sausage! That's the way it always  has been since man thought up sausage. But why, the devil take them, won't they  eat it?" the newspaper asked. "And why do we continue to eat it?"  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THOSE TICKET PRICES  </P> <P> When I placed a telephone order May 15 for four $50 tickets for "Aida," the  order taker at a major ticket agency knew enough at that date to state that if  the show were cancelled, handling charges of $23.50 would be retained.  </P> <P> Less than 12 hours later, the cancellation of the operatic spectacular at the  Los Angeles Coliseum was announced.  </P> <P> Let's say 5,000 tickets sold, each with an additional fee of about $6. Six  times 5,000 equals $30,000: a good deal for someone?  </P> <P> DR. MARTHE BROWN  </P> <P> Malibu  </P></p>

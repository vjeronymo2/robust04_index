			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Argentinian crop disaster declared after heavy rain HEAVY RAINFALL in the province of Buenos Aires over the last week has caused an estimated USDollars 100m worth damage to farms, officials said yesterday. Buenos Aires province, which covers a large part of Argentina's fertile pampas plains, produces most of the country's wheat, soyabean and maize crops. Mr Raul Sarachu, the provincial government's director of agricultural economics, said yesterday that about 30 per cent of the province's maize output and about 15 per cent of its soyabean production had been lost. He said rainfall had been excessive all this year: 'It is an abnormal situation. We have had a year's rainfall in three or four months.' Earlier in the year, the south of Buenos Aires province suffered severe drought. Since then constant heavy rain has fallen mainly on the province's low-lying north-west and south-west regions, where drainage is insufficient. Mr Sarachu, while warning that estimates were still unreliable said about 60 per cent of the total 5m to 6m hectares in the affected region were flooded. The region produces 1.5m to 2m tonnes of maize a year, plus 800,000 to 900,000 tonnes of soyabeans and about 350,000 tonnes of sunflower seeds. The provincial government has declared the area a disaster zone, allowing farmers to reschedule loans from the provincial government's bank, and given them a five month extension on tax payments. The farmers pay about Dollars 60m to Dollars 70m a year in local taxes.</p>

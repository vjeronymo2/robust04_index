			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Klaus Wickel, president of the IG Metall Metal </F> Workers Union: "`The Economic Community Has Been Successful,  But Social Problems Are Mounting'"]    [Text] The Europe saga illustrates the opportunities and  dangers that lie in the unions relationship with Europe. Zeus,  who worshipped the king's daughter Europa, assumed the form of a  white bull and behaved so gently that the girl climbed onto his  back. Before she knew what had happened, the steer swam across  to Crete with her where she became Zeus' lover. Not only was  the girl deceived, but so was Zeus' wife Hera, who in fact  realized what was going on very quickly.    What does this old myth have to do with the unions and  Europe? Well, the unions neither want to be the betrayed wife  nor do they want to be the seduced innocent. The European  integration process has created an enormous economic and  financial zone, but Europe as a social policy zone has remained  an illusion. From the very beginning, the German trade unions  were positively disposed toward Europe. They grinned and bore  it as economic integration made progress over decades and social  considerations were neglected. They came out in favor of the  Rome treaties although social questions were excluded. There  are good reasons why Europe should exist. One motive is that of  securing peace in Europe, and that hope has not been  disappointed. Europe has experienced a long period of peace,  and the war in former Yugoslavia reminds us how valuable peace  is. It also reminds us that peace is always in danger and that  nationalist and ethnic excesses can quickly turn into war. The  European economic community was an exceptionally successful  venture. To quote Willy Brandt, it has become "a unique zone of  prosperity." However, these successes cannot conceal the fact  that social problems in Europe are mounting up. It is a scandal  that there are almost 20 million unemployed people in Europe.  Almost one-fifth of people under the age of 25 are without  work. I do not want to become Cassandra, but this challenge  must be addressed. If that is not done, then there is a danger  that the entire European integration process will run into  difficulties. We should consider the current weariness and  skepticism with regard to Europe to be a warning sign, the  writing on the wall. The writing on the wall reads that Europe  must be democratic and social, or it will not exist at all. Is  it really surprising that support for Europe has been crumbling  away? Is it really surprising that anti-Europe groups are being  formed and that the contradictions that are appearing in the  European unification process are being used to achieve political  capital?    The unions also face the challenge of having to rethink  their  position on Europe. I am not concerned about formulating  radical, verbal positions on Europe, but, within the limits of  what is possible, to use the German presidency to place concrete  proposals on the table. Three demands are of key importance for  the German unions. First, the guidelines for European employee  councils have been discussed for over 20 years and they must now  be approved despite the policy of obstruction being practiced by  Unice [European employers union]. The Federal Government  supports this demand and the next council meeting, at which the  guidelines will be on the agenda, should be considered an acid  test. The commission's patience with respect to the formulation  and reformulation of the guidelines knows no end and that also  applies to the unions.    Second, a European policy on employment must be implemented  so that the Europe of the future is not a Europe of the  unemployed. The hopes contained in the Ceccini report, which  forecast the creation of millions of jobs proved to be illusory.  French President Mitterrand has assured [EU President Jacques]  Delors of his support. By contrast, the German Government has,  in an irresponsible manner, blocked the employment policy  initiative with its monetary veto.    The Federal Government should abandon these stances. A  Franco-German package solution is conceivable, one in which both  sides will have to bear their costs. Why should we not embark  on unconventional paths and not seek a reduction for the  duration of the reconstruction of eastern Germany according to  the British pattern? Why should we not respond to the French  side with regard to the European bond issue, which, by virtue of  its job creation impetus can also satisfy German interests?  This kind of package would satisfy all sides, because an end to  the skepticism about Europe, which is spreading like a plague,  would also benefit Europe as a center for business.    Third, the British, who want to use the fact that they have  not signed the protocol on social affairs in order to improve  their position as a center for business, should be forced to  sign the protocol. Why should we not attempt to reduce British  skepticism by bringing about an intelligent reshaping of the  agriculture sector and thus make them more ready to achieve a  compromise.    The issue of shaping Europe as a social policy zone is also  a  question of Europe's political legitimacy at the same time.  Acceptance of the European unification process can only be  increased if European agencies adopt a resolute approach in  eliminating shortcomings in social policy and democracy. In  following such a course, they can rely on and count on the  support of the German trade unions.</p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Break-up of Nuclear Electric to be urged Prof Stephen Littlechild, electricity industry regulator, is expected later this week to deliver a blow to Nuclear Electric, the state-owned power generator, by asking the government to consider splitting it up. He will also raise the possibility of changes to Scottish Nuclear as part of a wide-ranging restructuring of the industry. Prof Littlechild will back the companies' campaigns for privatisation but make clear his view that restructuring is essential if a sell-off is approved. As regulator Prof Littlechild does not have the power to implement the ideas he is floating. However, his views, contained in his submission to the government's nuclear review, are bound to influence the government. Prof Littlechild is concerned about the growing share - 23 per cent - Nuclear Electric has of the England and Wales electricity market and about Scottish Nuclear's 47 per cent share north of the border. In its submission to the review Nuclear Electric suggested the creation of a private-sector company for its more modern power stations, leaving its older Magnox stations in the public sector. Prof Littlechild will ask the government to consider taking the more radical step of dividing the ownership of Nuclear Electric's advanced gas-cooled reactor stations. Nuclear Electric said yesterday it had not seen Prof Littlechild's recommendations. Mr Mike Kirwan, finance director, said any break-up decision would be for the government He said his company did not abuse its position in the market and, because Nuclear Electric was not setting prices in the wholesale electricity pool, there would be no competitive advantage in splitting it up. He added that smaller companies would weaken the nuclear industry's potential to export its technology and know-how.</p>

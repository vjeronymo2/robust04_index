			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: New World Development ahead 37% at HKDollars 1.9bn New World Development, the Hong Kong property, hotels and infrastructure group, yesterday reported a 37 per cent rise in after-tax earnings to HKDollars 1.9bn (USDollars 245m) from HKDollars 1.39bn in the six months to the end of December. Profits were struck on a 41 per cent growth in turnover to HKDollars 8.37bn from HKDollars 5.94bn, with most of the earnings growth coming from a strong performance by the hotels division. Earnings from rents and property sales were flat, while those for construction and piling were slightly down on the same period a year ago. Earnings per share advanced 34 per cent to HKDollars 1.21. Directors declared an interim dividend of 28 cents, 12 per cent up on a year ago. The company added its voice to the growing number of Hong Kong property developers seeking to allay fears about the colony's property market. It said that it remained confident that the property market in Hong Kong would continue to experience 'healthy growth' over the coming years. New World directors sought to underline the importance of its activities in China. They said that the company would maintain between 20 and 25 per cent of its net assets in mainland investments, with infrastructure and property development constituting the main focus. Pre-tax profits from hotel interests rose 51 per cent to HKDollars 401.2m. The company said that New World Hotels would open a hotel in Manila this summer and one in Saigon in later. In the past six months it has signed management contracts for four hotels in China. The group's other hotel operation, Ramada International Hotels and Resort, has been undergoing a reorganisation aimed at improving efficiency. A new division has been created to manage Ramada's growing interests in the US. The company said that it had cut its stake in Asia Television from 47.5 per cent to 27.5 per cent. It gave no details of the price. Sumitomo Realty &amp; Development, Japan's third largest property developer, said it would post a Y48bn (Dollars 458m) extraordinary loss in the year to end-March after a wholly-owned subsidiary, Sumitomo Fudosan Finance, writes off Y56bn of bad loans, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Sumitomo Realty will make up for some of the loss by selling facilities in Kyoto for Y38.4bn it said.</p>

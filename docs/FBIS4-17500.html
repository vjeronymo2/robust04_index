			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] At a news conference on the results of his talks on  a gradual settlement of the Black Sea Fleet's problems today,  Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev described the standpoint  of the Ukrainian military delegation as unconstructive. It  follows from his explanation, which cited naval rules, that  coastal buildings and facilities belonging to the fleet are part  of the fleet and therefore are a subject of the talks. The  Ukrainian side, on the other hand, insisted that all this  property automatically belongs to Ukraine because it is situated  on its territory.    Touching on certain other demands by the Ukrainian  delegation, Grachev said they were unacceptable and even  discriminatory with regard to Russia. Specifically, in the view  of the Russian defense minister, the demand that the whole  Russian Black Sea Fleet should be concentrated at one base in  Donuzlav is unacceptable. First, this would contradict the  notions of military security. Second, it is quite impossible to  site even part of the fleet's officer corps at Donuzlav. Yuriy  Dubinin, a representative of the Russian president, who took  part in the talks, praised the Russian military delegation for  the diplomatic skill shown and regretted that in spite of this  the talks produced only a negative result.</p>

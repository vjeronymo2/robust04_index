			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Luis Orlando Pantoja from the "First Thing" </F> program]    [Excerpts] One of our listeners, who happens to be an old  friend, told me yesterday that she has scales at home. She said  that she decided to weigh some of her purchases when the young  man brought them to her from the store. She began with the  rice: six ounces was missing. Then came the sugar: five  ounces was missing. [passage omitted]    I mention this because I have precise information about  other  places where similar incidents have occurred. Of course, the  rice and sugar later end in the black market. Where do these  and other products come from? I believe they come from the  stores, among other places, and, in some cases, from what is not  delivered to the stores and butcher shops.    I am not saying that this applies to all the stores,  supermarkets, and butcher shops because it is not true and it  would not be fair. One cannot judge everyone alike; one must  not use the same median to judge everyone. To tell you the  truth, certain places are not weighing the products correctly,  and the surplus is accumulated and used to speculate, to sell  it, to embezzle the people, etc.    In fact, on certain occasions the rice, beef, ground meat,  hot dogs -- whatever other product arrives -- are unscrupulously  sold in the same stores and butcher shops. In some way, these  cunning people, these thieves, are deceiving the inspectors or,  simply, some inspectors are not doing what they should and are  being swindled. I believe the situation which currently  prevails in the country, the shortage, all the problems which  afflict the population...[pauses] I believe all the staples  should be subject to controls. The measures should be  particularly strict dealing with those products.    We cannot have the same controls that we had, for example,  10  years ago and that were not precisely the best. It is necessary  to be stricter now, and the organizations which have inspectors  for that control should or are dutybound to be more demanding.  We have ways to prevent that type of theft, and, if this is so,  those who have the responsibility of preventing this theft are  dutybound to do so.</p>

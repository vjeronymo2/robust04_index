			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FCIC agrees with the comment and has modified subsection 12.(e) accordingly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment recommended amending subsection 12.(f) to require that moisture adjustments for silage, if applicable, will be made prior to any adjustment for quality for grain-deficient silage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subsection 12.(f) contains the requirements that must be met for silage production to be adjusted for moisture and for grain-deficiency. Current FCIC procedure specifies that when both adjustments apply, the silage moisture adjustment factor is to be multiplied by the silage grain-deficient factor and the result multiplied by the number of tons of silage that qualify for both adjustments. This method of adjustment results in a proportionate adjustment of the silage production based on both factors. FCIC does not agree with the comment because adjusting for moisture first may result in a disproportionate adjustment of the silage production. FCIC has not amended subsection 12.(f). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment assumed that moving to a factor-based quality adjustment process as specified in paragraph 12.(e)(4) removes any reliance on local market price, except for quality, such as aflatoxin, not addressed by the factor table in the Special Provisions. The comment also stated that if language in subparagraph 12.(e)(3)(ii) remains in the policy, an insured would have strong justification for requesting adjustment of production that meets the grade requirements in the policy, but which has a value less than the local market price. The comment recommends deletion of subparagraph 12.(e)(3)(ii). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FCIC agrees that quality adjustment should not apply if grain meets minimum grade requirements and other substances or conditions are not present causing a value less than the local market price. The Special Provisions will specify how the quality factor will be determined for quality deficiencies, substances and conditions. Subparagraph 12.(e)(3)(ii) has been deleted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment recommended that language in subsection 13.(b) be changed to require only one notice for prevented planting acreage rather than requiring notice three days after the final planting date and three days after the date the insured stops planting within the late planting period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The crop provisions provide two distinct periods during which the insured may be prevented from planting (i.e., by the final planting date and during the late planting period). The notice requirement allows the insurer the opportunity to verify that the acreage could not have been planted during such periods. FCIC agrees that an insured should only be required to give one notice if it is sufficient to cover all acreage for prevented planting purposes. Subsection 13.(b) has been modified to clarify that written notice must be given not later than three days after the final planting date for acreage the insured was prevented from planting by the final planting date, and not later than three days after the date the insured discovers that planting will not be possible if the insured was not prevented from planting such acreage by the final planting date but was prevented from planting such acreage during the late planting period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment indicated that the proposed provisions in paragraph 13.(d)(3) will allow an insured to request a written agreement for prevented planting coverage for acreage exceeding the policy limitations, and to subsequently enroll in a USDA program that allows less acreage to be planted. The comment recommended revising the paragraph to limit eligible acreage to the amount allowed by any applicable USDA program, regardless of when the insured enrolls in such program or any previously approved written agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FCIC agrees that if the farm is enrolled in a USDA program that limits the number of acres planted, acreage in excess of the amount allowed under a USDA program should not be eligible for prevented planting coverage. Paragraph 13.(d)(3) has been amended accordingly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment recommended that language be added to paragraph 13.(d)(3) to allow prevented planting coverage by written agreement for acreage added to the insured's farming operation after the sales closing date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The insurance period for prevented planting coverage begins on the sales closing date. Allowing additional coverage to attach after the beginning of this period would likely result in coverage being requested primarily when conditions are favorable for a prevented planting indemnity. This adverse selection should be avoided to help maintain an actuarially sound program and to keep premium rates from rising to cover such losses. The definition of ``Written agreement'' has been amended to specifically disallow any prevented planting liability as a result of any request submitted after the sales closing date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the changes indicated in the responses to comments, FCIC has made the following changes: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. FCIC has modified paragraph 3.(a)(2) to require that the price elections for grain and silage have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price election offered for grain and silage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2 FCIC has modified subsection 5.(b) to simplify the cancellation and termination dates in Texas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The provisions in section 6 have been modified to allow insurance for coarse grains planted into an established grass or legume if allowed by the Special Provisions or by written agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. FCIC has modified paragraph 12.(b)(2) to specify that the production guarantee for a unit will be computed by multiplying the insured acreage of each type (grain/silage) by the production guarantee for the applicable type. The proposed language contained in subparagraph 12.(b)(1)(i) has been modified in a similar manner. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the rule, ``Common Crop Insurance Regulations; Coarse Grains Crop Insurance Provisions'' published at 59 FR 28016, revised as set out below, is hereby adopted as final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 457 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Crop Insurance; corn, grain sorghum, soybean. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Final Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, pursuant to the authority contained in the Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.), the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation hereby amends the Common Crop Insurance Regulations (7 CFR part 457), effective for the 1995 and succeeding crop years, in the following instances: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Channel 5 plan aims for 63% of population The government is finalising plans that would allow a fifth television channel to go ahead, capable of reaching about 63 per cent of population. This is the shape of an emerging compromise which would both allow a Channel 5 using existing analogue technology and keep open the possibility of developing digital terrestrial television. The original plan produced by the Independent Television Commission envisaged the channel reaching about 74 per cent of the population on two channels - 35 and 37. The new plan, following Radio Communications Agency research and talks between the Department of National Heritage and the Department of Trade and Industry, would use channel 37 and other local frequencies in cities such as Glasgow and Manchester. Extensive retuning of video recorders would probably be necessary, particularly in London. It is not clear whether the final Channel 5 plan can be cleared by civil servants and ministers in time for the ITC's next meeting on June 23. Time Warner, the world's largest media group, is prepared to go ahead with a bid on the basis of a channel that would reach more than 60 per cent of the population. The ITC is concerned, however, that there may be considerable delay in getting approval for the use of the extra frequencies that would take the reach of the channel up from about 50 per cent to more than 60 per cent. Potential bidders talk of considerable enthusiasm among programme makers, advertisers and potential local operators for a new Channel 5 and there is considerable frustration at what is seen as unreasonable delay in government. The ITC decided in February that it wanted to advertise the channel and asked the government whether the frequencies were still available. Three groups have expressed interest. The Time Warner consortium includes MAI, the group that controls Meridian Broadcasting and Anglia Television, and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times. The others are NBC, the US network company, and Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group.</p>

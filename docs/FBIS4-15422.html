			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Kukanov under the "Regional Elections" </F> rubric: "Half an Assembly Is Still Not an Organ"]    [Text] St. Petersburg -- Forty-eight hours before the  second round of voting was held 3 April, the city court rejected  an action brought by St. Petersburg Prosecutor's Office  appealing against the mayor's decision to extend the 20 March  election of a new organ of representative power by 24 hours.  But this does not at all mean that the elections to the city  assembly are being regarded as valid, because the Prosecutor's  Office intends to appeal to the Russian Federation Supreme Court  against the ruling.    Without waiting for the preliminary results of the 3 April  voting, one thing can be said with certainty: The candidates  elected to the city assembly do not include a single  representative of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation,  the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, or the "Homeland" or  "Great Russia" electoral blocs, which gathered under their  banners orthodox Bolsheviks, Anpilov's communist workers, and  nationalist-oriented organizations. Back on 20 March the  politically-aware citizens of the city on the Neva confounded  sociologists, who had predicted that the main struggle would be  between Communist, Liberal Democrat, and "Democratic Unity of  Petersburg" bloc candidates. The last-named got the largest  number of candidates for deputies' seats -- 18 -- through to the  second round.    Most likely only one-half of the city assembly's 50 seats  will be occupied as a result of the repeat voting. But half an  assembly is still not an organ of representative power because,  according to current legislation, it can be legally constituted  only if two-thirds, in other words 34, deputies are present. It  is proposed to elect the missing deputies in fall.</p>

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Business and the Environment: The cleaner choice - Should the green motorist choose a diesel or petrol car Many motorists seeking a car that is both economical and relatively inoffensive environmentally must have reached the end of last week in confusion over whether to choose a diesel or petrol vehicle. On Thursday, a UK government panel of scientists warned that increasing traffic density threatens to create harmful airborne levels of benzene, linked with a form of leukaemia. Nearly 80 per cent of airborne benzene comes from petrol cars. Only 9 per cent comes from diesels. The level of benzene would be much lower if most cars continued to use leaded petrol (benzene partly compensates for lead's absence). Yet for a long time motorists have been encouraged to switch to unleaded fuel to help to keep organ-damaging lead out of the atmosphere. Some motorists might have been tempted to explore the merits of diesel cars, heavily promoted by the motor industry recently as more environmentally-friendly and economical than petrol cars. Yet little over a week ago the Quality of Urban Air Review Group (Quarg), a panel of experts appointed by the UK's department of the environment, criticised diesel cars for their emissions of nitrogen oxides - a factor in smog formation and 'acid rain' - and tiny particulates strongly suspected of causing cancer. The panel warned in a report that by early next century there could be cause for 'considerable concern' about the deterioration of air quality in urban streets if diesel cars continue their current strong sales acceleration - they already account for about one in five new cars sold in the UK. Not surprisingly, the report prompted an instant, hostile response from the motor industry, which had been given no prior warning of it. Car makers said it was 'misplaced, misguided and fundamentally unsound'. The industry's concern is understandable to some extent. The UK car market is still at a fairly early stage of recovery from one of its steepest recessions on record, and is worried that confused motorists might now, if only temporarily, opt to stay out of the showrooms. An adverse report on diesels' possible carcinogenic hazards in the 1980s helped to reverse Germany's diesel boom and hit car sales overall. And while the German market has begun to climb again, some in the diesel car industry such as John Maddell, a senior executive of Lucas Industries, say it led to Germany's motor industry losing its technological lead to the French. Now that the furore over the Quarg report has faded, it is becoming apparent that the differences between the motor industry and the panel are more in degree than fundamentals. The industry retains its belief that the panel, in arriving at its 'considerable concern' warning, is not taking enough account of technological progress being made to further reduce the two pollutants - nitrogen oxides and particulates - for which diesel has been most criticised. The report pays due tribute to the advantages of diesel over petrol. These include much reduced emissions of carbon dioxide, the inescapable by-product of combustion linked with global warming, and of two other pollutants, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. It acknowledges that, currently at least, commercial vehicles - mainly trucks and buses - are much bigger culprits than diesel cars in terms of poor urban air quality. At the heart of the Quarg report lie its projections about the share of the total car market likely to be taken by diesel cars and the effect that this will have in terms of all the pollutants they emit but mainly particulates - of which the notorious black diesel smoke forms only a part (see above chart). What the panel views as the potential reduction of particulate emissions through technological progress - and tighter EC emissions standards for all cars from 1996 - is apparent in the chart. At a constant 16 per cent share of the market, the amount of particulates emitted by diesel cars would be halved from around 65 kilotonnes to 30 kilotonnes by the year 2005. However, in the steepest growth scenario, with the diesel share of new car sales rising to 49 per cent, the volume of particulates emitted would be little changed from 1991 levels and government goals of improved urban air quality would be unfulfilled. The industry's complaint is that this scenario does not take adequate account of current and future developments in diesel technology; that diesels tend to maintain a consistent emissions performance whereas petrol engines and their catalysts degrade and become much 'dirtier' after 50,000 miles; and that the relative lack of large-scale testing of vehicles in use in city centres downplays the heavy emission of pollutants by catalyst-equipped petrol cars on short journeys because their 'cats' do not reach full operating temperature. In reality, the jury will be out for some time before either side can be proved right. Industry technologists maintain that substantial improvements are still to come from refining technologies already in use, such as exhaust gas recirculation and electronic management of fuel systems. Still several years away, however, are possible leaps in anti-pollution technology for diesel vehicles. Most promising among them is an oxidation catalyst for diesels, mainly to cut nitrogen oxide but also capable of reducing particulate emissions. This research is being led by Japan, and the Mazda car company is believed to be near to making them commercially available. Research is also continuing on particulate 'traps', which would capture the particles and then burn them off at intervals. When these are coupled with the introduction of low-sulphur diesel fuels, the volume of both particulates and nitrogen oxide emitted by diesel cars should fall substantially. Under a recent EC directive, the permitted level of sulphur in diesel fuel will fall from around 0.5 per cent by weight now to 0.2 per cent by weight on October 1 this year and to 0.05 per cent in October 1996. 'The problem could easily disappear,' says Roger King, spokesman for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Whether it does or not, the industry's fears that the public will shun diesel cars on environmental grounds may be exaggerated. Car makers last week were reporting few signs of customer concern.</p>

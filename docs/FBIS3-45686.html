Lu Peijian, auditor-general of the State Auditing  Administration, said here today at a national auditing  conference that one of the main tasks of this year's work is to  check for the existence of illegal transmissions of capital  funds in financial departments.    He explained that from this year on, about one-third of the  major state projects currently under construction will have to  be audited every year. Those already completed will certainly  be included.    The auditing administrations will mainly check whether  investment in these projects has been directly and rationally  applied to its designated uses.    So far as overseas-funded construction projects are  concerned, Lu said, standard audit reports will be submitted to  overseas investors, so as to be in line with international  practice.    China has yielded good results in auditing during the last  ten years since it set up formal auditing administrations.    In the period, over 22.8 billion yuan which should have been  raised for state financial departments but had been pocketed  illegally has been uncovered by auditing administrations.    As a result, they have helped cut down state expenses by  more  than 40 billion yuan.</p>

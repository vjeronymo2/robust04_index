			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Access to Equity: A question of sink or swim on the main market - Increasing concerns that are facing the smaller companies SMALL COMPANIES and their advisers have been increasingly concerned that an 'equity gap' has yawned before them, making it hard for them to raise long-term capital other than debt finance. Small quoted companies are questioning whether they should continue with the expense of a listing. Unquoted ones are deterred from going public or raising equity privately. This is increasingly being seen as bad for the UK economy. Small companies are the big companies of the future. A number of events have fuelled this worry. The Stock Exchange's decision to close the Unlisted Securities Market, after the previous failure of the Third Market, will remove a 'nursery' market for smaller companies. Companies will have to sink or swim on the main list. The move by some brokers to stop marking markets in smaller stocks has made it even harder for investors to deal in such companies, although in response to this the Stock Exchange has introduced the Seat order-driven system of trading. Similarly, there is little analysts' research into smaller companies. Public companies may find themselves caught in a size trap, Mr Michael Higgins of Charterhouse, the merchant bank says. 'They go public on the promise of access to capital markets but unless they move quickly they get trapped.' After the initial interest generated at the flotation, unless the market capitalisation moves up swiftly - usually through issues of shares for acquisitions - the interest can fade. But if they remain private, companies can find it difficult to raise equity capital on terms they are happy to agree, and many have resorted to debt finance despite the high interest rates of recent years. Many smaller companies, according to Mr Richard Balarkas, a leading light in the City Group for Smaller Companies (Cisco), are unaware of the role equity markets have to play. He suggests that the Stock Exchange has not done all it could to provide markets to meet the needs of smaller companies. Future attempts, he says, should be managed separately from the Stock Exchange's main list. Recession has taken its toll, too. Smaller companies perform worse in downturns, in part because they are usually more reliant on the UK economy than large companies which are likely to have international activities. However, all is not gloom. Mr Higgins says that now people are focusing on the problem some solutions are being put forward. Also as an end of recession institutional investors report a markedly more positive attitude to investment in small companies in the last few months. Retail investors are also reported to be buying again as they seek a better return than is available from deposit accounts. This week the Pilot Investment Trust was launched specifically to invest in companies with a market value of under Pounds 30m. Even so there remains a problem for the smallest companies. As one institutional investor put it: 'Not many people want to look at things under Pounds 20m. You cannot get a big enough holding to make it worth bothering with.' However, he added that illiquidity is not always a problem. 'People are prepared to put up with illiquidity if they think they have found a good story'. Mr David Lowes, a corporate finance director of Robert Fleming, the merchant bank, has found a similar problem. 'Companies on the stock market valued at under Pounds 20m have considerable difficulty in raising interest among institutional investors', he says. Fleming's corporate finance department 'is cautious of encouraging anybody to go to market at that level', he adds. If small companies cannot go public, they may try to find private equity capital. But one of the main sources, venture capitalists, also has its drawbacks. Mr John Jackson, the chairman of a number of smaller groups and a director of the new Pilot trust says: 'Private companies are nervous of venture capital because they feel that venture capitalists understandable interest in exit routes will lead them to be nudged in directions not necessarily in the best interests of their businesses.' A recent survey of private companies carried out by Baker Tilly, the accountants, found an over-dependency on short-term capital provided by clearing banks despite accusations that banks 'turned their backs' in the recession. Fear of losing control was cited by these companies as another reason for avoiding venture capital. Solutions fall into two broad groups. First, there are various plans to develop new markets, such as Cisco's proposal for a separately managed market and the move to develop a 'Euro-Nasdaq' along the lines of the US screen based dealing system. Any new market must, however, be more robust than the previous ones which have disappeared when circumstances get difficult. Mr Balarkas says that any new market 'must be one which does not disappear when the next recession comes along.' But there are also calls for a change in the investment culture in the UK. Mr Jackson argues that years of high interest rates in the UK have made equity providers demand high rates of return which can be hard for companies to achieve. 'If you are an ordinary company with ordinary prospects it is difficult to persuade people to invest in equity', he says. Further the institutional savings industry, spawned by tax breaks which are now largely abolished, means there is a much smaller retail market in the UK than in the US, for example. There is a different attitude to risk in the UK which can put investors off. 'Any healthy economy has to have a large number of young companies, and must accept that some will not succeed,' Mr Jackson says. Mr Balarkas suggests that there is still a core of retail investors interested in buying shares in small companies - perhaps local to them. But hopes of offsetting the tax breaks that spawned the big institutions with new tax concessions for direct share ownership are unlikely to come to fruition. Those tax breaks that have been introduced to help investment, such as the Business Expansion Scheme, have sometimes been abused by tax avoidance schemes. Mr Lowes concludes: 'The question is, is it a structural problem or is it that we are in a recession and people are not parting with their money? For good companies, there should always be a solution - it's up to the City to communicate its requirement for investment and up to companies to understand the requirements investors place on them'.</p>

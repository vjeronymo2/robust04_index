			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Arts: Karetnikov's 'Till Eulenspiegel' - Opera Few modern operas can claim a more tortuous genesis than Nikolai Karetnikov's Till Eulenspiegel, which has just received its stage premiere at Bielefeld in north Germany. Karetnikov, born in Moscow in 1930, comes from the post-Shostakovich generation of Soviet composers who experimented with new techniques and fell foul of the Communist authorities. Till Eulenspiegel was hardly calculated to win official approval. A two-act Singspiel completed in 1985, it is a parable of Soviet repression and the indomitable human spirit. The work first reached the West two years ago, in a recording made piecemeal with help from off-duty members of the Soviet Cinema Orchestra and scraps of tape from the cutting-room. Today, the only obstacles to its performance in Moscow are financial. And so - with an irony that suits Karetnikov's style - Till Eulenspiegel has been premiered far from the people to whom it would mean most. Initial reactions to the recording were ecstatic. Gramophone went so far as to hail it as 'one of the most powerful operas of recent times'. John Dew's Bielefeld production hardly supports that verdict. Till Eulenspiegel comes across as a good allegorical yarn - easy-to-follow, singable and entertaining, but not strikingly original. Karetnikov and his co-librettist, the film director Pavel Lungin (Taxi Blues), used a novel by the 19th century Belgian writer Charles de Coster as their source. Till is more than the endearing prankster depicted in the Strauss tone poem - he becomes an uncompromising fighter for justice and freedom. The setting is Flanders under the Hapsburg empire and the Spanish inquisition. Till is exiled for making fun of a monk, his father is burned as a heretic, his mother is murdered and he himself is nearly executed. From first to last, death and freedom form two sides of the same coin - no more so than in the final scene, when Till dies of poison and is mysteriously resurrected. Woven into the fabric of the story are bizarre clips of the Spanish court and a role-call of stereotypes - a fishmonger who informs on his fellow citizens, a fortune-teller, a quartet of prostitutes and Till's alter ego, a vagabond named Lamme. All are wrapped into a polystilistic theatrical idiom embracing mystery-play, pantomime, ballet, burlesque and satirical drama - while running the musical gamut from renaissance song and baroque recitative to Orthodox chant, Sprechgesang and 12-note variations. Karetnikov emerges as a musical chameleon, a virtuoso impersonator, but lacking Schnittke's ability to mould his influences into something more personal. Dew's production, designed by Thomas Gruber and Jose Manuel Vazquez, matches the parodistic quality of the score, without losing sight of the pain and violence beneath the surface. The stage is a 20th century prison of wire mesh, divided into three playing areas to keep pace with the quick changes of setting. No scene outstays its welcome, though some would have benefited from a more identifiable sense of place. The biggest drawback is the positioning of the orchestra behind the stage, from where - despite amplification - Karetnikov's subtle accompagnato makes a sketchy impression. Give or take some predictable lapses of coordination with his cast, Geoffrey Moull conjures an idiomatic range of sound. In the baritone title role, William Oberholtzer is more worthy than charismatic. The Bielefeld ensemble provides versatile support, with excellent contributions from Susan Maclean as Till's fiancee Nele and Ulrich Neuweiler as Lamme.</p>

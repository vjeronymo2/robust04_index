			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 780.23(a)(1) required a description of the proposed postmining land use and the method in which the proposed postmining land use is attained. Section 780.23(a)(1) implemented section 508(a)(4) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 780.23(a)(2) required specific management plans when range and grazing is proposed as a postmining land use. Range or grazing management plans are not specifically required by the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 780.23(a)(3) required information needed to support approval for an alternative postmining land use when requested under &sect;816.133. Section 780.23(a)(3) implemented section 508(a)(3) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 780.23(a)(4) required that consideration be given to making proposed mining activities consistent with the existing surface owner plans and applicable State and local land use plans and programs. Section 780.23(a)(4) implemented section 508(a)(3) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 780.23(b) provided that the reclamation plan include a copy of the comments of the proposed land use by the legal or equitable owner of record of the surface of the proposed permit area and the applicable State and local government agency. Section 780.23(b) implemented section 508(a)(3) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Slope Measurement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 30 CFR 779.25 (Cross sections, maps, and plans) required slope measurements against which new mining effects can be compared. Section 779.25(a)(11) required the applicant to include the existing slopes of the proposed mine site. The 1979 preamble indicates that slope can be derived from either a topographic map or from field calculations (44 FR 15045, March 13, 1979). These slope measurements were to be used by the regulatory authority to evaluate the applicant's ability to achieve approximate original contour. There is no specific requirement in the Act to provide preexisting slope measurements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Discussion of Comments and Final Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM received letters on the proposed rule from eight commenters representing industry, State regulatory authorities, Federal and State agencies, and individual citizens. OSM has reviewed each comment carefully and has considered the commenters' suggestions and remarks in writing this final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rulemaking simplifies the current regulations by promulgating a single new rule, 30 CFR 780.23 (Land use information), to replace the two former land use information rules. Final &sect;780.23 combines sections from former 780.23 (Reclamation plan: Postmining land uses) and former 779.22 (Land use information). This rulemaking deletes former &sect;779.22 in its entirety. Paragraphs from former &sect;779.22 needed to implement prescriptions of the Act have been relocated to final 780.23. The final rule also deletes 30 CFR 779.25(a)(11) (Cross sections, maps, and plans) in its entirety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Land Use Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Listed below is an outline of the informational requirements that are incorporated into final 30 CFR 780.23 (Reclamation plan: Land use information). This rule is identical to proposed 30 CFR 780.23 except as indicated below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Final section 780.23(a) requires that the applicant provide a statement of the condition, capability, and the productivity of the land within the proposed permit area. Section 780.23(a) is identical to former &sect;779.22(a). No comments were received addressing the redesignation of this section. Section 780.23(a) implements section 508(a)(2) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Final &sect;780.23(a)(1) requires a map and supporting narrative describing the uses of the land at the time of the filing of the application. The description must also include any changes to the land use which occurred during the past five years, except in a case where the application is for lands which were previously mined, in which case the description must include the use of the land prior to any mining to the extent such information is available. Final section 780.23(a)(1) incorporates the provisions of former &sect;779.22 (a)(1) and (b)(5). Proposed section 780.23(a)(1) was identical to former &sect;779.22(a)(1) except that it would have deleted the five-year limit on the historical land use description. As proposed, &sect;780.23(a)(1) would have also subsumed the reporting requirements of &sect;779.22(b)(5). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters felt that the proposed deletion of the five-year limit on the historical land use description would have added to the reporting burden on the applicant and that the information collected would often be unnecessary. One commenter supported the proposed change and believed that there was sufficient enabling language for the regulatory agency's requirement of a historical land use description. OSM has reconsidered the proposal and agrees with the concerns of the commenters opposing the deletion of the five-year time frame in that it may add an unnecessary reporting burden on the applicant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Letter: No tepid reception Sir, Antony Thorncroft accurately reports our intention to commission an independent review of our costs, ('Opera House asks consultant to investigate costs', March 20) but unnecessarily, and inaccurately, adds that 'many recent new productions have attracted tepid reviews'. Does he read the Financial Times? Huguenots was hardly tepidly received. It was excoriated. But the reviews of our last four successive new opera productions - Simon Boccanegra, Mitridate Re di Ponto, Don Giovanni, Death in Venice - were glowing in their approval, and Clement Crisp, reviewing the Royal Ballet recently, in new work and old, has much admired and praised what he has seen. For the second year running, the Royal Opera House has achieved the double whammy of winning both the Standard awards for opera and ballet. Of this year's six Olivier nominations for opera, four come to us. Our ballet companies won three out of six. Casually to compare our work unfavourably with English National Opera's is to play an old cracked vinyl record, long out of date. And it hurts. It is hard enough to justify a necessary level of funding without having to contend with under-representation of what we actually achieve. Jeremy Isaacs, general director, Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London WC2E 9DD</p>

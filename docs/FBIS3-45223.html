			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Chen Luzhi (7115 7627 4160), vice chairman in </F> charge of routine affairs with the All-China Committee for  Pacific Economic Cooperation Standing Committee: "Asia-Pacific  Region and the World Viewed From Seattle"]    [Text] The Seattle Conference on Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation [APEC] opened on 17 November and concluded on 20  November. However, worldwide discussions and explorations on  the significance and effects of the recent conference are far  from concluded. We may put it that the Seattle conference was  the most conspicuous of all world events that could play an  important readjusting role in the Asia-Pacific region and the  global pattern in the wake of the end of the Cold War.    The Seattle APEC Conference comprised three parts: First,  the fifth routine session of the APEC ministerial meeting on  17-19 November; second, the unofficial summit of the 12  sovereign states of the 15 APEC member states and regions on 20  November; and third, bilateral talks outside the conference, of  which, the most notable was the official meeting between  President Jiang Zemin and President Clinton. The activities of  these three parts overlapped each other and formed into a rich  and colorful picture which has given much food for thought. The  ministerial meeting viewed the prospective direction of  Asia-Pacific's economic development, the unofficial summit  instilled a very important political essence in APEC, whereas at  the bilateral talks, especially the official Jiang Zemin-Clinton  meeting, some important bilateral relations were explored and  viewed anew from the higher tier of common interests on a  regional or even global scale. Obviously, the APEC conference  far exceeded the range of its original role, and is shaping into  an important force that affects Asia-Pacific and even the global  pattern.    On the issue of Asia-Pacific economic cooperation, the  ministerial meeting adopted the "Declaration on the Framework of  Trade and Investment," established a committee for trade and  investment, conducted coordination, and augmented cooperation  between members on global trade and investment to promote  regional free trade and reciprocal investment; firmly supported  APEC members, who are not GATT members to become signatories;  and were determined to add political pressure for the successful  conclusion of the Uruguay Round before 15 December 1993. The  APEC conference accepted Mexico and Papua New Guinea as new  members, and decided to admit Chile to next year's ministerial  meeting; nevertheless, no more new members are to be accepted  for the next three years.    The non-official meeting of leaders issued a "Statement on  Economic Prospects," which believes that the Asia-Pacific region  will play an important role in the world economy and take the  lead in economic development and trade expansion, calling for  the continuous removal of the region's barriers to trade and  investment and improving education and training to make progress  in telecommunications and communications as well as  environmental conditions. The leaders agreed to hold a  conference for finance ministers, founding a forum of Pacific  industry and commerce, and formulated plans for education and  business volunteers to develop and promote tertiary education  and the exploitation of human resources in the region.    During the conference, leaders of various countries  conducted  frequent bilateral contacts. President Jiang Zemin met 14  leaders (including newly accepted members). The Jiang Zemin and  Clinton meeting was the first Sino-U.S. summit since February  1989. Just as Vice Premier Qian Qichen, who is concurrently  foreign minister, put it, this important meeting was positive  and constructive. Although they were not talks, it was  impossible to resolve all of the problems, and neither side  would change its basic position, it is expected that Sino-U.S.  relations will improve somewhat. The important significance of  the meeting lies in defining anew the foundation for improving  and developing Sino-U.S. relations.    Superficially, the aforesaid results of the conference did  not seem to have made any specific arrangements for the  Asia-Pacific pattern with the end of the Cold War. We would  rather say that the conference reflected the concept of the "New  Pacific Community," and the "Asia-Pacific Economic Community"  Clinton set forth did not materialize, and this portends the  surfacing of new contradictions and confrontations which could  result from the U.S. strengthening its control over the  Asia-Pacific Region. However, should we analyze the situation  further, we may find that it was by no means accidental that  these interrelated measures were all adopted in the short span  of three or four days. The Seattle APEC Conference has revealed  the following major tendencies in the world situation with the  end of the Cold War:    1. The role of economic strength has become markedly  prominent in the balance of international forces. The  significance of Clinton's new strategy for the Asia-Pacific  region does not lie in building an Asia-Pacific community within  a short period (the "Statement on Economic Prospects" issued by  the Summit was confined to saying "we have conceived the idea of  building an Asia-Pacific economic community"), but in the change  from the past U.S. Asia- Pacific strategy based on security and  bilateral arrangements to a strategy of giving simultaneous  importance to security and economics and multilateral as well as  bilateral arrangements. From a contemporary angle, it is  imperative to give relative prominence to the economy and  multilateral arrangements because of the excessive attention  paid to security interests and bilateral arrangements in the  past. This falls in line with the U.S. goal of reinvigorating  the economy, and is conducive to the U.S. maintaining its  leading position and role. From a long-term view, facing the  challenges of the 21st century cannot be done without exerting  efforts in achieving new breakthroughs in science and technology  and economic growth. This being the case, the share of economic  factors will increase with the development of the situation.  Clinton's new strategic concept spans the 20th and 21st  century, and should not be neglected. It will inevitably exert  effects on the Asia-Pacific and global pattern.    2. Weight of Asia-Pacific Region in the global  balance has markedly increased. The Seattle APEC  conference has arranged the host countries for the next four  sessions: Indonesia in 1994; Japan in 1995; the Philippines in  1996; and Canada in 1997. In addition, the unofficial summit  decided that a summit would be held in Indonesia. Here, we do  not have to deal with the sustained growth of the Asia-Pacific  economy strengthening the region's role in the global position,  because from the site of the next four sessions, one can see  that Asia-Pacific will become the central area of global  concern. We shall wait and see whether or not the unofficial  summit will become institutionalized, but we can almost be sure  that the 1994 meeting in Indonesia will be an enthusiastic one,  and the 1995 meeting in Japan will not be inferior. Thus, an  Asia-Pacific summit might gradually take shape aside from the  G-7. The rise of the Asia-Pacific is an irresistible trend,  which will become a conspicuous characteristic of the post-Cold  War world.    3. China's place and role also show a rising  trend. Under the circumstance of drastic changes in the  world situation, China, as a developing socialist power, has  maintained stability. The success of the policy of reform and  opening up have brought a high rate of economic growth, which  has become in increasingly active factor in the Asia-Pacific and  global situation. While the United States has readjusted its  Asia-Pacific strategy, it will be very difficult to realize its  strategic goals in Asia-Pacific without a corresponding  readjustment in its policy toward China. The evolution of the  post- war situation in the Asia-Pacific region shows that should  the United States fail to correctly handle its relations with  China, it will lose the foundations of its strategy in the  Asia-Pacific region. It seems that President Clinton has come  to see this point, and his official meeting with President Jiang  Zemin was actually a wise move. Obviously, the improvement and  development of Sino-U.S. relations is where the common interests  of the two countries lie; furthermore, this not only concerns  China and the United States by any means, but inevitably has a  global significance, which is self explanatory.    President Jiang Zemin said: "What sort of world will be led  into the 21st century is an important issue that leading members  of our generation must earnestly explore and resolve," and he  added, "we can accomplish something." It seems that the Seattle  APEC conference has made a positive stride forward in this  direction.</p>

			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / International Company News: Chrysler leadership race intensifies THE board of Chrysler, the US automotive manufacturer, held an unusual special meeting in New York at the weekend amid speculation that it would consider naming Mr Robert Eaton, president of General Motors in Europe, as successor to Mr Lee Iacocca, its chairman. Mr Iacocca, who is 67, is due to retire at the end of this year. The Chrysler board has been weighing up for months whether to appoint a successor from within the company or on from outside. Mr Eaton acknowledged in an interview with the New York Times that he had held discussions with Mr Iacocca about joining Chrysler, though he did not specify in what capacity. Aged 52, he has played a key role in making GM Europe the company's most profitable automotive business, helping to offset heavy losses in the US market. Mr Eaton was rumoured to have flown to New York to meet the Chrysler board late on Saturday to discuss a succession plan, although a spokesman for the company declined all comment on the board's deliberations. The appointment of Mr Eaton would be a severe blow to Mr Robert Lutz, president of Chrysler, who has made clear that he wants to succeed Mr Iacocca. Mr Lutz, who has a strong design and engineering background, has played a crucial role in revamping Chrysler's tired model line with a range of exciting new vehicles due to reach the US market over the next two years. Several large Chrysler shareholders have made clear they back his candidacy. However, Mr Lutz has less knowledge of the financial side of the business and has clashed with Mr Iacocca on numerous occasions. If he does not get the chairmanship, Chrysler might have trouble keeping him. Another possible contender is 56-year-old Mr Gerald Greenwald, Mr Iacocca's former heir apparent, who left the company in 1990 to join an ill-fated airline management buy-out and now works for a New York investment bank. Mr Iacocca has been chairman of Chrysler ever since the late 1970s, when he engineered a government rescue which pulled the company back from the brink of bankruptcy.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The NTUC [National Trade Union Congress] Voice  Cooperative Society has entered into a joint venture with CUE  Network Corp. of the U.S. to launch an international paging  service in Singapore in about six months' time.    Called CUE SE Asia, the venture has an authorised capital of  $1 million [Singapore dollars], said Choo Wee Khiang, chairman  of NTUC Voice and an MP for Jalan Besar GRC [Group  Representatives Committee], yesterday.    The company will develop the use of FM subcarriers already  present with the two frequencies FM 100.3 and FM 91.3 used by  NTUC Radio Heart. FM subcarriers are the sidebands that  separate various radio frequencies and are largely unused.    Cue SE Asia will make use of FM radio stations around the  world that are signed on the CUE network to transmit paging  signals internationally.    Subscribers to the service can choose the countries with  which they want to be linked. Subscribers can be contacted in  North America, Canada, China, Japan, Taiwan, and Korea. Right  now, there are about 100,000 subscribers in the U.S. and Canada.  Subscriber numbers in Southeast Asia are expected to hit the  same figure. Subscription rates have yet to be worked out.    Negotiations are under way with other countries in the  region, including Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, the  Philippines, and Vietnam to be hooked up on the network in one  to two years, and NTUC Voice and CUE intend to make Singapore  the service hub of the region.    The international paging will work only with pagers  developed  by CUE. These will be available in the market soon and are  expected to retail at U.S. $190, the price at which they are  sold in the U.S.    As only Telecom can provide paging services locally until  1997, negotiations are under way for CUE SE Asia to operate the  service locally.    In the meantime, a satellite dish will be set up nearby,  possibly on Batam, to receive and transmit signals  internationally. If talks with Telecom do not come through, the  pagers will only be for international messages and not local  signals.    Besides the international paging service, CUE SE Asia will  offer other telecommunications services, the most significant of  which is the differential global positioning satellites or DGPS  service.    This uses the same FM sidebands as the international paging  service for the transmission of differential correction  information. This is useful for work that involves the  pinpointing of accurate locations -- navigation for instance.  Talks are already under way with NTUC Comfort.    DGPS can record the location of a vehicle and broadcast it  back to a despatch centre. The equipment required to receive  and transmit DGPS is simply a special piece of software that is  attached to the CUE pager's docking platform.    Mr. Choo said this use of the FM sidebands makes sound  commercial sense.</p>

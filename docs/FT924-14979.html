			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / International Company News: Syndicate turns down BBL stake LARGE shareholders in Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL) have turned down a 6.72 per cent stake in the Belgian bank, clearing the way for Internationale Nederlanden Groep (ING), the Dutch banking and insurance company, to buy the shares and proceed to a full bid for BBL. ING, which already owns 10 per cent of BBL, announced last month it planned to buy the stake from Unipar and SBH Investments of Italy, with a view to making a bid. But the stake first had to be offered to other members of a shareholder syndicate, headed by Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (GBL), the Belgian holding company which owns 13 per cent of BBL. Mr Jacques Thierry, BBL's chairman, announced on Monday night that the syndicate members had not exercised their option to buy the shares. ING will now audit of BBL's accounts before deciding whether to launch its BFr3,600-a-share bid, which values the bank at BFr63.6bn (Dollars 2.18bn). Since the possibility of a bid was announced, GBL - which indirectly controls a further 11 per cent of BBL - has been forthright in its opposition to the price and the bidder. Comte Jean-Pierre de Launoit, GBL's deputy chairman and a BBL director, said 10 days ago that the price was insufficient.</p>

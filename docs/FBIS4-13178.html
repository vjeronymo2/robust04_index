			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Beirut, 15 Apr (MENA)--The assassination of  Iraqi opposition figure Talib Suhayl al-Tamimi in his house in  Beirut continues to cause political and diplomatic interactions,  particularly after two Iraqi diplomats confessed yesterday to  the Lebanese judicial authorities and also before 'Awad Fakhri,  Iraqi charge d'affaires in Lebanon that they were involved in  the assassination.    While the Lebanese Foreign Ministry is expecting today to  receive the Iraqi Government's reply to its request to lift the  diplomats' immunity in order to try them before Lebanese courts,  diplomatic sources expect the Iraqi reply to be negative and  expect the Lebanese Government to expel Cultural Attache Khalid  Khalaf and Cultural Attache Muhammad Kamil Kazim next week after  indicting them in accordance with Lebanese laws. [passage  omitted]    The Lebanese judicial authorities have asked the Foreign  Ministry departments to provide them with a copy of the full  identity papers of 'Ali Sultan Darwish, the Iraqi consul in the  embassy.    Security authorities last night arrested Muhammad Rashid,  manager of the al-Rafidayn Bank, and two of the bank's  employees. They are being investigated at the same time as the  Lebanese security forces continue to surround the Iraqi Embassy  building. Security sources said that the siege will not be  lifted until the wanted men are handed over.    The Iraqi Embassy issued a statement rejecting the measures  taken around the embassy as a violation of diplomatic norms.  [passage omitted]    As part of the security measures taken in connection with  the  assassination, security men raided a number of apartments in  northern Beirut where members of the group that planned and  carried out the assassination reside. The security men  confiscated guns, ammunition, and silencers.    Lebanese press reports said that the judicial investigation  into the assassination of Iraqi opposition figure Talib Suhayl  al-Tamimi has revealed serious information. The confessions of  the two Iraqi diplomats accused of the assassination indicated  that there is an intelligence network [words indistinct] within  another group of employees of the Iraqi Embassy and the  al-Rafidayn Bank, including an Armenian shirt maker called  George Tartajian who helped the defendants reach the house of  the victim. He has been arrested.    The paper AL-SAFIR, which published this information today,  said that the order from Baghdad to assassinate al-Tamimi came  in a coded telex message to the al-Rafidayn Bank center in  al-Sadat Street in Ra's Beirut.</p>

			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PASADENA TO CONSIDER REGULATING GUARDS  </P> <P> Despite the city manager's recommendation against it, the Board of Directors on  Tuesday asked for more information to assess whether Pasadena should regulate  private, uniformed guards and the companies that employ them.  </P> <P> "If we had an ordinance on the books it wouldn't have prevented (Robert Earl)  Holloway's death, but we need to explore the issue more fully," City Director  William Paparian said.  </P> <P> The board in June asked for information on city laws pertaining to security  guards in the wake of resident complaints of city inaction after Holloway's  death in January. Accused of trespassing at the King's Villages housing project  in Northwest Pasadena, Holloway, 28, died Jan. 18 of strangulation after  fighting with five security guards.  </P> <P> Both the district attorney and the state attorney general declined to file  criminal charges against the guards or their employer, Gold Security Patrol.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, City Manager Philip Hawkey told directors that state licensing laws  regulating private security firms prevent the city from passing laws of its  own.  </P> <P> "The city by ordinance does have some limited jurisdiction . . . just an  inventory of who is doing work and the patrols they would follow," Hawkey said.  </P> <P> But even such limited city regulation could discourage reputable security firms  from doing business in Pasadena, Hawkey said. In addition, such a law could  expose the city to lawsuits if a mishap or death occurred at the hands of  security guards, Hawkey said.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, city directors asked for a survey of the number of guard firms in  the city and the companies' opinions of possible city regulations. The  regulations could include requirements that security firms provide the names of  their guards, the state licenses held by the guards, the routes to be followed  by guard patrol cars and the radio frequencies used.  </P> <P> Director Chris Holden also asked for an analysis of the city's ability to  create tighter restrictions on security guards at housing projects such as  King's Villages. The city in 1982 purchased King's Villages from the federal  Housing and Urban Development Department and sold it to Goldrich, Kest &amp;  Associates, a private management company.  </P></p>

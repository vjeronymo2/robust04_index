			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Joseph Mace-Scaron: "Mitterrand-Rocard </F> Relations: Enemies for 30 Years"]    [Excerpt] They have hated each other so much. For 30 years  [French President] Francois Mitterrand and [Socialist Party  First Secretary] Michel Rocard have been performing "Who's  Afraid of Virginia Woolf" on the Left. For 30 years,  misunderstandings have been added to rebuffs, disdain has  followed underhand blows. The case of the embargo on arms for  Bosnia is merely another episode in a long series.    After Michel Rocard backed the stance adopted by  Bernard-Henri Levy, Francois Mitterrand forcefully reaffirmed in  Wednesday's [25 May] cabinet meeting that he would not accept  "sermonizers" on this issue. He added that there was no  question of going back on the embargo which reduces the two  camps' sources of armaments. Yesterday morning, in an interview  granted to five European newspapers, he stressed once again,  that this demand had "not been acted on.... I think this is  wise."    This shows the Elysee's irritation at the Socialist Party  [PSF] first secretary, who also expressed his anger: "Have you  ever known an embargo to be imposed on the victim? If we cannot  protect the Bosnians, they should at least be allowed to defend  themselves."    In private, Mitterrand asserts that the "Europe Begins at  Sarajevo" list is an operation directed by the PSF first  secretary or rather by Jean-Paul Huchon, his right-hand man. In  reply to those who express surprise at this certainty, the head  of state says that this list -- the ultimate sacrilege -- openly  attacks the major issue of his seven-year term: France's  European policy. Moreover, this initiative "obligingly"  displays the split between the original pro-Mitterrand  intellectuals and their former champion.    At PSF headquarters they are not displeased to see Michel  Rocard "finally dissociating himself from the Elysee, which has  so far only distinguished itself by its aptitude to cause  nuisance." And a jumbled list of examples is given:  cohabitation which was "too soft" at the beginning, legislation  on citizenship, and the encouragement given to the formation of  the Tapie list for the European elections.

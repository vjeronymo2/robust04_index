He got a strike, set the hook and the fish  spooled him.  </P> <P> The fish started to move out. As Kevin tried to gain line with it the skiff  drifted faster. Sanderson thought it could be a shark or big bat ray. Kevin  refused to give the rod to his father.  </P> <P> About 20 minutes later a yellowtail surfaced.  </P> <P> A net was lowered but the yellow was too big. Kevin held on although his arm  was weakening.

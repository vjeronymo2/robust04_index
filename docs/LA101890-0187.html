			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: POMONA;  </P> <P> DEVELOPER FOR DOWNTOWN  </P> <P> The City Council has chosen Hopkins Development Co. of Newport Beach to try to  develop a retail center south of Buffums department store downtown.  </P> <P> The council, acting as the Redevelopment Agency, this week designated Hopkins  as the developer for a 22-acre site north of Mission Boulevard and east of  Garey Avenue.  </P> <P> Last year, another company, CSA Real Estate Development of Anaheim, tried  without success to secure major tenants for the same site.  </P> <P> City officials said Hopkins has proposed to build housing, either single-family  homes or townhouses, on part of the site to improve the project's financial  feasibility. City officials said they want to keep Buffums, either at its  current site or in a new retail center downtown.  </P> <P> The agreement gives Hopkins 90 days to secure letters of interest from  potential tenants and to prepare a development plan.  </P></p>

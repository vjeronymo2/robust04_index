			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / US firms protect partners: Accountancy Three of the six largest US accountancy firms have changed their legal structure in an effort to provide protection of their partners' assets from litigation. The remaining three large firms confirmed that they were also at an advanced stage of taking the same route over the next two months. Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Ernst &amp; Young and Price Waterhouse changed their legal status to become Delaware limited liability partnerships on Monday. KPMG Peat Marwick and Deloitte &amp; Touche are also likely to become registered in Delaware over the next few weeks, taking advantage of accomodating corporate regulations. Arthur Andersen, the world's largest firm, is believed to be considering registering as a limited liability partnership in Illinois, the state in which its principal US activities are based. Otherwise it too will register in Delaware. The change has come as part of efforts by the firms to mitigate the effects of large lawsuits from aggrieved investors and others who claim to have relied on their audit opinions. The firms argue that many of the claims against them are unjust and are fighting for reform of the US legal system to introduce 'proportionate liability' rather than the current position in which they can be required to pay all damages even if only found partly to blame.</p>

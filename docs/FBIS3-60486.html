			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "AIDS Information To Be Extended"] </F>   [Excerpt] "The best vaccine is information that leads to a  change of behavior," Health Minister Michael Ausserwinkler  stated on Monday [29 November] on the occasion of the upcoming  World AIDS Day on 1 December. He announced plans to  considerably expand information activities and to coordinate the  individual measures in Austria to a greater extent. Thus, 18  million schillings will be available for a broad information  campaign on AIDS in 1994 (10 million in 1993). The funds for  AIDS relief organization and other institutions will be  increased from 31.8 million (1993) to 35 million schillings.    The minister described the current situation as follows: "By  the end of November a total of 1,077 persons had developed AIDS,  and 667 thereof had died. The number of those infected with the  HIV virus in Austria is estimated at 10,000 to 15,000. It is  assumed that one to two persons are newly infected every day."  There is no complete therapy for those who have developed the  disease. Realistically, one must proceed from the premise that  there will be no vaccine against AIDS by the year 2000. The  minister estimated the costs for the treatment of a person who  has developed AIDS at 1 to 1.5 million schillings. [passage  omitted]</p>

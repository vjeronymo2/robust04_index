This is one arena where Cap Sesa Industrie seeks  to boost its presence.    "Industry is the sector of the economy that dispensed most  of  all with software and services last year," says Gerard Mezin,  director-general of Cap Sesa Industrie. In the light of this  finding, his company (Fr1 billion business volume) -- which  chalked up 3.5 percent of its software and service sales for 6.5  percent of the business volume of the SSI [data processing  services and engineering companies] in this sector in 1992 --  intends to double its shares of the market by the 1996 horizon  without any foreign growth.    The pie that is to be shared here as a matter of fact looks  quite appetizing. According to Pierre Audoin Conseil, the  industrial enterprises last year devoted 92 billion to their  data processing systems, including 29 billion for software and  services. A study specially conducted by Cap Sesa shows that the  big accounts, that always sustained the growth of the services  market (in 1992, ten industrial groups accounted for 35 percent  of the software and services expenditures) have a tendency to  slow their investments down; on the other hand, medium-sized  enterprises will pick up the slack and will help push  expenditures up.    "The difficult economic situation in which many of the big  accounts find themselves obviously has an unfavorable impact on  their investments in software and services," emphasized Gerard  Mezin. Moreover, there are currently wide disparities between  the sectors that should recover with the passage of time. Some  of them, such as metallurgy, agribusiness and food, and capital  goods are posting expenditure ratios between data processing and  business volume that are still rather meager when compared to  the industry average. Cap Sesa, in turn, has just signed two  important contracts, representing a total of more than Fr80  billion in the field of computer-aided manufacturing management  and commercial management.    "In 1996, the industrial enterprises will consume 30 percent  of FM and 30 percent hardware. Big projects will be increasingly  built up on the basis of these products," predicts Gerard Mezin.  These two market segments should advance, respectively, at a  rate of 23 percent and 12 percent per year, as against 9.3  percent for systems integration, a preferred arena of  competition between data processing services and engineering  companies, on the one hand, and data processing equipment  makers, on the other hand.</p>

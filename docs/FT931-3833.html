			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: NS to get an arbiter A NEW recruit is to join the ranks of ombudsmen and arbitrators handling complaints about financial services. From April 1, the newcomer - styled an 'independent adjudicator' - will determine disputes between the department for National Savings and its investors. The name of the adjudicator - picked from a field of 50 legally-qualified applicants - will be announced soon by the Treasury. The job is part-time and the appointee will take over the task from the registrar of friendly societies. Investors might wonder how an adjudicator appointed, paid-for and provided with office space by National Savings' overlord, the Treasury, can be described as independent. But although NS has around 30m investors, very few of those involved in disputes are likely to come into contact with the adjudicator - or even to learn that such an official exists. Unlike the banks, most of which display posters or leaflets about their ombudsman, NS has no plans to make any information about the adjudicator available in post offices. And, apparently, it intends not to reveal the possibility of adjudication until very late in a dispute. An NS spokesman said this week that if a dispute reached an impasse after 'protracted correspondence,' the department would then tell the investor the matter could be referred to the adjudicator. The annual report of the registrar of friendly societies shows that in the year to September 1992, he dealt with 18 NS disputes: 10 over NS savings bank deposits; six over savings certificates; and two over stocks, bonds or premium bonds. Third-party title disputes were the largest category, accounting for 11 cases, followed by claims for additional interest (three cases).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by special ABC COLOR correspondent Luis Maria Maiz </F> in Brussels]    [Text] President Juan Carlos Wasmosy told ABC COLOR  yesterday that his European tour comes at a key moment. He said  he received an "excellent response" from European Union [EU]  officials. Wasmosy said he has the "complex" mission of  reconditioning the "completely unrealistic" image of "today's"  Paraguay. Today he will raise with [French President] Francois  Mitterrand the possibility of rescheduling the foreign debt for  the next two years so as to allocate funds for social programs.    Wasmosy said his European tour is taking place "at the right  moment." He said he has received an "excellent" response to his  explanations of cooperation projects, most of which seek to  favor the most vulnerable classes.    Wasmosy yesterday ended a two-day visit to Brussels where  his  busy agenda involved meeting with high EU and European  Parliament dignitaries and European Bank of Investments  officials, among others.    He is scheduled to meet on 8 April with French President  Francois Mitterrand at the Elysee Palace in Paris. Wasmosy will  raise with the French president his desire to reschedule the  Paraguayan foreign debt repayments.    Wasmosy will discuss the same issue with French Patronage  and  Paris Club board members.    In a brief chat with ABC COLOR, Wasmosy described his  meetings in Brussels. He explained to the European Parliament  our country's political situation, our hopes for agro-industrial  development and progress in processing raw materials, which are  currently exported without added value.    Wasmosy said he clearly explained the peasant problem and  the  way in which his administration is coping with this situation  that was broadly covered by the press, specially in February and  March.    Asked if the key point of his European tour involves  rescheduling our foreign debt, Wasmosy made it clear that  Paraguay is not specifically asking for renegotiations because  "we have no arrears."    The president emphasized: "We have not come to ask for  pardons, but to raise a rescheduling of our repayments for the  next two years so as to have the funds we wish to allocate for  social programs. We have not come to ask for renegotiations or  pardons."    Wasmosy described as complex the task of overcoming the  distrust towards the image that Paraguay had projected over the  past 30 years or so, an image that still prevails in Europe. He  added: "Think about Paraguay's current profile in Europe. It is  completely unrealistic nowadays. As president, I have the huge  task of reconditioning this image."    Industry and Commerce Minister Ubaldo Scavone said the  Paraguayan delegation was impressed by the interest demonstrated  by European officials in the Paraguayan process and Paraguay's  future.    Scavone noted: "The president was subjected to what we could  call a very interesting questioning by the European Parliament  Foreign Relations and Security Committee. This demonstrates that  there is considerable interest in the Paraguayan process and  Paraguay's future."    The EU is experiencing difficult times both in its internal  recycling, its stance toward GATT, and its relationship with the  United States.    These complications, however, will not prevent Paraguay from  securing some assistance. Scavone said: "Considering our past  achievements, which were nil, we have very good possibilities."    Scavone emphasized the favorable inclination that exists. He  added that "President Wasmosy's image and his correct and able  handling of the issues has greatly contributed" to this visit's  success.</p>

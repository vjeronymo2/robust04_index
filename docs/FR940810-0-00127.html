			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> During the rulemaking, participants raised various issues concerning notification. Several participants wanted accessibility to be a consideration in the approach (Exs. 162&hyph;5, 162&hyph;11, 162&hyph;14, 162&hyph;23, 162&hyph;29, 162&hyph;30, 162&hyph;33, 162&hyph;42, 162&hyph;49, 162&hyph;55, 162&hyph;58, 162&hyph;59), and BCTD suggested that ``accessible'' be defined as ``material subject to disturbance by building or facility occupants or maintenance personnel or workers performing renovation, repair or demolition inside and/or outside buildings'' (Ex. 162&hyph;42).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most agreed that PACM and/or ACM within areas such as mechanical rooms and boiler rooms should be labeled. For example, Mr. Olson of Dow Chemical Company supported the posting of areas where those who may be exposed will see it before working there (Ex. 162&hyph;17). A representative from the Department of Defense felt that general posting in public areas would alarm building occupants and over time, lead to reduced credibility and effectiveness (Ex. 162&hyph;13). This was echoed in the comments of J. Thornton of Newport News Shipbuilding who felt that signs ``may breed complacency'' (Ex. 162&hyph;21). One participant worried that perhaps a tenant considering renewing his lease who had been notified of PACM within the building might choose to relocate even though there really was no asbestos-containing materials actually present in the building (Ex. 162&hyph;20). OSHA has decided that ``accessibility'' is relevant to posting information concerning the location of in-place asbestos. Paragraph (k)(7)(vii) requires labels to be attached at ``accessible locations.'' OSHA agrees with BCTD's definition as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some representatives of contractor interests recommended that OSHA use as a model for notification the California regulation by which the building owner provides written notification to all building employees, tenants, and contractors (Exs. 162&hyph;27, 162&hyph;32).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted below, paragraph (k)(7)(vii) requires previously installed asbestos products to be labelled in most circumstances; either visibly labeled in accordance with the standard, when feasible, or that information required on the label be posted as close to the installed product as feasible. Information concerning other previously-installed asbestos-containing products must be posted in mechanical rooms or other areas which are accessible where such material is present; or if the products are installed in other areas, the building owner must otherwise make such information available to employees who perform work covered by this standard. The provision exempts from labeling and posting those products which the manufacturer demonstrates cannot release fibers in excess of the PELs. OSHA has found that this exemption will never apply to PACM (TSI or surfacing ACM); rarely will it apply to other asbestos containing materials, because on this record, disturbance of ACM  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> can <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  exceed the PEL. As noted in the comments summarized above, there will be cases where labeling of such materials is not feasible. In such case, the standard requires that signs or labels be displayed as close as feasible to such materials. Additionally, housekeeping workers must be informed that all resilient flooring material they clean, buff or otherwise maintain may contain asbestos.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA believes that the strategy for the flow of information regarding the presence and location of asbestos-containing or presume-asbestos-containing materials it has developed in this revision of its standards will assure that workers who might be exposed to asbestos within public and commercial buildings and/or facilities will be informed of the potential for such exposure and through the training provisions will be made aware of the practices they are to use to avoid exposure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To further assure the responsible transfer of information, OSHA is requiring that records of the work performed, the location and quantity of ACM or PACM remaining at the completion of the work, and data supporting any rebuttal of the presumption that a material contains asbestos, are to be maintained by the building/facility owner and are to be transferred to successive owners of the building/facility. Further, in the event that ACM/PACM is inadvertently encountered, OSHA has included a requirement for timely notification. If during the course of asbestos work ACM or PACM is discovered at a worksite, within 24 hours of finding such material, information as to its location and quantity are to be conveyed to the building owner and any other employers at the site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

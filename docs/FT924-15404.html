			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Early end to puerile joy Since John Major spoke about the need to repair the 'fault lines' in the European Monetary System, there has been some back-pedalling. No real British reform plan is likely to be presented to the Birmingham Euro-summit, and the emphasis has changed to the need for so-called economic convergence. Meanwhile, Norman Lamont's singing in the bath is likely to change to sobbing in the sink unless the fall in sterling is soon arrested. Amid the puerile rejoicing of the Euro-sceptics it is not yet realised quite how far sterling has fallen since Britain's humiliating departure from the ERM. The situation is reminiscent of 1986, when, as I then pointed out, sterling was allowed to fall far too much under the pretext of a drop in the oil price; and the groundwork was laid for the boom and bust cycle we have suffered ever since. The big difference is that the 1986 depreciation took place in fits and starts over a whole year. This time the process has been compressed into weeks or days - rather in the way that the long drawn-out themes of a Bruckner slow movement are sometimes then compressed into a brief, frantic scherzo. Meanwhile the Treasury is trying to work out some monetary guidelines on the assumption that the UK is outside the ERM. Indeed one school of thought there is against Britain returning to the ERM except in the context of a commitment to full monetary union - which is as likely in present political circumstances as Norman Lamont dancing a Scottish reel in the middle of Downing Street. The pound has been hit by the unseemly row with the Bundesbank and disappointment at unrealistic hopes of a German interest rate cut last Friday. At the end of last week sterling had fallen by nearly 18 per cent on the previous DM2.95 parity. This has more than corrected for any element of overvaluation in the latter and will nearly all work its way into domestic inflation. The best market indicator of expected inflation is the gap between high coupon long-dated gilts and the indexed variety. This has widened from well under 4 1/2 per cent to over 5 1/2 per cent - higher than it was before the election which Labour was expected to win. Forget further early interest rate cuts over and above the foolish reduction made after ERM departure. The government will be lucky to avoid a base rate increase before the Tory conference is over. Unfortunately, it is becoming clear that ministers are being economical with the truth in their assertions that the UK did everything possible to remain in the ERM. They did not raise interest rates when pressure on sterling built up in August and some officials were recalled from holiday. They did not even raise them following the lira devaluation; nor even as late as the afternoon of Tuesday, September 15, when the pressure on sterling began to be unbearable. Even on the final Wednesday morning they procrastinated for several hours. The comparison with the actions of the French and Swedish governments speaks for itself. We still do not know how far the government ignored advice from the Bank of England and how far that advice itself was flawed. It is in any case now clear that the PM and chancellor were not prepared to raise interest rates in a recession, even temporarily, for the longer-term gains of staying in the ERM. It was in that case culpably foolish to rely on hypocritical drum-beating speeches to produce a contrary impression. The government had plenty of time for a planned temporary withdrawal before the highly visible benchmark of the French referendum. Alternatively it could have responded to Bundesbank pleas for realignment, which every half attentive journalist had been hearing for at least two years and which Helmut Schlesinger personally conveyed to a high-ranking British dignitary - who passed it on to John Major - several weeks before the final storm. Of course all is not well in an ERM, three of whose members have devalued or withdrawn. A grown-up decision is needed on whether it is to be an adjustable band, or a permanent fixing of exchange rates with a view to a single currency, or a two-speed mixture. British officials also have some valid technical points - such as the failure of the divergence indicator to flash for large creditor currencies to whom smaller currencies are tied, or the fact that Germany did not have intervention obligations so long as the Belgian franc was 5 basis points higher in the grid. More important is said to be the need for compatible combinations of monetary, exchange rate and fiscal polices among members. But when the British make such suggestions, they sound like people throwing large stones in thin glass houses. The UK joined the ERM two years ago without any attempt at negotiation either of the entry rate or accompanying policies. The joys of sinking outside are fast disappearing. But the real question is the conditions on which other members will have Britain back.</p>

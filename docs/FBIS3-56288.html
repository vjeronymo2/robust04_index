			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Joint Statement on Issues of Export Controls  and Policy in the Area of Transfers of Conventional Weapons and  Dual-Use Technologies    The secretary of state of the United States of America and  the minister of foreign affairs of the Russian Federation  underscored the staunch commitment of their countries to efforts  to curb the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and to  enhance global and regional stability. In keeping with the  spirit of the new strategic partnership between the United  States and Russia the ministers have agreed on development of  wide-ranging cooperation in the field of export control.  Moreover, they have agreed that all necessary steps in this  field be taken expeditiously, and have established a  senior-level working group for this purpose, as well as to  initiate bilateral cooperation in the areas specified in a  memorandum of intent signed this day in Moscow.    The ministers expressed satisfaction with steps taken since  the last meeting of the President of the United States and the  president of the Russian Federation to eliminate the vestiges of  the Cold War, such as the Coordinating Committee for  Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM), which according to the  understanding reached by COCOM members will be terminated not  later than March 31, 1994. They also welcomed the decision to  establish a new multilateral regime for enhancing responsibility  and transparency in the transfers of armaments and sensitive  dual-use technologies. This new arrangement would not be  directed against any state or group of states, and would prevent  the acquisition of such items for military end uses if the  behavior of a state is or becomes a cause for serious concern as  determined by the participants of the new multilateral regime.    The United States and Russia, as leading exporters of  conventional weapons, military equipment and dual-use  technologies, are convinced that additional measures are needed  on an international basis to increase responsibility,  transparency and, were appropriate, restraint in this area.  They expressed their willingness to work with other countries  in bringing about the early establishment of a new multilateral  regime in order to achieve these objectives, which would  supplement existing non-proliferation regimes, in particular  through arrangements to exchange information for the purpose of  meaningful consultations.</p>

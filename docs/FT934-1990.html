			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The Joint Statement: Reynolds basks in unusual glory of cross-party support After weeks of criticism from the opposition benches in the Irish parliament over his approach to the Anglo-Irish peace initiative, Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, yesterday basked in an unusual display of cross-party support. The three main opposition parties, Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats and Democratic Left, have been concerned that Mr Reynolds, in pushing hard for an accommodation of nationalist aspirations in the joint declaration, would alienate unionist opinion in Northern Ireland and exacerbate political tensions and violence there. Ms Mary Harney, leader of the Progressive Democrats who has been one of Mr Reynolds' sharpest critics, described the declaration as 'fair and balanced'. She added: 'Over the past number of weeks I and my party consistently expressed our concerns that a peace formula might be attempted to satisfy the men of violence at the expense of constitutional unionists in particular. I am happy to acknowledge that my concerns have not come to pass.' Mr John Bruton, the Fine Gael leader, congratulated the two prime ministers in reaching an agreement. Highlighting the British government's acknowledgement of the right to self-determination in the island of Ireland, he said: 'In view of this declaration, there can be no conceivable justification for any organisation, like the IRA, to continue to attempt to coerce the British people by arms into agreeing to something that they have already plainly agreed to in this declaration.' He was concerned at a 'lack of clear timetables or mechanisms' for the resumption of inter-party talks and hoped that the formula for dropping the republic's constitutional claim to Northern Ireland in the context of an overall settlement 'would not be used as an excuse to defer all action on constitutional reforms into the indeterminate future'. Mr Prionsias de Rossa, leader of Democratic Left which in an earlier guise was the political wing of the official IRA before the organisation split in the 1970s, paid tribute 'to the drafting skills of some of the best brains in both the Irish and British public services'. He said the British government 'has gone as far as it is politically possible to go to meet republican demands in regard to self-determination'. He added: 'If the IRA spurns this opportunity, responsibility for the continuing violence will be seen to rest totally with them.' Mr de Rossa also said that Mr Reynolds 'has gone further than he or any of his predecessors have been prepared to go in the past' by making a solemn written commitment to drop the republic's constitutional claim to Northern Ireland as part of an overall political settlement. Mr Bruton warned against establishing too many bodies for discussing issues in the north. On the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, he said there should not be 'competing institutions trying to solve the same problem - creating needless misunderstandings and misinterpretations'.</p>

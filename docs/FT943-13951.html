			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Food &amp; Drink: The threat on France's doorstep - The Spanish wine bargains available Which country do French wine producers see as their greatest threat? The average British wine drinker might think Australia. Her (yes, she is female) American counterpart might think north, or even south, America. But the answer is Spain. Spain is right on France's doorstep and not only has 20 times more vineyard than Australia, and five times more than the US, but half as much again as France. Only its water shortage keeps Spain in third place as a wine producer behind France and Italy. But imagine if New World thinking were ever to prevail within Europe and allow widespread irrigation . . . There is certainly no shortage of Spanish wine bargains available in Britain, although there tends to be a curious polarisation of supply: either dirt cheap liquids carefully designed to meet British taste and price points (sic), or intensely ambitious wines which set their cap at Madrid's connoisseur class. Ribera del Duero has provided the Madrilenos with Spain's most fashionable, concentrated, well-structured reds. Vega Sicila (Laymont &amp; Shaw, of Truro, Cornwall) and Pesquera (John Armit of London W11) have been the standard bearers, but producers such as Sanz's Dehesa de los Canonigos are putting on the pressure. British wine drinkers are now being treated to a much wider variety of names from this promising wine region at less exalted prices (and, it has to be said, slightly less exalted quality). Senorio de Nava's good value wines are relatively widely available - the harmonious and powerful 1987 is Pounds 5.69 at Asda and Pounds 5.99 at Fullers wine shops, while it is possible to find the still slightly tough 1989 reduced from Pounds 5.69 to Pounds 4.99 until today at some branches of the Co-op. The Wine Society, of Stevenage, Hertfordshire, has the rich and powerful Callejo 1989 at Pounds 6.95. Its Spanish selection is looking particularly interesting at the moment. Marques de Alella Clasico 1993 at Pounds 4.95 is a lively, super-tingly, lemony, dry white also made just outside Barcelona, which would make a refreshing and genuinely interesting aperitif and could withstand fierce chilling for a picnic. The society's classically rustic Masia Barril Tipico 1991 Priorato at Pounds 5.75, on the other hand, is just the job for those with fond memories of blockbusting, old-fashioned, sun-drenched red Chateauneuf-du-Pape. The typical Priorato red should theoretically have 13.75 per cent alcohol. This one has 15. In many ways the rugged, slatey slopes of Priorat(o) constitute Spain's most fascinating red wine appellation at the moment. A series of small-scale investors in Clos This and Clos That have made ambitious, long-term red wines which combine Catalan heritage with recognition of what the international wine collector seeks. Moreno Wines of London W2 and W9 have Clos Mogador in their exceptionally interesting Spanish range (see also their Guilbenzu reds from Navarra from Pounds 4.99), but it is Pounds 17.49. Clos Mogador probably ought not to be broached until the next century, but Clos Dofi 1990, not to my knowledge available in the UK, manages to combine the promise with current pleasure, albeit in no more than 2,500 bottles, filled from some absolutely top quality barrels. Clos Dofi is made by a refugee from Rioja, but Rioja has woken up from its dream of first-growth prices and can now offer the odd genuinely interesting bargain, such as Oddbins' Puelles Rioja. At Pounds 3.75 this scented, full, fruity red wine is one of those new riojas that has nothing whatever to do with the archetype, being juicy rather than oaky. Oddbins also has the more serious Palacio de la Vega Cabernet Sauvignon 1991 Navarra at Pounds 6.99. It is full, deep, with lots of oak, but very well put together. Strike before prices rise. Today is the last day of the Co-op's offer of the appley dry and perfectly acceptable light white Galician Valle de Monterrey at Pounds 1.99, although even at the usual Pounds 2.49 it is a good buy.</p>

			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Markets: Sun Life's long-term care plan - At a Glance Sun Life has made a series of changes to its whole-of-life plan which could allow it to be used to pay for long-term care bills. The policy will now pay out if the insured person 'loses their independent existence', so extra money could be provided for those with a long old age, before they die.</p>

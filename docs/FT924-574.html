			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / International Company News: Ciments Francais bids for remainder of Guintoli CIMENTS Francais, the troubled French cement group, has bowed to pressure from the Paris stock market authorities by mounting a bid for the remaining shares in Guintoli, the building company linked to the scandal over its off-balance sheet dealings. The bid, which values Guintoli at FFr466.7m (Dollars 87.2m), has been made by Ciments Francais and Paribas, the French bank which, following this autumn's scandal, was forced to offer to repay FFr500m of the FFr6bn it received for selling control of Ciments Francais to Italcementi of Italy. Ciments Francais and Paribas are offering FFr890 a share for the 67.1 per cent of Guintoli's equity the former does not already own. This is the same price that Ciments Francais paid for its original 32.9 per cent stake. Paribas' involvement forms part of its agreement with Italcementi. Under the terms of that deal it now owns Ciments Francais' existing stake in Guintoli and will be entitled to any shares that are subsequently acquired. The offer follows an announcement last week by the Conseil des Bourses de Valeurs,the French stock market regulator, that Ciments Francais should bid for Guintoli after the discovery that the off-balance sheet dealings - worth FFr1.05bn overall  - had raised the group's stake above the 33.3 per cent level at which, under law, a company must make a full offer.</p>

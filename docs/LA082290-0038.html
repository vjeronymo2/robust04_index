			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> No Interview for Oprah: The Oprah Winfrey show on Monday boasted of a coup.  </P> <P> Vicki Long, the Atlanta woman who reportedly had a two-year affair and marriage  to former Archbishop Eugene Marino, and her attorney Gloria Allred had granted  an exclusive interview to Oprah. The interview was to be taped Wednesday and  was to air Thursday. But on Tuesday, word went out that the interview was  canceled. " 'The Oprah Winfrey Show' has made the decision that it would be  inappropriate to conduct the interview at this time," said a release. A  spokeswoman for the show would not disclose the story behind the cancellation,  but said, "We feel that statement speaks for itself." BETH KLEID  </P></p>

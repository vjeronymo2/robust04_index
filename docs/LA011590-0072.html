			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET BEAT: PORTFOLIO MANAGER ZEROES IN ON REAL ESTATE-RELATED STOCKS  </P> <P> Forget about those real estate jitters that have rocked the market lately.  Portfolio manager Allen A. Parker is undaunted. "Wealth accumulation has always  involved substantial real estate," he says. Only now it will be through real  estate-related stocks more than direct investment.  </P> <P> Parker, who runs the U.S. Real Estate Fund, operated by San Antonio-based  United Services Advisors, argues that the "wave of the future" is the  securitization of real estate (an unpopular subject these days). That's because  the end of most tax breaks on real estate investments and the illiquid nature  of such ventures have made them unattractive to many institutional and wealthy  investors.  </P> <P> These days, he's particularly high on real estate investment trusts. About 160  are listed on stock exchanges, but only half are actively traded, and he  considers only 25 to be of institutional quality. Of those, he sticks to a  subgroup that he calls "property specific," which he believes are most  recession-resistant, especially those that either own local strip shopping  centers anchored by grocery or discount drug chains, or properties leased to  psychiatric or substance abuse hospitals.  </P> <P> What makes REITs especially attractive, he says, is that they "pay you to wait"  with robust dividends. For example, Boston-based Copley Properties, "an example  of being in the right thing in the wrong place," owns industrial and office  properties in its headquarters city. It trades for about $11.50 on the American  Stock Exchange, but has a dividend yield (dividend as a percent of share price)  of more than 8%. "So you're going to wait for this thing to come back," he  says.  </P> <P> Parker also likes Bethesda, Md.-based Federal Realty Investment Trust, which  owns shopping centers in the mid-Atlantic region; Wellesley, Ma.-based  Meditrust; Los Angeles-based Health Care Property Investors; Beverly  Hills-based American Health Properties, and Toledo-based Health Care REIT.  </P> <P> P.S.: Another Parker pick is home builder Kaufman &amp; Broad, whose stock has  plunged about 25% in the past six months. "We'll buy on the pullback," he says.  That's because he believes that real estate investing is a little like  investing in mutual funds: It should be done for the long haul, just "more so  with real estate."  </P> <P> Thrifty Investing in Closed-End Funds  </P> <P> Like those closed-end country funds that are the rage these days, several  similar funds are devoted exclusively to savings and loans. (Shares of  closed-end funds, unlike conventional mutual funds, are traded on exchanges.)  The idea is that you can get thrift stocks cheaper by buying shares in the  closed-end fund rather than buying the individual thrift stocks, while  eliminating the risk of trying to pick a winner.  </P> <P> The favorite of Prudential-Bache Securities closed-end fund analyst Steven  Cress is First Financial Fund, which trades as a stock on the New York Stock  Exchange, and closed Friday at $7.375 a share. "The stocks in the fund are  oversold, and eventually the market will place a fair valuation on it," he  says.  </P> <P> Cress isn't alone with that opinion: Savvy New York hedge fund manager Julian  Robertson hasn't sold a share even though First Financial's price has dropped  by nearly half since he nearly doubled his position last August to 27.5%.  Robertson, who is quick to admit a mistake and then sell off, told me: "This is  one we don't think is a mistake."  </P> <P> Looking for a Corporate Co-Pilot  </P> <P> Informed sources say: Pan Am, which is known to be seeking a merger partner, is  in discussions with NWA (and not just Trans World Airlines, as has been widely  speculated). If a deal is struck, it is likely to be structured (on paper at  least) with Pan Am buying NWA (which owns Northwest Airlines), which itself  recently went private . . . New York real estate developer Donald J. Trump has  quietly sold all of his stock in AMR, the parent of American Airlines, which  has slumped about 30 points since he bought it and launched a short-lived bid.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The application proposes that GPUN be authorized through December 31, 1999 to enter into agreements, with terms of up to ten years and negotiated on an arm's-length basis, for the Services. It is stated that revenues received and expenses incurred in connection with the Services will be accounted for under appropriate accounts in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts. The application also states that the net revenues from the Services will be used to reduce the cost of GPUN service charges to GPU electric public utilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The application states that GPUN expects not to materially increase its staff or capital investments to provide the Services. In addition, it is stated that for the five-year period for which an authorization is sought, the aggregate annual revenues from and expenses associated with the Services are not anticipated to exceed 5% of the total annual operating expenses of GPUN, which in 1993 were $421 million. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The application states that it could be advantageous to provide the Services through one or more new wholly-owned subsidiaries, each of which the application proposes that GPU form and acquire through the purchase of $1,000 in capital stock. Finally, the application states that GPUN will, on or before May 1, of each year, report to the Commission the Services provided for the preceding year as well as the revenues derived therefrom and the expenses associated therewith. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jonathan G.

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Trafalgar House Hongkong Land's coup looks pretty well complete now that it has secured four places on the Trafalgar House board, including those of chairman and finance director. It has done so, moreover, with a stake of just 25 per cent that conveniently allows it to equity-account the holding but does not it oblige it to consolidate. In other circumstances, a rise to such dominance without a full bid might have provoked howls of protest. Trafalgar's intractable troubles presumably prompted the institutions to acquiesce in this case. Besides, they have the consolation of a share price more than double last year's low. The precedent is disturbing just the same. This could be a new beginning for Trafalgar House, but it will not become another Bechtel overnight. Cash flow is under pressure and disposals are as remote as ever. Hongkong Land will not automatically repeat the miracle it has wrought at Kwik Save. One has to hope it succeeds. If not, other shareholders will lack the power to obtain redress.</p>

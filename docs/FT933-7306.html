			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Small companies' foreign investment backed by UN ALTHOUGH foreign direct investment by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) remains relatively small in dollar terms, it can bring considerable benefits to developing countries, according to a UN study published today. The UN Conference on Trade and Development says SMEs, rather than big multinationals, tend to transfer technology more suitable for small-scale or labour-intensive operations. Their investment can bring significant balance of payments gains. However, more than 80 per cent of foreign direct investment by smaller companies goes to industrialised countries, with south and east Asia and Latin America taking the bulk of investment in developing countries. Unctad researchers think SMEs may account for about 10 per cent of the total worldwide flow of foreign direct investment, worth about Dollars 150bn (Pounds 100bn) in 1992, although they make up perhaps half the world's 37,000 transnationals. The report, prepared for an international conference in Osaka next month on foreign direct investment and the role of SMEs, draws on a survey of 735 SMEs, defined as employing fewer than 500 people in the home market. The study identifies the main incentives for SMEs to locate overseas as growth prospects in the local foreign market, improved competitiveness (including use of cheaper labour) and increased exports. More than 90 per cent of multinational SMEs are exporters. The most important obstacle to such investment is inadequate information about international business opportunities, the survey shows. But SMEs are also put off by the perceived difficulties and risks of operating in the third world. The single most important action by governments to attract more foreign direct investment is to establish a stable macroeconomic environment, Unctad says. Developing countries should also ensure SMEs take advantage of investment incentives. Even where financial assistance programmes exist, most SMEs raise investment finance privately, the report says. This is due partly to ignorance, partly to fear of bureaucratic entanglement and partly to the wish of many SMEs to own their foreign affiliates wholly, while government assistance tends to favour joint ventures and other forms of partnership.

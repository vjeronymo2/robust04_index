			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 25 (AFP)--The Beijing authorities  announced Wednesday fresh price controls on 34 staple  commodities following widespread complaints from residents over  illegal price hikes.    "This action aims at putting prices of these commodities and  services within the level residents can stand," the municipal  government said in a report.    Prices of 10 staples, including salt, coal, petrol and  housing rents will be set by the state, while a monitoring  system has been set up to record price fluctuations in 24  others, including rice, edible oil, sugar and pork. Enterprises  or shops wanting to raise prices must apply five-to-10 days in  advance to the municipal price bureau for approval, the report  said, adding that the bureau could intervene if the hikes were  too extreme or too frequent.    Since the beginning of the year, price rises of staple  commodities in medium and large cities throughout China -- amid  nationwide inflation of around 21 percent -- have drawn strong  protests from urban residents.    In a bid to curb inflation, the State Council sent six price  inspection teams to 14 provinces at the end of March.    According to press reports, the teams have already handled  more than 61,000 cases of illegal price-rising cases, involving  more than 50 million yuan (5.7 million dollars).</p>

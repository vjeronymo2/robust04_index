			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Firmer bonds lift European share prices A further recovery in bond markets led share prices higher across Europe yesterday. Bonds consolidated in calmer trading but traders said long-term investors remained sidelined and cash activity was thin. German bond markets firmed after the Bundesbank called for variable-rate securities repurchase agreements, a move seen as paving the way for lower short-term interest rates. Later, encouraging comments from a member of the US Federal Reserve gave US Treasuries a lift, further supporting European bond markets. Prices eased on late profit-taking in the German bund market, where traders were reluctant to hold paper ahead of the release of M3 money supply growth numbers for January and amid tension in the Balkans and Russia. UK gilts, however, held most of their gains, with the Liffe March long gilt futures contract closing at 113 7/16 , up  5/8 point on the day. In the London equity market, the FT-SE 100 Index closed at the best of the day, a gain of 46.9 bringing it to 3,328.1. The Footsie has now recovered all but 12 points of the ground lost last Thursday. Other European equity markets were also firmer.

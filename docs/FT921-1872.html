			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Bonn heads off public sector strike: Pay talks for 2.6m collapse after government refuses to concede 9.5 per cent demand PAY TALKS for more than 2.6m German public sector workers collapsed yesterday after the government and federal states refused to improve their 3.5 per cent pay offer. The government immediately appealed for arbitration to head off strike action. Unions representing 2.3m public sector workers, 240,000 postal workers and 110,000 railway workers, all declared a formal failure of the negotiations after two days of often bitter and stormy talks in Stuttgart. But their plan to call an immediate strike ballot was foiled by the government move to go to arbitration, which imposes a compulsory cooling-off period of up to six weeks. Nevertheless, the prospect of a big public sector strike in Germany is still real. 'The two sides are still worlds apart, between what the employers are offering and what the trade unions are demanding,' said a representative of the local authorities, the third tier of employers involved below the central government and the states. Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies, leader of the OTV public sector union, said the government's 3.5 per cent offer was a 'declaration of war.' The unions are seeking 9.5 per cent, plus extra holiday pay. The government's hard line reflects anxiety about extraordinary pressures on the public purse stemming from German unification costs and the signals that a high pay award would give for other sectors, including key engineering workers. Chancellor Helmut Kohl this week approved an increase in pensions of only 2.7 per cent, well below the current 4.2 per cent annual inflation rate, to a storm of criticism. Behind him he has the grim determination of the Bundesbank to stifle the threat of inflation by tightly controlling money supply and keeping short-term interest rates at a record level. Public sector wages have been resolved in arbitration twice before in the past decade, but the two sides appear more firmly entrenched than in recent years. However, neither side really wants all-out conflict, aware that the German economy is in danger of tipping into recession and that the cost of massive transfers from the west German economy to the east is still rising. West German industry had the world's highest labour costs last year for the third consecutive year, according to a study yesterday, Reuter reports from Bonn. The Institute of German Economy (IW), financed by German industry, said labour costs in west German industry in 1991 were DM40.48 (Pounds 14.17 at current exchange rates) an hour, DM1.65 (about 58 pence) higher than in Switzerland. The Swiss had the highest labour costs from 1986 to 1988; the Germans since. Portugal had the lowest industrial labour costs among 20 countries surveyed by the IW. Hourly labour costs there last year were DM7.88 (Pounds 2.76), below the DM11.14 (Pounds 3.90) paid in Greece, the next cheapest. The strength of the D-Mark and rising costs of social welfare were the main reasons for the high German levels.</p>

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Private motors THE LATEST problems with the proposed Renault-Volvo merger raise important points of principle. In effect, the French government and Volvo management are saying to the Swedish group's shareholders: trust us. We will conduct the merger in a rational way. We will then privatise the result as soon as possible. Volvo's owners may be forgiven for hesitating: doubly so, given the French government's damaging volte-face last week over Air France, whereby it appeared to duck commercial realities in favour of political expediency. From the Swedish viewpoint, consider what is at stake. The French government argues, with some show of reason, that merger must come first, privatisation second. Until the combination has been put in place, after all, it is hard to set a value on the operation. But this necessarily means the process will be at the mercy of politicians. This is not simply a matter of whether one company's interests will be preferred to another's: that might happen in any takeover. It is more a question of how far the merger will be structured in the interests of votes rather than profitability. The French could argue that the industrial realities point the other way. Renault has undergone severe cutbacks since the mid-1980s. Between 1988 and the end of last year, it reduced its workforce by 32,000. Granted, non-French workers bore the brunt of these economies, but the Swedish unions are apparently anxious enough about their future to carry on backing the deal regardless. The existence of a French golden share, which could in extreme cases reduce Volvo shareholders' voting rights, is not calculated to soothe Swedish sensibilities. But with a little good will, and some more concrete assurances from the French side, none of this need be insurmountable. The deal, after all, has one crucial argument in its favour: that its origins lie in industrial rather than political logic. This bears out a wider point: that the whole Renault-Volvo argument shows why privatisation in Europe has become such an unstoppable force. Across a broad range of industries - cars, telecommunications, computers, chemicals, energy - mergers and joint ventures are becoming essential. The reasons are various: recessionary pressure, the rising cost of R&amp;D, or - as in telecoms - the changes brought by deregulation. In each case, nationalised companies - awkward in their structure, doubtful in their motivation - tend not to get invited to the party. The message for them is a simple one: privatise or perish.</p>

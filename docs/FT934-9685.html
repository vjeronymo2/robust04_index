			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (17): Seamless service will cut waiting - Janina Stachura looks at trends in the car rental market IT MIGHT not be exactly a bargain basement sale, but for the cost-conscious business customer looking for a good car rental deal there is everything to play for in a fiercely competitive industry. This is a sector in which it probably costs less to hire a car than it does to rent a dinner suit for the evening. It is dominated in the UK business arena by six big league players - Avis, Europcar Inter-rent, Hertz, Budget and Eurodollar. The big boys have not shown to be wanting in an industry which has not avoided the bruising effects of recession as companies looking to cut costs have limited business travel. For the big corporate customer hiring a luxury Mercedes to the one-man band business person on a tight budget, all that is required is a little shopping around. Broadly speaking, the business car rental market is divided into domestic and international with three segments - the independent business traveller, small businesses and corporate customers - and special deals can be negotiated within each to suit individual requirements. Mr Neil Summerville, Budget's vice-president of franchise operations, says: 'In general, we have done our selling to most of the major business users. They have a pre-arranged deal before they get to the desk. 'Independent business users can benefit from our all-inclusive programme - there is something for them as well - even though they don't have the buying power of some big companies.' Rates cover more than rental. Additions offer anything from unlimited mileage and loss damage waiver to 24-hour cover by a motoring organisation in case of breakdown. Avis has a customer travel magazine with information varying from a guide to the dashboard of the particular car that you are driving to city and route maps. Hertz has an 'en route' service for some customers which includes driving directions, medical and legal help, regional tourist information and even weather and traffic conditions. Mr Stephen Jones, Hertz UK marketing director, says that the recession has served artificially to depress prices. 'Consequently we don't have a lot of scope in pricing terms and are seeking to be competitive in service terms, offering value-added services which are different from other companies. He says there has been a move toward what he describes as the integrated service concept with combined packages involving car rental companies, airlines and hoteliers. Alliances have been forged with airlines to offer a wide variety of services in addition to car rental to customers. Hertz UK, for example, has teamed up with British Airways to offer customers services ranging from the opportunity to get a free flight by collecting airmiles to their very own BA check-in counter at Hertz in Heathrow Airport. Avis has partnerships with more than a dozen airlines, including British Midland and Virgin Atlantic, to offer customers 'that little bit extra'. They can earn points towards airmiles, win an African safari or try a spot of ballooning. Mr Dale Morley, Avis UK director of sales and marketing, says links with airlines' loyalty programmes provide a range of benefits for passengers and have proved successful in the US. Avis has close ties with British Midland and Virgin. 'Across Europe there has been an increase in penetration of customers quoting loyalty programmes when they rent with us,' says Mr Morley. 'For the business traveller who has to make the journey anyway, it is attractive to find that he or she can earn airmiles not only from the airline but also from the car rental company and an affiliated hotel.' New technology has meant you can arrive at a location, see your name on an indicator board and just pick up your car without even having to see a piece of paper, let alone sign one. This seamless service has been made possible by specialist systems which are seen by some industry watchers to be the key to future success in the marketplace. Avis has invested as much as Dollars 1bn in a system whose heart is in the US. Known as Wizard, it has integrated reservation, rental and billing systems in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Europe. Mr Morley says: 'Nobody wants to wait for a car very long; the business renter wants to get into the car and drive away. The last thing he wants is to wait at a car rental counter. As an all-service provider we have to acknowledge this.' He sees new technology and the ability to turn it into service benefits and seamless service as the way ahead for the industry.</p>

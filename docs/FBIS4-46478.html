			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Capt 1st Rank (Ret) B. Makeyev: "Limiting </F> Antisubmarine Activity as a Factor of Strategic Stability"]    [Text] Limiting antisubmarine activity may be viewed as an  important part of the overall problem of finding ways to reduce  military activity in the world ocean. The end of the Cold War,  elimination of former conflicts between the East and the West,  and a number of other new factors bringing on positive shifts in  international relations are making inclusion of the naval  "component" in negotiation processes even more important.    There is no doubt that arms reduction and reinforcement of  mutual trust in military affairs must be comprehensive,  embracing all of their forms. In this aspect navies possessing  enormous firepower, mobility, independence, and a significant  ability to resist the enemy can in no way be an exception, all  the more so because in the last few decades they have become an  important means of offensive military activities, including  against objectives on land. If we ignore this, a shift of the  arms race to the sea would not be excluded. Not only might this  be an obstacle to lowering the overall military balance to the  level of defensive sufficiency desired by all, but it may also  act as a powerful destabilizing factor in this process. In this  case although unilateral steps to reduce the composition of the  fleets doubtlessly do limit the arms race at sea to a certain  degree, they cannot produce a decrease in the overall military  balance, and, consequently, strategic stability in the world. If  the state of the fleets is disregarded, such reductions will  actually be unsupervisable, and they will doubtlessly be  accompanied by a desire to improve naval forces qualitatively  and to raise their combat effectiveness. This is why the  inclusion of sea armament in the negotiation process together  with other forms of armament is an objective reality.    Considering the differences in the approaches to this  problem  in different countries, it would appear suitable to approach its  solution gradually, in stages. In this aspect I can propose  three stages of its resolution. First--creating and  strengthening measures of trust at sea, upon which both  collective and unilateral actions of the agreeing parties need  to be oriented. Their goal is to reduce the danger of military  confrontation and tension, and to avert conflicts resulting from  misinterpretation of one another's actions. While these are not  measures of real disarmament per se, and while they do not have  an effect on either the structure or the effective combat  strength of the fleets, they will nonetheless create a climate  of trust between states, and promote reinforcement of  international peace and security. These measures should include  agreements on preventing incidents at sea, on the creation of a  system of notification regarding major exercises and maneuvers,  on launchings of ICBMs and SLBMs, and on the concentration and  relocation of naval forces, and other measures that may  significantly reduce the probability of chance conflicts at sea.    In the second stage we need to reach agreement on measures  to  limit especially dangerous naval activities, and to reduce the  possibility of creating conditions for a surprise attack from  the sea and for initiation of offensive actions there of a major  scale. Prohibiting or limiting activities of naval forces in the  patrol zones of missile submarines, and later on in regions  where the greatest concentration of naval forces is observed  today, as well as in international shipping lanes, in fishing  zones and so on, should be included among such measures. In the  third and final stage we could raise the issue of balanced  reduction of the composition of fleet forces, with regard for  the effectiveness with which they can carry out offensive  missions in agreed regions.    Today, productive negotiations are being conducted only  within the framework of the first stage, as outlined above. As  for the second, I feel that it should begin with talks on  limiting antisubmarine activity.    It should be clarified here that antisubmarine activity is a  multifaceted concept. It penetrates into all aspects of naval  functions, and it is represented by an entire complex of  measures directed at detecting and destroying enemy submarines  with the purpose of preventing strikes by their missiles and  torpedoes against ships (vessels) and coastal objectives, and at  preventing them from carrying out reconnaissance, laying mines,  and carrying out other tasks. As we know, antisubmarine warfare  is accomplished by special antisubmarine forces and resources.    In this case, ship and aviation antisubmarine warfare [ASW]  forces rely upon extensive networks of permanently stationed  sonar systems, on space and air reconnaissance, and on command,  control and communication resources, which in their integration  make up a global system for monitoring the underwater situation  in vast regions of the world ocean.    Naturally, it would be hard to accept disturbance of any  links of this system, which ensures the safety of naval forces  and allows them to carry out their missions at sea effectively.  This is the principal argument offered by the American side  whenever the discussion turns to limiting antisubmarine  activity. However, there are links in this system, after all,  that can and must be viewed as objects in relation to which the  second stage of negotiations on reducing military activity at  sea should begin. I am referring to limiting antisubmarine  activity not in general, but only in regions of possible covert  patrolling by strategic submarine forces, which, together with  other strategic nuclear forces, are deterrent forces that  provide strategic stability and maintain a potential readiness  for a retaliatory nuclear strike against an aggressor.    It is fully understandable that the capability of these  forces for carrying out this mission depends not only and not so  much on parity of nuclear resources, regarding which the  corresponding agreements already exist, but also on their  ability to resist the enemy in the event of enemy actions. After  all, in a crisis one of the sides might use its ASW forces for  preemptive strikes against the other side's SSBNs in order to  achieve strategic superiority both for the purpose of military  and political pressure and in order to weaken a retaliatory  strike as much as possible.    It is precisely in order to exclude such a situation and to  increase survival of SSBNs, and ultimately to reinforce  strategic stability, that it appears suitable to prohibit search  operations in regions of possible combat patrols. In this case I  am not asking the sides to reveal the specific areas of combat  patrols by SSBNs: Keeping such areas secret is absolutely  natural, and disclosing them is even unsuitable from the  standpoint of raising their ability to resist the enemy in the  event that one of the sides violates agreements. What I am  asking for is to determine particular zones in the seas and  oceans where such regions may be located, and into which access  by ASW forces should be limited.    However, when we work out such measures of prohibition we  need to study a number of questions, the absence of answers to  which made such an initiative on the part of the USSR futile in  the past. Are such restrictions on antisubmarine activities  possible in the operational, technical, and legal aspects? Won't  they be detrimental to other antisubmarine missions carried out  by fleet forces? And finally, can compliance with such  restrictions be supervised?    It seems to me that negotiations on this subject are  possible  and suitable because they significantly fill in the omissions in  strategic arms reduction treaties. On the other, hand agreements  reached in this case would not preclude other antisubmarine  activities associated with defending warship formations,  transporters, assault landing detachments at sea, naval bases,  and so on. After all, the specific (unique) features of actions  to seek and destroy SSBNs in their patrol regions make it  possible to quickly distinguish them from other antisubmarine  activities, and, consequently, effective supervision over  compliance with agreements is possible.    In fact, in contrast to other missions of antisubmarine  defense, struggle with naval strategic nuclear weapon carriers  requires early deployment of forces for finding them and for  keeping them under observation in order to prevent a surprise  nuclear missile strike from the sea. Today, the possibility for  destroying missile submarines at the onset of war before they  launch their missiles has vitally important significance to both  of the warring sides. All subsequent actions at sea following a  missile launch, including actions against nuclear-powered  submarines, would not be able to prevent or even reduce the  damage suffered by the side that had lost the initiative and  allowed the enemy to purposefully employ his fighting potential,  no matter how effective these subsequent actions might be. On  the other hand, effective and timely strikes against missile  submarines are possible only when maneuvering naval forces  (aviation, surface ships, and submarines) interact efficiently  with reconnaissance forces (sonar, space, air, marine  radiotechnical etc.). This is why the actions of maneuvering ASW  forces are the subject of negotiations to limit antisubmarine  activities in regions of possible patrolling by SSBNs, and why  deployment of such forces in these regions would be limited.    In this case, there is no need for detailed examination of  the actions of these forces. Within the scope of the content and  the orientation of this article it will be sufficient to dwell  on the basic means of using ASW forces to reveal hostile  intentions against SSBNs, and, thus, illustrate the  possibilities of supervising compliance with an agreement. A  detailed examination of the specific issues regarding search  operations in regions of possible patrolling by SSBNs is a  matter for experts at negotiations. On our part, we will limit  ourselves to the most general forms and means of their actions  only for the purposes of illustration.    Shore-based patrol aviation occupies the most important  place  today in search operations against missile submarines. It  possesses high mobility and maneuverability, a large radius of  operations, a significant search potential, including by means  of the latest nontraditional detection resources, and it is less  dependent on weather conditions than ship-based ASW airplanes  and helicopters. Therefore, presence of shore-based airplanes in  the combat patrol regions of SSBNs is subject to strict  regulation. In addition, their activity depends on the surface  area of the region to be searched and on the particular search  resources employed in this case, and, consequently, it is rather  specific, and it cannot be lumped together with actions by ASW  airplanes carrying out other ASW missions.    Surface ships, which remain the principal antisubmarine  defense forces of carrier formations, convoys, and assault  landing detachments, can also be tasked to fight SSBNs. Sonar  stations equipped with low-frequency towed antennas of  considerable length, possessing a range of submarine detection  that is an order of magnitude greater than the operating range  of stations with onboard antennas, are now the preferred  resource for seeking SSBNs. In this case the nature of maneuver  of both lone ships and ship groups, including ones employing ASW  helicopters, and their appearance in stipulated regions for a  period of time greater than that needed for antisubmarine  support to the passage of ship detachments or formations,  provide the grounds for concluding such actions to be a  violation of agreements reached regarding the given region.    ASW submarines are one of the most effective and covert  resources for finding and destroying SSBNs in their regions of  maneuver. The modern polyfunctional sonar complexes they use,  which operate predominantly in passive modes in combination with  high-speed automated target classification and indication  systems, make such submarines the most dangerous enemy to SSBNs,  and a resource that is hardest of all to reveal in such a  region. But even their actions are distinguished by certain  specific features in this case, associated with the need for  lengthy shadowing of a detected submarine, for classifying it as  an SSBN, and so on. In addition, there are certain means of  monitoring their presence in a given region, implemented both by  the SSBN itself and by other naval forces supporting such  monitoring, which carry out such tasks with the needed  periodicity in different regions determined by agreement so as  not to reveal the specific patrol zone of the missile submarine.    In general, shadowing of a submarine by any maneuvering ASW  forces differs from observation and reconnaissance in the given  region in that they must maintain prolonged contact with the  submarine, with their weapons ready for immediate use. And,  although the means of such shadowing will vary (covert and  overt, continuous and discrete, by lone objects and their  groups, by homogeneous and heterogeneous forces), the specific  tactics and the nature of maneuver immediately reveal their  essence. They could of course be concealed by other actions of  ASW forces in contiguous zones and regions, but concentration  itself of these forces in a given zone is a major factor  disclosing the true intentions. Thus, these and a number of  other specific features of the activity of antisubmarine forces  searching for missiles submarines (the order of transfer of  contact from certain forces to others, the particular features  of radio exchange, build-up of these forces in a time of danger,  an so on), which we will not discuss here, make it possible not  to require, at negotiations, the total absence of ASW forces  from the indicated regions, which is not to the liking of the  American side today. The goal of an agreement must be their  quantitative restriction to a certain pre-established level. A  certain permissible probability of their detection of SSBNs in  the corresponding region may be used as a criterion of this  level.    This approach does, of course, require complex  justifications  accounting for the dimensions and the hydrometeorological  characteristics of the region, as well as the performance  characteristics and means of use of ASW forces. While this  approach should be based on state-of-the-art computerized  procedures, a simple procedure based on an algorithm  characterizing the probability of detection of a submarine in a  given region may be used for tentative and approximate  assessment of the maximum permissible strength of antisubmarine  forces in a certain region.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-023-16A>      Equation </FIG>    where d[.sub]det[/]--range of the detection equipment of  the ASW forces; V[.sub]_r_[/]--relative speed of ASW forces  searching for a missile submarine on patrol; n--number of units  of searching forces; t--time allocated to surveying the region;  S--area of surveyed region.    By some simple manipulations we get:   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-023-17A>      Equation </FIG>     Given certain assumptions, we can use this formula to  approximately determine the nature of the ASW forces  (homogeneous or heterogeneous) to be used in searching for SSBNs  in prescribed regions with a prescribed P[.sub]det[/], and,  consequently, introduce quantitative restrictions on  antisubmarine activity in regions in which naval strategic  forces may operate with the purpose of ensuring their ability to  resist the enemy. The calculation procedure might be as follows  in this case:    1. Determine the boundaries and total areas of prohibited  regions:    (S[.sub]1[/], S[.sub]2[/], S[.sub]3[/],  ...S[.sub]k[/]);    2. Determine the average ranges of detection resources  (d[.sub]det[/]), the searching speeds (V[.sub]ASW[/]) and  the time of operation of different ASW forces in each subregion  (t), in relation to specific hydrological and  hydrometeorological conditions of the region, and calculate  relative speeds V[.sub]_r_[/] with regard for the patrolling  speeds of the SSBNs;    3. Calculate the search potentials of ASW forces that may  operate in the given region: aviation--SP[.sub]av[/], surface  ships--SP[.sub]ss[/], submarines--SP[.sub]sub[/], using  the known approximate formula  SP[.sub]i[/]=D[.sub]deti[/]V[.sub]_r_i[/]. After this,  determine the overall search potential of ASW forces  (SP[.sub]total[/]) as the sum of the potential of all  participating forces;    4. Determine the areas of the zones of operation of  different  branches of ASW forces (aviation--S[.sub]av[/], surface  ships--S[.sub]ss[/], and submarines--S[.sub]sub[/]) in  proportion to the search potentials using the known formula    S[.sub]i[/]=S(SP[.sub]i[/]/SP[.sub]det[/]).    We assume with accuracy sufficient for tentative assessment  that ASW forces will interact only within the zones of their  operation in the search area;    5. Use formula (2) to calculate the number of units of  different ASW forces which may not be exceeded in the given  region. Because of difficulties in monitoring ASW submarines  stationed in the region, when the calculated quantity of other  ASW forces is present in the region, detection of just one  submarine there would have to be treated as the limit. Moreover,  vessels intended for long-range sonar reconnaissance would be  categorically prohibited from entering the region.    The listed features of the operations and quantitative  composition of ASW forces searching for SSBNs in a particular  region cannot go undetected. Therefore, the appearance of  unidentified submarines and of a certain number of ASW ships and  shore-based airplanes in this region, carrying out some or all  of the actions serving as indicators of SSBN search operations,  is sufficient grounds for the conclusion that the corresponding  side is violating agreements.    In conclusion, it should be noted that limiting  antisubmarine  operations, carried out by strategic deterrent forces, is legal  from the standpoint of international law, inasmuch as it raises  strategic stability at sea, it yields to control, and it does  not undermine the principles of antisubmarine defense provided  in all other spheres of naval activity. Reaching agreement on  this issue would be a substantial step on the road to also  limiting other forms of military activity in maritime regions in  support of the mutual state interests of the agreeing countries,  and, ultimately, it may open the road to the beginning of  productive negotiations on disarmament at sea. On the other  hand, stubborn rejection of this approach would be an indication  of a certain lack of interest in successfully resolving this  issue, which would then require implementation of other adequate  measures.

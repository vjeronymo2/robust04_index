			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Ukrainian Presidential Edict on 11 April 1994 Edicts No. </F> 33 and No. 34 by the President of the Crimean Republic" issued  in Kiev on 14 April]    [Text] On 11 April 1994, the president of the Crimean  Republic issued Edict No. 33 appointing V.M. Lepikhov as acting  chairman of the Security Service of the Crimean Republic and  Edict No. 34 in accordance with which the powers of acting  chairman of the Security Service of the Crimean Republic I.F.  Kolomytsev were suspended.    The aforementioned edicts are at variance with the Ukrainian  Constitution (Article 75-1) and Ukrainian laws.

Proceeding from this and in accordance with clause 7-2 of  Article 114-5 of the Ukrainian Constitution, I resolve as  follows:    1. To cancel 22 April 1994 Crimean presidential edicts No.  33  "On the Acting Chairman of the Security Service of the Crimean  Republic" and No. 34 "On Suspending the Powers of Acting  Chairman of the Security Service of the Crimean Republic" as  such that are at variance with the Ukrainian Constitution and  Ukrainian laws "On the Division of Powers Among the Bodies of  State Power of Ukraine and the Crimean Republic" and "On  Ukraine's Security Service."    2. This edicts becomes effective on the day of its signing.    [Signed] Ukrainian President L. Kravchuk    [Dated] Kiev, 14 Apr 1994</p>

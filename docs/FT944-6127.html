			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / International Company News: Authorities clear Union Pacific bid for Santa Fe Union Pacific, one of the seven biggest US railways, yesterday appeared to be heading for victory with its Dollars 3.2bn hostile takeover bid for Santa Fe Pacific, another of the big seven railway companies, after the federal regulatory authorities removed Santa Fe's main objection to the offer, writes Richard Tomkins in New York. The Interstate Commerce Commission, which regulates mergers in the US railways industry, said it was prepared to accept Union Pacific's plan to buy Santa Fe's shares immediately and put them in an independent trust pending the ICC's consideration of the takeover. Earlier Santa Fe had rejected Union Pacific's bid, saying it was not clear whether the ICC would accept the trust arrangement. The ICC's decision puts Union Pacific at an advantage over Burlington Northern, the friendly bidder for Santa Fe, because Burlington's agreed Dollars 3bn bid would not take effect unless and until it had received ICC clearance - a process that could take a year or more. Santa Fe yesterday declared a two-week postponement of the shareholder vote on the merger with Burlington Northern, announcing a new date of December 16.</p>

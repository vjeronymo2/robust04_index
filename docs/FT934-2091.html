			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / International Bonds: US investors indulge in Argentine tastes A seemingly insatiable appetite among US investors for Argentine bonds ensured a successful debut yesterday for Transportadora de Gas del Sur (TGS), Argentina's largest transporter of natural gas. Lead manager Lehman Brothers said that TGS's Dollars 200m offering of five-year Eurobonds was two times oversubscribed and that 60 per cent of the bonds were sold into the US. The remaining 40 per cent was placed in Europe and Asia. Last week, strong demand from US investors, confident that the Republic of Argentina would achieve an investment-grade rating before too long, enabled the sovereign borrower to increase the size of its first offering of global bonds to Dollars 1bn from Dollars 750m. The strength of the demand also permitted Argentina to further tighten the yield spread which it pays over government bonds, thereby establishing a new benchmark for other Argentine borrowers raising funds internationally. TGS's bonds were priced to yield 270 basis points over US treasuries which, according to Lehman Brothers, represented a spread of 20 basis points over the five-year area of the new yield curve for Argentine sovereign debt in the international bond market. When the bonds were freed to trade, they rose to par bid from a launch price of 99.70. They later settled at 99 7/8 , giving a spread of 266 basis points. Syndicate managers expect a few more offerings from Latin American borrowers to emerge before the Eurobond market closes down for Christmas. Petrobras, the Brazilian state-owned oil company, is expected to launch its first Eurobond offering denominated in yen later this week. The three-year deal, via Nomura, is expected to set a new record for a Euroyen issue by a Latin American borrower. The largest deal to date is a Y20bn (Dollars 183m) three-year offering by Telebras, Brazil's state-owned telecommunications holding company, which was launched in late October. At the launch, Telebras's bonds were priced to yield 445 basis points over the No 91 Japanese government bond but the spread has since tightened to 421 basis points. Syndicate managers said the current spread on Telebras's bonds would be taken into account during the pricing of Petrobras's bonds. Elsewhere, investors continued to digest the terms of Fisons' offer to exchange its recent Pounds 100m offering of 10-year Eurobonds for a new offering of five-year Eurobonds in the wake of the company's restructuring plans. The amount of Fisons' public debt outstanding would not change as a result of the offer.</p>

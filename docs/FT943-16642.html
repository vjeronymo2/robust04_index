			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Chapter 11-style scheme proposed for insolvent states Mr Jeffrey Sachs, the former economic adviser to the Russian government, has called for a new system for dealing with country insolvency, based on the Chapter 11 bankruptcy code used in the US. Speaking at a Centre for Economic Performance symposium at the London School of Economics, Mr Sachs said the International Monetary Fund had 'become an institution that has unfortunately become set in ways that made sense in the 1950s but are inappropriate for the 1990s'. The IMF lacks a conceptual framework for state insolvency, said Mr Sachs, who has long been an outspoken critic of the IMF. The Chapter 11 system, by creating a standstill on debtors, gives a critical breathing period to companies, enabling them to sort out their problems, and prevents a 'creditor grab race' whereby assets are quickly seized. 'The IMF needs to be moved in the direction of acting as a bankruptcy referee or judge rather than as a lender in financial distress,' said Mr Sachs. He thought the mechanisms to achieve a debt standstill could be achieved under existing treaties, but a new economic conference to establish such procedures might be needed. Mr Sachs also criticised the IMF for favouring free-floating currencies, rather than nominal exchange rate targets and for concentrating on balance of payments financing needs, rather than on the financial problems of the indebted governments themselves.</p>

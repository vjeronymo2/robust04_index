			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Attendance at such meetings, however, intrudes into the attorney-client relationship and impairs the right of the defendant to a fair trial. Accordingly, this section provides that undercover agents or cooperating witnesses may participate in such meetings, but only when requested to do so by the defense and when reasonably necessary to protect their safety or life, or the confidentiality of an undercover operation. See Weatherford, 429 U.S. at 557 (informant went to meeting ``not to spy, but because he was asked and because the State was interested in retaining his undercover services on other matters and it was therefore necessary to avoid raising the suspicion that he was in fact the informant whose existence [the defendant and his counsel] already suspected'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, even when an undercover operative's attendance at such a meeting is authorized to protect his or her cover and safety, any information acquired regarding lawful defense strategy or trial preparation may not be communicated to government attorneys or otherwise used to the substantial detriment of the represented party. See Weatherford, 429 U.S. at 558; Ginsberg, 758 F.2d at 833; Mastroianni, 749 F.2d at 906. As a safeguard, this rule provides that such information should not be communicated to the attorneys for the government or law enforcement agents who are participating in the trial of the pending criminal charges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When there is reasonable cause to believe that the purpose of the meeting is not the lawful defense of the underlying charges, but the commission of a new or additional crime (such as bribery of a witness or subordination of perjury), attendance by informants or undercover agents at attorney-client meetings is permissible pursuant to &sect;77.6(e). The belief, however, must be based on reasonable cause, not mere suspicion or conjecture. See Mastroianni, 749 F.2d at 906. Furthermore, the prohibition against communication of lawful defense strategy to the prosecution should be observed if, in fact, such strategy is imparted to the informant or agent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Government attorneys should give serious consideration to the extreme sensitivity of permitting agent and informant attendance at defense meetings. Agents and informants should be instructed to avoid participating in such meetings, and to minimize their participation when attendance is required, if it is possible to do so without arousing suspicion. Agents or witnesses who attend defense meetings should also be instructed to avoid taking any role in the shaping of defense strategy or trial preparations. Finally, agents and informants should be instructed to avoid imparting defense strategy or trial preparation information to any other law enforcement officials if reasonably feasible to do so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, this restriction applies only to law enforcement officials and cooperating witnesses who are acting as ``agents for the government'' at the time of the communication. If one of several co-defendants who attended an attorney-client defense strategy meeting later testifies for the government at trial, no violation will have occurred as long as the co-defendant was not a government agent at the time of the meeting.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Brugman,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 655 F.2d 540, 545&hyph;46 (4th Cir. 1981).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 77.10&blank;Organizations and Employees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section is similar in structure to &sect;77.13 of the previously published proposal. However, it includes several substantive changes based on comments received during earlier comment periods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The issue addressed by this section_when should a communication with an employee or member of a represented organization be considered a communication with the organization itself_is one of the most difficult issues addressed by these regulations. It was also perhaps the most commented upon provision during the comment period. Several federal prosecutors commented that they regularly encounter attorneys who assert that they represent every individual in a large corporation or organization. Others stated that these blanket claims of representation extend to all the former employees as well. These prosecutors argued for a bright line rule to prevent such abuse and generally commented favorably on the earlier proposal. Others argued that the earlier proposal was too narrow in scope and would deprive corporations and other organizations of the effective assistance of counsel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department believes that this section, and particularly the definition of ``controlling individual'' in &sect;77.10(a), strikes an appropriate balance, one that ensures government attorneys the ability to enforce federal law, while preserving the opportunity for corporations and other organizations to secure effective assistance of counsel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (a): Communications With Current Employees; Organizational Representation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This paragraph states that a communication with a current employee of an organizational party or person should be treated as a communication with the organization for purposes of this part only if the employee is a controlling individual. If a communication with a current employee is considered to be a communication with a represented organization under these rules (that is, if the communication is with a controlling individual), then that communication is subject to the same limitations that would apply if the communication were directly with the represented organization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accord with the basic structure of this part, which distinguishes between represented parties and represented persons, this paragraph effectively provides that when an organization is a represented party, an attorney for the government shall not communicate, or cause another to communicate (subject to the exceptions enumerated in &sect;77.6), with any controlling individual of the organization without the consent of the organization's attorney. In contrast, when an organization qualifies as a represented person, an attorney for the government may communicate, or cause another to communicate, with any controlling individual if the communication does not involve negotiations of a plea agreement, settlement, statutory or non-statutory immunity agreement, or other disposition of actual or potential criminal charges or civil enforcement claims, or sentences or penalties, as prohibited by &sect;77.8, and if the communication does not violate the provisions of &sect;77.9.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

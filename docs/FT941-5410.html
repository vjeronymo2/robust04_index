			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Challenge from the periphery - Case Study: GM / A Hungarian auto plant that sets quality standards for the west Szentgotthard in western Hungary is a strategic crossing point for the flux of products, capital and ideas streaming across the widening European market. This unprepossessing town close to the Austrian border was sealed off before 1989 by the cold war insignia of barbed wire and watch towers. Now it is a test-bed for western manufacturing techniques. In a Dollars 250m plant in the shell of a communist-built farm equipment factory, General Motors has been assembling cars and engines since 1992. GM has profited from a five-year tax holiday and a Dollars 25m Hungarian investment grant. Other motor groups with footholds in Hungary include Suzuki, Ford and Audi. By setting new standards for low-cost production with up-to-date technology, such investments are helping spur the cross-border rationalisation and cost-cutting that are potent realities of the European market. Mr Ernst Hofmann, the moustachioed 63-year-old managing director of General Motors Hungary, describes how GM has designated Szentgotthard-produced engines as a quality benchmark throughout the group. Mr Hofmann - a veteran production specialist from GM's Opel subsidiary in Germany - praises the '100 per cent flexibility' of his 480-strong Hungarian workforce. Productivity and quality are at least as high as in comparable west European plants, he says. The Hungarian factory has a bearing on GM's larger plants in western Europe. 'We are competition for decision-making in the west.' At the equivalent of DM300 a month, workers at the factory earn one-eighth of the pay of those in GM's west German car plants. The GM assembly plant this year should produce about 11,000 Astra Opel hatchback cars and 140,000 engines, assembled from knock-down kits from west Germany. Labour accounts for less than 10 per cent of total costs, with materials making up 80 per cent. The share of local Hungarian production is about 10 per cent. Mr Hofmann believes this could eventually rise to 30 per cent as Hungarian component producers increase production. Last year, the plant exported 3,500 cars out of its 13,400 production - an uneconomic exercise at present, in view of the high cost of transporting components to Hungary. At least until 1996, the car plant is likely to operate at below its 15,000 per year capacity. By contrast, the engine plant is planned by end-1994 to be operating at full capacity of 200,000 engines per year. By introducing an extra shift, Mr Hofmann reckons Szentgotthard's capacity could be doubled with little extra investment. The importance of this plant and others like it in eastern Europe is far greater than their small size. West European car-makers will have to fight hard to beat the east European challenge.</p>

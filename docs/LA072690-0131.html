			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE PANEL OKS ANTI-BIAS BILL OPPOSED BY BUSH  </P> <P> The House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday approved a major civil rights bill  to curb job discrimination and brushed aside Bush Administration warnings that  the legislation will lead to hiring quotas.  </P> <P> "We did not bring forth a bill that will lead to quotas or any danger of  quotas," Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose), the bill's sponsor, said before the  panel approved the measure, 24 to 12.  </P> <P> Civil rights forces are pushing for floor action on the bill as early as next  week. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) said last week that a floor vote  would not be held until after lawmakers return from their August recess.  </P> <P> By wide margins, committee Democrats beat back Republican-sponsored amendments  designed to limit damages that courts may award to victims of discrimination  and to tighten the rules governing fair-hiring lawsuits.  </P> <P> The bill, which tops the civil rights movement's legislative agenda, would  effectively reverse five Supreme Court decisions from last year. Provisions  range from a ban on racial harassment in the workplace to punitive damages for  discrimination victims in extreme cases.  </P> <P> The most controversial provision was designed to reverse a Supreme Court ruling  that favors companies in certain discrimination lawsuits.  </P> <P> Until last year, companies could win such suits if they proved that the  employment practices leading to the disparity were required by "business  necessity." The new ruling makes it easier for employers, placing on those  filing suit the burden of proving that the practices in question are not  business necessities.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration and a number of businesses object that the bill's  definition of business necessity combined with provisions for damages will lead  to a jump in discrimination lawsuits by lawyers eager to share in court  judgments.  </P> <P> The critics say that companies will adopt the practice of hiring by racial and  ethnic quotas as a means of insulating themselves from such lawsuits.  </P> <P> "This should really be called the plaintiffs' lawyers' full employment act of  1990," Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.) told the committee.  </P> <P> Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), a supporter of the bill, conceded that "there are  horror stories about over-enforcement" of similar laws but added that such  instances were rare and those intent on discriminating found ways to get away  with it.  </P> <P> "The advantage is overwhelmingly with the sophisticated bigot," he said.  </P></p>

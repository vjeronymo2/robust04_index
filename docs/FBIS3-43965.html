All those who delay in joining it or who  fail to join will be left behind. In accordance with President  Mobutu's decree, endorsing the wish expressed by the political  class during the Palais du Peuple consultations, an  extraordinary session of the High Council of the Republic,  Transitional Parliament, was officially opened at 1600 at the  Palais du Peuple today. The first session was devoted to the  registration of the members and the management of the new  Parliament. It must be pointed out that the political class'  decision to have Monsignor Laurent Monsengwo chair the High  Council of the Republic, Transitional Parliament -- beginning  from the next session -- was unanimously approved. Proceedings  are to resume at 1500 at the Palais du Peuple on 20 January.  All members of the High Council, Transitional Parliament are  requested to attend the meeting. Toum Bamba Toulou has just  arrived from the Palais du Peuple and gives us further details:    [Begin Toulou recording] The atmosphere at the Palais du  Peuple was good. Mr. Moulenda Loutoula, parliamentary secretary  general, chaired the inaugural session of the High Council of  the Republic, Transitional Parliament. There were almost 400  members from the defunct National Assembly, the defunct High  Council of the Transition, which was set up following the  Sovereign National Conference. Negotiators from the two  political groups -- the Political Forces of the Conclave, as  well as the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition and Allied  Groups -- who worked arduously to obtain the protocol agreement  which will govern the transitional period, were also present.    There are three items on the agenda of this extraordinary  session, which should not exceed 15 days. As of tomorrow, the  session will be chaired by Monsignor Monsengwo, chairman of High  Council of the Republic, Transitional Parliament in accordance  with the spirit of the accord. First, there will be the  internal organization of the Parliament, that is, the  examination and ratification of the mandate of the members, then  the drawing up and adoption of internal regulations, the  election of the final executive bureau, and the setting up of  working commissions. The honorable councillors will also set up  and adopt the constitutional act for the transitional period.  The last item will be the election of the person who will head  the final transitional government. All the items on the agenda  are important, but the one concerning the election of the prime  minister is very delicate. This is why we are repeating our  call that there must be good will, clearheadedness, and moral  and intellectual sincerity from all sides so that a judicious  and conscientious choice for the prime minister will be made.

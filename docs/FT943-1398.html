			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Complicated pensions solvency requirements a waste of time Sir, You report, 'Workers at Swan Hunter face cut in pensions' (September 20), that the Swan Hunter pension scheme is technically solvent, yet can cover only 60 per cent of its members' pensions. Under the government's current proposals, this would have meant Swan Hunter being required to put many millions of pounds into the scheme within a three-month period - probably impossible for a company in such dire straits. No amount of legislation is going to make a financially unsound employer put money into a pension scheme, and the sooner the government recognises this the better. Then it can get on with the real job of drafting clear and simple requirements for employers to tell employees when their pension scheme is going awry. The government should stop wasting taxpayers' money in trying to design complicated solvency requirements that will at best be useless and at worst be damaging in terms of increased pension costs, following what will effectively be government-dictated investment policy as clearly explained by Barry Riley ('New benchmark worries UK pension funds', September 21). H R Wynne-Griffith, partner, Barnett Waddington &amp; Co, 11 Tufton Street, London SW1</p>

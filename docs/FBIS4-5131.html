			<p>BFN     [Text] Bandung, REPUBLIKA -- The Nusantara Aircraft  Industry Company Limited [PT IPTN] has handed over another  CN-235 aircraft to the Indonesian Air Force. The CN-235  aircraft manufactured by PT IPTN was the fourth of the six  aircraft ordered by the Department of Defense and Security of  the Republic of Indonesia as part of a contract for the  realization of its third strategic plan.    A simple transfer ceremony was held at a hangar of the PT  IPTN Production Area II in Bandung on Friday (25 March). The  transfer documents were signed by Ir. [academic title] Hari  Laksono representing the president director of PT IPTN and Major  General I Made Sadha A.R., master of economics, director general  for services of the Department of Defense and Security, who  represented the commander of the Armed Forces of the Republic of  Indonesia [ABRI]. The Department of Defense and Security will  later hand over the aircraft to the Indonesian Air Force. The  documents were also signed by Commodore Sugiarto, deputy chief  of the Air Force for personnel affairs.    The transfer is part of the contract for the realization of  the third strategic plan, which was signed by the minister of  state for research and technology and concurrently president  director of PT IPTN and the minister of defense and security in  Jakarta in March 1988. The contract covers the purchase by the  Department of Defense and Security of six CN-235 aircraft from  PT IPTN -- two units used to transport paratroopers,  two units of the low altitude parachute extraction system  or LAPES type, and two units used for medical  evacuation or medevac.    The two paratrooper units were handed over by PT  IPTN to the Department of Defense and Security in January 1993.  One LAPES-typed unit was handed over to the department in  December 1993.    With the transfer of the other LAPES-typed unit on Friday  (25  March), only two medevac-typed units which are undergoing  finishing touches are yet to be handed over to the department.  The two remaining units are scheduled to be personally handed  over by Prof. Dr. B.J. Habibie, president director of PT IPTN,  to Armed Forces Commander General Feisal Tanjung in June 1994.    The aircraft, which have been handed over to the department,  are specifically designed for ABRI operations. The Indonesian  Air Force can rely on the capability and agility of the aircraft  to carry out its major duties. For example, a  paratrooper unit is superior because it can  simultaneously transport military personnel and drop them in a  designated terrain.</p>

			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOY PILOT LANDS IN MOSCOW AFTER TIME OFF COURSE  </P> <P> Eleven-year-old Tony Aliengena arrived to a welcome from enthusiastic Soviet  schoolchildren and curious airline pilots at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport  Monday after a blunder by his on-board Soviet navigator sent him briefly off  course.  </P> <P> The mistake happened while Tony was on approach to the Moscow airport following  a 400-mile flight from Leningrad, his father, Gary Aliengena, said. The  navigator, who boarded Tony's plane in Leningrad, provided an erroneous course  heading for the Moscow airport, sending the child aviator from San Juan  Capistrano in the wrong direction for about half an hour, Aliengena said.  </P> <P> After discovering the error, the navigator righted the course, said Aliengena,  who laughed off the incident.  </P> <P> "It's one of those things," Aliengena said at his Moscow hotel room, where  Tony, his parents and sister were lodged for the five-day stay here. Other  members of the entourage, however, arrived to find no hotel accommodations.  </P> <P> The 2 1/2-hour flight -- Tony's first full day of flying through the Soviet  Union -- proved otherwise uneventful. After detouring around some  thunderstorms, Tony landed his father's red, white and blue Cessna 210  Centurion amid heavy media fanfare.  </P> <P> Awaiting Tony's single-engine plane were about 75 people including a large  contingent of Soviet journalists and Moscow children wearing school uniforms.  After Tony emerged from the cockpit and stretched, he practiced a Soviet  tradition that follows a safe landing: taking a chunk of bread offered to him  on the runway apron, dipping it in salt and eating it.  </P> <P> Recording the event was a media crowd so large that even press-savvy Aliengena  was surprised.  </P> <P> "In my life I've never seen so many cameras," Aliengena said.  </P> <P> While the Aliengena family retired to their hotel in high spirits, events were  developing that could put a damper on Tony's round-the-world trip.  </P> <P> Foremost was a growing indication that Tony will not get the long-sought  meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, to whom he planned to present  a friendship scroll bearing good-will signatures from more than 250,000 U.S.  schoolchildren. Instead, it seemed likely that Gorbachev would be kept busy all  week presiding over the session of the Supreme Soviet, said Sergei Tchermeykh,  an official of the Ministry of Civil Aviation whose 10-year-old son Roman is  accompanying Tony around the world.  </P> <P> Tchermeykh said Tony may have to present the scroll to one of Gorbachev's top  assistants, a meeting tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.  </P> <P> "If he (Gorbachev) is free, he will will meet with him," said Tchermeykh, who  was among those who turned out to greet the plane. "But I personally doubt it."  </P> <P> Tchermeykh Monday also provided some sobering insight on the rigors of the  7,000-mile Soviet leg of Tony's trip. He said Tony and his entourage would face  formidable aviation problems while traveling into the sparsely settled  countryside in the Soviet far east.  </P> <P> The biggest problem, he said, will be the inability of almost all air-traffic  controllers in Siberia and the east to speak English. Tony will have to depend  solely on his on-board Soviet navigator, who also could have problems finding  his way because there is little radar coverage in the vast terrain through  which Tony will travel, Tchermeykh said.  </P> <P> Tony also faces the daunting challenge of traversing a high range of mountains  in the Soviet far east through which no small plane has ever flown, Tchermeykh  said.  </P> <P> "It is a very difficult project," said Tchermeykh, who plans to accompany Tony  on the trip. "But I think and say it is possible."  </P> <P> A more pressing difficulty confronted the nine Americans in Tony's entourage  when they arrived in Moscow only to discover none had hotel reservations. The  Americans had been told that the reservations had been made by the Soviet  Foundation for Social Invention, an agency which is sponsoring Tony's trip  through the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Foundation representatives instead hustled the weary and confused Americans  aboard a bus and parceled them out to the homes of various Moscow residents who  volunteered their help.  </P> <P> The lack of accommodations angered some of the Americans, and the anger boiled  over when a foundation representative began collecting passports and visas from  the group.  </P> <P> "I don't know where I'm going, I don't know what I'm doing, and now you take my  passport," Julia Roberson, a member of a Los Angeles-based film crew  accompanying Tony, snapped at one of the foundation representatives.  </P> <P> Foundation officials said they would try to place Americans at local hotels for  the rest of the week. In the meantime, they are staying with people such as  Arthur Bouchara, a 23-year-old postgraduate student who opened his one-bedroom  apartment in suburban Moscow to this reporter and his wife.  </P> <P> "This is unexpected from me because I learned about you only two hours ago,"  said Bouchara. Like many of the other host families, Bouchara is a member of  the Moscow World Family Club, a group devoted to facilitating international  exchanges.  </P> <P> And like the other hosts, Bouchara seemed thrilled to share his home.  </P> <P> "It is good that you come from your home in America to our home here to see how  we live. We are very honored to have you," he said in English at his mother's  apartment next door, where she prepared a hearty meal of beef, potatoes and  salad for her hungry guests.  </P> <P> Later this week in Moscow, Tony will be putting on public display a Soviet  friendship scroll that he was given in Leningrad to carry across the country.  Between 150 and 200 children in Leningrad already have signed the scroll, which  is to be presented to President Bush upon Tony's return to the United States.  </P> <P> Tony is scheduled to resume his trip Saturday morning with a flight to  Kuibyshev.  </P> <P> FLIGHT LOG -- Part II, Page 2  </P></p>

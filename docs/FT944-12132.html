			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / German holiday ruling Germany's federal cartel office yesterday recommended that two of the country's largest holiday agencies be prevented from having the exclusive right to block book rooms in 15 Spanish hotels because it hinders competition. Touristic Union International (TUI) and NUR Touristic said they would fight the decision. The cartel office's recommendations follow complaints by other German travel agencies that TUI and NUR had stifled competition in the Canary and Balearic Islands last year by block-booking hotel beds for almost the entire season. Alltours, a German-based agency, said it had been impossible to reserve rooms even in other hotels because of the prices offered by TUI and NUR, which they claimed were beyond what it could offer. The cartel office recommendation coincides with a surge of renewed German interest in Spain, and in the islands particularly. This is because tens of thousands of holiday-makers switched their vacations from Turkey after attacks on Germans in the region.</p>

			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Cook attacks Tories over funding THE Conservative party is being funded increasingly from undisclosed individual and overseas donations rather than declared corporate donations, a Labour Research Department survey suggests today. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said there was a Pounds 15m 'credibility gap' between the donations declared by British companies and the donations the Tories admitted receiving. An analysis of 5,000 published company accounts traced only Pounds 3.7m given to the Tory party in the run-up to the 1992 general election compared with total donations of just over Pounds 19m declared in Conservative party accounts. The difference of more than Pounds 15m was almost certainly accounted for by gifts from overseas and from individuals. A similar survey before the 1987 election showed a gap of about Pounds 8m between donations received and donations disclosed by companies. The survey will fuel calls from opposition parties and from some within Conservative ranks for the publication of more information on Tory party finances. The party has already said it will publish a balance sheet this year for the first time, but has no plans to list individual donations. The survey comes as Sir Norman Fowler, Tory chairman, gives evidence today to a Commons' home affairs committee inquiry into the funding of political parties. Sir Norman is expected to be quizzed on donations to the Conservative party from Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman. The Labour Research Department found a steep fall - by 188 to 240 - in the number of companies giving to the Tory party bfore the 1992 general election compared with 1987, reflecting the depth of the recession and disquiet about government policies. Companies must by law declare donations of Pounds 200 or more. The biggest corporate donors in 1992-93 were United Biscuits (Pounds 130,000), and Taylor Woodrow (Pounds 124,500). The Conservatives were urged by Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, to agree to a 'charter for political parties' that would commit them to refusing donations from foreign individuals, companies or governments. Under the charter, campaign spending would be limited, donations above a certain level would have to be disclosed and parties would have to publish full audited accounts.</p>

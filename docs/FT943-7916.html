			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Clinton orders ban on Cuban refugees: White House drops 30-year-old policy of preferential treatment to try to 'demagnetise' US President Bill Clinton yesterday ordered that illegal refugees from Cuba should not be allowed to enter the US, and that US citizens who tried to help them at sea would be prosecuted. At a news conference to explain his administration's about-turn in policy towards Cuban refugees, Mr Clinton said Cubans picked up in international waters would be taken to Guantanamo Bay, the US military enclave on the island of Cuba, just as refugees from Haiti are. Abruptly reversing 30 years of preferential treatment for Cuban refugees, administration officials said they wanted to 'demagnetise' the US and deter people from attempting the dangerous sea crossing to escape from the regime of President Fidel Castro. Mr Clinton harshly criticised Mr Castro for attempting 'to export to the US the political and economic crisis he has created in Cuba'. Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, said the move was intended to 'keep people from taking to the seas in unseaworthy vessels in dangerous circumstances'. 'Cubans should know that as of now no Cubans picked up by the Coast Guard will be brought to the US,' she said. Cubans have always been afforded special immigration treatment because of the US's long ideological feud with their communist government. But the policy has exposed successive administrations to charges of double standards and racism, since poorer and blacker Haitians faced much harsher treatment. Mr Clinton criticised his predecessor, President George Bush, for his policy of returning Haitian boat people to their country, but then adopted it himself when he took office. He has wrestled with the problem ever since, and has yet to find a satisfactory solution. While a law passed in 1966 forbids the administration to return Cubans to their island, it does not prohibit their detention in camps such as Guantanamo. 'Certainly Cuban refugees will be treated humanely, and those who have legitimate fears of political persecution can apply for refugee status through the in-country system in Havana,' Ms Myers said. Ms Myers said yesterday that Mr Clinton had made clear that 'one, Fidel Castro will not dictate immigration policy here in the United States, and two, the president will not permit a repeat of the 1980 Mariel boatlift', when more than 100,000 Cubans fled the island in a matter of months. After Attorney General Janet Reno, who oversees the immigration services, announced the change of policy on Thursday night, Governor Lawton Chiles of Florida welcomed the new policy. 'It allows us to make sure these people get the proper health screening, that other screening is done . . . right now, we don't know who is coming in,' he said. Mr Chiles says his state has been overwhelmed with the influx of refugees, and had asked the president to declare a state of emergency.</p>

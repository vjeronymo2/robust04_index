			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video on DPRK President Kim Il- </F> song's news conference with foreign reporters at the Kumsusan  Assembly Hall in Pyongyang on 16 April; Kim's remarks in Korean  are translated from Japanese subtitles]    [Text] North Korean President Kim Il-song held a news  conference today with a group of foreign reporters, including  members of the NHK. In the news conference, President Kim  Il-song commented on North Korean nuclear facilities, where the  DPRK is suspected of developing nuclear weapons, and said that  no country is making its military facilities open to the general  public. In this way, he stressed again that the DPRK has no  intention to accept inspections by the International Atomic  Energy Agency.    The news conference was held at the Kumsusan Assembly Hall,  where President Kim Il-song's presidential office is located,  for nearly three hours starting at 1000 [0100 GMT] this morning.    [Begin Kim Il-song recording] We have nothing to hide at  all. We have no secrets. However, we have military secrets. It  is normal for every country to hide its military matters. We  will make everything, except for the military matters, open to  the general public. [end recording]    In this way, President Kim Il-song stressed again that the  DPRK has no intention to accept inspections of the two  facilities in Yongbyon, which are main targets of the nuclear  suspicion. Moreover, President Kim Il-song said: We have been  saying that we have neither the intention nor the capability of  building nuclear weapons. It is unlikely that we will ever own  nuclear weapons.    In this way, he denied the suspected nuclear weapons  development. On the other hand, President Kim Il-song repeatedly  said that he hopes to visit the United States someday.    [Begin Kim Il-song recording] Although I have never been to  the United States, I think a day will come for me to go there.  [ends recording]    This was the first time for President Kim Il-song to  disclose  his hope to visit the United States.    [Begin recording by an unidentified NHK reporter in  Pyongyang] President Kim Il-song gave us very strong  impressions. One of them is the fact that he looked very  healthy. Although he is 82 years old, he energetically spoke  for three hours and ate well. He did not look tired at all. In  response to a question what he will do when he goes to the  United States, the president said: I have nothing to learn from  the United States because I am not young anymore. However, I  would like to go fishing and hunting. It will be a fruitful  visit in many respects.    International attention is focused on how President Kim  Il-song will settle the difficult situation. [end recording]</p>

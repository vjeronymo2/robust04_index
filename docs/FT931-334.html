			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Survey of the Republic of Slovenia (7): Lasko is reaching out - A look at one of Europe's biggest breweries, now seeking international markets LOCATED in a town of 5,000 inhabitants in the hills of eastern Slovenia, the Lasko brewery is one of Europe's biggest. Though it is seeking international markets, it is definitely not looking for foreign investment. 'We need to break into markets abroad. But we are in search of sales, not foreign investment,' emphasises Mr Franci Jontes, marketing director of the brewery. He and his colleagues fear that foreign competitors may try to buy out the brewery - but only to close it down. It would not be the first time this has happened since Lasko was founded in 1825. 'A German cartel bought out the shares and shut the brewery in 1927; we do not want to repeat the experience,' he says. 'Local entrepreneurs rescued Lasko, which resumed production in 1938. But the Germans took over the factory during the second world war. A joint Allied bombardment hit the nearby railway bridge but also razed the brewery towards the end of the war,' says Mr Gorast Setina, the public relations manager. Confident that the black and gold label Zlatorog beer ranks among Europe's finest, Mr Jontes is hoping to boost foreign sales. Slovenia's 2m citizens are fond of Lasko beer, but they cannot possibly drink more than a fraction of the 2.5m hectolitres (about 55m gallons) which the riverside brewery is capable of producing every year. Most of it used to be sold to former Yugoslavia, particularly Croatia whose Adriatic coast attracted millions of thirsty tourists before the war. Lasko has been through trying times, but Mr Jontes admits the past few years have been among the toughest. The brewery is still reeling from the loss of its Yugoslav markets since 1991. 'Overnight, our sales dropped by 45 per cent,' he says. Croatia, Slovenia's southern neighbour, accounted for 41 per cent of total sales in 1990, but only 7 per cent last year. Sales to Croatia stopped completely for six months after October 1991, when Slovenia introduced its new currency, the tolar. Lasko was forced to cut costs, sacking 140 workers. Mr Jontes believes the current labour force of 480 will be reduced by another 25 per cent over the next three years. He cites high customs duties to neighbouring Austria and Italy as a major obstacle to bolstering sales. 'We need reciprocal customs duties. In Ljubljana, you can buy Goesser, a popular Austrian beer, as readily as Lasko. Goesser pays 37 per cent customs duty but we must pay 60 per cent to sell our beer on their markets,' he complains. Like many Slovene exporters, Mr Jontes believes the exchange rate of the national currency makes his job more difficult. 'It does not pay to sell our product below a certain price. But inflation and the strong tolar cut into earnings.' Product recognition is also a problem. Mr Jontes says Lasko is working with Charlemagne Strategies, a London-based marketing firm, to help break into UK and other markets. Exports accounted for 11 per cent of total sales in 1991, of which Croatia, Italy and Austria were the biggest markets. He says Lasko recorded a profit of DM4m in 1992. But the drop in sales has forced Lasko to cut production. Last year the brewery produced 1.4m hectolitres, less than 60 per cent of capacity. Lasko's managers are strongly opposed to foreign ownership. The brewery is still socially-owned, which means that the workers own the company, instead of the state or private individuals. Under the privatisation law passed by the Slovene government in November last year, Lasko's workers have the right to buy out the majority of the company shares. But the situation is not that simple. The prewar, pre-nationalisation shareholders have also demanded that their interests be taken into account. Mr Jontes expects to reach agreement in the near future over the division of shares with former owners. The Lasko brewery is the biggest employer in the region. Over the past decade, it has acquired a local spa, hotels and a 12th century castle, Grad Tabor. Set on a high ridge above the town, the castle affords wide views of the barley fields in the Savinska valley which provide much of the malt for Lasko beer. Mr Jontes sits in Grad Tabor, now a popular regional restaurant, sipping his golden Zlatorog and hoping for better times. 'All we need is a fair crack of the whip and the quality of our beer will do the rest,' he says.</p>

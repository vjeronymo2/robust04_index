			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Gardiner up to Pounds 1.85m PRE-TAX PROFITS at Gardiner Group, the distributor of security and surveillance equipment, more than doubled from Pounds 839,000 to Pounds 1.85m in the six months to the end of April. Mr Richard Clemons, chairman, said the period had been 'steady as you go' as the new board had attempted to distance itself from the discovery last year of, in the words of Price Waterhouse, which recently completed the investigation, 'a deliberate overstatement' of Pounds 4.8m in Gardiner's 1991 accounts. In the light of the 'overstatement' the interim dividend is halved at 0.23p (0.47p) payable from earnings per share of 1.15p (0.54p). Gardiner shares moved up 1 1/2 p to close at 26p. Mr Clemons said the new board was in the process of adopting the Cadbury principles and had formed both audit and remuneration committees. The results, prepared under FRS 3, showed turnover up at Pounds 40.2m (Pounds 36.6m), partly helped by exchange rate fluctuations. Turnover is biased towards the first half. Interest payments fell to Pounds 380,000 (Pounds 550,000) reflecting lower UK interest rates and reduced borrowings. Gearing at the half-way stage stood at 41 per cent compared with 47 per cent at the October year-end. Mr Harvey Samson, chief executive, said turnover was strong at Gardiner Security, the principal subsidiary, 'despite what are still difficult economic conditions'. Mr Clemons said: 'Tight control of costs and margins, together with the strength of our position in the market, gives the board optimism for the future.' Gardiner operates subsidiaries in Denmark, Norway, France, the Netherlands and Belgium.</p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Daimler chief promises to try harder Mr Edzard Reuter, chairman of Daimler-Benz, yesterday promised shareholders further 'energetic measures' to improve profits. He told the annual meeting that group sales had risen 15 per cent to DM30bn (Dollars 17.9bn), in the first four months of the year, but earnings were 'not what they should be'. The Daimler group, which last year lost DM1.8bn, is expected to stay in the black this year. Mr Reuter confirmed that a one-for-10 rights issue would be made this summer. However, he forecast that the AEG industrial division would not show operating profits until 1996, while Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) was expected to return to the black next year. Consolidated turnover for the first quarter, revealed in an interim report yesterday, rose 19 per cent to DM22bn, after a strong performance at Mercedes, which accounted for 70 per cent of the total. The Mercedes-Benz automotive division had increased sales markedly, but its performance also had to be improved. The comparable period last year was severely affected by recession and a sharp fall in car deliveries. Among the smaller divisions, the Debis services operation increased total revenues by 27 per cent to DM2.6bn. Turnover at AEG rose 12 per cent on an adjusted, comparable basis to DM1.59bn. Most of the growth came from Germany, up 11 per cent, and the US, where sales rose 13 per cent. Rail systems and micro-electronics showed strong improvements. Orders rose 59 per cent to DM3bn. The interim report blamed cuts in defence and space budgets and difficult conditions for airlines for an 11 per cent fall in turnover at Dasa, to DM3.34bn. Revenues from European Union countries dropped 20 per cent. Mercedes benefited more than its competitors from the recovery in world car markets, the report said. Turnover rose 28 per cent to DM16bn thanks to a 33 per cent rise in revenues from cars and a 21 per cent improvement from commercial vehicles. Worldwide unit sales of passenger cars increased 52 per cent while unit sales of commercial vehicles increased 17 per cent.</p>

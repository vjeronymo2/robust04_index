			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Fall in French GDP forecast Rexecode, an economic forecasting institute, said France's gross domestic product could fall by 0.5 per cent in 1993, Reuters reports from Paris. Its latest economic outlook said France's unemployment rate would continue rising, averaging 11.2 per cent over 1993 and 11.7 per cent in 1994. It ended 1992 at 10.5 per cent and was 10.6 per cent in February. Rexecode director Michel Didier predicted that the measures planned by the new premier, Mr Edouard Balladur, to relaunch the economy would have only a limited impact this year.</p>

			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EASTERN HALTS EFFORT TO HIRE NEW PILOTS  </P> <P> Eastern Airlines today stopped hiring new pilots, saying it had enough for its  rebuilding effort after the last week's sudden surge in picket-line crossings.  </P> <P> Spokesman Robin Matell said Eastern canceled training classes next week for its  newest recruits and will also stop advertising for pilots.  </P> <P> Eastern filed for Bankruptcy Court reorganization five days after being hit by  a crippling strike by its pilots, flight attendants and machinists unions March  4. The company has undertaken plans to rebuild to two-thirds its prestrike  size.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 800 Daily Flights  </P> <P> In its bankruptcy reorganization plan, Eastern indicated that it would be  flying 800 daily flights with 1,700 pilots by year's end. Eastern now has 350  daily flights, compared with nearly 1,100 before the strike.  </P> <P> Whether Eastern could hire and train enough new pilots has been a major  question about the plan to rebuild. The company this month leased five planes  and crews from sister carrier Continental Airlines to help meet schedule  expansion goals.  </P> <P> Matell declined to give figures on Eastern's pilots, but sources speaking on  condition of anonymity have said more than 600 union pilots are flying,  including about 250 who have crossed picket lines since the union leadership  last weekend discussed ending the strike.  </P> <P> Eastern has graduated 300 newly hired pilots from training and has between 700  and 800 in training.  </P> <P> Veteran pilots who want to return to work will be put on "a preferential recall  list" and given priority for future openings, Matell said.  </P> <P> Hank Weber, spokesman for Eastern's Air Line Pilots Assn., was skeptical about  whether Eastern has hired enough qualified pilots but said today's announcement  would stop the flow of pilot crossovers.  </P></p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: Oil group expands in Argentina Royal Dutch/Shell Group, the Anglo-Dutch oil group, is to invest more than Dollars 1bn in Argentina in the next four years. It wants to upgrade and expand its retail and refinery businesses and increase oil exploration and production. The investments, to begin in 1994, will modernise its ageing refineries, raising capacity and improving environmental controls to meet more stringent regulations. The company's retail network will also be expanded and upgraded. Royal Dutch made the announcement in the Netherlands this week during a state visit by Argentina's President Carlos Menem. It said: 'The idea is to have an integrated company in five years.' Royal Dutch has traditionally concentrated on the refining and retail sectors of the oil industry in Argentina, rather than production. It said that political stability, pro-business government policies and economic growth had substantially increased Argentina's attractiveness. The new investment programme comes at a time of increasing competition in the once tightly-controlled oil industry. In 1991, the government deregulated the industry. In June it partially privatised YPF, the national oil company. YPF, now 45 per cent-controlled by private investors, is Argentina's only fully-integrated company and controls half the domestic oil industry.</p>

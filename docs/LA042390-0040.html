			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NIGERIA TROOPS STOP REBEL OFFICERS IN COUP ATTEMPT;  </P> <P> AFRICA: PRESIDENT BABANGIDA SAYS INSURGENTS HAVE BEEN CAPTURED. THE UPRISING IS  BLAMED ON MUSLIM-CHRISTIAN TENSIONS.  </P> <P> A group of obscure mid-level officers staged a coup attempt Sunday against the  military government of Nigeria, but government troops appeared to have quashed  the attempt after half a day of heavy fighting in the capital, Lagos.  </P> <P> If successful, the coup would have been the seventh in the contentious  country's 30 years of independence. Nigeria, which with more than 110 million  people is the most populous country in Africa, has often been roiled by tribal  disputes and by a religious division that pits the Muslims in the north, who  hold a slight numerical superiority, against Christians in the south.  </P> <P> Although for most of the day the whereabouts and condition of President Ibrahim  Babangida were unknown, he surfaced late Sunday to talk with reporters, the  official News Agency of Nigeria reported.  </P> <P> "The unfortunate situation in Lagos this morning has been brought under  control," he said, adding that his military aide, Lt. Col. U. K. Bello, had  been among the loyalists slain in the fighting. Most of the rebel leaders have  been captured and will be tried, he said. There was no other word on  casualties.  </P> <P> The coup plotters evidently harbored grievances against what they perceived to  be the Babangida government's increasing favoritism toward the Muslim north.  Early Sunday morning, after rebel troops had seized control of Radio Nigeria  headquarters in Lagos, a man identifying himself as Maj. Gideon Oguaza Oka  announced over the air that, on behalf of the Christian regions of the "middle  belt and southern parts of this country, I wish to happily inform you of the  successful ousting of the dictatorial, corrupt, drug-baronish, inhumane,  sadistic, deceitful, homosexually centered and unpatriotic administration of  Gen. Ibrahim Babangida."  </P> <P> Oka said the northern states of Borno, Bauchi, Kano, Katsina and Sokoto -- all  almost entirely Muslim -- would be excised from the country and not allowed to  rejoin the 21-state federation until they proved their loyalty to the new  regime. Northerners working in the south would be forced to return to their  homes, he added.  </P> <P> By noon local time, however, the radio station had been retaken by government  troops, and a military leader said the coup had been crushed. There was  sporadic fighting in Lagos, but it appeared to have ended by nightfall.  </P> <P> In the wake of the coup attempt, the military government moved quickly to allay  fears that the plot's most significant casualty might be Babangida's plan to  return power to civilian control on Oct. 1, 1992.  </P> <P> "No amount of threat or blackmail will distract the government's attention in  this regard," said Sanni Abacha, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, in a  radio address. "We are set to hand over (power) to a democratically elected  government in 1992."  </P> <P> Like his seven predecessors as leaders of independent Nigeria, Babangida, 49,  is Muslim. But over his five years of power, he has shown such finesse at  balancing the country's contentious political and religious interests that an  admiring domestic press has dubbed him "the Maradona of politics," a reference  to the wily Argentine soccer player, Diego Maradona.  </P> <P> His broad popular support, enforced by occasional strong-arm tactics, enabled  him to impose a harsh economic adjustment program on the spendthrift and  heavily indebted country, which is a major oil exporter.  </P> <P> But the economic strictures have reduced the standard of living so much that  Babangida's political support has been draining away.  </P></p>

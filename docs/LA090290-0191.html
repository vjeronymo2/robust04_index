			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOR HUNTINGTON BEACH, OIL SPILL STILL ISN'T OVER;  </P> <P> POSTSCRIPT: THE SLICK THAT FOULED THE COASTLINE IS GONE, BUT IT LEFT BEHIND A  DEEP POOL OF DISILLUSIONMENT.  </P> <P> Six months ago, streams of yellow police tape were strung along 15 miles of  oil-soaked beaches like a grim warning, keeping people away from Orange  County's most notorious crime scene.  </P> <P> All over this ocean-side city, people talked -- in coffee shops, in press  conferences, in City Hall chambers -- about the crime against nature, when  crude oil gushed from a ruptured tanker onto the beaches on Feb. 7. And they  vowed to never let it happen again.  </P> <P> The day after the spill, Janice Belk, a 13-year resident of Huntington Harbour,  stood next to the Huntington Pier and watched, startled and helpless, as a  tear-shaped, ink-colored slick hovered near the coast. "Oh, goodness," she said  that day. "We won't be seeing the surfers. We'll be seeing dead fish and dead  birds."  </P> <P> Now, Belk looks back on a summer full of nature's restoration. She pedals her  bicycle along the shore, relishing all the signs of normalcy.  </P> <P> "The surfers are back," she said. "I see hundreds of them every day. It's also  good to see the beautiful birds flying in again."  </P> <P> Nearly seven months after 397,000 gallons of crude spilled from the American  Trader's torn hull, the beaches are clean again, tourists are back, grunion are  spawning, birds have nested, seaside businesses are booming and city budgets  have almost recovered.  </P> <P> And, about once a week, a giant oil tanker pulls quietly to the terminal off  Huntington Beach, unloading millions of gallons of valuable cargo without  incident. More tankers than ever use the mooring where the American Trader hit  bottom on its own anchor, but they are now restricted to smaller sizes.  </P> <P> In Sacramento and Washington, there has been political fallout from the recent  spate of oil-tanker accidents on the nation's shorelines. Congress and the  California Legislature have just adopted new laws that address tanker safety  and create multimillion-dollar trust funds financed by the oil industry for  handling future spills.  </P> <P> But the final, unresolved chapter of the Huntington Beach spill -- determining  how badly nature actually suffered and who will pay fines and damages and how  much -- hasn't been written. The drama is being played out far from the beach  -- in lawyers' offices from Los Angeles to New York.  </P> <P> Although the slick is gone, an undercurrent of disillusionment lingers in  Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Some resentment toward the oil industry, and fears about long-term ecological  damage remain. Environmental issues are in vogue now in a city that never had  the ecological fervor of nearby Newport Beach or Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> Belk said she looks at her favorite beaches in a new way -- as something  precious and vulnerable to mankind's mistakes.  </P> <P> "I always considered myself interested in the environment, but now I'm very  concerned," she said. "Anybody who lives in this area would have to be  concerned now."  </P> <P> Too little time has passed, however, to judge whether all this talk will be  transformed into permanent changes in how people treat their natural resources.  </P> <P> Gary Gorman, a firefighter and ecologist who quietly worked for years to save a  little piece of Orange County's coast, knows this better than most.  </P> <P> He and seven other Huntington Beach residents turned a 25-acre muddy patch off  Pacific Coast Highway into a bird and fish sanctuary after several years of  work. When the oil spewed out of the tanker, the wetlands had been resurrected  for less than a year.  </P> <P> A brokenhearted Gorman and others struggled day and night to save the marsh. It  survived, but just barely; the brown tide slurped ashore, minutes after they  had finished building their dirt dams. Small oily spots soiled the wetlands,  but Gorman said the damage seems minimal.  </P> <P> Gorman now believes that the spill left the public with a greater sensitivity  about the vulnerability of natural surroundings.  </P> <P> That new awareness, he said, is "the single greatest" legacy left by the spill.  </P> <P> "The environmental movement has been heightened by the spill, but measuring  that is difficult -- it's difficult to quantify," Gorman said.  </P> <P> The first real test will come on Nov. 6, when three slow-growth advocates vie  in the election against pro-development candidates for City Council seats.  </P> <P> "People in the city now realize that steps must be taken to protect our  beaches, including steps to prevent development," said Bob Biddle, president of  Huntington Beach Tomorrow, a slow-growth organization. "This oil spill made  people aware how fragile the whole area is. Until this happened, we've always  taken our beaches for granted. We never thought something like this would  happen to us."  </P> <P> Perhaps the biggest fallout is that Huntington Beach is no longer willing to  look the other way when it comes to the oil industry that once was the  community's dominant economic force.  </P> <P> The City Council is trying to persuade the State Lands Commission, which holds  the deed, to cancel the lease at the Golden West Refining Co.'s tanker  terminal, the only one off Orange County. The American Trader tore its hull on  its anchor at the terminal 1.3 miles offshore as it approached to unload  millions of gallons of British Petroleum oil into a pipeline.  </P> <P> Calling its shoreline "the most visited recreational public beaches on the West  Coast," the City Council wrote the state commission that "it would be doing a  great disservice to the public" to let the terminal remain open, even though  the lease doesn't expire for 15 years.  </P> <P> "I really feel from a safety standpoint and from an environmental standpoint  that our city -- in fact the whole Orange County coast -- would be better off  if this mooring lease were ended," said Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J. Mays.  </P> <P> If its terminal is shut down, said Roger Kemple, senior vice president of  Golden West Refining, his company will have to find another way to deliver the  crude oil to its refinery in Santa Fe Springs. A pipeline now links the  Huntington Beach mooring to the refinery, so it would have to build another one  elsewhere, or share another company's berth.  </P> <P> "Any other options (for delivering oil) we look at cost more," Kemple said,  "but they don't make the operation any safer."  </P> <P> Coast Guard officials concluded that the accident occurred at the mooring  because of a freakish combination of conditions.  </P> <P> Swells of 4 to 6 feet, a low tide, the tanker's pitching and gradual drifting  of sand underneath the mooring all combined at 4:20 p.m. on Feb. 7 to cause the  American Trader to bounce on the bottom and pierce its own hull. Tankers with  the same draft -- the part of the ship that is under water -- had used the  terminal often, but none had suffered the same fate.  </P> <P> Before the spill, the ocean floor at that spot had not been officially surveyed  for years. The area had experienced several major storms since then, but from  the charts available, crews were unaware that shifting sand underneath had made  the mooring several feet shallower than charts indicated.  </P> <P> Now, under new Coast Guard rules, Golden West Refining must survey depths  annually, and ship crews must use sounding devices and limit the sea conditions  in which they approach.  </P> <P> Tankers at the mooring also must carry smaller loads to maintain a 6-foot  clearance between their anchors and the ocean floor. As a result, Golden West  will slightly increase tanker traffic at the mooring. Ten oil tankers have  unloaded there since traffic resumed four months ago, according to Coast Guard  records. Before the spill, an average of 30 used it yearly.  </P> <P> The new restrictions "have changed how they operate. They're more cautious  now," said Cmdr. Gary Gregory, chief of port operations for the Coast Guard's  Long Beach office.  </P> <P> In fact, possibly because of the heightened concern for safety, at least three  tankers approaching the mooring since April have turned around and awaited  safer seas, Gregory said.  </P> <P> "It was a freak accident, and with the new restrictions, the chances of it  happening again are about zero," Gregory said.  </P> <P> Congress last month addressed one major oil-shipping safety issue by adopting a  law that requires new tankers to be equipped with double hulls beginning in  1995. It also set aside a $1-billion national trust fund, funded by the oil  industry, for cleaning up spills and rehabilitating natural resources.  </P> <P> The state Legislature adopted a measure that sets aside $100 million so that  California cleanup operations can begin immediately.  </P> <P> Whether accidental or not, spilling oil into the ocean is a crime -- a  violation of state and federal water pollution laws.  </P> <P> Sylvia Cano Hale, a deputy attorney general in the state's Los Angeles office,  along with teams of city and federal lawyers, continues to gather evidence in  preparation for filing a wide-ranging lawsuit. It is expected to target British  Petroleum, the Cleveland-based company that owned the spilled crude oil, but it  also could name American Trading Transportation, the New York company that owns  the ship and employs its crew, and Golden West Refining.  </P> <P> Lawyers for the shipping company have already taken defensive action, filing  papers in U.S. court trying to limit their liability to $8 million, the value  of the American Trader ship.  </P> <P> Together with American Trading, British Petroleum spent about $25 million  cleaning up the oil-soaked beaches.  </P> <P> The California attorney general's office, however, hopes to prove that their  financial responsibility does not end there. The state plans to seek fines for  water pollution violations, reimbursement of city and state cleanup costs and  compensation for harm to the economy, recreational resources, wetlands and  animal life.  </P> <P> To solicit the public's ideas about how to compensate for the damages and  disruption, state and federal officials will hold a public meeting Sept. 13 at  Huntington Beach City Hall.  </P> <P> At the least, the companies could face civil charges that they violated the  California water code, which would carry a maximum fine of $20 per gallon  spilled, or about $8 million in the American Trader case.  </P> <P> "There's nothing in (the statute) that says we have to prove intent, negligence  or damage," said Bruce Paine, an associate engineer with the Santa Ana Regional  Water Quality Control Board. "You just spill the oil, and that's what it can  cost you."  </P> <P> The city of Huntington Beach recovered $250,000 from British Petroleum, about  half the amount it spent on cleanup, including workers' overtime. The rest will  be sought through the litigation.  </P> <P> As the lawyers collect evidence and prepare to file suit, signs of the recovery  are everywhere along the shoreline.  </P> <P> On one of the last, waning days of summer at his fish market near busy Newport  Pier, dory fisherman Rick Breneman pointed to the blue waters.  </P> <P> "After the oil spill, the waters around here looked like mud," he said.  "Business really dropped off for two months. People kept asking us if the oil  had contaminated the fish, but of course we fish way out beyond where the spill  was. . . . Now, this summer, I'd say business is about average, the way it is  during a summer."  </P> <P> This summer, Huntington Beach was as popular with tourists as ever, according  to the city's Conference and Visitors Bureau.  </P> <P> "We were pretty successful in getting word out that the beach was cleaned up,"  said Diane Baker, the bureau's executive director.  </P> <P> Beaches show no visible oil, although some residue remains in crevices of rock  jetties that occasionally surfaces as tar balls and oil splotches during high  tides and swells. But it is quickly cleaned up, city fire officials say.  </P> <P> "I haven't seen any oil and I'm out there surfing almost every day," said Bobby  Tang, 17, who works at the Frog House surf shop near the Santa Ana River mouth,  one of the areas hit hardest by the slick.  </P> <P> "On occasional days, I have seen tar balls, but not recently. I think they did  a good job cleaning it," said Tang, adding that he rarely hears surfers talking  about the spill anymore.  </P> <P> Biologists do not know whether all marine life will return like the surfers  did. Grunion, killed by the thousands in February when they tried to spawn off  Huntington Beach, began laying healthy eggs a month after the spill. There is  no measurable long-term damage to the little silver fish, according to  biologists with the state Department of Fish and Game.  </P> <P> However, sand-dwelling critters, such as shrimp and crabs, were almost wiped  out by the oily tide and have shown no signs of recovery, the state biologists  said. The tiny animals probably will repopulate the area within five years,  they said. Results of studies on the effects on migratory sea birds have not  been released.  </P> <P> As some scars of the spill heal, environmentalists and officials worry that  Orange County might just be having a superficial, short-lived love affair with  ecology.  </P> <P> "So often people become complacent. They tend to think Prince William Sound (in  Alaska, where the tanker Exxon Valdez hit a reef and spilled 11 million gallons  of oil in March, 1989) is on the other side of the world," said Gorman, the  restorer of the Huntington Beach Wetlands. "It's difficult for people to  comprehend when something happens that far away."  </P> <P> "But this spill was on one of the most popular beaches in California," he said.  "It brought home the environment story, so it was a very graphic illustration  of what an oil spill really does."  </P></p>

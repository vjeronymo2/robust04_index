			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / International Company News: Hemlo strikes share-swap deal HEMLO Gold Mines will become the gold mining arm of Canadian resources group Noranda under a share-swap proposal announced yesterday. Noranda proposes to sell all its gold properties to Hemlo in exchange for 8.6m Hemlo common shares currently worth CDollars 69m (USDollars 60m). Noranda owns 50.1 per cent of Hemlo's 87.6m shares. Further payments of up to CDollars 10m are envisaged if the gold price rises. Hemlo operates the Golden Giant mine in north-west Ontario, one of Canada's largest and lowest-cost gold producers. However, efforts to diversify have failed. Output by Hemlo is expected to be about 440,000 ounces this year. The deal with Noranda would boost its reserves by about 2.2m ounces. Properties to be transferred to Hemlo would include 289 exploration sites in North America, including Noranda's interest in the Silidor mine in Quebec.</p>

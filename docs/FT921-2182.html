			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Landfill activities boost Caird CAIRD, the waste management company, yesterday reported a 41 per cent increase in profits for 1991 after strong increases in its landfill and special waste divisions. Pre-tax profits jumped from Pounds 4.86m to Pounds 6.87m on sales down 18 per cent at Pounds 26.2m. Earnings per share almost doubled to 4.75p and an increased final dividend of 1.37p is proposed, giving 2.7p for the year. Mr John Ashton, chairman, said the group had made progress concentrating on the landfill and special waste sides with the disposal of the dry waste and non-core businesses. Debt rose to Pounds 12m, for gearing of 25 per cent, from no debt at the end of last year end if off-balance sheet debt was included. Since the year end Caird has received Pounds 5.4m from the sale of businesses, including the English Dry Waste division, and is expecting to sell more assets with a net realisable value of Pounds 4.1m this year. Caird reported its results as Waste Management Inc, the world's largest waste group, announced it was to float 20 per cent of its international operations in order to take advantage of intensified environmental regulation. Overall profit margins at Caird rose from about 10 per cent to more than 26 per cent. Operating profits doubled to Pounds 7.23m at the landfill division as a result of the increased sale of materials from recycled waste and the sale of quarried materials. Margins in this division rose from 60 per cent to more than 73 per cent. It takes very little low margin domestic waste. Margins in the special waste division rose from 8 per cent to more than 20 per cent as the group moved out of treatment of bulk products and focused more on smaller, more hazardous chemicals. Profits rose from Pounds 350,000 to Pounds 1.29m in this division. Capital expenditure was Pounds 21.5m, most of it on site development. This year the figure is likely to fall to Pounds 6.5m. Extraordinary items of Pounds 1.02m covered withdrawal from non-core businesses and the final portion of a total Pounds 1.2m bill for fighting off Severn Trent's hostile bid.</p>

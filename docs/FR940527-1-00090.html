			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We do not believe that this special exception for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacement and renovation of old facilities should apply to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals whose capital projects preserve the overcapacity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is currently evident in much of the hospital industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, a hospital cannot qualify for an exception unless  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it has received any required approval from a State or local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> planning authority. If such approval is not required, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> urban hospital must demonstrate either that (1) overall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average occupancy in its MSA is at least 80 percent, or (2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its capacity is no more than 80 percent of its prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capacity (in terms of bed size). We are exempting rural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals from this requirement because of concern about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintaining access to needed services in rural areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hospitals that qualify for exceptions under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> special provision may continue to receive exceptions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments for up to 10 years beyond the transition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Exceptions payments will be available to hospitals that meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the special criteria above for 10 years after the date when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the hospital meets the age of asset test, provided that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital meets the age of asset test no later than the end  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the capital prospective payment system transition period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the hospital (that is, the last day of the hospital's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> last cost reporting period beginning before October 1,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2001). We believe that extending exceptions payments for up  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to 10 years after the transition should be sufficient for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals who must undertake major renovation or replacement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of facilities during the transition period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We would continue to determine the amount of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceptions payments under this special provision on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cumulative basis. That is, we would determine the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital's exception payment by comparing the cumulative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments made to the hospital under the capital prospective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments system to the cumulative minimum payment levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable to the hospital for each cost reporting period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the prospective payment system. Any amount by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the hospital's cumulative payments exceed its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cumulative minimum payment levels would continue to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deducted from the additional payment that would otherwise be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payable for the cost reporting period. In addition, we will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply another test designed to limit the amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceptions payments under this special provision. We would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce the amount of an exception payment that would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise be made for any cost reporting period under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> special provision by the amount of any Medicare hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inpatient prospective payment system payments for the cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting period (less 75 percent of operating prospective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment system disproportionate share payments if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable) that are in excess of Medicare inpatient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating and capital costs. This calculation includes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments under both the capital and operating prospective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment systems. It does not include graduate medical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> education payments, outpatient service payments, or payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for any other services covered under Medicare Part B. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propose to exclude 75 percent of operating prospective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment system disproportionate share payments from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination of the Medicare operating prospective payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system payments in order to account for the financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressure that disproportionate share hospitals experience in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other parts of their operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, we emphasize that these proposed policies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be subject to reevaluation in the light of passage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comprehensive health care reform by Congress. The hospitals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for whom we currently propose to provide special protections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may no longer require such protections after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation of comprehensive health care financing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reform. Therefore, we will carefully monitor the impact of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final health care reform legislation on the hospitals that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would receive special treatment under the policies proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above to determine whether such legislation justifies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revision of those policies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are proposing the following revisions to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations text to implement the changes discussed above:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Under new &sect;412.348(a), we would define current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ratio, fixed assets, and average age of fixed assets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The new special exceptions requirements are set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forth at proposed &sect;412.348(g).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Current paragraphs (a) through (e) have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> redesignated as paragraphs (b) through (f), and current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (f) has been redesignated as paragraph (h).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We are also proposing to make conforming technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes to &sect;412.348 to correct references.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

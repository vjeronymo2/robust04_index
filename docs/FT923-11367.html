			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Murdoch pulls out of E German tabloid GERMAN publisher Mr Hubert Burda said yesterday the brash Super] tabloid sold in eastern Germany had been forced to close yesterday after Mr Rupert Murdoch, the Australian-born publisher, decided to pull out of the one-year-old venture, Reuter reports from Berlin. Mr Burda said that high unemployment in eastern Germany, a harshly competitive newspaper market and a lack of advertising revenue made it impossible to make the tabloid profitable in the near term. Mr Murdoch's German subsidiary decided on Wednesday to pull out of Super]. 'We're all standing here in tears,' a senior manager of the paper's 180 staff said. The newspaper, whose sex and crime formula competed directly against the Bild tabloid owned Axel Springer, had been making heavy losses, she said. Super] sold 375,000 in eastern Germany, well below the 490,000 achieved by Bild. Mr Burda said he did not want to run the loss-making business by himself.</p>

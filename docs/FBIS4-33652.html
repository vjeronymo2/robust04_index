			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 8 Jun (EFE) -- Haroldo Venegas, director  of the Chilean Association of Exporters of Nontraditional  Manufactured Products (Asexma), reported today that the  preferential treatment granted to Chilean exports within  Mercosur [Common Market of the South] countries will expire in  December. Chilean exports to Mercosur countries total about $1  billion.    The Chilean business leader added that, within this context,  there is an urgent need for an association with Mercosur.    Venegas said that such association will mean Chilean  products  will not lose their competitiveness in the Mercosur market,  which comprises 190 million people.    Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa will meet today in  Buenos Aires with Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella.  During the meeting Figueroa will hand Di Tella a Chilean  proposal for joining Mercosur -- which comprises Argentina,  Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.    Asexma figures show that Chilean exports to Mercosur in 1993  totaled $1,089 billion, which represents 11.6 percent of all  Chilean exports.    Commercial trade between Chile and Mercosur countries  totaled  $2,850 billion.    Some 74 percent of Chilean exports enter the Mercosur market  under a system of preferential treatment that Chile negotiated  at the bilateral level with each of the four Mercosur countries  within the framework of the Latin American Integration  Association (ALADI).    In 1993, 80 percent of all Chilean exports to Argentina, the  fourth most important Chilean commercial partner, were granted  preferential treatment: Chilean exports to Argentina in 1993  totaled $588.9 million. The third [as received] most important  Chilean commercial partner is Brazil: Some 95 percent of Chilean  exports to Brazil, worth $407.1 million, were granted  preferential treatment.    Venegas stated that if some kind of agreement is not  negotiated, many products will be seriously effected in the  Mercosur market because of high tariff rates -- about 25 percent  in Brazil and 20 percent in Argentina.</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Blockbuster cleared for Viacom merger Shareholders in Blockbuster, the US video retailing group, yesterday narrowly voted to merge with Viacom, the entertainment group. The vote ushers through a deal which appeared to be on the rocks only a matter of weeks ago. The deal was approved by holders of 57.7 per cent of Blockbuster's shares. An agreement, valuing the company at Dollars 7.6bn at yesterday's market price, was an important element in Viacom's financial strategy after it bid Dollars 10bn for Paramount. Blockbuster's strong cashflow was to be used by Viacom to help service the substantial debt taken on to acquire the US entertainment group. The deal was thrown into doubt, however, by a steep fall in Viacom's share price earlier this year. The non-voting B shares, the main currency for the deal, tumbled from Dollars 45 at the start of the year to Dollars 21 3/4 , eroding the value of the all-share transaction for Blockbuster's shareholders and prompting several big institutions to oppose the merger. Viacom's shares have staged a recovery in recent weeks, aided by the success of several big Paramount movies and the rapid disposal of a number of Paramount assets to raise cash. This, in turn, prompted optimism among Viacom shareholders that the Blockbuster merger would be consummated, in turn lifting Viacom's share price further. At midday yesterday, Viacom B shares were trading at Dollars 39, up Dollars  3/8 on the day. Despite the recovery in the shares, resistance to the transaction continued up until the last minute. However, with 23 per cent of the shares in the hands of the Blockbuster management and a handful of supportive institutions, the likelihood that it would succeed had been growing in recent weeks. The merger agreement with Blockbuster, negotiated in January, had been due to expire at the end of this week.</p>

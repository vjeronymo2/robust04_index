			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Arts: 'Elektra' and 'The Carmelites' - Opera in Berlin Claudio Abbado and his Berlin Philharmonic have been preparing Strauss's Elektra for recording, and for performance at the next Salzburg Easter Festival. On Wednesday they unveiled the result for their concert audience at the Philharmonie, and it was extraordinary. It is a rare opera recording that gets all the soloists originally planned - somebody always turns out to have conflicting commitments. This time, however, it is hard to believe that Abbado could have wanted any other singers. Deborah Polaski's tall, commanding Elektra displayed not only the full power of her recent Brunnhilde at Covent Garden, but a dramatic and expressive range we had only guessed at here. Cheryl Studer, back in her best voice again, matched her with a Chrysothemis who was no kind of shrinking maiden, but lusted for a normal domestic life as passionately as Elektra wanted to wreck it. As Clytemnestra, Marjana Lipovsek offered a richly subtle study far beyond the usual croaking monster, and did it in luscious voice. As if these were not enough, we had Franz Grundheber's superlative Orestes, darkly implacable, and an elegant, uncaricatured Aegisthus from Reiner Goldberg. Any lesser voices, exposed thus behind the band, might have been regularly overwhelmed, for Abbado gave Strauss's score its full head. The Berlin Phil played superbly; hallucinatory details sprang up from almost every page, and in the right places the noise was shattering. It was Abbado's relentless drive, however, that made this a memorable reading: daringly swift as a whole, but so well paced and long-purposed that it made an unbroken span. Rivetting, and masterly: book in haste for Easter if you can. *** At the Deutsche Oper, there was the gentlest of contrasts: Poulenc's Dialogues des Carmelites, in its first German production in the original language. As you may remember, it recounts a semi-mythical tale of innocent Carmelite nuns who were condemned to the guillotine in the last days of the revolutionary Terror. In fact the original language was the least of the merits of this staging; most of the singers sounded well-coached rather than at home in it. The obvious exception was Rita Gorr, who wields magnificent authority and force as the dying Prioress; perhaps too John David DeHaan, an intelligent, finely sung Father-Confessor. Jiri Kout conducted Poulenc's score - a surprising one to come from him, despite the tender piety he revealed in several smaller pieces - with impeccable style and sympathy. Gunter Kramer's production is notable for its starkness and consistency, and a wealth of interesting, unevenly successful ideas. The stage is almost bare but for a few chairs and screens, and the cast are in almost-modern dress - nothing period-picturesque. Mere Marie, the nun who survived to tell the tale, is constantly present, brooding at the forestage when not involved in the scene (which she does admirably in the person of Karan Armstrong). The heroine Blanche de la Force is an aristocratic girl nearly crippled by pathological fearfulness, who by a cruel irony of fate chooses the Carmelite order as a safe refuge. In the earlier scenes Kramer lets the pathology spread to the staging, by way of expressionist emphasis; for a time, we see the world through Blanche's eyes. Alexandra von der Weth plays her uncannily well, and sings with touching simplicity and clarity, lacking only the experience to light up her words. So too with Heidi Person as her best friend, scatty, charming Constance. Poulenc's last scene is an outrageous coup, irresistibly harrowing in a literal production like the Royal Opera's. As they arrive at the scaffold the sisters sing a long, beautiful Salve Regina - while their voices drop off one by one as their heads do, just offstage. Kramer makes it painlessly symbolical: in a close huddle, the singing nuns (twice too many of them) advance slowly from furthest rear-stage, two or three of them faint dead at each audible crash of the blade, like flowers dropping from a bouquet. Very balletic, quite pretty; but our hearts are not wrung.</p>

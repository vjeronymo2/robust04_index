			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Shephard says 26,000 jobs at risk near mines ABOUT 26,000 jobs would be lost in addition to the 30,000 mining redundancies if all 31 pits proposed by British Coal closed, Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, said yesterday. Mrs Shephard was giving evidence to the Commons employment committee which is investigating the proposed closure of pits. The committee is also looking at the effect on employment and the effectiveness of efforts to find new jobs. Organisations representing miners claim as many as 70,000 jobs could be lost. Mrs Shephard said estimates suggested 17,000 jobs would be lost among contractors with a further 3,000 to 6,000 jobs at risk in the surrounding areas. About 3,000 transport jobs would be lost, 2,800 of them in British Rail. Mrs Shephard said unemployment in pit areas was already higher than average. Mrs Shephard said some areas affected by the closures were likely to receive assisted area status designation and her department was contributing to a new map for these which would include criteria to do with unemployment. Mrs Shephard was questioned about how far in advance her department knew about the closures. She said her department was 'aware' of the scale of the closures in the summer. The number of closures was indicated to her department the week before the announcement, but nothing had been put in writing at that stage. Meanwhile mining equipment industry representatives warned the Commons trade and industry committee yesterday of big job losses if the government's pit closure plan went ahead. Ms Beverley Webster, vice-president of the Association of British Mining Equipment Companies, said the industry's workforce would fall from 22,000 to less than 7,000 if the number of UK mines was cut from 50 to 20 as proposed. The trade and industry committee also heard that the nuclear fuel industry believes it could handle the spent fuel from the UK's Magnox power stations if they were closed to help the coal industry. Mr John Guinness, chairman of British Nuclear Fuels, the state-owned reprocessing company, told the committee early closure of the magnoxes would be 'feasible' but 'most uneconomic'.</p>

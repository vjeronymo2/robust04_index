			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi </F> Beilin by Ya'el Dan and Itay Engel on 25 May; place not given --  recorded]    [Text] [Dan] Earlier this morning, we spoke with Deputy  Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin about the matter of 'Arafat's  decree canceling Israeli laws in the autonomous areas. We  started off by asking him whether he agreed with Yo'el Singer,  the Foreign Ministry's legal adviser, who reacted yesterday by  saying that 'Arafat was behaving as though he has shelved his  agreement with Israel and is now doing as he likes.    [Beilin] No, everyone can draw his own analogy. I think  that we are essentially dealing with the agreement's first days.  There are definitely a lot of problems. There are also a great  many hopes. I can say that this agreement has granted the  Palestinians many important things they have never had; however,  I can also state that Israel has control of all the safety  valves. Therefore, I refuse to get worked up about every single  act that may constitute a violation of the agreement, because we  can ultimately prevent any such violation.    [Engel] Dr. Beilin, in one of your previous interviews to  IDF radio in connection to other statements made by 'Arafat, you  said that it would be great to have an alternative but,  regrettably, although 'Arafat is no Mandela, he is all we have.  Our question is whether you consider that to mean that we must  always just shrug our shoulders in resignation and plow ahead?  Are there any red lines that 'Arafat will cross soon, if he has  not crossed them already?    [Beilin] The red line is very clearly written in black ink.  It is the agreement itself. We will not accept any violation of  the agreement. Any violation will....    [Dan, interrupting] But we have already seen many  violations.    [Engel] Does his latest decree not constitute a violation of  the agreement?    [Beilin] If it constitutes a violation of the agreement, we  will not accept it. What do you mean? Does the fact that he  issued a decree mean that it will be implemented? What is the  whole agreement about? This agreement really gives us a series  of measures by which we can prevent many things from happening  if the other side violates the understandings. Therefore, if a  situation indeed develops in which the legislation which was  previously in force becomes irrelevant.... [pauses] After all,  in the meantime, it is just a decree; the question is what  happens when it is implemented. We can easily prevent the  Palestinians from taking any action to implement the decree.    [Dan] Perhaps the question is more on the psychological  level. There is a crisis of confidence between the PLO and  Israel. With whom did we sign an agreement? With people who  are in such a hurry to violate it?    [Beilin] Well, the psychological aspect is more of an  individual matter. Those who had complete confidence in the  other side probably feel less comfortable. Since I belong to  the camp with low expectations, I do not have complete trust in  the other side. You quoted my remarks accurately earlier. It  is true that I regard this agreement as more the product of what  is possible than of what is ideal. We will have to continuously  monitor things step by step and check whether the agreement is  being upheld. Each day brings its own problems. At the same  time, we must bear in mind that this is the beginning of a very  complex and historic stage. It would be stupid to view every  single step as being either the end of the agreement or proof of  its total success.    [Engel] Perhaps it would be wiser to simply say that  whatever 'Arafat said will not be implemented, because people  hear his remarks and receive the impression that we are  incapable of putting 'Arafat in his place. He continues to  issue these statements, and if the Israeli Government treats him  like a leader, then it is only natural that people in the street  will assume that his decrees will be implemented in the field.    [Beilin] I am not in any way minimizing 'Arafat's leadership  of the Palestinian people. I do not take his remarks lightly.  I am not proposing that we take his proclamations or actions  lightly. I definitely think that we should continue to monitor  his statements and actions and take the appropriate action  whenever the Palestinians violate the agreement.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(ina)": "Nechanicky in Charge of Interior </F> Ministry's Inspectorate"]    [Text] Prague--[Interior] Minister Jan Ruml yesterday  appointed Vladimir Nechanicky, a former prosecutor with the CSFR  Prosecutor General's Office, the new director of the Interior  Ministry Inspectorate, which investigates misdemeanors committed  by police officers.    Nechanicky, who represented Otakar Kracik, one of the  accused  in the rum affair, is the fourth head of the Inspectorate in the  almost two years that Ruml has managed the department. The  Ministry's spokesman, Jan Subrt, justified the personnel changes  by saying that the Inspectorate is returning to Ruml's  management and will no longer be the responsibility of his  deputy, Jiri Krizan. Krizan, however, will continue to manage  the supervisory team that looks into the misdemeanors committed  by the department's civilian personnel.</p>

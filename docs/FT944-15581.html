			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Armed forces set to adopt lower profile in N Ireland The government yesterday gave fresh impetus to the peace process in Northern Ireland by indicating that the armed forces were preparing to adopt a lower profile in the province. Amid clear indications that Downing Street will announce in the next week that it is ready to hold exploratory talks with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, told MPs he was planning new measures to reduce the impact of the armed forces' operations. Mr Rifkind said it would be irresponsible to cut force levels in Ulster prematurely. But he told the House of Commons that the government aimed to 'make the posture of the military patrols appear less aggressive to the public'. He said: 'It can never be normal for soldiers to be deployed on the streets of the United Kingdom. Our aim is to remove soldiers from the streets of Northern Ireland - but when it is safe to do so, and not a moment sooner.' The new measures will be implemented by the GoC (General Officer Commanding) Northern Ireland and the Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Yesterday, Rev Ian Paisley, leader of Ulster's Democratic Unionist party, reiterated that he would not take part in peace talks over the future of Northern Ireland in spite of the declaration of a ceasefire by loyalist paramilitaries last week. Mr Paisley condemned the negotiations as a 'counterfeit peace process' and warned that the IRA was continuing to arm itself. He reserved particular scorn for Mr James Molyneaux, the leader of the Ulster Unionist party, who made clear at the weekend that he endorsed the prospect of talks between the British and Irish governments and republican nationalists. Mr Paisley accused the UUP leader of 'crawling' to Dublin. Mr Molyneaux last night had 40 minutes of talks in Downing Street with Mr John Major, prime minister, on the situation in Northern Ireland. He is believed to have reaffirmed his tacit support for the British government's plans to hold preliminary discussions with Sinn Fein. The cabinet's Northern Ireland sub-committee is expected to meet this week to make preparations for such talks.</p>

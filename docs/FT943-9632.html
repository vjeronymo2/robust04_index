			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Business and the Environment: Credit where credit is due - An ambitious attempt to rate companies according to their greenness The concept of environmental risk is gaining ground in business circles. But how does it affect a company's standing in the market and the way it behaves? One of the more ambitious attempts to relate environmental risk to the traditional features of a business, such as its credit standing, geographical location and payment performance, has just been completed in the UK*. It was prepared jointly by Risk and Opportunity Intelligence, an economic analysis firm, and Environmental Auditors Ltd, an environmental consultancy, using information about 330,000 companies in the Dun &amp; Bradstreet database. EAL ascribed an environmental risk rating to each of the companies in the database, based on its industrial category. Risk, in this case, meant how 'dirty' the business was and how likely environmental factors were to affect its performance. Thus dry cleaners and garages achieved low rankings and service businesses scored higher. ROI then compared these ratings with the credit ratings which had already been ascribed to the companies on a scale of 1 (best) to 5 (worst). The surprising result (left-hand table) was that the more environmentally risky companies tended to have the lower credit risk. That is the opposite of what might be expected, namely that dirty companies are also the more risky financially. The reason for this paradox is to be found in another part of the research (right-hand table). This shows that environmental risk rises with both the size of a business, and also in many cases with its age. In other words, bigger and longer established companies are dirtier. This is not surprising when considering Britain's large companies today: they are usually decades-old manufacturing or chemical companies with household names. Thus, ICI and Shell only earn middling environmental risk ratings because of the nature of their businesses, but their credit rating is the very best. On the other hand, a newly formed publishing firm consisting entirely of white-collar workers would earn a high environmental rating, but could pose a large risk financially. That particular finding applies whether a company is measured by the size of its turnover or by its tangible net worth. But another aspect of the research puts a different twist on this. ROI and EAL compared a company's environmental risk rating with its payment performance. This showed that companies with a high environmental risk tended not to settle their bills promptly. Could this be another version of the frequently observed fact that large industrial companies like to keep their creditors waiting? Companies with low environmental risk, in other words the newer service industries, were prompter payers, although if they were late they were very late. The survey found that the companies with optimal risk are, by these measurements, 11 years old. That is the point at which the environment and credit risk lines cross. Any company younger than that tends to have a lower environmental risk and a higher credit risk. Any older is more risky environmentally, but stronger financially. The survey also looked at how environmental risk is spread around the country. Not surprisingly, perhaps, the south east stands out as having by far the highest proportion of low-risk companies because it has the most service industries, such as finance, and relatively few manufacturing companies. The regions with the greatest number of high-risk companies were the West Midlands and Wales, again hardly a surprise given the amount of manufacturing and mining in those areas. One of the more intriguing findings relates the riskiness of a company to its age. This shows that older companies tend, in general, to be the dirtier ones. But there are a couple of wrinkles. There is a sharp jump in dirty companies formed in the late 1930s and early 1940s, presumably a legacy of the war effort when production was all that mattered. After the war, the number of new dirty companies fell steadily as various pieces of environmental legislation were passed, such as the 1956 Clean Air Act, the 1974 Control of Pollution Act and the 1989 Water Act. But, curiously, the line then starts rising again. After 1990, more dirty companies were formed. This can be interpreted in two ways. It can mean that pollution regulation is not biting and that the authorities are tolerating lower standards. A more likely explanation, however, is that technology has now advanced to the point where it becomes possible to start up dirty companies again, but within the standards set by new pollution controls. If so, that is a healthy development because it suggests a rebirth of manufacturing. Niall Fraser of ROI says that some of the findings of the survey may seem obvious. But he says: 'No other study has included such a vast number of businesses.' He believes the research could provide a useful tool to measure performance among bank loan portfolios, investment funds insurance companies and company suppliers. It has been used by stock analysts to assess the soundness of UK clearing banks by classifying their exposure to various levels of environmental risk. *System-based Environmental Risk Rating (SYBERR).

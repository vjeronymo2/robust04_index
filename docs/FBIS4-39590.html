			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Makarov] </F>   [Text] Syktyvkar, 9 Jun -- The Komi Government resigned en  masse on Tuesday [7 June] as Yuriy Spiridonov has taken up the  post of head of the Republic of Komi, which, under the new  Constitution, is also head of the government. He will have five  deputies and it is thought there will be 17 ministries, as well  as the administration of the head of the Republic of Komi,  working as a single body ensuring the operation of the  government he heads.    At a session of the republic's Supreme Soviet, Spiridonov  warned that in his government the number of civil servants would  be cut back considerably, although the professionals would  remain on the job.    A special parliament resolution passed on Wednesday made  provision for appropriations for the material-technological and  financial working of the head of the Republic of Komi, setting  the salary for the post at 50 times the minimum monthly salary  set by Russian legislation.</p>

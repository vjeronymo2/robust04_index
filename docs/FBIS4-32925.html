			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 26 May (EFE) -- The Peruvian Government has  expressed "its surprise and concern" to the OAS over the  publication of a secret Inter-American Human Rights Commission  (IAHRC) report on former President Alan Garcia's case.    Reports from Washington state that in the report the IAHRC  reportedly rules against the Peruvian Government in the case  Alan Garcia raised against the Alberto Fujimori administration  for "illegal harassment and trial."    In an official communique issued today in Lima, the Peruvian  Foreign Ministry states that both Peru and the IAHRC "are barred  from divulging or disclosing the IAHRC's preliminary report in  compliance with pertinent regulations."    The communique adds that the Peruvian Government deplores  the  disclosure of this report because "it undermines the  confidentiality" which, according to the Human Rights Convention  of the Americas, must prevail in the preliminary stage.    The Foreign Ministry also expresses "its surprise and  concern" over the incident, which it believes may affect "a just  analysis of pending issues to be assessed by the IAHRC."    The Foreign Ministry communique asserts that the IAHRC has  issued a preliminary report and that this organization "does not  issue rulings or pass sentences at this or at any other level."    It adds that what was disclosed concerning the case  involving  the former Peruvian president "does not interfere in the  investigations or in the judicial proceedings" to which Alan  Garcia must respond in Peru.    Garcia has several trials pending in Peru for the alleged  illegal possession of guns and misappropriation of funds while  in public office.    Reports from Washington state that the IAHRC has established  that the "the Peruvian Government is responsible for violating  the right to personal safety and freedom of Alan Garcia Perez  and his wife, and the right to personal protection conferred  upon his children by the Human Rights Convention of the  Americas."    Garcia also sued the Peruvian Government before the IAHRC  for  a raid on his private residence that the military conducted on 5  April 1992. On this date, President Alberto Fujimori perpetrated  a coup d'etat as a result of which he closed Congress,  dismantled the judiciary, and assumed complete power with the  support of the military.</p>

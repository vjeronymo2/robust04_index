The Vietnamese Paper NHAN DAN said although the United  States  threatens "economic sanctions" against the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea, none of the Asian countries want in actuality  to see "sanctions" taken against this country as demanded by the  United States.    The Nepalese Paper NEPAL NEWS noted that South Korea takes  an  anti-national, bellicose confrontation attitude, entreating the  United States to set up an "international cooperation system"  against North Korea. As a matter of fact, South Korea has no  justification or qualification to meddle in the nuclear issue on  the Korean peninsula, added the paper.    The Zairean Paper UMOJA said: The United States does not  know of its dialogue partner. The Korean people and People's  Army are not those who would yield to anyone's pressure. They  are fully prepared for any event. The United States can get  nothing from "sanctions" and pressure.    The Jordanian Paper AL SHAAB in a commentary said that North  Korea, which has a staunch and self-sacrificing spirit to defend  the sovereignty and other legitimate rights with a means of  self- defence, can turn into a volcano destroying the "new world  order" of the U.S.    The Tanzanian Paper WATU said:    The DPRK has turned into a powerful socialist state,  independent, self-sustaining and self-reliant in national  defence. So no "international sanctions" can work on this  country.    The Swedish Magazine RIKTPUNKT said the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula can be settled only through DPRK-U.S. talks  because the issue arose when the United States deployed nuclear  weapons in South Korea and began threatening the DPRK with them.</p>

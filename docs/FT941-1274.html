			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: GE Capital contests board slots at Kemper GE Capital yesterday put forward four of its own nominees for election to the board of Kemper, the Chicago-based financial services group. The move signals the outbreak of open hostilities in its Dollars 2.2bn struggle for the group. If elected, the four nominees - all former executives of either GE Capital or its parent, General Electric - will push for the sale of Kemper for at least the Dollars 55 a share being offered by GE Capital, the company said. Kemper's board last week voted unanimously to reject GE Capital's offer, which had been made to the company's directors. GE Capital's response yesterday marks the outbreak of the first full-scale proxy solicitation battle in the US for several years. In a proxy battle, one or more shareholders seeks to impose their will on a company's board by gathering support from other shareholders. GE Capital said yesterday it held 100 shares in Kemper. The GE financial services subsidiary said it would write to Kemper shareholders in the next 10 days to put its case for a sale of the company. Its four nominee directors will come up for election at the Kemper annual general meeting, on May 11. The nominees will contest the four board seats up for re-election at the meeting, among them that of Mr David Mathis, the Kemper chairman.</p>

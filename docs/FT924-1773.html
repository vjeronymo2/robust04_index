			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / International Bonds: IADB reopens July issue to raise Dollars 200m THE Inter-American Development Bank raised Dollars 200m yesterday by reopening an existing Dollars 500m issue launched in July. Although placement proved rather slow, due to the slowdown in investor activity during the Christmas season, dealers reported some interest from investors bullish on the dollar, who have been buying short-dated dollar bonds selectively. However, the deal, which matures in August 1997, was considered aggressively priced, offering a yield of just five basis points above the comparable US Treasury. Lead manager Salomon Brothers pointed out that the margin was 15 basis points when calculated over the interpolated yield curve. The original Dollars 500m issue had become very expensive. After the deal was launched in July at 18 basis points over the comparable Treasury, the spread had tightened to 10 basis points below the curve. Dealers said this anomaly existed because of the lack of Eurodollar bonds, preferred by some investors because they are issued in bearer form, which trade below par. By the end of the day the spread on the new tranche had widened from five to 11 basis points over the five-year Treasury yield. Moody's has placed the long-term debt ratings of International Business Machines under review for possible downgrade, affecting Dollars 18bn of debt. The move threatens to widen further the gulf between Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's assessments of IBM's creditworthiness. IBM's debt is still rated AAA by S&amp;P, although with a negative outlook, while Moody's rates IBM's senior debt two notches lower at Aa2. Moody's said the latest review was triggered by IBM's announcement that it was taking a Dollars 6bn charge in the fourth quarter to cover further workforce and capacity reductions. British Airways' Pounds 300m of unsecured Eurosterling bonds has also been placed under review for possible downgrade by Moody's following BA's bid to acquire up to 25 per cent of Qantas Airways. The Australian government, which is in the process of privatising the 100 per cent-owned airline, is expected to decide whether to accept the acquisition in January. BA is also awaiting a decision by the US Department of Transportation on a Dollars 750m investment in USAir. The review will focus on the impact of these potential investments and the operating benefits which could be realised.</p>

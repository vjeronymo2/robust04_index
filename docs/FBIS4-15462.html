The document prepared by the Ministry of Defence  together with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs mentioned the  establishment, on the basis of military units of the Russian  Armed Forces stationed on the territory of former Soviet  republics, of Russian military bases and facilities in the  interests of ensuring the security of the Russian Federation and  those states.

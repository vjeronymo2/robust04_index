			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Computer services staff to be axed EDS-SCICON, the computing services company, is planning to make more than 250 people, or 6 per cent of its workforce, redundant following a review of staffing levels. It will be one of the largest job-shedding exercises in the computing services sector and reinforces the view in the information technology industries that only a weak economic recovery can be expected next year. Mr Tom Butler, the new managing director, said that on expected levels of business there were 380 jobs too many in the organisation and only 100 vacancies to be filled. The workforce was told yesterday that the redundancies would be announced after a 30-day consultation period. Mr Butler said the redundancies would involve managers and administrative staff as well as technicians and sales personnel. EDS-Scicon was formed by the merger last year between the UK operations of EDS, a General Motors subsidiary and one of the world's largest computing services companies, and SD-Scicon. Mr Butler said the redundancies would involve staff from both sides of the merged company. The company has substantial expertise in facilities management - running other companies' computers on a contractual basis. It is expected to be a prime contender to win contracts under the 'market testing' programme announced last month by the government.</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATUS REMAINS QUO ON WINFIELD; WITT JOINS YANKEES  </P> <P> Dave Winfield's veto of the New York Yankees' attempt to trade him to the  Angels is "still headed toward arbitration," his agent said Sunday.  </P> <P> Jeff Klein, who represents Winfield, said "not a thing" had occurred in talks  with Winfield or Angel General Manager Mike Port that would avert having an  arbitrator rule on whether Winfield's refusal right as a 10-and-five player --  a player with 10 years of major league service, five with the same club --  supersedes his inclusion of the Angels among the teams to whom he would accept  a trade.  </P> <P> Winfield refused to report to the Angels after they acquired him on Friday in  exchange for pitcher Mike Witt. Winfield, a 12-time All-Star, is contending,  with the backing of the Major League Players Assn., that his rights take  precedence over the trade-agreement clause. The Player Relations Committee,  which represents baseball owners, is contending that by continuing to provide a  list each year, Winfield's 10-and-five rights were overridden.  </P> <P> Don Fehr, executive director of the Players' Assn., said Saturday that  discussions had begun on scheduling an arbitration hearing, which could be held  this week.  </P> <P> Klein and Port chatted briefly Sunday. "It was a courtesy kind of  conversation," Klein said from his home in Westchester, N.Y. "We exchanged  pleasantries. Everything's the same."  </P> <P> Players may take 72 hours to report to their new clubs after a trade.  Winfield's grace period expires this evening, as the Angels travel to Milwaukee  to begin an eight-game, three-city road trip.  </P> <P> Witt reported to the Yankees Sunday.  </P> <P> Port is not worried that he has not yet directly spoken to Winfield, who is at  his New Jersey home.  </P> <P> "I understand where things are with Dave right now, and, given the  circumstances, I wouldn't do anything different if I were the player involved,"  Port said.  </P> <P> "We don't begrudge David his position. That's why we have a court system and  why baseball has a grievance procedure."  </P></p>

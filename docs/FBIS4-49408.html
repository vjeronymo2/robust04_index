			<p>BFN     [Text] Nice, France, May 5 (XINHUA) -- The Asian  Development Bank is close to doubling the amount of capital it  will make available in loans in the 1994-1999 period to 48  billion U.S. dollars, according to the bank's 27th annual  meeting held May 2-5 here.    However, the plan is overshadowed by disputes between some  Asian countries and the United States over whether some policy  preconditions should be linked to loan provisions.    The United States also wants to see more money entEr social  projects, such as anti-poverty programs, improvement of women's  status, environment protection and family planning.    This position was disputed by India, Bangladesh, Indonesia,  Thailand, Laos, the Philippines, and China.    These countries insist that loan provisions should not be  linked with policy preconditions.    Bank president Mitsuo Sato said the bank would try to help  solve the dispute.    The bank's board of governors will vote on May 22 on the  capital boost plan.    The meeting was attended by 225 delegates from the bank's 55  member nations. Economic reconstruction, approaches to economic  expansion, and challenges facing Asian nations were the topics  which dominated the discussions.    A consensus at the gathering is that the Asian-Pacific  region  has made a large contribution to global economic recovery.    The Asian countries realized an average rise of 7 percent in  their gross domestic production (GDP) despite a world-wide  recession in 1993.    The meeting also called on member states to settle problems  challenging economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region where  unbalanced economic development, a shortage of capital, poverty,  a deteriorating environment, and population pressure are serious  obstacles to further growth.    Some representatives have asked for lower interest on loans,  an augmented capital flow, and greater help for those countries  which are lagging behind.    Zhou Shengqing, deputy governor of the People's Bank of  China, also attended the meeting.</p>

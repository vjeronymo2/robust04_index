			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Management: A surprise Discovery - John Griffiths seeks an explanation for the Rover four-wheel-drive vehicle's astonishing popularity Measured by many conventional motoring criteria, the success of 'lifestyle' four-wheel-drive vehicles defies logic. They first emerged in the 1980s with aerodynamics marginally better than a brick's; cornering poise that not even a Citroen 2CV might envy; essentially crude suspension and other mechanical underpinnings 'borrowed' from trucks and other utility vehicles; and poor fuel economy compared with an ordinary car. There has been some honing and polishing since then. But the fundamentals are little changed and even smooth-talking motor industry marketing directors find it hard to explain the vehicles' appeal. Yet appeal they undoubtedly have. Growth in sales of four-wheel-drive vehicles, many of which never stray from the highway to use their off-road capabilities, continues to outpace that of the world car market overall. The 58,561 sold in the UK last year represented a doubling from two years earlier and was eight times as high as 10 years ago. Even by four-wheel-drive standards, however, the Land Rover Discovery has been a spectacular success. Production has been increased on eight occasions since its launch in 1989; 1,600 additional jobs have been created - and last week Rover Group's Land Rover subsidiary announced a Pounds 68m investment programme to expand output by another 20 per cent. Rover Group executives now talk of the Discovery as one of the most successful vehicles in the company's (nee BL, nee British Leyland, nee BMC) long history. They do so not just in sales terms - although at 37,000 units last year Discovery accounted for one half of Land Rover's global sales - but because it was designed 'in-house', brought from design screen to showroom in just 30 months, and has provided Rover with a virility symbol that its design and development credentials are fully intact. Precisely why the Discovery hit the jackpot is harder to explain, according to Peter Wyhinny, Land Rover commercial director. One reason sometimes advanced is the versatility of the product. Discovery was not only designed to capitalise on the high-status image of the Range Rover, and thus be readily accepted by companies on their executive fleets. It was also designed with seven seats to give the carrying capacity for school runs and leisure trips previously provided by only a few estate cars or 'people carriers'. With rear seats folded, there is enough load space for furniture dealers. With the capability to tow legally nearly 4,000 kilograms, 'we were able to make the Discovery appeal to many different people for many different reasons', maintains Wyhinny. 'Also, once people drove it, they liked the commanding driving position and the ability to see traffic movements ahead.' Land Rover describes the Discovery's typical customer as over 30, professional or with his or her own business. According to Wyhinny, more than 50 per cent of Discovery sales are 'conquests' from other makes and types of vehicle. Some are trade-ins from smaller and Japanese four-wheel-drives, but many are conventional saloons. A large number of estates are apparently being swapped. Land Rover, meanwhile, has deliberately responded to criticisms against four-wheel-drive vehicles in general. While acknowledging that Discoverys will never perform like sports cars, the company installed extra anti-roll bars to improve the vehicle's handling. Land Rover has also gone out of its way to dispel the 'gas guzzler' image. Owners who do not mind averaging well under 20 miles per gallon can still specify a 3.9 litre petrol V8. But the company has also developed its own TDi diesel, with the result that nearly 90 per cent of all Discovery sales in Europe are 30 mpg-plus diesels. Pricing, meanwhile, has been another important part of the strategy. The Discovery's range has been broadened so that it now spans the Pounds 17,000-Pounds 28,000 price sector in the UK, allowing relative easy trade-ups from the volume car market. Not least, Land Rover has sought to keep resale values high by frowning on excessive discounting and encouraging dealers to accept used Discovery cars as trade-ins. Not surprisingly Land Rover takes issue with those motor industry analysts who say the 'lifestyle' four-wheel-drive sector is a fad that could collapse overnight. For supporting evidence it points to North America, where such vehicles account for 10 per cent of the total vehicle market and to Japan, where there is almost no prospect of off-road travel but where four-wheel-drives take 6 per cent of sales. 'In the UK and Continental Europe it is around 2 1/2 per cent,' points out Wyhinny.' They are immature markets and we see plenty of headroom for growth.'</p>

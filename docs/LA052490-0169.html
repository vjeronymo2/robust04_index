			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAID SHOWS SERIOUSNESS OF PARTS PROBE AT NORTHROP;  </P> <P> DEFENSE: FEDERAL AGENTS SEIZED PARTS RIGHT OFF THE F/A-18 ASSEMBLY LINE. BUT  THE NAVY SAYS THE PLANES ARE SAFE.  </P> <P> When a squad of federal agents stormed the Northrop F/A-18 plant in El Segundo  on Tuesday, they went straight for the assembly line, removing allegedly  defective parts from the jet fighters while the planes were being produced.  </P> <P> The extraordinary raid -- possibly the first time that law enforcement officers  have confiscated evidence directly from an aircraft production line --  reflected the seriousness of the allegations that the F/A-18s contained flawed  components.  </P> <P> The critical parts in question include metal and plastic tubing in the  aircraft's hydraulic, fuel and pressurization systems, according to sources  close to the investigation. The tubing allegedly failed to meet strict military  specifications, though Navy officials said Wednesday that they do not believe  existing F/A-18s are unsafe to fly.  </P> <P> The tubing is supposed to be precisely formed and shaped, but the tubes  supplied to the F/A-18 line often failed to fit, investigators said. In some  cases, the tubing was bent or otherwise forced into position, leading to  concern that it might not withstand internal pressures during operation.  </P> <P> "The Naval Air Systems Command has made a thorough review of the system and has  determined there is no safety-of-flight issue," insisted Navy spokesman Lt.  Dave Wray.  </P> <P> He added that the hydraulic system, which operates at the highest pressures of  the three systems, has two backup systems in the event of failure. Northrop  formed and installed the backup tubing as well, but officials said it is  unlikely that all three could fail.  </P> <P> "Our big concern is whether this tubing is going to hold when a pilot pulls a  big left-hand turn" at five times the force of gravity, said a federal agent  who asked not to be named. "If all three systems fail, God doesn't want you to  live anyway."  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Navy officials were continuing to study the matter. So far, the  F/A-18s in the Navy fleet are being flown as usual, Wray said.  </P> <P> Northrop is continuing normal production, said company spokesman Tony Cantafio.  Another spokesman, Ron Owens, said the company is not commenting beyond an  earlier statement that it is "working with the government to understand the  issues."  </P> <P> Northrop produces the aft and center fuselage sections of the F/A-18,  representing about 40% of the content of the aircraft. McDonnell Douglas  assembles the aircraft in St. Louis. Last year, Northrop delivered 101 F/A-18  fuselages, and plans to deliver 94 this year. It is the company's largest  program after the B-2 Stealth bomber.  </P> <P> The allegations were originally made by Northrop employees, who have filed a  case under the federal False Claims Act, which allows individuals to sue on  behalf of the government and share in any damages. The individuals are  represented by Claremont attorney Herbert Hafif, who said he could not identify  them "in order to preclude the threat of retaliation."  </P> <P> An internal "fact paper" from the Naval Investigative Command said the probe  "concerns allegations of product substitution, false certifications and  possible cost mischarging."  </P> <P> "Product substitution" refers to allegedly defective tubing. "False  certifications" refers to whether Northrop tried to cover up the tubing  problems with falsified testing and improper certifications to the government.  </P> <P> "We believe the certification process is faulty for meeting mil specs (military  specifications)," the source said. "Our argument is, they ran the tubing  through, it didn't meet the specs, so they fudged with the computer to show  that it met them."  </P> <P> The "possible cost mischarging" allegation is based on the supposition that if  Northrop supplied defective parts, then the government did not get what it paid  for and was overcharged as a result.  </P> <P> Federal agents reported that Northrop officials had not been cooperative with  the investigators, but Cantafio rebutted that assertion.  </P> <P> The federal agents complained that Northrop officials brought a team of company  lawyers to each plant and ordered employees not to talk to the federal agents  and refused to allow employees to assist the agents in selecting the right  documents and computer material.  </P> <P> "They basically said, 'You boys figure it out,' " according to the source.  </P> <P> As a result, the agents are reported to have seized a huge amount of  documentation and computer tapes, since they were not sure exactly what they  were looking for. Rather than select documents from a drawer, they simply took  the entire drawer.  </P> <P> But Cantafio said that calling in lawyers hardly represents a non-cooperative  response. "If you got a search warrant, what is the first thing you would do?  You'd call your lawyer," he said.  </P></p>

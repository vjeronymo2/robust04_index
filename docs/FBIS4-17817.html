			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Albert Kochetkov] </F>   [Text] Tbilisi, 27 April (TASS) -- The Georgian parliament  has adopted a law on weapons, which will come into force on 15  May. The authors of this legislation -- members of the Georgian  parliament's legal commission -- today commented on this  document during a press conference in Tbilisi. Journalists were  told that the adoption of the new law was dictated by two  factors. Firstly, the Georgian law enforcement bodies are now  unable to ensure the protection and safety of every citizen and  his home. Secondly, the republic is, literally speaking,  flooded with weapons, and the new law will allow the authorities  to control them to some extent and to regulate the production,  sale, and storage of pistols and revolvers.    Georgia will apparently draw on Russia's weapon-making  potential, primarily on the Tula and Izhevsk plants, famous for  their top-quality pistols and revolvers.    At the same time, the law allows the Georgian Government to  issue licences to legal persons not only to purchase and sale  wholesale consignments of short-barrel weapons, but also to  manufacture them.    All the citizens of Georgia, upon reaching the age of 18,  will be entitled to purchase and possess weapons if they are  able-bodied, sane, not addicted to drugs or alcohol, and  "socially reliable," i.e. normally disposed towards neighbours  and the society as a whole.    However, the law regulates the calibre and barrel length of  the weapons, as well as their other tactical-technical  characteristics. The organisers of the press conference assured  the journalists that all the necessary regulatory enactments  would be ready before 15 May, which is rather dubious, of course.</p>

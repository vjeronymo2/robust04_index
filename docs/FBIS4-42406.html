			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Israel To Freeze Its Relations With </F> Rome"]    [Text] Jerusalem -- Israel has decided to temporarily  freeze its relations with Italy. This came as a surprise move  by [Israeli Prime Minister] Peres' deputy Yosi Beilin, intended  as confirmation of Israel's condemnatory stance against the  neofascist danger in Europe. The decision was made at the  Israeli Foreign Ministry yesterday evening, following lengthy  consultations, over a period of days with the Israeli Embassy in  Rome.    Another plenary meeting is planned at the Foreign Ministry  in  Jerusalem for next week. It is being suggested that the  complete freeze on relations may be lifted, and that the measure  will only apply to AN [National Alliance] members.    A first practical measure was already taken yesterday with  the decision to cancel a cultural mission to Rome, which was  scheduled for early next week. Israeli Foreign Ministry sources  explained: "We did not wish our representatives to meet the new  Cultural Heritage Minister Domenico Fisichella, who is a  National Alliance member."    The same sources added: "We had to choose between the logic  of reasons of state, which leads us to greatly appreciate  [Italian Foreign] Minister Martino's friendly statements  concerning Israel, and our commitment to combat any kind of  return to the totalitarian ideologies which developed in Europe  in the first half of this century."</p>

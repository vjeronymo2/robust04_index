			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HURST GETS BAD START FOR PADRES;  </P> <P> HE GIVES UP EIGHT RUNS AS THE GIANTS WIN AGAIN  </P> <P> Look at it this way.  </P> <P> If Tony Gwynn didn't hurl his body against the center-field wall to make a  catch . . . if John Kruk didn't leap across the warning track to make a catch .  . . if Roberto Alomar didn't swan dive into a line drive for a catch . . . if  Tim Flannery didn't dig holes at third base to make three catches . . . the  Padres would have lost, 15-3.  </P> <P> As it was, their second consecutive fall to the San Francisco Giants Monday was  at least by something resembling a baseball score -- 8-3 -- even if Bruce Hurst  did feel as if he had been passed, punted and kicked.  </P> <P> In front a paid crowd of 21,768 at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, making his  National League and Padre debut, Hurst learned at least one thing. When you  walk outside without your best stuff, they treat you here just as they would in  Boston or Bangkok. They murder you.  </P> <P> Baseball's biggest free agent winner this winter ($5.25 million for three  years) was a victim of a different sort of collusion as the Giants joined  together to put him through five innings that stretched into the darkest parts  of his imagination. One of baseball's premier left-handers was racked for 10  hits and eight runs, including two homers (back to back) and three doubles, and  he even threw a wild pitch.  </P> <P> Just four batters into his Padre career, he had allowed a run. Two innings  later, he allowed six, facing 10 hitters in a stretch that included a three-run  homer by Will Clark and another homer -- one pitch later -- by Kevin Mitchell.  </P> <P> After that inning, also for the first time as a Padre, the calm Hurst flung his  glove.  </P> <P> "I was awful," said Hurst afterward, professionally facing and answering all  questions. "I think my target area was dugout to dugout."  </P> <P> He said his shoulder, which had suffered from some stiffness during the spring  but didn't bother him as he went 4-1 with a 2.70 ERA, felt fine and loose in  the 80-degree heat. He said it was his mind that was hurting. Being the new kid  on the block, Hurst said, has taken his concentration around the block.  </P> <P> "I felt great, I had a nice sweat going . . . but I just wasn't prepared to  pitch," Hurst said. "There's been a lot of distractions going on around here  lately, there's been a lot of things happening . . . trying to get settled  here, trying to do this or that, maybe do too much . . . but I'm not going to  make excuses. That's my pet peeve -- they don't ask too much, just that you be  ready to pitch. I should have been ready. I wasn't."  </P> <P> The Padres' right-handed middle relievers were ready, as Greg Booker and Mark  Grant combined for four shutout innings, including five strikeouts in the final  two innings by Grant. The middle relievers have now thrown 6 1/3 scoreless  innings in two games, giving much pleasure to McKeon, who has felt they have  taken undue criticism.  </P> <P> At this point, the only thing that would make McKeon happier is a victory for  his 0-2 club. Especially since the Padres may tend to take early season losing  a little worse than other teams. After all, they have lost their first five  games in each of the past two seasons en route to baseball's worst starts each  of those years.  </P> <P> "We're going to be OK, we're not going to panic," McKeon said. "I said in  spring training that some of these guys were actually pitching too good, and  that I knew they had to have a bad outing, and hoped they would have it then.  It's all part of the game. We'll be here tomorrow."  </P> <P> If nothing else Tuesday, as they struggled against the smart pitching of  starter and winner Kelly Downs (seven shutout innings), the Padres proved their  defense is with them. If only they hadn't needed such defense.  </P> <P> Example: With one out in the first, Robby Thompson lined a single to left. Will  Clark doubled into the right-field gap, moving Thompson to third. Mitchell  bounced a single past shortstop, scoring one run and moving Clark to third.  </P> <P> Then Candy Maldonado simply crushed a ball to center field . . . but Gwynn  chased it down and made a leaping, bouncing-off-the-wall catch. Observers  ranked it among Gwynn's top three career catches -- and he has had four in  which he's gone over the wall. That catch was followed by a diving stop by  Flannery at third base off a Matt Williams grounder to save another run.  </P> <P> "I don't know if the catch was that good," Gwynn said. "It was like, I couldn't  tell where the wall was. Then I just caught it and karate-kicked the wall, and  that was it."  </P> <P> Said Giant Manager Roger Craig: "Those guys playing defense never quit."  </P> <P> Flannery made another diving stop the next inning, but by the third, it didn't  matter. Quickly now -- Brett Butler doubled. Thompson walked. Clark homered off  of what turned out to be a pitch that typified Hurst's night.  </P> <P> "It was a fastball," Clark stated.  </P> <P> "It was a forkball," Hurst said with a sigh.  </P> <P> Kevin Mitchell then hit his second homer in two games, to right. Maldonado  singled. Kruk made a great leaping catch off Matt Williams' hit to right. Kirt  Manwaring reached first on a throwing error by Flannery. Jose Uribe singled in  a run. Manwaring scored on a passed ball by Benito Santiago.  </P> <P> When asked if he felt awful for Hurst, Gwynn said, "I felt awful for everybody.  You could just see that Hurst wasn't getting the ball where he wanted."  </P> <P> Which brings us to today, 1:05 p.m., the Padres' Ed Whitson against the Giants'  Don Robinson. Whitson is one of the Padres' best pitchers at stopping losing  streaks, and while two games is not considered a losing streak, the Padres only  lost more than three games in a row once last year under McKeon.  </P> <P> Whitson, who ended last night's game in a rare pinch-hit performance because  McKeon had run out of players, said he's ready to for anything.  </P> <P> "I've been good at this (winning games after losses) in the past, and  hopefully, I'll be good at it again," Whitson said. "The Giants are hitting as  good as I've ever seen them hit as a team. But I'll be out there. You can count  on it."  </P> <P> Padre Notes  </P> <P> Rhoda Polley, the Padre administrative assistant who threw out the first ball  Monday, resigned Tuesday to concentrate on her fight with cancer. . . .  Monday's loss means the Padres won't equal one of baseball's most unusual  records of last year, when they were the only team to win the first game of  every home stand, going 9-0. They are still 17-2 in the past 19 home-stand  openers. . . . Outfielder Shane Mack, on the 15-day disabled list with a sore  elbow, is still unable to throw the ball any harder than a light toss. He won't  be ready for a couple of weeks, at which point he will be shipped to triple-A  Las Vegas.  </P> <P> Luis Salazar was not surprised at the giant reception he received in Monday  night's opener, including chants of "Louieeeee." "Hey," Salazar said, "I've  been here before, you know? These people remember." This is his third stop  here. . . . No wonder the Giants have won eight of their past 11 games here,  including their last six. They are loaded with San Diego connections. No fewer  than eight Giants either live here or used to play here, according to research  by the Giants' publicity staff. Manager Roger Craig, coach Norm Sherry, and  players Kevin Mitchell, Terry Kennedy, Craig Lefferts and Joe Price all live in  the area. Coach Bill Fahey and pitcher Dave Dravecky used to play here.  </P> <P> Giant fans will be heartened by the news that disabled pitcher Mike Krukow  looked good in a simulated game Tuesday afternoon and could come off the  disabled list within a couple of weeks. The return of Krukow, 7-4 with a 3.54  ERA last season before undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery Sept. 13, will  send either Don Robinson, Scott Garrelts or Atlee Hammaker to the bullpen. . .  . In the Miracle Cure Dept., Giant third baseman Mitchell says he has been  hitting so well this spring -- a major-league leading .455 during the spring  and then two homers in the first two regular season games this week -- because  of simple thing: contact lenses. Mitchell said he has not been truly seeing the  ball since he was hit in the face with a pitch by Jay Tibbs, then a Cincinnati  pitcher, in 1986. He decided this winter to get the lenses, and the results  have spoken loudly for themselves. . . . Padre Fever Dept: On Monday, a local  radio station auctioned 22 bats signed by the 1984 Padres. They were sold, for  charity, for $4,600.  </P></p>

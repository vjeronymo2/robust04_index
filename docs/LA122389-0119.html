			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING;  </P> <P> MOORTEN'S BOTANICAL GARDENS PRESERVES THE TRUE PALM SPRINGS  </P> <P> Turn-of-the-century health-seekers and nature lovers recognized Palm Springs  for what it was -- a true oasis. Here was a palm-dotted retreat where an  ancient hot springs gushed forth. Here was nature, simple and unadorned.  </P> <P> But today, the old Palm Springs is a little hard to find. As the demand for  more golf courses and more luxury housing increases, the last vestiges of wild  Palm Springs are all the more precious.  </P> <P> Fortunately, there are people and places committed to the preservation of the  last of the wild desert. Patricia Moorten, who owns and operates Moorten's  Botanical Garden, believes the purpose of her garden is nothing less than the  preservation and protection of our endangered native desert flora. "The idea  behind Moorten's Garden is to give visitors, after they've been downtown, the  feeling that they're out in the desert again," she said.  </P> <P> The garden is on Palm Canyon Drive just a few blocks from high-fashion salons  and tacky T-shirt shops, but it is a world apart. The wood-burned plaque at the  entrance reads: "This garden fosters the spirit of the desert despite the  advent of man's possessive encroachment therein."  </P> <P> At first glance, the wooden fence, overgrown cacti facing the street and the  funky hand-lettered signs suggest a tourist attraction from the 1930s -- kitsch  instead of glitz. But once inside, the visitor is amazed by the extent of the  cactus collections. And even though you swore you were going to concentrate on  nothing but fun and sun in Palm Springs, you end up effortlessly learning an  amazing amount of natural history and desert lore.  </P> <P> A visit to the garden is an introduction not only to the Palm Springs of the  past but also to the botanical diversity found in the deserts of the world. The  self-guided tour takes the visitor through the environments of the Sonoran,  Colorado, Chihuahuan, Mojave, African and South American deserts.  </P> <P> Moorten's was opened more than a half-century ago by Chester "Cactus Slim"  Moorten and his bride, Patricia. Slim was a Hollywood actor-turned-desert  landscaper who developed a reputation for locating and transplanting exotic  cactus species during the worldwide cactus craze in the early '50s.  </P> <P> The garden very much reflects the personality of Patricia Moorten, a well-read  botanist who, after more than 50 years of work, still consults with cactus  lovers the world over. Dressed smartly and always wearing a large sun hat,  Moorten frequently inspects her garden paths. She runs the place with the help  of son Clark and grandson Richard.  </P> <P> "We're so glad to share our garden with visitors," she says. "The fact that  it's three generations of us now working here makes it very special."  </P> <P> Moorten's is a great place to commune with cacti. More than 3,000 species can  be found here, among them enormous century plants, spectacular 15-foot giant  saguaros and a 20-foot cardon from Baja. Several hundred full-size species of  cacti and succulents flourish in the cactarium, a temperature-regulated  hothouse.  </P> <P> One special attraction is an S-shaped palm tree that was moved here years ago  from the open desert. The move was not an easy one, and a giant crane was  required. The tree had been hit by lightning, which burned and bent it; still,  it survived.  </P> <P> "To me this palm is an example of that Bible passage that talks about how we  grow from the heart out," Moorten says.  </P> <P> The palm is the focal point of the garden's Little Tahquitz Falls area, which  is a reproduction of the actual Tahquitz Canyon area just a few miles away.  It's a romantic place, judging from the number of weddings and receptions that  take place here.  </P> <P> Children are drawn to "Tortoise Terrace," where desert tortoises lumber about  and bask in the sun. And they seem to have a great time following the "Dinosaur  Footprints" in the Prehistoric Garden.  </P> <P> Home gardeners can browse in the garden's nursery and buy succulents and cacti  of all sizes from deserts near and far.  </P> <P> Moorten's philosophy about preserving the desert extends far beyond the walls  of her garden. She frequently hosts gatherings of like-minded civic and  conservation groups.  </P> <P> "Palm Springs is still a very unique and romantic place," Moorten says, "but  the city, for some reason, has always felt compelled to promote pseudo-glamour  instead of the magnificent geographical setting."  </P> <P> For five decades, Patricia Moorten has been a voice in the Palm Springs  wilderness. She was one of the first botanists to preach the gospel of  xeriscaping -- drought-resistant landscaping. As a city parks commissioner, she  fought for desert landscaping instead of lawns and insisted that the palms not  be pruned. To this day, when she learns of an imminent development, she makes  it a point to beat the bulldozers to the construction site and "liberate" the  native plants.  </P> <P> "A little patch of green doesn't hurt, but the greatest percentage should be  desert, open and natural," Moorten says.  </P> <P> Clearly Moorten and other Palm Springs preservationists lost more battles than  they won. They have seen the land and the names on the land change to an  astonishing degree -- Rio del Sol is now Bob Hope Drive, Wonder Palms Road is  Frank Sinatra Drive.  </P> <P> To Patricia Moorten, and to visitors who step off the commercial path,  Moorten's Botanical Garden is a place that celebrates the diversity of desert  life and is living proof that the desert is anything but a barren wasteland.  "The desert is far from deserted. It's full of fascinating creatures,  especially plants. In fact, I feel like the desert is in tune with the  universe."  </P> <P> Moorten's Botanical Garden is at 1701 S. Palm Canyon Drive, Palm Springs, (619)  327-6555. It's open Monday through Saturday, 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.; Sundays, 10  a.m. to 4 p.m. Adults $1.50; children 50 cents; age 5 and under, free.  </P></p>

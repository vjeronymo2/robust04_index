			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Rights and placing at Wiggins to fund property acquisitions WIGGINS Group, a property developer which recently agreed a creditors' voluntary arrangement, yesterday announced a reverse takeover involving a financial reconstruction and the injection of several development properties. Mr Stephen Hayklan, chairman of Wiggins, said that the deal marked the return of the merchant developer. Mr Oliver Iny, chairman of Clerkenwell Holdings, a private developer who will own 30.4 per cent of the company after the deal, wanted a quoted vehicle to take advantage of the upturn in the property market. The deal involves a capital reorganisation, board changes, the acquisition of several development properties, a Pounds 1.6m rights issue and a Pounds 7m placing. The money raised will be used to buy the site of a former hospital at Lincoln for a total of Pounds 6.4m from Castlegold, a company controlled by Mr Iny. The land has planning permission for 400 residential units, a hotel and two schools. It has also acquired an option to buy from Castlegold a leisure site in Brent for Pounds 1.5m and the site of a former hospital in Bedfordshire for Pounds 8m. The board changes include the appointment of Mr William Syson as non-executive chairman and Mr Iny, Mr Christopher Foster and Mr Lance Blackstone as directors. RACI, a stockbroker, will place 280m new shares at 2 1/2 p per share. The rights issue of 63.5m shares at 2 1/2 p is on the basis of 4-for-1 and will not be underwritten.</p>

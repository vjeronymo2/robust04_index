			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] The State Duma devoted the whole of  today to discussing the second reading of the 1994 federal  budget. Here is our correspondent Aleksey Venediktov.    [Venediktov] The passing of the second reading of the budget  was replete with dramatic situations. The parliamentary speaker  Ivan Rybkin delayed the opening of the evening session by 42  minutes and assembled the heads of all the political groupings  in the presidium room. He proposed adopting all the amendments  put forward by the budget committee as a single package without  voting on each one separately.    Communist leader Gennadiy Zyuganov demanded that Sergey  Glazyev should be allowed to speak on one amendment on setting  up a non-budgetary fund into which would go the money from  privatization and from which the money would be used for the  needs of the army. The leader of the Yabloko group, Grigoriy  Yavlinskiy, stated that if Glazyev was allowed to say anything  at all, then he would demand that all 275 amendments should be  voted on separately. As a result of such slight blackmail, all  the amendments were grouped together for a single vote.    [Announcer] The document was then passed by a majority of  two.    [Correspondent Ivan Trefilov] The State Duma's deputies had  the wisdom to leave unchanged the main figures of the budget  which were adopted in the first reading. In 1994 expenditure  will be 194.5 trillion rubles [R] and revenue will be R124.5  trillion. The budget deficit is fixed at R70 trillion which is  36 percent of the expenditure section.    Thanks to the efforts of the budget committee, some  corrections have been made within various articles. There has  been a reduction of R4.5 trillion in expenditure on foreign  economic activity and a reduction of R1.5 trillion in  expenditure on servicing the internal debt. The total savings  amounted to R8.5 trillion. These monies will be used to add  R3.5 trillion to the defense budget. The subjects of the  Russian Federation have received just under R3 trillion. The  rest of the savings has been directed to supporting the social  and cultural sphere, to scientific and fundamental research and  to law enforcement activity. Support was also given to the  proposal of the budget committee to create a special  non-budgetary fund to support the army. Ivan Trefilov for Ekho  Moskvy from the State Duma.    [Announcer] Those who voted for the budget were primarily  the  Communists and Agrarians. In an interview to our correspondent  [Communist leader] Gennadiy Zyuganov stated:    [Begin Zyuganov recording] This is the logic of common  sense.  Any government, regardless of its ideology, if it is going to  operate, will be obliged to tackle these questions regardless of  what its overall basic views are. Everyone wants to eat, work  and have social protection and adequate security. [end recording]    [Announcer] Parliament's democratic wing came out against  the  budget. In an interview with journalists [Yegor] Gaydar, leader  of Russia's Choice said:    [Begin Gaydar recording] I would like to point out that the  very idea of creating a non-budgetary fund with monies from  privatization for financing defense is an obvious delusion. The  budget was one small weakness: It is clearly unrealistic. It is  clearly out of touch with the possibilities of Russia's economic  development in 1994. It has many things which are not at all  correct. [end recording]    [Announcer] Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of the Yabloko  grouping, holds a position which is similar in principle.    [Begin Yavlinskiy recording] The voting just now concerned  the redistribution of 10 percent within the budget. This is not  a fundamental issue. In those places where, say, 70 percent of  our amendments were adopted it was somewhat improved, but this  did not alter the overall situation. [end recording]    [Announcer] The budget will now be sent to the Federation  Council. Nikolay Gonchar, chairman of the Budget Committee of  the upper chamber, told our correspondent:    [Begin Gonchar recording] It has evidently been suggested to  the leadership of the Federation Council that the Federation  Council should be convened earlier than planned, that is,  perhaps, next week because, I believe, the situation is rather  tense. I think the Federation Council will come under very  strong pressure and the Federation Council deputies will find  themselves between the pressure put on them from above and the  pressure put on them from below. [end recording]    [Announcer] However, before the document can be examined by  the upper chamber it must undergo its third reading. In  accordance with the law, the government should, within a period  of two weeks, take account of the observations which the Duma  made today and, after this, put it forward for the final vote.</p>

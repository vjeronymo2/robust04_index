			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The National Assembly ended its extraordinary  session at the Parliamentary Palace in the afternoon of 4  January. The closing ceremony was chaired by National Assembly  speaker Andre Milongo. A plenary session was held in the  morning of the same day, during which the 1994 state budget was  adopted. Andre Mimossi, a permanent correspondent at the  Parliamentary Palace, has the details:    [Begin recording] [Mimossi] [passage omitted] During the  extraordinary session, parliamentarians discussed the major item  of their deliberations, which is no other than the 1994  financial draft bill, that is the state budget for this year, as  well as the basis upon which it was drafted, namely the economic  and social recovery plan known as PARESO [expansion unknown].  The 1994 budget, which was adopted by the National Assembly is  nearly 166 billion CFA francs, that is 38.64 billion CFA francs  less than the figure for last year. By adopting the text  submitted to it at the session, the National Assembly has just  paved the way for a reassuring future for Congo. Assembly  speaker Andre Milongo pointed out the importance of this text.    [Milongo] During the deliberations, the honorable  parliamentarians examined the various draft bills which would  enable us in the very near future to set up local councils and  allow for unrestricted management of local authorities. With  the adoption of this text our country has taken a major step in  the march toward the country's decentralization and  municipalization. I am convinced that this praiseworthy policy  will contribute to the development of our regions and  municipalities through the control and valorization of their own  human, economic, and technical resources. However, it must be  stressed that the step being taken is realistic and cautious  because in the first stage, only the regions and municipalities  will be upgraded into administrative entities. During the same  session, our honorable assembly also examined and adopted the  1994 appropriation bill, as well as the action program for  economic and social recovery, PARESO, which accompanies it.  These measures will enable the government to reorganize and  improve the economic and social fabric which is now in a  shambles. [passage omitted]    I also take this opportunity to express my gratitude to our  honorable parliamentarians for all the initiatives taken, which  led to the adoption of the statement on the restoration of peace  in the country at their congress meeting on 16 December 1993. I  hope that there will soon be a return to peace now that the  measures included in the statement have been effectively  implemented. I, therefore, urge all the honorable  parliamentarians, and I repeat, honorable parliamentarians to  work tirelessly and above all sincerely for peace in their  various constituencies because working for peace means ensuring  one's own security. Collective security is the best security.  [end recording]</p>

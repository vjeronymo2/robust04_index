			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Striking musicians closed the "Folies Bergere" extravaganza on the Las Vegas  Strip Saturday night in a labor dispute with the Tropicana Hotel. The  Ramada-owned 2,000-room resort employs 14 musicians in the main showroom where  the curtain routinely goes up twice nightly, seven days a week. The dark  showroom put about 170 waiters, waitresses, dancers, showgirls, stagehands and  entertainers out of work. About 1,400 people had reservations for the two  performances Saturday night. It was unclear whether the Tropicana would resume  a showroom policy by hiring non-union musicians. The musicians union has been  threatened in recent years by high technology, which has replaced large musical  groups and orchestras with tape and synthesizers. The strike marked the first  walkout on the Strip since the expiration on June 2 of a contract covering  30,000 bartenders, culinary workers, stagehands and musicians at more than 30  gambling resorts. John Chiero, president and general manager of the Tropicana  Hotel, said all other hotel workers remained on the job, despite musician  picket lines. He said closure of the showroom "will not economically impact the  hotel because historically, showrooms in Las Vegas lose money." "The Folies  Bergere," a French extravaganza, has played the Tropicana Hotel for more than a  decade. ALEENE MacMINN and Claudia Puig  </P></p>

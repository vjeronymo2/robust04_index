			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Technology: New tools for routine jobs - Vanessa Houlder examines intelligent computers in a series on IT innovation in the financial services sector A new generation of computing tools is being pressed into service in some of the most competitive and innovative sectors of the financial services industry. 'Intelligent' computing techniques are designed to imitate human behaviour in the way information is sifted and responses made. They include neural networks, which are interconnected computing units that loosely resemble the function of neurones in the human brain; genetic algorithms, which help find the best solution from large amounts of data; and fuzzy logic, a tool for dealing with imprecise information. They are being used in a range of applications, including credit assessment, fraud detection, forecasting and portfolio management. Banks believe they have the potential to sharpen their competitive edge, since their adaptability and skill at manipulating large amounts of data often surpass traditional statistical techniques. Almost every large financial business in Europe and the US is experimenting with these tools, according to Sergio Focardi, a partner of the Intertek Group, a Paris-based research organisation which has conducted a survey of advanced computational methods in 80 international banks. This research, in which banks are typically investing up to Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.8m) a year, is viewed as highly promising, he says. Some bankers are very enthusiastic. 'The potential is incredible,' says Bill Edisbury, manager of emerging technology at TSB bank. The TSB has been experimenting for five years with building models using neural networks' ability to learn from experience. TSB General Insurance in Newport uses such a model to set premiums for personal loan protection insurance, based on data from national unemployment statistics and claims histories. The bank, together with University College London, has also exploited the pattern-recognition ability of neural networks by building a model that was 57 per cent successful in forecasting the direction of the long-dated gilts market. But for every enthusiast, there is a sceptic. Many financiers believe that these computational techniques promise more than they can deliver. Moreover, the secrecy that surrounds most banks' experiments in the field is believed often to hide disappointing results. 'It is a triumph of optimism over experience. People's experience has been mixed to poor,' says one banker. The performance of these tools depends largely on where and how they are used. Intertek's Focardi believes that the success of the tools in forecasting markets' behaviour lags behind their success in dealing with relatively simple questions in credit assessment, fraud detection and marketing, where 'the results are consistently good'. He says: 'Forecasting is a more difficult subject because of the intrinsic complexity of markets' behaviour, the possibility of structural change and the lack of data.' Even enthusiasts such as Edisbury believe that the take-up of these tools by the financial markets may be slower than originally expected. The tools are not necessarily expensive or difficult to apply. One package, devised by Right Information Systems, a software house, which is used in several banks, costs Pounds 10,000 and can be used by anyone with spreadsheet skills. This system can run on a standard PC, although some users prefer high-performance computers. However, many people are reluctant to use neural networks because of the difficulty in seeing how a particular decision was reached. This is a particular problem in loan evaluation work, where it is often necessary to explain why a loan has been turned down. Another problem is 'overfitting', where the model finds spurious patterns in a given set of data. 'Neural nets are so easy to abuse,' says Konrad Feldman, a researcher at UCL. 'The fact they have learned something doesn't mean they can generalise.' One way in which these weaknesses can be overcome is by combining neural networks with other innovative techniques in hybrid systems. For example, the parameters used by a neural network model can be refined using genetic algorithms, which attempt to breed the best solutions from a set of random solutions in a manner analogous to the mechanisms of biological evolution. They are being used to construct useful trading rules from a set of plausible rules and in portfolio management to find an ideal combination of assets. Neural networks and genetic algorithms can also be used in conjunction with fuzzy logic. Fuzzy logic provides a mechanism for handling imprecise concepts, such as 'small', 'big', 'high' and 'low', which is particularly useful in loan evaluation and portfolio selection. Japanese banks have been in the forefront of these techniques. For instance, Yamaichi Securities uses fuzzy logic to make decisions for an investment fund; Nikko Securities uses a neuro-fuzzy system for a bond-rating programme. To a greater or lesser degree, all these computational tools are difficult to apply. Paul Refenes, an expert in financial engineering at London Business School, doubts that there have been been any 'wholesale' successes in applying these tools to the management of money, and says that difficulties in quantifying risk will make banks reluctant to hand over large sums of money to these machines. Yet even if their scope to manage money autonomously proves limited, they are expected to have a greater role in aiding research. 'They could replace certain expert areas in the financial services sector,' says Edisbury, while Refenes says: 'They will become a tool that traders and investment managers will have to use.'</p>

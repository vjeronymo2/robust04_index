			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> As noted in the preamble to the existing regulations, the limit on payment rate differentials within a category of care was one of the more controversial issues of the regulation. That controversy continues today. In writing the existing regulations, we were persuaded by grantees and child care advocates that grantees should be permitted to differentiate within categories of care to account for licensing status and considerations of quality, as well as coordination with other child care programs. As a consequence, grantees were permitted to set differential payment rates, with a 10 percent cap, within categories of care. However, in the preamble, we indicated that we would consider amending the regulation if it became apparent that the 10 percent limit was inappropriate or served no useful purpose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since publication of the existing regulations, we have conducted program reviews in States and non-exempt Tribes, held a number of meetings attended by States, Territories and Tribes, consulted with many child care advocacy groups and received numerous letters from the Congress and other interested parties. In these contacts, we were told that child care providers meet varying licensing requirements and provide care at varying levels of quality. Grantees have asked for the additional flexibility to set payment rates which provide incentives for becoming licensed and which reflect differences in program quality. A number of grantees have stated that, in setting payment differentials within categories of care, they want to recognize and compensate those child care facilities which have obtained nationally recognized accreditation along with those child care providers who have earned Child Development Associates (CDA) credentials. Additionally, grantees want to take into consideration the differing costs of providing care in licensed, unlicensed, and license-exempt (e.g., relative) settings, and of providing care during non-traditional hours (e.g., evenings and nights).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It has also been pointed out that other child care subsidy programs allow grantees to differentiate within categories of care without imposing any limitation on the amount of the payment differential. As a consequence, some grantees have experienced difficulty in creating a seamless child care system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eliminating the 10 percent limitation will give grantees the flexibility to address these areas of concern. As a consequence, we propose to remove the reference to limits on payment differentials in &sect;&sect;98.16(a)(12) and 98.43(e). We propose to revise &sect;98.43(e) and add &sect;98.16(a)(12)(iii) to require grantees that provide for variations in the payment rate within a category to include a description of how the differential rates within categories of care are determined and to identify the distinctions within categories. Grantees would still be required to ensure that payment rates are sufficient to provide access to child care services comparable to those in the non-subsidized sector.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are clarifying the regulations at &sect;98.43(b) (1) and (2) to read ``amount charged'' instead of costs. We believe this terminology more clearly reflects Federal policy which prohibit the use of Federal dollars to pay more for a service than the provider would charge a non-subsidized family. Oftentimes, the provider may not bill the actual costs, believing that the parent(s) could not afford them. However, providers may well provide those ``costs'' when responding to market surveys or other ``payment rate'' questions concerning costs, resulting in receipt of payments which exceed those actually charged. We believe that this revision will eliminate such occurrences. This clarification does not represent a change in policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Payments for Higher Quality Care Under Title IV&hyph;A Child Care Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Currently, Federal Financial Participation (FFP) for title IV&hyph;A child care is available for the lowest of the actual charge for care, the local market rate for that category of care or the applicable statewide limit. The local market rate is based on the 75th percentile cost of care in the local area. We continue to believe that the 75th percentile is a reasonable definition of local market rate. This level represents a balance between concerns about fiscal accountability and accessibility to most services. In addition, we believe that requiring local market rates to be set at the 75th percentile has raised the general level of reimbursement to providers. We recognize, however, that the 75th percentile may not be sufficient to purchase some higher quality care. Therefore, to permit States to recognize and reward higher quality care, we propose amending &sect;255.4(a) to define the actual charge for care that meets the State's objective criteria for higher quality care as the local market rate for such care. We will provide FFP for the actual charge for such care, subject to the statewide limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While we recognize that State licensing or regulatory certification contributes to high quality care, we do not believe that licensing or regulation is the sole criterion or indicator of a higher quality of care. The proposed amendment to &sect;255.4(a) requires that the State-defined higher quality criteria will be in addition to existing State licensing or regulatory requirements. For example, the State's objective criteria for higher quality care might be that providers have a Child Development Associate (CDA) credential coupled with lower than regulatory staff/child ratios, or the State could choose the Head Start Program Performance Standards or other nationally or State-recognized criteria as its criteria for higher quality. We do not propose a national standard or definition for higher quality care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, it is not the intention that this regulation be used to circumvent the regulation at &sect;255.4(a)(2)(iii) which establishes local market rates at the 75th percentile based on a survey of providers in an area. We expect that, because the State's criteria for higher quality care will be above the licensing and regulatory standards generally in effect, the State will make payments at the actual cost (subject only to the statewide limit) under this provision less frequently than payments are made at the 75th percentile. Payments for higher quality care would apply, then, to only a few providers in an area, not the majority of providers. These providers still would be included in local market rate surveys. We are also proposing to amend &sect;255.1(i) to require States to specify in the Supportive Services Plan their objective criteria for higher quality care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

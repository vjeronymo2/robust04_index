			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GLENDALE COUNCIL TENTATIVELY OKS A 3RD DOWNZONING  </P> <P> The Glendale City Council gave preliminary approval Tuesday to the third  proposal in three weeks by resident groups requesting zoning changes that would  forbid apartment construction in their neighborhoods.  </P> <P> The council voted to set public hearings for a group of 10 homeowners wanting  to turn 18 multifamily-zoned properties in the 300 and 400 blocks of Mission  Road into single-family lots.  </P> <P> "The residential neighborhood's topography is hilly; most land parcels are  small, and the streets are ill-equipped to accommodate the increased parking  and traffic demands," City Planning Director John McKenna said in support of  the proposal.  </P> <P> The council is encouraging voluntary downzoning of neighborhoods from apartment  to single-family zoning to deal with the city's population explosion.  </P></p>

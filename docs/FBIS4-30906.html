			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Kozlany, West Bohemia, May 29 (CTK) -- The Benes  Decrees, ordering the expulsion of the Sudeten German population  after World War Two, can on no account be revised, President  Vaclav Havel said here today. The political position of the  Czech Republic on the question was completely clear, he told  journalists in the village where Edvard Benes, Czechoslovak  president in 1935-38 and 1945-48, was born 110 years ago  yesterday. Revising the decrees would mean revising the entire  post-war situation, he said. "The decrees were a reflection of  the time," and their study is a matter for historians, he said.    In a speech today to mark the annivesary of the birth of  this  key figure in Czechoslovak history, Havel said Benes's merits,  "though overshadowed by his dilemmas, defeats and problematic  acts, are unquestionable".    "He was a great man who made a worthy contribution to our  state; he was a figure whom history at times placed before great  dilemmas," he said. Coming to terms with Benes's acts meant  coming to terms with the cruelties of history, he said. [passage  omitted]    The 110th anniversary of Benes's birth is being celebrated  in  a time when his life's work can be analysed and evaluated  "freely, objectively (and) publicly," Havel said. His life "not  only dramatically reflects the fate of the Czech nation, but  also exposes some of the fundamental and urgent questions of our  modern existence as a state and the basic dilemmas of politics,"  Havel said.    Havel also laid flowers at the bust of Edvard Benes and the  memorial plaque at his house of birth, and opened an exhibition  of Benes's life in the village school. [passage omitted]</p>

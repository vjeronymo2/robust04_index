			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Management (Marketing &amp; Advertising): Pulling together on the high seas - In the run-up to Cowes Keith Wheatley says corporate yachting has chartered a new course Thick black clouds were building to the west and a squall filled Creightons' giant spinnaker to bursting point. The 80ft maxi-yacht thundered up the Solent in need of a sail change. The mixed crew of Touche Ross staff and clients were about to get stuck in. When the spinnaker was released, thousands of square feet of billowing nylon came down in a rush. Willing arms flailed and strained to gather it aboard before it became the Solent's most brightly coloured fishing net. 'I've never been to any client event where people are so relaxed so quickly,' comments George Owen, marketing director for the Praxis software arm of Touche Ross. 'You're wearing casual clothes, winding winches together. There isn't any time for formality.' Until the past three or four years, corporate use of yachts almost certainly meant champagne, lobster and a 'jolly' for the board and its valued customers. The recession killed that. In some respects it looked as if the recreational boating market might also be in a terminal condition. Every south coast marina had more boats laid-up in the car park than afloat on their moorings. Yet what has emerged is a strong and growing market of company-related competitive sailing, both for corporate entertainment and in-house training purposes. Companies that are used to the costs of Wimbledon or Ascot find it increasingly appealing and effective to be able to put 20 people aboard a boat such as Creightons for less than Pounds 2,000. The result is that clients invited on such outings are more likely to be handed a set of oilskins than the customary umbrella and pen. 'We expected our UK fleet usage to be leisure-based, as the boats are in the Mediterranean,' says Vanessa Lowe, marketing manager for Sunsail. 'In fact, we have a huge demand to charter them as a fleet for corporate racing and training.' From a marina base at Port Solent near Portsmouth, Sunsail runs a large operation that involves handling the 35ft Beneteau club/racers as if they were hire cars. Probably the most common pattern is for an industry or sector to set up a challenge and then the yachts are rented by individual companies who put their team aboard. Brewers, accountants and the advertising industry follow this method. Sunsail organises all the courses and race starts and finishes - even to the extent of warning competitors firmly that the protest committee is away on a golfing holiday. The Industry Sailing Challenge, sponsored by T&amp;N, the UK engineering company, has seen 212 companies and 3,000 competitors in its seven-year history. This year's finalists included Richard Ellis, Ford, SG Warburg and Touche Ross. 'For most sailors once around the Isle of Wight is more than enough. Twice around, which means sailing through the night, is very testing,' says Clive Jacobs, the former broadcaster, whose company Ocean Racing Agency owns and manages the event. 'It requires not just the determination to succeed but stamina to go with it. I think that's why so many firms who compete use the event for leadership, problem solving and decision-making under stress, and - above all - the development of team working.' 'We wanted to be involved in something like this because it's sporting, not conspicuous consumption by a few senior people,' says Owen. 'The fact that most of us don't know anything about sailing is a plus. Learning how to learn together is very important.' Trainers point out that one of the advantages of yachting is that little can be achieved by individuals, the tasks are too large and too heavy, and that the group is in a self-contained universe with no outside distractions and a simple common goal. 'The team-work side of sailing on a boat this big and complex takes them by surprise,' says Tony Allen, a solicitor and one of the co-owners of Creightons. 'They arrive as strangers and within an hour or so they're touching hands on winches and shoulder to shoulder on halyards. That kind of thing doesn't happen in daily office life. 'We never get blase about seeing it happen. I spend half my week in an office and people just don't intermingle that easily, although these kinds of physical challenges show that they want to.'</p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Stock exchange takes a matador to Taurus / Analysis of the history of one of the City's biggest computer projects AFTER more than a decade of planning and an estimated Pounds 400m spent on its development, London's planned share settlement system ranks as one of the biggest computer projects ever conceived in the City. Could it really all be scrapped? Yes, if the London Stock Exchange's board agrees with a proposal to be put to it today by its chief executive, Mr Peter Rawlins. The technical difficulties standing in the way of completing the project are just too big, he will say: it is better to start again from scratch than to go on. Most of the big banks, brokers and registrars in the City, which have spent large sums on Taurus in recent years, were unaware yesterday of the likely demise of the project. The news prompted anguish, anger, recrimination: in the aftermath of today's meeting, it is likely to send reverberations throughout City boardrooms. Mr John Lamb, in charge of share registration and custody business at National Westminster, summed up the mood: 'For the City, it would be a very, very sad thing. Hells bells, we've got one of the least attractive settlement systems of any major stock market.' The system for settling share transactions has become one of the main battlegrounds in the competition between European financial centres, and is the area where London comes out worst. The process of exchanging shares for cash is slow - it takes up to three weeks - and cumbersome, with a series of paper-based administration procedures needed for each share sale. Taurus - which stands for the transfer and automated registration of uncertificated stock - was meant to end all that, enabling London to leapfrog its rivals into a leading position internationally. A decision to terminate it now would prove a fittingly spectacular end to a troubled history. The idea that share ownership should be transferred like money in the banking system, through computerised book entries on a computer, was first put forward by a stock exchange committee in the early 1980s. In the rush to build a new trading infrastructure for the stock market in time for Big Bang in October 1986, though, the decidely unglamorous area of settlement was put to one side. The idea was rekindled in 1986, as Big Bang and soaring share prices drew small shareholders into the stock market, leading to an explosion in the number of share transactions passing through the market and a backlog of unsettled bargains that at one stage reached Pounds 3bn. With Bank of England prodding, renewed efforts were made to build an automated book-entry system. If any one decision can be blamed for the quagmire into which the Taurus development has become bogged down, it was the abandonment in 1988 of a plan for a Pounds 60m central database to maintain records of all shareholdings in the UK stock market. Also, the registrars who maintain records of shareholdings in the UK feared that the stock exchange would itself become a central registrar, putting them out of business. The result was a compromise, designed to protect the interests of the many users of the London stock market - registrars and custodians, offering share maintenance services to companies and investors, as well as listed companies  -who wanted a transparent system for share ownership that enabled them to identify who owned their shares. The Department of Trade and Industry, keen to protect small shareholders, pushed for levels of security and investor protection that professionals grumbled were unnecessary. As Mr Mike Jones, head of development at brokers Capel Cure Myers, said yesterday: 'We tried to leave the present relationships in place, and design a system around it.' The conclusion of the head of operations at one London investment bank was briefer: 'We've ended up with a camel.' The Taurus plan is based on a series of databases around the City maintained by brokers, bankers, custodians, investors and registrars, each of which holds records of shareholdings. The databases were to be linked on an electronic network, making it possible both to transfer stock between them and to take an overall picture of a particular company's shareholdings. It is now clear that this system, finally adopted in 1989, was far more complex than anyone had predicted. First, the Department of Trade and Industry took more than a year to amend UK company law to recognise automated transfer of share ownership. Those legal changes were implemented to fit the Taurus system: it was unclear yesterday whether they would suit any other automated share transfer system that may succeed it. Technical difficulties have brought Taurus to the brink of failure. Testing of the stock exchange's own system, which acts as a central hub for the network, began last October. Wider testing, involving securities firms, started in January. This process, expected to be the simplest part of a test cycle lasting until at least the end of the year, has already fallen behind. The stock exchange admitted yesterday that the testing has been 'slow and patchy'. One broking firm said that, rather than the 154 functions that were meant to have been tested when the latest phase began in January, only 50 have been tried. If Taurus is scrapped, what could follow? 'It's all very well people knocking Taurus - but is there an alternative being proposed?' said Ms Alison Renison, head of Taurus development at Barclays. 'Whatever happens, the UK has to have a book-entry system.' During the years that London has been working on Taurus, other financial centres have moved quickly to enhance their share settlement systems. Frankfurt now boasts share settlement in less than the three-day cycle recommended by G30, the Washington-based think tank, and Paris last year moved to an automated system. With computing costs now far lower than they were five years ago, there were already voices yesterday urging a return to the relatively simple solution of a central database for the stock market. Whether City vested interests can be reconciled to make a quick and cheap solution possible this time around remains to be seen.

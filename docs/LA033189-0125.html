			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFENSE SECTOR STRONG BUT FEBRUARY ORDERS DIP 2.3%  </P> <P> Orders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods dropped 2.3% in February, the  second straight monthly decline, the government said Thursday in a report  offering more evidence that the economy may be slowing.  </P> <P> Orders fell to a seasonally adjusted $230.7 billion last month after dropping  1.2% in January, the first back-to-back declines since orders fell for four  consecutive months starting in February, 1986, the Commerce Department said.  </P> <P> Last month's decline was in line with other government reports that showed  slower growth in February and with widespread expectations that the economy  will cool off in this seventh year of its record peacetime expansion.  </P> <P> "This confirms that February was a very weak month," said economist David Wyss  of Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass. "It leaves unanswered the question  of whether this is the start of the slowdown we're expecting."  </P> <P> The decline would have been even bigger were it not for a 22.4% surge last  month in defense orders, which are subject to wide swings depending on when  government contracts are signed.  </P> <P> Excluding the military, orders were down 3% last month.  </P> <P> The biggest negative factor in last month's orders picture was a 7.2% decline  in the transportation category, reflecting fewer orders for planes and cars.  </P> <P> But even excluding the volatile transportation area, all other orders were down  1.4% last month.  </P> <P> The economy grew a robust 3.9% last year, the best showing in four years, but  analysts believe that the pace will be closer to 2.7% this year, with the  slowdown most evident in the second and third quarters.  </P> <P> Factory orders had increased a healthy 9.7% in 1988 in part because of an  export-led boom that showed signs of stalling late in the year.  </P> <P> The back-to-back declines in orders during the first two months of 1989 may  suggest that the Fed's slowdown campaign is taking effect, Wyss said.  </P> <P> "The Fed's been raising rates for a year now," he said. "It's about time we  started to see it in the real growth (statistics)."  </P> <P> In the key category of non-defense capital goods, considered a good indicator  of industry investment plans, orders dropped 8.2% in February to $37.1 billion  after rising 2.3% in January.  </P> <P> Orders for "big ticket" durable goods, items expected to last three years or  more, were down 3.3% to a seasonally adjusted $124.2 billion after dropping  2.8% during the previous month.  </P> <P> Declines were recorded in nearly all major industries, including a 3.2% drop in  orders for primary metals, with the steel industry accounting for much of that  decline.  </P> <P> Demand for non-durable goods was down 1% to $106.5 billion last month, with the  largest decreases coming in orders for chemicals and rubber and plastics  products.  </P> <P> Shipments of manufactured goods were down 1.7% to a seasonally adjusted $227.6  billion in February. It was the biggest decline since March, 1986, when  shipments were down 2.4%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FACTORY ORDERS  </P> <P> Orders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods dropped 2.3% in February to a  seasonally adjusted $230.7 billion.  </P> <P> Source: Department of Commerce  </P></p>

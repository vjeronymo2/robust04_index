			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Minsk Radio Minsk Network in Belarusian  on 23 June at 0900 GMT broadcasts the live "special newscast  Presidential Marathon" moderated by Alyaksandr Awcharenka.    Awcharenka begins by saying that polling stations opened  five  hours earlier to elect "the first president in the history of  Belarus," however this historic event was not accompanied by  "crowds lining up to cast their votes." He adds that according  to reports from various oblasts, voting is still "gaining  momentum."    Correspondent Ivan Hladkin, reporting live from the Central  Electoral Commission, says that 7,326,550 people are "included  on the lists for voting by secret ballot." Over the 10 days  granted by the law for those unable to come to the polls on 23  June, some 279,938 people have cast their votes, which amounts  to 3.8 percent of the total number of voters. As of 0900 GMT,  39.1 percent of voters have come to the polls in Brest Oblast  and voting has been completed at 15 polling stations:     -  In Gomel Oblast -- 38 percent have voted, voting completed  at 11 polling stations;    -  In Vitebsk Oblast -- 37.2 percent,  voting completed at 19 polling stations;    -  In Mogilev Oblast -- 35  percent, voting completed at five polling stations;    -  In Grodno  Oblast -- 33.6 percent, voting completed at 12 polling  stations;    -  In Minsk Oblast -- 33.2 percent, voting completed at  five polling stations.  "Only" 20 percent of voters have turned out by 0900 in the city  of Minsk.     According to Hladkin, a number of people's deputies  representing Popular Front Chairman Zyanon Paznyak have sent a  motion to the Central Electoral Commission claiming that at one  of the polling stations in Smalyavichskiy Rayon, people were  forced to vote for one of the candidates. The commission has  passed the motion to the prosecutor's office. Several other  "petty" violations have been monitored at other stations.    Vyachaslaw Makalchuk, reporter from Pinsk, then makes a  telephone call to the studio and briefs the listeners on the  situation in the city and the cost of holding the elections in  the city. Makalchuk says that voter turnout has been "good" and  by 1000 GMT "a majority of Pinsk Oblast voters" will have cast  their votes.    Program moderator Awcharenka then reads a report received  from the Belarusian Embassy in the United States, which says  that the Boston city administration resolved to "hoist a  Belarusian flag over the city on 23-25 June" as a "symbol of  solidarity of one democratic state with another."    Program moderator Awcharenka then concludes the program  saying that the next live connection with the Central Electoral  Commission will be at 1200 GMT.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the Salvadoran elections,  scheduled for 20 March.    Unity Movement presidential candidate Jorge Martinez has  advocated the promotion of a moral market economy based on "the  ethical values of man that serve as the root for the  construction of an economic order oriented toward the promotion  of increased national well-being" and which will accomplish this  objective "by better distributing economic resources, by  securing sustained economic growth, and by an equitable  distribution of income." Martinez explained that "the system's  stability depends on social justice." (San Salvador LA PRENSA  GRAFICA in Spanish 24 Feb 94 p 8)    A poll conducted by the Jose Simeon Canas Catholic  University  and Central American University reveals that the majority of the  people have little interest in the elections process, do not  trust the elections process or the country's elections, and have  no trust in the state's institutionality. The poll reveals that  36 percent of the people have not decided yet who they will for  vote on 20 March. The poll reveals that what the people most  want is jobs, fighting crime, and the end of poverty. What the  people most want, the poll reveals, has to do with the economy,  and then with crime. (San Salvador Radio Cadena YSU in Spanish  1800 GMT 24 Feb 94)    Nationalist Republican Alliance, Arena, presidential  candidate Armando Calderon Sol has regretted the 24 March attack  on Miriam Diaz, a leader of the Farabundo Marti National  Liberation Front, FMLN. He said: "Violence has been left  behind. The Salvadoran people are tired of violence, including  verbal violence, to say nothing of physical violence. We regret  this event, we condemn it, we repudiate it, and we are asking  that a thorough investigation be conducted." He emphasized that  attacks are not the road, "elections are the road, democracy is  the road." (San Salvador Radio Cadena YSU in Spanish 1800 GMT 25  Feb 94)    Arena candidates for the 20 March elections, including the  presidential and vice presidential candidates, Armando Calderon  Sol and Enrique Borgo Bustamante, respectively, have met in San  Salvador to work out the final details of the elections. Arena  sources say this is the only party that has representatives in  the most remote corners of El Salvador. (San Salvador Radio  Cadena YSU in Spanish 1800 GMT 2 Mar 94)    Roberto Escobar, the presidential candidate for the National  Conciliation Party, PCN, responded to a question on his party's  platform by stating: "All the economic measures envisaged in  our political platform are congruent with the improved social  well-being of Salvadorans. We understand social well-being," he  noted, "as the satisfaction of educational, health, housing,  recreational, sports, cultural, and spiritual needs." He  explained that economic and social development cannot be  separated. (San Salvador LA PRENSA GRAFICA in Spanish 1 Mar 94 p  8)</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 3 June -- The situation that arose in the  State Duma as a result of the examination of this year's federal  draft budget should not be dramatized, said Valentin Kovalev,  deputy chairman of the State Duma.    The clause on the proposed military expenditure was the  stumbling block: The State Duma approved it as 37 trillion  rubles in the first reading, but the Federation Council brought  it up to 55 trillion, thereby increasing it by 18 trillion  rubles. "I want to stress that these decisions are not final,  but just a process; the parliamentarians are continuing their  considerable and tense work," Valentin Kovalev told the  ITAR-TASS correspondent who asked him for his comments.    "I do not think that the military budget is an issue for  conflict, although I would like to remind you that a  conciliation procedure exists within the framework of the  Federal Assembly between the State Duma and the Federation  Council," he said. "We proceed from the premise that the  conciliation procedure should be permanent, and we will resolve  all contradictory questions within its framework consistently.  I am convinced that the chambers will reach agreement,"  Valentin Kovalev stressed.    Asked what the reaction of the deputies in the State Duma  might be to the Federation Council's decision, although not yet  final, he noted that "predictions are thankless things,  especially if one takes into account the fact that we have 10  factions and deputies' groups plus another unregistered group of  deputies. That means there are 11 points of view on every  question. Proceeding from this, it is difficult to make any  prediction, but I am convinced that within the framework of the  conciliation procedure which operates not only between the  chambers but but also between the factions and deputies' groups,  we will reach a mutually acceptable decision which will be to  the liking not only of the Federal Assembly and the government,  but also of the country as a whole," Valentin Kovalev stressed.</p>

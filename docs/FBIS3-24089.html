Roshchina: "Mayor of Vladivostok Seeks </F> Revenge, Creates Own Party"]    [Text] "Party," it is a word, of course, spoken  emphatically. However, in this case it may simply represent a  public organization of V. Cherepkov supporters which opposes the  kray's "corrupt Communist groups" in power headed by Ye.  Nazdratenko. All of the new organization's verbal and written  efforts indicate that the latter is so.    The decision by "Cherepkovians" to form the new group was  made at the last meeting held between the mayor and the  community in the "Gray House" on January 15th.    After lengthy debate those gathered elected a presidium of  active members and approved a name for the organization,  "Assotsiatsiya izbirateley [Association of Voters]." The name,  in the opinion of those who spoke, reflects the organization's  democratic atmosphere and its open membership not only for the  citizens of Vladivostok, but for those in the kray, and in any  other political party or association.    The primary task of the organization at present is to strive  to win in the upcoming elections to the kray Duma. In doing so,  the group hopes to gain a significant number, if not a majority  of seats so as to present a serious legislative counterbalance  to the kray executive power.    We have lost some elections, stated V. Cherepkov, and won  some too, like Zhirinovskiy and Nazdratenko. We cannot waste  time. Today candidates were selected from other representative  bodies that will finance the elections for them. They are  already being instructed on how to present themselves in public  and how to appeal to the voters. Therefore, we must act in an  organized fashion, not haphazardly.    As far as financing for the new organization is concerned,  Cherepkov noted that an account already exists, into which money  is being deposited in his support. He said that it is his desire  to transfer the account over to the Assotsiatsiya izbirateley  [Association of Voters].    Judging by all appearances, the organization's first step  will be to submit a whole package of demands to various  authorities, starting with the President and ending with the  local SMIP [mass information and propaganda media]. From the  president the organization is demanding the reinstatement of its  former representative in the kray, V. Butov; from SMIP, the  publication of a list of people who prepared the order leading  to Butov's removal. The association is also demanding two hours  a week of radio broadcast time from the Primorskaya  teleradiokompaniya, and one hour a week of television time: like  the governor, the mayor also wants his own "Mayor's Hour."    A demand was also made to put PKTV back on the air, and yes,  this time without specifying to whom the demand was being  addressed. While on its crusade to capture the mass media, it  has not been beyond the association to utilize the services of  even KRASNOYE ZNAMYA, which is not well liked by the  organization. The mayor stated, for example, that "if we are not  allotted at least one release a week for publishing our  association's material, it will be necessary to pose the  question of cutting off KRASNOYE ZNAMYA's financing at the  taxpayers' expense."    Cherepkov also mentioned intentions to create yet another  new  newspaper (apparently at the expense the city administration),  which will tentatively be called "Golos naroda [Voice of the  People]," and will reflect the opinions of the voters.    For those who are curious: the association's meetings, which  V. Cherepkov's will participate in - and for whom they will  simultaneously serve as meetings with the community - will be  conducted on Saturdays at 14:00 hours in the city administration  building.</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / South African Referendum: Business greets spur to growth BUSINESSMEN in South Africa reacted with jubilation to yesterday's referendum result which, they said, would help their continued re-integration into the world business community while improving domestic growth prospects. The business community campaigned strongly in favour of a 'yes' vote, with some companies going as far as to warn employees that the consequences of a 'no' vote would be large-scale retrenchments. The South African Chamber of Business said yesterday: 'The decisive outcome of the referendum will undoubtedly have a positive effect on the medium- and long-term performance of the economy and should lead to any remaining trade and other sanctions being lifted soon.' Businessmen cautioned, however, that this was merely the beginning of a difficult road forward. Mr Tony Norton, president of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), said the result 'doesn't guarantee anything. It is merely a condition precedent for economic progress.' Financial markets moved sharply upwards in response to the result. The overall index on the Johannesburg stock exchange rose by 1.2 per cent, and the industrial index was 1.4 per cent higher. The financial rand, the investment currency for foreigners, closed at R3.71 to the dollar, compared with Tuesday's close of R3.96. Movements of this currency are a barometer of foreign sentiment. Mr Richard Jesse, analyst at stockbrokers Martin and Co, said markets had taken a simple view of the referendum. 'No is bad and Yes is good and the bigger the Yes the bigger the good.' The result had removed a major source of uncertainty. Mr Brian Gilbertson, chairman of the mining house Gencor, said the result 'was a great release of tension because it shows clearly that the initiatives of the state president have very great support.' He said the result meant a number of the company's projects, such as the Columbus stainless steel project and the expansion of the aluminium producer Alusaf, were now possible. They had been held up because of the lack of foreign investment and access to foreign markets. Mr Norton said the result showed people were not only ruled by their hearts; that in the quiet of the polling booth simple issues like jobs, the value of their houses and savings, counted more. Mr Paul Kruger, managing director of Sasol, South Africa's largest fuel and chemicals company, said the result showed 'a general realisation of the realities in South Africa. The (white) electorate has now been satisfied that the state president is not willing to give everything away, that he has certain economic bottom lines.' He added 'It also dispels the myth that the process is not irreversible. There is no reason why any country in the world should continue with sanctions.' Mr Norton said he felt a key issue emerging from the referendum was the strong and competent leadership shown by Mr de Klerk. He thought this, and the size of the 'yes' vote, would impress foreigners. There was no doubt the result would boost the country's trade prospects, and prospects for foreign investment were also enhanced, he said. 'Today was one step closer to when the notebooks become cheque-books.'</p>

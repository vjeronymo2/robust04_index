			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Civil service shake-up plan near The government is finalising proposals for wide-ranging reform of the civil service career structure, allowing greater external competition for top posts and giving Whitehall departments more auto-nomy in senior staff appointments. Ministers will outline their proposals in a consultative paper next month that will mark the most important stage yet in the government's plans to reform the top levels of the service. Among proposals under consideration is reform of the controversial fast-stream entry system, which ensures that a select few entrants are groomed for top Whitehall jobs at the peak of their careers. The system has been accused of creating a self-replicating elite, of largely male, white, Oxbridge generalists. Officials have found that most large private-sector companies have some sort of procedure for giving high-fliers a wide range of experience to prepare them for top management jobs. But it is rare for fast-stream candidates to be selected before they have entered the organisation - high-fliers are normally identified according to their performance in the job. New proposals may also give greater autonomy to departments in deciding who should get fast-stream status. Under the present system, fast-stream applicants are chosen by the Civil Service Selection Board. The document will outline ways in which the government can recruit more people with strong private-sector experience into the upper echelons of Whitehall. A study by the Cabinet Office efficiency unit last year recommended opening more jobs to outsiders and advertising top posts. The report also called for regular assessments of how leading civil servants perform their tasks.</p>

This action is taken to further define criteria, by which FmHA will monitor the lender's future recovery from unsatisfied guaranteed borrower accounts. There is no formal procedure at present for monitoring these accounts. The intended effect is to maximize collections from unsatisfied guaranteed borrower accounts and to minimize the financial loss to the Government.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Written comments must be submitted by July 5, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit written comments in duplicate, to the Office of the Chief, Regulations, Analysis and Control Branch (RACB), Farmers Home Administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Room 6348, South Agriculture Building, 14th and Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20250.

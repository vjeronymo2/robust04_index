			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Esteemed listeners, during the broadcasting of this  newscast we received a communique from the Romanian National  Unity Party [PUNR], phoned in by PUNR Vice President Ioan Gavra,  which reads as follows:    A protocol on a political understanding between the Social  Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] and the PUNR on setting up a  coalition government was signed on 1 February in the evening.  This openness achieved by the PUNR is the most important  political moment in Romania life since the parliamentary  elections of September 1992. Within the framework of this  political partnership, the PDSR and the PUNR have established  the scope of their cooperation at parliamentary, governmental,  and territorial levels.    The assumption of the political responsibility of the  government act by the PUNR will take concrete shape in the  drafting of an anti- crisis and anti-inflationist governmental  program capable of dynamizing the mechanisms of reform and  privatization and of contributing to the efficient resolution of  the people's social problems -- the communique received by  telephone from Mr. Ioan Gavra points out.    Contacted also by telephone, PDSR Executive President Adrian  Nastase confirmed the signing of the protocol and said that it  is the outcome of negotiations conducted on the evening of 31  January by the five parties of the parliamentary majority,  namely the PDSR, PUNR, the Socialist Party of Labor, the Greater  Romania Party, and the Agrarian Democratic Party of Romania.</p>

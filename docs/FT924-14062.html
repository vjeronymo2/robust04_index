			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Foreign groups to keep up California tax fight BARCLAYS BANK of the UK and other foreign companies with operations in California are to continue their eight-year legal challenge against the state's 'unitary tax' method, despite a decision by the US Supreme Court not to take up the case. Unitary tax is calculated on the basis of a company's worldwide earnings and taxes a portion of them according to the percentage of activity in the state. A company that has 10 per cent of its world sales, property and payroll in California, for example, would be taxed on 10 per cent of its worldwide profits even if the California operation makes no profit. Most other states and the US government base such taxes on a percentage of profits reported within their borders. Barclays Bank, with the support of other multinational corporations and several foreign governments, filed a suit eight years ago charging that the California tax assessment system was unconstitutional as it interfered with the US federal government's ability to conduct foreign policy. 'The Supreme Court decision is a disappointment,' said Ms Joanne Garvey, a San Francisco attorney acting for Barclays. But the fight would continue in the California state court system where a decision was pending on another element of the dispute, she said. At issue is Dollars 792m in taxes paid up to 1988, when California relaxed its unitary tax rules, offering foreign multinational companies an alternative tax assessment method based only on US operations. Barclays, on behalf of all foreign multinationals, is seeking a refund. The California Supreme Court had referred back to the state Appeals Court the issue of whether calculating unitary tax placed an unfair burden on foreign multinationals, Ms Garvey said. Barclays' challenge was presented to the country's chief justices after it was rejected by the California Supreme Court in May. Last week they decided unanimously not to reconsider the state court's decision.</p>

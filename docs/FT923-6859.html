			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Arts: Brecon Jazz 92 DURING last weekend, the little Welsh town of Brecon was a curious melting pot. If you had a 'stroller' ticket, you could linger in the sunshine and showers of the roped-off riverside meadow bandstand or munch a vegeburger at the Museum car park stage, enjoying groups from Rod Mason's Hot Five to the cool mainstream of guitarist Howard Alden's Quintet. Beyond these exclusion zones, however, it was you, Krukke (the Dutch marching band) and the mob. But if the streets were swaying to the rhythm of ''Ere we go]', the Guildhall, Market Hall and Christ College echoed to more urbane and sometimes illuminating sounds. Some 12,000 seats were sold for the weekend's 'sit down' concerts alone and the programming was glorious. On Friday, a mainstream dream ticket featured trumpeter Clark Terry, saxophonist Lew Tabackin and guitarist Kenny Burrell, while down the road, Brazilian percussionist Nana Vasconcelos invoked the spirit of equatorial Brazil. On Saturday, pianist Dick Hyman played and talked authoritatively through the jazz repertory and later, feisty Courtney Pine gave an account of the state of the art in the UK. On Sunday afternoon, the blues and boogie of septuagenarian pianist Jay McShann gave way to the 'cubop' of Irakere. Pianists Michel Petrucciani and Bheki Mseleku, back to back, set the swinging in motion on Friday. In his trio, the tiny Frenchman delivers for EMI's Blue Note label what its roster of 25 years ago did. Thick, distinctive melodies are carried at a lick, Petrucciani occasionally dropping a gear and motoring off in another direction. His version of the Charlie Parker standard 'Billie's Bounce' cascaded so brightly off the keyboard, it hardly mattered that the overall sound quality was what you would expect from in-flight entertainment headphones. In another European Arts Festival sponsored-performance, Chicago-born tenorist Johnny Griffin, who is based in France, filled the same space with his regular rhythm section. Griffin is a prickly character who plays with a 'get outta the way' urgency - even the ballads on this night had a hectoring tone. In the Fifties, he spent some time with Monk, and his own recent originals have a similar strongly rhythmic quirk. The band, whose members look like characters from a Godard noir movie, has in Charles Bellonzi a drummer with time, presence and a way with brushes not often heard. The 22-year-old trumpet player Roy Hargrove has a crispness and attacking style which could run with Griffin's. Instead, he has worked recently with that other sax athlete Sonny Rollins. He brought his own loose-limbed quintet to Brecon and along with altoist Antonio Hart kept the dynamics changing by the simple technique of walking into the wings every five minutes. The soaring and flaring originals, as well as 'Milestones', thrilled in places, but their energy would have been dissipated completely without the sharply focused back-beat of drummer Gregory Hutchinson. Brecon usually scores highly by programming the irresistible (the tenor and sweet cornet of Scott Hamilton and Warren Vache, for example) with the unmissable. This year's coup was two exhilarating shows from the formidable trio of super-guitarist Pat Metheny, melodious bassist Dave Holland and the taut drumming of Roy Haynes. Metheny's cheesy grin, tousled hair and down-home image belie the consummate technician and composer who lurks inside. He said recently that the way he is playing now stems from the pain suffered in finishing a long-standing love affair. If his performance on Sunday resulted from that trauma, his loss is our gain. Alternating between a beaten up semi-acoustic, whose bridge is held in place by a toothbrush, and a futuristic synclavier guitar synth, Metheny ranged effortlessly between tear-jerking and bucolic originals ('Farmer's Trust') and Ornette Coleman's controlled hysteria ('Lawyers'). His improvisational technique is to hook you on a pretty melody and invent endlessly and mellifluously close to it. He takes on the whole gamut of guitar styles seamlessly too, from the metal posturing of 'Questions and Answers' to the studied melancholy of 'Lonely Woman'. Holland is entirely sympathetic in accompaniment, developing and extending the leader's themes rather than merely suspending ideas as a solo bass will often do. But Metheny dominates the ensemble entirely and the contrasting harmonics of samples on the synclavier to the truthful nylon strings of the acoustic was compelling. Well done Brecon.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The government's call for people to surrender their  arms does not seem to have been heeded in Bujumbura. After the  expiration of the ultimatum yesterday at 1800 local time, the  possession of about 10 firearms was declared in Rohero Zone, six  arms in Ngagara, and one in Bwiza. No arms were declared or  surrendered in Musaga, Buyenzi or Nyakabiga. The town's  northern zones of Kamenge, Kinama, and Cibitoke, whose leaders  we met, remain tense. The head of Kamenge Zone said he no  longer has access to his office. The head of Kinama Zone told  us that people had left the zone en masse. Only armed elements  remain there.</p>

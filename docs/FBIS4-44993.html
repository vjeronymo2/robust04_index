			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ja'far Ra'id: "Challenges Facing President </F> Rafsanjani"]    [Text] The majority of members of the Majles belong to a  bloc strongly linked to the bazaar--the big traditional  merchants--in the Iranian homeland generally and in the capital,  Tehran, particularly. This bloc has become known as the Resalat  group, in reference to a daily morning newspaper RESALAT  (Message) that speaks for them.    The Resalat bloc does not rally under the banner of a party  organization or the like. The group is united only by ties of  mutual acquaintance and cooperation based on common principles  and economic interests.    Terms used in the media, such as rightist, leftist,  fundamentalist, and other similar terms do not apply to the  Iranian Resalat group. Basically, we can say that it is  religiously and culturally conservative, but believes in  allowing free scope to the private sector, supporting the  national economy, and resisting foreign hegemony. The group  maintains very strong links to circles of the ulama and their  entourage of religious students, especially in Qom at present  and in Mashhad.    It is certain that the streets of the Iranian bazaar, in  agreement with the halls of Shiite religious schools, were what  initially undertook to spread the seeds of the Iranian  revolution, sustaining it physically and morally until it took  root, grew, flourished, and bore fruit.    In the summer of 1963, the bazaar led a violent uprising in  Tehran, Qom, and Mashhad, which the shah's government suppressed  without mercy, slaying or wounding many victims. In the wake of  the uprising, Imam Khomeyni, the mastermind of the bloody  uprising, was banished from the country. He remained with his  family in his place of exile in Turkey for a year and a few  months, then went to Iraq and settled in al-Najaf. He worked  openly and secretly to overthrow the imperial system in Iran. He  succeeded in realizing his goal in February 1979, after about 16  years. The bazaar had been the firm base of the revolution since  it began fermenting in the forties. Leftist and extremist  organizations joined the revolutionary mass shortly before the  outbreak of the revolution. That was the unruly sea that  overthrew a venerable regime whose roots went back 3,000 years  into history and brought an entirely new regime, the Islamic  Republic of Iran.    Using methods at which only they excel, the extremist  organizations succeeded in riding the wave of the Iranian  revolution during its prime and infiltrating strategic centers  in it. During the first days, they publicly or secretly  eliminated most of those they considered their enemies. So  influential did they become in sensitive areas that they  eliminated the chosen elite of revolutionary leaders that had  sprung from that conservative traditional milieu, such as  Ayatollah Beheshti and Ayatollah Motahhari. Some of them they  assassinated individually; in the case of over 70 of them they  blew up the hall in which they had gathered. With the speed of  an irresistible whirlwind, these extremist groups nationalized  companies and institutions and seized homes and real estate on  various pretexts. However, the revolution's top leadership was  gradually able to free itself from these extremist groups, one  of which was the Tudeh party, the largest Moscow-oriented  communist party in the Middle East. Some of the party's leaders  are still in prison. Death on the gallows awaited some of its  military leaders.    Days upon days pass. Domestic events react with  international  and regional developments. Circumstances help the traditional  bazaar group regroup and rebuild their ranks. They seize the  opportunity to banish extremist ulama such as Mohtashami and  Khoi'niha from the parliamentary arena. The group slips quietly  without noise into the Majles. It chooses one of its supporters,  Hojjat ol-Eslam 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, as speaker of the Majles.  The group practically holds the reins of the Iranian Majles. It  emerges into view as able to exert more influence on President  'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani than the hard-liners who had  ridden roughshod throughout the third session of the Majles,  which preceded the present session.    For the first time since the revolution, observers can  witness in Iran the formation of a class or quasi-class on the  way to gaining power in the country and adopting a policy with  more or less clear features on the domestic and foreign level.  It then will be feasible for the major forces that control the  courses of international policies to enter into fruitful  dialogue with the bodies representing that class or quasi-class  for the benefit of Iran, the region, and the entire human  community. This class or quasi-class, starting from its  interests, its historical roots and social position, and its  relations with other sectors of the Iranian people, is trying to  play an active role in the following four directions:    1. Not to turn its back on the revolution that has taken  place in the country, but to make a strenuous effort to  safeguard its accomplishments and gains and strive to preserve  its Islamic Shiite character.    2. Not to neglect Iran's national interests, however strong  the external pressures, and to strive continually to protect  those interests, making sacrifices if necessary to defend them.    3. To maintain the existing broad relations between it,  religious scholarly circles, and the traditional religious  seminaries.    4. Defend stubbornly and without yielding the interests of  this class and its traditional allies among learned religious  bodies; this by maintaining the strength of the private sector,  encouraging its role through the market economy, and  facilitating government support to it.    There is evidence that this development that has emerged  from  events in Iran has not escaped the notice of some major  countries. These countries now are busily seeking ways to help  them approach the centers that represent the Resalat group and  enter into dialogue with them.    The beginning of the story of this group coincides with the  revolution and a religious scholar named Ayatollah Azari-Qomi,  the second greatest judge of the Iranian revolution after its  victory. Arrested and imprisoned during the time of the shah, he  is said to have memorized the Koran during his stay in prison.  Appointed the revolution's public prosecutor, he followed a  moderate path, helping many of those arrested to leave prison  and saving them from death. He became known for gentleness and  tolerance.    On account of this, stubborn hard-liners opposed him and  forced him to resign. He traveled to Iraq to make contact with  the ulama of al-Najaf. (It was before the outbreak of war  between the two countries.) When he returned to Iran, he taught  religious courses at the seminary in Qom. He established a bond  of cooperation with the Association of Revolutionary Teachers  supported by Imam Khomeyni--it is now sponsored by Ayatollah  Sayyid 'Ali Khamene'i, leader of the revolution. Azari-Qomi was  elected to membership in the second session of the Majles as  representative of the city of Qom. The session began in 1984 and  ended in 1988, a period of four years, as the Iranian  constitution specifies. During the session he was elected to  membership on the parliamentary committee on economic and  financial affairs.    Ayatollah Azari-Qomi is considered a superior jurist.  Responsible parties in the Islamic Republic of Iran refer to him  for his opinion on various matters of Islamic law. Imam Khomeyni  and the regime assigned him major tasks, including serving as  the revolution's public prosecutor and representing Imam  Khomeyni in the Majles to review the constitution of the Islamic  Republic of Iran. Azari-Qomi was one of Imam Khomeyni's  outstanding students.    Azari-Qomi became famous for his independent positions and  his opposition to the governments that successively assumed  responsibility for administering the Islamic Republic of Iran.    One of the most important things to be mentioned in this  regard is his opposition to the policy of the former prime  minister, Engineer Mir Hoseyn Musavi Khamene'i, who followed a  line very close to socialism when it came to safeguarding  private property and big corporations. Azari-Qomi was the  regime's religious scholar who presented the greatest challenge  to Musavi, whom Imam Khomeyni had no other choice than to  support strongly as prime minister during the Iraq-Iran war.  Azari-Qomi strongly attacked the government's economic policy  and received threats from some enthusiastic supporters of that  policy.    In 1985, Azari-Qomi and his group of supporters began  publishing a daily newspaper entitled RESALAT as a free pulpit  to spread their ideas and explain their political ethic. It was  said at the time that there might be a degree of understanding  and mutual rapprochement between Ayatollah Azari-Qomi and the  then deputy speaker of the Majles, Ayatollah Shaykh Mohammad  Yazdi. Shaykh Mohammad Yazdi is currently head of the judiciary.  The newspaper was known from the beginning for following a  moderate line calling for establishing balanced international  relations and a market economy.    Observers in Iran believe that Azari-Qomi speaks for the  bazaar people (the big merchants in the Iranian market). He has  been and remains an indefatigable critic of state interference  with the private sector. He supports the private sector's  administering most economic affairs, including civil services,  communications, and such development projects as dams and the  like. This attitude has encouraged the major bazaar merchants to  support the newspaper RESALAT and its owner.    It should be mentioned that this group's support of the  country's top policy achieved an overwhelming victory for the  government wing. This group took the lion's share in the results  of elections for the fourth and current session of the Majles.  The Resalat bloc has the most powerful influence in the Majles.  Its legislative weight gives it the power to make any bill in  the Majles succeed or fail.    The full name of the bloc's leader is Ayatollah Ahmad  Bigdeli  Azari-Qomi. He is considered one of the influential teachers and  jurists of the Qom seminary, and is a senior founder of the  Association of Teachers in Qom, which we can consider to some  extent the official society of Shiite jurists in Iran.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 14 Apr (TANJUG)--Serbian President  Slobodan Milosevic received Thorvald Stoltenberg and Lord Owen,  cochairmen of the Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, this  evening.    The Serbian president and the Geneva conference cochairmen  exchanged views on the latest situation in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina and other important issues related to a  political resolution of the crisis. They particularly focused on  initiatives and ideas linked to ending the armed confrontations  and creating conditions to restore the negotiating process.    The Serbian president believes that an end to all  hostilities  in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina should be achieved, which  means, first of all, that the Muslim forces should give up any  further military provocation. The responsibility for their  behavior rests to the greatest extent with the international  community, which has not only tolerated but--by undertaking air  attacks against the Serbs--also openly encouraged the Bosnian  Muslim leadership to continue the war.    The success of the peace process depends directly on  abandoning discriminatory practices and on returning to the  international community's principles of impartiality and  objectivity, Milosevic stressed in his talks with Stoltenberg  and Owen.</p>

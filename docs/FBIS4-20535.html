			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jacqueline Mattei: "Advanced Plastics: </F> Rhone-Poulenc and SNIA Become Partners"--first paragraph is  L'USINE NOUVELLE introduction    [Text] Rhone-Poulenc and SNIA [expansion not given] (Fiat  group) increase their collaboration on polyamides, a sector  where their product lines complement each other.    After carpet fibers and yarns, followed by textile yarns,  Rhone-Poulenc and the Italian company SNIA (Fiat group) are  pooling their efforts in the field of advanced polyamide  plastics. Their 50-50 subsidiary, Nyltech (800 people, sales of  1.2 billion francs [Fr]) will rank third in Europe, behind BASF  [Baden Aniline and Soda Factory] and DuPont.    The European advanced plastics market represents 700,000  tons, and polyamides account for one half of that. Their  characteristics (resistance to impact and high temperatures)  favor their use in automobile (underhood parts) and electrical  (circuit-breakers, switches) engineering. These are weighty  sectors where large manufacturers--like Valeo (automobile  equipment) or Legrand (electrical equipment)--look for suppliers  of a size commensurate with theirs and offering products  suitable for their specific applications.    The product lines of SNIA and Rhone-Poulenc complement each  other (one offers polyamide 6, the other polyamide 66), which  precisely will enable them to broaden their offers to automobile  equipment manufacturers.  <H5>  No Rationalization in Sight </H5>   The creation of a joint-venture with a bare-bones structure  should also reduce overheads and improve the profitability of  this activity, which suffered from the slump affecting the  European automobile industry. On the other hand, no  rationalization is expected for the time being.    The new entity will have four production plants: those of  SNIA at Ceriano Laghetto, Italy, and Manchester, New Hampshire  (United States); those of Rhone-Poulenc at Saint-Fons (Rhone)  and in Taiwan. It will also inherit Longma, a joint-venture that  the French group just set up in China, near Shangai: a  bridgehead for future expansion in Asia. It will also have two  development centers, at Saint-Fons and at Freiburg (Germany).    The two companies have already formed two joint-ventures:  Novalis for polyamide carpet fibers and yarns, and Nylstar for  textile fibers. This third partnership proves that collaboration  goes on satisfactorily. Another sign is Fiat's (symbolic)  acquisition of an interest in Rhone-Poulenc.    Polyamides account for one half of the sales of  Rhone-Poulenc's fibers and polymers branch (which amounted to  Fr11.2 billion last year). The three partnerships cover about 50  percent of its polyamide activities.    The two companies, however, may not be able to carry their  collaboration any further! Rhone-Poulenc also produces  industrial yarns and is integrated upstream, which is not the  case of SNIA.</p>

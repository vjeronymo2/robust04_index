			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Opinion poll blow for PM and party MR JOHN MAJOR last night faced further grim evidence that support for the Conservatives continues to fall, as an opinion poll showed them in third place behind Labour and the Liberal Democrats, Ralph Atkins writes. As Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative chairman, prepared to launch today the party's campaign in the Christchurch by-election, a Gallup survey for The Daily Telegraph showed another fall in the prime minister's rating. The Tories' slide into third place was reminiscent of the party's worst years in the early 1980s, when the now-defunct Liberal-Social Democratic Alliance was at its height. The Gallup poll puts the Conservatives on 24.5 per cent, the Liberal Democrats on 26.5 per cent and Labour on 43 per cent. Mr Major's personal rating is 18.4 per cent, the lowest recorded by Gallup for a prime minister. Asked about Mr Major's qualities, 85 per cent of those polled said he was 'not really in charge' and 77 per cent said he was 'indecisive'.</p>

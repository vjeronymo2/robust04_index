			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AL MARTINEZ: NOTES ON THE LADY IN STRIPES  </P> <P> There's nothing like a celebrity court case to bring out the crowds. Fatty  Arbuckle proved that a long time ago and Christian Brando is proving it now. If  they get any more popular, they're going to have to be held in the Dorothy  Chandler Pavilion.  </P> <P> Give us a murder, a rape, a dope bust or even a slap in a cop's choppers, and  we gather like hungry buzzards at an auto-da-fe, provided, of course, the  carrion in the case has what is known in Hollywood as A Name.  </P> <P> The elements of these trials are compelling: pretty women, handsome men,  expensive criminal lawyers, massive media coverage, violence buffs, groupies by  the gross . . . and, of course, the mysterious Lady in Stripes.  </P> <P> In the Brando case, we are additionally blessed with the Great Brooding  Presence of Christian's father, Marlon Brando Himself, elevating the  proceedings to a spiritual level that ordinary murder trials rarely attain.  </P> <P> At one point in the preliminary hearing the other day, he pleased the crowd by  closing his eyes and extending his hands as though meditating. It was pure  Brando.  </P> <P> He somehow continues to come across as the mystical Col. Kurtz in "Apocalypse  Now."  </P> <P> One sees him lying in semi-darkness in the steamy jungles of Vietnam, speaking  in a characteristic hoarse whisper to the spirits of the dead, as a cow is  killed nearby in ceremonial sacrifice.  </P> <P> What a scene. Hold on the cow. Come up with the wailing spirits. Cut to the  Great Brooding Presence and fade out.  </P> <P> Beautiful. That's a take.  </P> <P> I don't mean to minimize the seriousness of what's going on here. A man is dead  and Christian Brando, if convicted of his murder, could spend a long time in  the slammer.  </P> <P> But there is a quality of carnival to a celebrity case that is difficult to  ignore.  </P> <P> You already know, I suppose, that Christian is accused of killing Dag Drollet  last May 16. He believed Drollet was beating Cheynne Brando, who was Drollet's  woman, as they say, and Christian's half-sister.  </P> <P> There may or may not have been an argument between Christian and Dag, and they  may or may not have struggled for a gun that may or may not have accidentally  fired, but one thing's for sure. Dag is dead.  </P> <P> As defense attorney Robert Shapiro put it, Christian was enraged because "a  loved one (pause), a sister (pause), a little sister (pause), a little pregnant  sister (pause) was desperate."  </P> <P> Then: "He reacted as any brother would." Well, almost any brother.  </P> <P> I caught only a snippet of the hearing but was left with no doubt that this was  A Name on trial.  </P> <P> You knew it by the portable TV cameras lined up on the floor outside the  courtroom, like a row of electronic Howitzers waiting to be fired.  </P> <P> You knew it when you entered the courtroom itself and a bailiff searched your  briefcase.  </P> <P> You knew it by the frantic note-taking of the reporters, by the  standing-room-only crowd . . . and by the mysterious Lady in Stripes.  </P> <P> Oh, yeah . . . her.  </P> <P> There's one at every celebrity trial. They seem to know everyone involved and  chronicle every word of the proceedings, but never reveal their identity.  </P> <P> It would be more lyrical had the woman in question worn red, since a mysterious  Lady in Red is shrouded in the kind of aura a Lady in Stripes lacks, but you  take what you get.  </P> <P> She was a dark-haired, gum-chewing person in her mid-30s who took notes  enthusiastically. I was sitting next to her and, during a break, she asked the  equivalent of did I come here often?  </P> <P> Then, without further preamble, she established her mysterious nature by  refusing to give her name before I asked.  </P> <P> The conversation went something like this:  </P> <P> "Do you come here often?"  </P> <P> "Well, not exactly, I'm a, you know, journalist."  </P> <P> "I can't give you my name."  </P> <P> "Oh . . . OK."  </P> <P> "Or why I'm taking notes."  </P> <P> "No problem."  </P> <P> "But I can tell you I know a lot of what's going on here. I'm a friend of  Christian's girlfriends."  </P> <P> "Ah, ha."  </P> <P> "They're all Pisces."  </P> <P> "Of course."  </P> <P> I had a little trouble concentrating on the Mysterious Lady in Stripes, because  in addition to chewing gum, which was expressly forbidden in court, she giggled  mindlessly. Another for instance:  </P> <P> "That's (chew, chew) Christian's best friend's (chew, chew) ex-wife (giggle)  over there (chew, giggle). They used to (chew) date (giggle)."  </P> <P> I left her in mid-giggle because I was afraid I might snap and do her harm. I  punched a woman once who chewed and giggled simultaneously and have never  forgiven myself.  </P> <P> "Pay no mind," she said, picking herself up. "It's what any son would have  done."  </P> <P> What a swell mom.  </P></p>

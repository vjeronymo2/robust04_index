			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / International Company News: New Torras management claims group made losses GRUPO TORRAS, the Spanish industrial holding company owned by the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO), ran up total losses of Pta197bn (Dollars 1.7bn) in 1991 and 1992, according to accounts filed with the Spanish securities commission by the new Torras management. The figures vary widely from the small Pta3bn profit reported by the former Torras management for 1991, and reflect the conviction held by the new management of the KIO, which took control of Torras mid-way through last year, that their predecessors mismanaged the Spanish companies. Torras, which is in receivership, said that Pta44.4bn had been lost in 1991 and Pta153.1bn last year. The 1992 figure includes, according to Torras, Pta55bn in bad debt provisions for loans which it claims were made to companies directly or indirectly controlled by former Torras managers. The figures appear to include large portfolio losses on companies controlled by Torras. Torras said that of the Pta500bn invested in Spain by the KIO, only Pta73.3bn remained. It blamed the former management. In the past, the old management has claimed that the value of the KIO's investment only began to fall once the new management decided to cease supporting Torras companies and to pull out of Spain. The publication of the figures by Torras comes shortly after a court agreed to freeze KIO assets in two bank accounts in Switzerland after a Torras creditor claimed it had not been paid for assets sold to Torras when it was under its former management. In London, the KIO management insists that it is merely a shareholder in Torras, and is therefore not liable for its debts. The accounts presented to the Spanish authorities claim that Torras owes the KIO nearly Pta180bn. Peat Marwick, KIO's auditors, have advised the Kuwaitis to treat this debt as equity.</p>

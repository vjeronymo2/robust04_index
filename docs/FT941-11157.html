			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Higher bank lending and car sales point to upturn A sharp acceleration in the rate of bank lending and a big increase in new car registrations yesterday underlined the UK economy's steady recovery. Loans to the private sector by the main high street banks shot up from Pounds 3.13bn in the third quarter to Pounds 5.37bn in the fourth, confirming the upturn in bank lending seen over the previous few months. The seasonally adjusted rise wasthe biggest for three years and included an increase in borrowing by companies for the first time since June 1992, according to the British Bankers' Association. Further evidence of recovery came with the publication of figures fornew car registrations for last month. They jumped 20 per cent compared with a year ago as demand for new cars grew. Adding to the good news, confidential sales figures from 27 of the UK's housebuilders showed that sales of new houses picked up strongly last month. The statistics, collected by the House Builders Federation, indicated that the recovery in new house sales, which began last year, had been sustained in spite of concern about forthcoming tax increases. Lord Inchyra, director-general of the bankers' association, said renewed bank borrowing by the company sector - after more than a year of debt repayments - was the reason for the upturn in lending. However, most of the company sector loans went to the financial sector, with very little flowing into industry. Lending to manufacturers rose for the first time in three years, but the seasonally adjusted quarterly increase of 0.5 per cent was marginal. 'The feeling is that there is still not a pick-up in lending to the real economy, but perhaps things are turning,' said Mr John Ecklin, director of statistics at the association. Mortgage lending was entirely responsible for the quarter's rise in personal borrowing, with lending for consumption still down. The association said consumers were tending to borrow from finance houses - rather than banks - for consumer items, particularly cars. It added that the big quarterly increase in private sector bank lending would have been even greater but for the securitisation of nearly Pounds 800m of mortgages and other personal lending. After allowing for the securitisation of mortgages, the annualised growth rate in private sector lending by the nine main banking groups rose to 8.6 per cent.

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / United alters its aircraft allegiance: US airline's order for Airbus will earn it European goodwill On Sunday, Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman of United Airlines, was in Toulouse negotiating a Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.6bn) aircraft order with Mr Jean Pierson, chief executive of the European Airbus Industrie aircraft consortium. Five months earlier, Mr Wolf announced a Dollars 6.7bn cut in his airline's three-year new aircraft capital expenditure programme including 104 Boeing 737 and 757 narrow body jets after United reported a Dollars 331.9m net loss for 1991. The financial performance of United, the second largest US carrier, has remained in Mr Wolf's own words 'dismally woeful'. For the first quarter of this year, the airline lost Dollars 92.3m and the second quarter is also expected to be disappointing. But Mr Pierson appears to have made Mr Wolf an offer he found hard to refuse. On Tuesday his board approved an order for up to 100 Airbus A320 narrow-body aircraft, the rival of the Boeing 737, worth about Dollars 5bn. On Wednesday, the champagne flowed in Toulouse to celebrate what is undoubtedly one of the most significant marketing coups in the 20-year history of Airbus. United was one of the last remaining strongholds of Boeing, the world's largest manufacturer of commercial airliners. For the last two decades, United bought nothing but Boeings. In the early 1930s, Boeing owned a big stake in United until the US Congress decided in 1934 that airlines had to be separated from manufacturers. With the United deal, Airbus has now placed aircraft with all the main US carriers with the exception of USAir and South-west Airlines. The last two remaining Boeing strongholds are Japan Air Lines and British Airways, although the UK carrier inherited 10 A320s when it took over British Caledonian five years ago. Mr Pierson is now well on his way to achieve his target of a 30 per cent share of the commercial jet market. 'Last year we stood at 26 per cent of the global trade,' he recently said. Airbus has now become Boeing's main competitor overtaking McDonnell Douglas, which is struggling to revive its commercial aircraft operations by attempting, so far unsuccessfully, to negotiate a partnership with Taiwan and other Asian countries. The United deal also comes as the aircraft industry faces one of the worst cyclical downturns in its history. The order will help safeguard thousands of jobs at the four Airbus partner companies including British Aerospace (20 per cent), Aerospatiale of France (37.9 per cent), Deutsche Aerospace (37.9 per cent) and Casa of Spain (4.2 per cent). It is also important for Rolls-Royce, a partner in the International Aero Engine (IAE) consortium whose V2500 has been chosen to power United's new A320s. The order will give IAE a big boost in its fierce competition against the rival CFM International consortium, the joint-venture between General Electric of the US and Snecma of France which has won the lion's share of engine orders in the 150-seat narrow-body aircraft market sector. Finally, the order is likely to restore confidence in the A320, probably the world's most sophisticated and technologically advanced airliner which has regularly been dogged by controversy over the safety of its 'fly-by-wire' computer flight control system. But the deal begs one important question: why did United suddenly decide to order Dollars 5bn worth of Airbus aircraft after slashing in February its 1992-95 aircraft acquisition programme involving all Boeing aircraft? Airline industry sources suggested yesterday Airbus had presented United with 'an extraordinary opportunity' by offering extremely attractive financing. Under the terms of the deal, United will acquire 50 A320s on lease with options for an additional 50. Airbus claimed yesterday the arrangement was a classical financial vehicle involving long-term leasing. It added that the Airbus proposal was identical in structure to Boeing's competing bid to supply Boeing 737-400s to United. Boeing, for its part, said it had made a very attractive offer which went 'as far as prudence would dictate'. The Seattle manufacturer also added: 'Obviously Airbus could do more.' United is acquiring the A320s to replace gradually its fleet of ageing Boeing 727-200 three-engine airliners. It expects to retire 26 of these this year. Since February, it has also faced a new demand for aircraft for its expansion in the fast-growing Latin American market following its Dollars 135m acquisition of Pan Am's Latin American routes this year. Apart from the bargain terms offered by the European consortium, United clearly expects to earn some much needed goodwill in Europe by opting for Airbus rather than Boeing aircraft. Several European countries, especially France and Germany, have recently become alarmed by the aggressive expansion of big US carriers such as United, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines into their market and the transatlantic fares war this has unleashed. France has been seeking to limit this expansion by wanting to renegotiate its bilateral air agreement with the US. United now has four daily flights out of Paris to the US as well as European feeder services operated by Boeing 727s which could eventually be replaced by A320s. Although Boeing said it accepted and understood United's decision, the deal is likely to rekindle the old dispute over Airbus subsidies and creative financing to win market share in the US. The A320 contract is understood to be flexible with some liberal return arrangements if aircraft are not taken up by United. However, if Boeing ultimately decides to kick up a fuss, its campaign could be blunted by the accord reached this spring between the US and the European Commission on aircraft subsidies. 'It is an agreement that is balanced and fair to all and now that it is completed, it lets both sides focus their energies on what they do best: designing, building and selling aircraft,' Mr Pierson said in New York last month. But that was before the United deal.</p>

			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Bangkok reopens with a rise of 3.5% Tokyo Political worries were brushed aside as the yen retreated against the dollar, and the Nikkei rose on buying by foreign investors and investment trust funds, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index gained 177.43 to 20,164.63 after a low of 20,050.21 and a high of 20,282.16, recording a week's improvement of 1.1 per cent. Traders said that a government was likely to be formed next week, and economic policies would not differ drastically no matter who was chosen as prime minister. The fluctuation of the yen around the Y104 level encouraged investors, the currency closing down Y0.95 at Y103.95. Volume was 425m shares against Thursday's 367m. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 11.64 to 1,635.12, while the Nikkei 300 gained 2.04 to 299.43. Gainers led losers by 753 to 269, with 146 issues unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 5.11 to 1341.56. Export driven manufacturers were higher on the yen's easing: Hitachi rose Y4 to Y978, Fujitsu advanced Y10 to Y1,040 and NEC gained Y20 to Y1,150. Steels and shipbuilders were also firm, with Kawasaki Steel up Y5 to Y375 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries gaining Y4 to Y680. Hopes of higher domestic and overseas sales supported car makers. Isuzu Motors, the day's most active issue, rose Y14 to Y502 and Nissan Motor gained Y12 to Y896. Profit-taking depressed Matsushita Electric Industrial, which fell Y30 to Y1,720 and Sony, down Y30 to Y5,950. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 183.80 to 22,475.20 in volume of 22.2m shares. Roundup The region offered a mixed performance, with less exciting moves in the bigger markets. BANGKOK reopened after a three-day holiday, domestic mutual funds and long-term investors bought big companies and the SET index rose 43.72 or 3.5 per cent to 1,278.98, 4.5 per cent higher on the week. Turnover was Bt6.3bn compared with Bt2.1bn on Monday. The communications sector, one of the most active in the market, soared by 8.6 per cent. Communications issues, led by TelecomAsia, led the active list, rising by Bt9 to Bt103. TAIWAN rose 2.4 per cent on the day in active trade, but only 1.2 per cent on the week as the weighted index closed 130.91 higher at 5,592.90. Turnover climbed from TDollars 32.7bn to TDollars 60.9bn. The rebound was led by textiles and financials, the former after good news for cotton prices. MANILA chalked up a third successive gain although profit-taking pared early gains encouraged by the telephone stock, PLDT's rise in New York. The composite index finished 9.92 higher at 2,769.42, up 4.9 per cent on the week. JAKARTA, too, saw some profit-taking, but the JKSE index ended 5.37 higher at 472.65, up 2 per cent on the week. KUALA LUMPUR was lifted by late buying on speculation that the government would soon announce general elections, the KLSE composite index rising 12.36 to 1,033.66, 7.5 per cent higher on the week. Idris Hydraulic was one of the most active stocks, rising 25 cents to MDollars 5.35. SINGAPORE majored in Malaysian stocks traded over the counter, which rose as speculators returned, but the broad market was subdued and the Straits Times Industrial index fell 25.19 to 2,212.18, still 5.3 per cent higher on the week. HONG KONG was slow, turnover edging up slightly from HKDollars 3.32bn to HKDollars 3.55bn as the Hang Seng index receded 64.57 to 9,536.06, 2.6 per cent higher on the week. Losses were concentrated in the property sector where the sub-index fell 286.21, or 1.6 per cent to 17,368.32. BOMBAY saw profit-taking after the withdrawal of mutual funds from the market, and the BSE index closed 49.35 lower at 3,895.18, a fraction higher on the week.

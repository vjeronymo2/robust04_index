			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PROVIDING LAND FOR CHURCHES  </P> <P> (Mandatory) church zoning? What will be proposed next, requirements to mandate  the construction of government buildings by developers? The whole concept is  ridiculous and deserves little consideration.  </P> <P> There are far more pressing issues that affect people's lives in Orange County  that should be addressed by churches and local government. For example,  affordable housing is still a dream for many families who must pay high rents,  live in substandard conditions, or commute to their jobs from Riverside and San  Bernardino counties. Local developers, with few exceptions, have not had to  provide housing for low-income families in this county -- that responsibility  has been passed on to the government.  </P> <P> The free exercise of religion does not mean that we must provide land for new  churches with spacious meetings rooms, offices, and kitchens. Worship can take  place anywhere. Further, it is unreasonable to expect others to subsidize the  cost of the church land. Certainly, the developer is not going to absorb the  expense of valuable property in Orange County. It will be passed on to home  buyers who already pay inflated prices.  </P> <P> Clearly, there are other more immediate land-use concerns. Churches and local  government should spend more time and effort on alleviating human suffering and  less on trying to build the grandest religious palace to attract the largest  congregation.  </P> <P> LINDA EMERSON  </P> <P> Yorba Linda  </P></p>

For example, Mary Finn of Chart Services, an asbestos consulting company, testified that ``if breakage is minimized, obviously exposures are going to go down'' (Tr. 3765). Ms. Finn submitted area sampling data from flooring removal operations which had a mean of 0.056 f/cc as an 8-hour time-weighted average (Ex. 9&hyph;18). She also presented data on area TEM counts taken during four operations involving drilling through VAT_the mean for the four samples was 0.3 structures/cc (2 samples were below the limit of detection and one value was 1.01 f/cc), while all four samples were below the limit of detection when measured by PCM. BCTD cited various studies showing high fiber levels during flooring removal (Ex. 143 at 151&hyph;153). One, the Cook data, showed some high short term levels on one job, it was unclear what work practices were used, other jobs done by the same firm showed exposure values less than the PELs (see Ex. 35 and 119S). The Rosby data showed short term data which were well within the PEL excursion limit (Ex. 119 U). Other data pointed to by BCTD as indicating the unreliability of exposure reductions using non-aggressive methods, merely shows that EPA clearance levels were not achieved (Ex. 7&hyph;132), that exceedances were possible (Ex. 7&hyph;137 [it is noted that an exposure of .11 f/cc is considered in compliance with OSHA's PEL, and that TEM fiber counts were elevated (Ex. 119T)].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the Environ data contracted for and submitted by RFCI and Armstrong, which was interpreted differently by the submitter and by BCTD, these and other interested parties submitted additional data showing exposure levels during various kinds of asbestos-containing flooring removal. Low exposure levels were obtained in a New York State Department of Health Study, for floor tile removal using automated infrared heating, (followed by hand scraping)(see Ex. 7&hyph;100). As noted above, OSHA is allowing removal to be performed using heat, so long as tiles are not broken during the removal process. Under contract with EPA, PEI Associates performed a study which was described in a report entitled ``Evaluation of Tile and Mastic Removal at Fort Sill'' (Ex. 1&hyph;330). TEM was used to measure fiber levels resulting from use of several different methods to remove tile and/or mastic. They found that ``airborne asbestos levels averaged 0.135 structures per cubic centimeter (s/cc) during dry tile removal, 0.066 s/cc during wet tile removal, 0.247 s/cc during removal of mastic using citric acid and towels and 0.326 s/cc during sand machine mastic removals. No PCM measurements were presented, and the proportion of the TEM-measured fibers exceeding 5  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> m in length was not reported.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

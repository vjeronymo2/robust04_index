			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksander Kwasniewski, chairman of the </F> National Assembly Constitutional Commission, by correspondent  Marek Burczyk; place and date not given]    [Text] [Burczyk] We have heard voices denying the authority  of the current parliament to promulgate a new constitution.  Hanna Suchocka and Olga Krzyzanowska spoke about  "unrepresentative" parliament. Jan Lopuszanski has threatened to  "organize civil resistance if parliament, which is dominated by  the left-wing orientation, attempts to approve a new  constitution." What is your opinion on this subject?    [Kwasniewski] I believe that such views represent a serious  misunderstanding. In a situation where the current parliament  was called into being through a fully democratic election  procedure, after the Supreme Court confirmed the validity of  that election, it is simply irresponsible to say such things. In  any case, attempts to undermine the representative nature of the  present parliament are quite senseless. The method used could be  applied to question the validity of any parliament: After all,  there will always be a side that has lost.... In my opinion, our  present parliament, which is fully representative and which was  democratically elected not only is perfectly competent to draft  and promulgate a new constitution, it also carries a civic duty  and a social mandate to carry out that task.    [Burczyk] You sometimes talk about the need to create "a  constitution based on a civic compromise." What exactly do you  have in mind?    [Kwasniewski] The question of the drafting of a new  constitution has been for many years, as it were, the  battleground of two opposing concepts. One of these maintains  that a constitution should be a more homogenous and politically  unequivocal legal act, while the other concept--created,  incidentally, by 19-century thinker Lassalle, who was a social  democrat (though that fact should not be held against  him)--assumes that a constitution should be based on a social  compromise. I am an advocate of the second concept. I believe  that the fundamental legal act should reconcile the different  beliefs, philosophies, and options preferred by society. This  goal cannot, of course, be realized in its entirety, but the  creation of a constitution should in any case be conducted  through dialogue with, ideally, the widest spectrum of Polish  society, through discussion and compromise.    [Burczyk] Representatives of your political group [Social  Democracy of the Polish Republic, which is a component of the  Democratic Left Alliance; Kwasniewski is chairman of both]  declare that they will listen even to extraparliamentary  opposition's opinion on the projected new constitution at its  drafting stage. How do you see such cooperation in practical  application, inasmuch as, formally and legally,  extraparliamentary opposition is not entitled to have a say in  the drafting of the fundamental law?    [Kwasniewski] Well, we have to accept that  extraparliamentary  opposition operates outside parliamentary channels and that  certain consequences follow from that.... Nevertheless, we still  maintain that even groups such as that should be presented with  individual projects so that their opinions could be obtained. In  my opinion, a special forum should be created for that purpose.    [Burczyk] So far, there has been little positive response to  your proposals. On the contrary, you can hear critical voices  even from the "extraparliamentarians," who do not particularly  want to lend their names to something on which in the end they  will not have a say in any case. They do not wish to play the  role of a fig leaf....    [Kwasniewski] We will not spell out our specific offer to  them until our commission has determined the pragmatic framework  of our task. So far, we have only outlined our intentions to  them, and you can hardly expect anyone to formulate their  opinion about someone's unspecified intentions.... I remain  moderately optimistic on that question. This is because I  believe that sensible extraparliamentary groups will come to  appreciate that it is better to be in the know than to be in the  dark; better to have some influence on what happens than not to  have any at all.    [Burczyk] Minister Drzycimski said recently: "A constitution  opens up a new battlefront for the coalition, but the coalition  is not interested in such a front." In this way, he indicated,  as it were, that he was hoping that the whole process of  drafting and introducing the constitution would be actively  checked by the government coalition....    [Kwasniewski] As far as I am concerned, I want exactly the  opposite kind of action. I am an advocate of quick moves. After  four years of improvised democracy, it is high time to create a  stable framework for the state's sociopolitical system. I  believe that we should include the introduction of a new  constitution in the proposed timetable of major political events  in Poland scheduled for the immediate future. If the local  self-government elections are to take place in the spring of  1994 and the next presidential election is scheduled for the  fall of 1995, then, by the end of next year, we should prepare  the final draft of the new constitution, and, by the spring of  the following year, that fundamental law must be approved by  parliament and then confirmed in a referendum.    [Burczyk] Do you share the opinion that, once it has  approved  the constitution, parliament should be dissolved and a new  election should take place?    [Kwasniewski] No, I do not agree with it. This is because I  believe that stability is one of the most important elements in  Poland's political life today. That is why we have been and  still are in favor of carrying out the local self-government  elections according to the time schedule, running the  presidential election on time, and organizing the parliamentary  election according to the proposed timetable. If we succeed in  promulgating the new constitution according to our plans--that  is, not a constitution of the victorious camp but a constitution  of civic compromise--and if we manage to stick to the planned  calendar of individual elections, political reality in Poland  will have a much better chance of becoming more easily  predictable. Is that not an exciting and worthwhile prospect and  one that deserves all of our effort?    [Burczyk] As regards the referendum on the proposed  constitution, there are two concepts to choose from. According  to the first of these, the referendum will approve (or refuse to  approve) the constitution after the latter has been accepted by  the National Assembly. According to the second concept, the  referendum should be held before the passing of the constitution  by the National Assembly; in this way, some of the most  controversial questions concerning the sociopolitical system  could be resolved, as it were, while the constitution is still  "on the stocks." Which of these options are you prepared to  support?    [Kwasniewski] One thing is beyond question here: The actual  text of the constitution should be approved in a general  national referendum. As regards the other type of referendum and  the question of whether it should have the power of final  acceptance or just fragmentary acceptance, the problem is  slightly more complex. This solution has its advantages, but it  also has serious legal and practical drawbacks. Perhaps it would  simplify the resolution of certain questions--such as, for  example, the nature of state-church relations, or the extent of  social rights safeguarded by the Constitution. On the other  hand, what should we do if the referendum turnout turned out to  be very low, and the votes were distributed in an unfortunate  way, making it hard to interpret them unequivocally as the  expression of the will of the people? The concept of a  fragmentary-acceptance referendum requires much more careful  analysis and consideration.</p>

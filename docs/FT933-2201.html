			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / International Company News: Proton selects local partner PROTON, the listed Malaysian car manufacturer, is to enter into partnership with another local company to make 'model variants' of its cars, writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur. Diversified Resources, an assembler of foreign cars for the Malaysian market, will have a controlling stake in the new enterprise. The move has caused some concern among industry analysts. They argue that the new arrangement, by transferring part of the car production process outside Proton's control, goes against the carmaker's efforts to achieve economies of scale. Proton aims to produce up to 120,000 cars this year at its plant outside Kuala Lumpur and 150,000 units by 1995. Diversified Resources is a relatively small company with a plant on the east coast of peninsular Malaysia, a considerable distance from Kuala Lumpur. Proton, which receives substantial government protection, has captured about 70 per cent of the Malaysian car market. The company also exports, with the UK its biggest overseas market.</p>

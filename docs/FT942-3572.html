			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Stock exchange On the surface, profits notched-up by stock exchange member firms last year look respectable enough. If 1993 proves to be a year of peak profits, though, a 20 per cent pre-tax return on capital is hardly an adequate compensation for the risks. The market has recorded one year of aggregate losses and three years of single-figure returns on capital in the last five. Even if hurdle rates are being reduced in response to lower inflation, investors would normally demand more from such a volatile business. True, the overall numbers can be misleading. Around 15 to 20 per cent of firms are likely to make losses even when the market is booming, which depresses the aggregate return. There is a wide spread of performance between small private client stockbrokers and the biggest integrated firms. But given the weak performance of equity markets this year, most firms will be hard pressed to match their 1993 performance. Dealing profits, which account for the biggest swings in revenue, will be especially hard to come by. It is difficult to judge whether London is notably more or less profitable than other markets. On a broadly comparable basis, New York Stock Exchange firms made a 17 per cent return on capital last year. Yet profitability in the previous two years appears to have been higher than achieved in London. The danger must be that London firms allow their costs - especially staff costs, which account for almost half the total - to be set in markets which can better afford to pay.</p>

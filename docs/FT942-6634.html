			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Outdoors: It rained and the salmon sulked - Fishing Since returning from a brief sortie to Scotland, I have been chewing over weighty matters. Chief among them is a question with momentous implications: should I take salmon fishing seriously? The obstacles and objections are several and considerable. One is my economic base, which is quite rocky enough under existing burdens; (and serious salmon fishing tends to cost serious money). For another, it is an austere and taxing business, and I am not at all sure that I am up to it. The odd thing is that I should be entertaining the notion at all, in the light of my experiences during 2 1/2 days on the Beauly, the famous Highland river which runs into an extension of the Moray Firth just round the corner from Inverness. For, in the course of a good many hours of pretty single-minded fishing, I caught precisely nothing. And - before you jump to unflattering conclusions about my competence - no one else did much better. There were just four fish for the week on the whole river. I am happy to admit that factors only distantly related to fishing did contribute to my enjoyment: the trip was free; the hospitality was bountiful; the food in the lodge first rate, and the drink offered without stint; the music of the rushing water outside my window soothed me into deep, reviving sleep; the snow on the mountains, the sunlight on the green valley and the sparkling water were lovely to behold. Pleasant though all these were, what sticks in the mind is the river and promise - alas unrealised - of that most thrilling of quarries, the spring salmon. The beginnings, however, were unpromising. It was a three-jersey morning, and I had on just one, plus a waxed jacket which was no longer waxed and let the rain through. As a result of the weather, and standing in waders up to my waist, I was reduced within hours to a state of shuddering desolation. If this be salmon fishing, I remonstrated as I thrashed my 15ft rod at the steely, freezing stream, you can keep it. Take me back to England, fast. Thereafter matters looked up. I borrowed another jacket, put on more jerseys, and the sun came out. Faint memories of how to propel a salmon fly a reasonable distance returned to me. I began to see the river, not as an enemy, but as a great, vital force. And the idea of the salmon within it took hold of my imagination. It is a super river, the Beauly - big but not too big, blessed with magnificent, sweeping pools and racing shallows. The bottom three miles, down to Lovat Bridge at Beauly, is the best of it. The Middle and Upper river are visually impaired by hydroelectric dams (which do, however, have the benefit of ensuring constant flows even at times of severe drought). More to the point, the Beauly is extremely productive, with around 1,100 fish last year. That impressive tally reflects the profound changes which have overtaken the river in the past four years. For centuries it had been the chief glory of the great estates of the Frasers, until the late Simon Fraser sold it to a property company for in excess of Pounds 10m. The subsequent revolution has been inspired by the appetite of investors to see a return for their money. Now, we all know that timeshare has become a dirty word. William Midwood - the genial driving force behind the Beauly Fishings Company - winces at it, and courteously insists that I call his customers syndicate rod holders. But the essence is the same: salmon fishers with cash to match their passion are wooed to part with big piles of the stuff, to obtain the right to fish one of Scotland's great rivers. A flat payment of roughly between Pounds 20,000 and Pounds 70,000 secures a particular week in perpetuity. Thus far, only the Lower River has been syndicated (the Middle and Upper are available at rents of anything up to Pounds 5,000 a week for five rods). Fifteen rods can fish the Lower River at any one time, and almost all the rods in the prime time - which is July - have been disposed of. I do not propose to go into the controversial aspects of river syndication. Many object to the hard-headed commercial exploitation which is essential to it, and to the attitudes which the customers bring with them. In the case of the Beauly, the company paid a huge sum and it needs to get a return on its investment. There has been a massive investment in the river itself which would have been inconceivable under the old system. If William Midwood is able to restore the spring runs, he will be able to sell more of his rods (by the way, if you are interested in any of this, ring him on 0498-85393). But there is, too, a genuine longing - both in Midwood and his ghillies and everyone else involved in the crusade - to do improve things for the river itself. I suppose I was infected by this enthusiasm, as I fished down the great pool below the dam at Kilmorack; and down another beneath the frowning walls of Beaufort Castle. There were few fish about but it was tremendous to be in the water, powering out the line, seeing in the mind the swirl of the take, hearing the protest of the reel. And I thought: if I had the money, I could do worse than spend it here.</p>

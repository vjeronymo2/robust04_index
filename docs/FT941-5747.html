			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Bensons Crisps declines Bensons Crisps, the Preston-based food manufacturer, suffered from the growing price war in the grocery trade and reported pre-tax profits 66 per cent lower at Pounds 302,000 for the year to November 30, against Pounds 500,000. The company said there had been constant pressure on selling prices and product mix throughout the period. It added that the climate was not expected to change during the present year. Turnover rose from Pounds 33.2m to Pounds 34.5m with growth in sales to supermarkets and discounters making up for the decline to independents. Its share of the crisps market grew by 3 per cent while snacks showed a 24 per cent advance. A tax credit of Pounds 279,000 (Pounds 99,000 charge) helped earnings per share improve to 4.1p (5p). A maintained final dividend of 2.15p is recommended for an unchanged total of 2.85p.</p>

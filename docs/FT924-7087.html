			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Weighing up Amstrad's 30p: Tony Jackson examines Alan Sugar's offer to shareholders IN the whole contentious history of management buy-outs in the UK, the most contentious issue is whether the founders of public companies should be allowed to take them private again. Such cases always set up a particularly sharp conflict of interest. They therefore tend to create an odour of suspicion. The offer for Amstrad from its founder Mr Alan Sugar, as detailed in this week's formal offer to shareholders, is among the most odorous of the lot. The special features of the deal can be briefly enumerated. None of Amstrad's directors can advise shareholders on the merits of the offer, as they all hope to carry on working for Mr Sugar when the deal has gone through. No independent financial adviser has been employed on shareholders' behalf. There is no forecast of Amstrad's profits. Shareholders are told there is 'little prospect of a significant regular dividend'. The offer is materially below Amstrad's stated asset value per share. It is also more than 60 per cent below the level at which Mr Sugar sold a 7.5 per cent stake in the company 18 months ago. The value of the offer - Pounds 113m - is almost precisely equal to Amstrad's net cash in its latest balance sheet. Nearly half of that cash is being advanced as an interest-free loan from Amstrad to Mr Sugar. Perhaps, on reflection, this last point is not as odd as it looks. As a big London institutional shareholder sardonically remarks, a company being bought out normally ends up paying for the deal in the long run. It is merely unusual to see the fact so candidly divulged at the outset. The rest of the document bears this view out. The loan from Amstrad to Mr Sugar will eventually be repaid by dividends from Amstrad itself. Most of the rest of the purchase price is in the form of a Pounds 43m loan from Lloyds Bank. That loan is to be repaid by next June. Once again, the funds are to come from Amstrad. If they felt philosophical, Amstrad's shareholders might view the loan to Mr Sugar in another light. The Pounds 50m cash is going from Amstrad's coffers via Mr Sugar into their own pockets. It is therefore not so much a loan as the proceeds of a partial liquidation. How philosophical they feel may be another matter. Most will feel some disquiet over the way the 30p offer price is justified to shareholders. The crucial point is contained in a letter to the Amstrad board from Kleinwort Benson, the company's financial adviser. According to the accountants Touche Ross, Kleinwort says, Amstrad shareholders would be likely to get less than 30p per share if the company were wound up, in spite of the fact that net assets on the balance sheet four months ago were worth 46p a share. In arriving at that conclusion, Touche Ross did not carry out an audit, nor did it visit Amstrad's subsidiaries. In assessing the prospects for the group, it relied on assurances from Mr Sugar and the rest of the board. The nature of such assurances may be gauged from the offer document. Amstrad, Mr Sugar tells shareholders, has no blockbuster products on the way. It is a 'me too' competitor. It has to be streamlined. 'While no detailed plans exist', Mr Sugar says, 'I am clear that such action would result in a much smaller company.' In assessing the offer, shareholders might reflect that not all buy-outs are a bargain for management. In 1989 Magnet, the DIY and furniture chain, was bought out in a hotly controversial Pounds 630m deal. It was rapidly apparent that the directors had paid vastly too much. They lost their investment accordingly and some of them their jobs. Nevertheless, the Amstrad deal may not be a foregone conclusion. An investing institution said yesterday: 'This could be a case for shareholders digging their heels in, if only as a matter of principle.' Lex, Page 20</p>

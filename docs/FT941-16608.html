			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Skiing: Where the rain clouds have a snowy lining Could this really be north America's top ski resort? With thick clouds covering the Canadian mountains and rain beating on my window, it was difficult to imagine. A few diehard skiers were swimming about at the bottom of the Wizard Express, wearing see-through plastic coats emblazoned with the words 'Blackcomb at Whistler' which skiers who want to avoid being drenched can buy for CDollars 2. But if you think that any ski resort which dishes out rainwear might have a struggle to attract customers, you would be wrong. Much to the fury of Vail, the 'twin-peaks' of Whistler and Blackcomb, already Canada's top ski resort, have knocked the Colorado resort off its perch as the top ski destination in north America, according to one magazine survey. Nevertheless, you do have to be a particular breed of skier to get the best out of Whistler when the elements are conspiring against you. Whistler is a resort of paradoxes: at 2,214ft the ski village itself is lower than Kitzbuhel, one of the lowest major resorts in Europe. Yet with skiing at over 7,000ft on both Whistler and Blackcomb Mountains, the resort has the biggest vertical drop in north America. Whistler is close to Canada's west coast and it is often touch and go whether precipitation falls as rain or snow on the lower slopes. From the warmth of my room at the elegant Chateau Whistler Resort hotel it looked like a day to avoid skiing. And yet the day before, I had braved exactly the same conditions and enjoyed some of the best skiing in a winter already crowded with highlights. All it needed was motivation. Fair-weather skiers miss out on outrageously good skiing and a lot of fun. Optimists hope that when it is wet in the resort, it could be snowing higher up. They are often correct. Every time I have heaved myself on to a mountain in grim weather, I have enjoyed exceptional skiing . . . and returned with glowing cheeks and well-exercised lungs. The snow is not always 'champagne powder'. Even Tyax Heliskiing, which claims in its brochure that 'you will be rewarded with the ultimate prize: endless powder' admits elsewhere in its literature that heliskiing is defined 'not as powder skiing but rather as wilderness skiing in untracked snow'. During my day in the blizzard, Leanne Hutton, my guide, tried to sort out my deep-snow technique: 'You should absorb the bumps more. You get away with it in powder and crud because the deep snow absorbs you]' After retreating from some otherwise excellent skiing on Blackcomb's Horstman Glacier after visibility became tricky, we stayed in the trees and skied lower terrain on both mountains. After a while we hardly noticed that it was snowing heavily except that as each hour went by the snow became deeper and the skiing more exhilarating. On Whistler Mountain, Goat's Gulley, a narrow steep black run with ledges here and there which made it resemble a series of snow-filled waterfalls, was particularly enjoyable in deep snow. The only time we felt miserable rather than elated was riding the chairs. On Blackcomb's so-called Solar Coaster chair bone-chilling winds pierced our soaking ski clothes. A day or two later, we managed to get into Whistler's famous and vast bowl area, which is frequently closed because of high winds or avalanche danger. There are six: Glacier Bowl, Sun Bowl, West Bowl, Whistler Bowl, Harmony Bowl and Burnt Stew Bowl, now re-christened Symphony Bowl (the resort has been re-considering a number of names. A run called Hooker, a logging term, now has no name at all. An area called Spankey's is also causing concern.) Whistler's bowls are all accessed by the Peak Chair. People standing in line sometimes have a grandstand view of the more hair-brained breed of skier leaping off steep cliffs above. Ski poles are rattled like sabres and there is a wild baying, working up to fever pitch as the queue wills the skiers to leap, hoping for either triumph or tragedy. There was particular excitement when two skiers inched their way towards the most spectacular plunge of all: off Jordan's. This involved a 200ft leap on to such steep terrain that the chances of stopping before being committed to a further leap of 60ft over rocks were minimal. The first skier had scarcely gouged a huge hole in the snow after his initial leap than he was hurtling off on the second jump. As he made another bomb-blast in the snow like a flattened Tom and Jerry cartoon victim, a huge roar burst from the lift-queue. Extracting himself from his snowy crater, the skier waved his poles in the air triumphantly to his audience, who were slightly less ecstatic when his companion managed to check his momentum and come to a halt between his two jumps. There was more drama to come: while I was getting my bearings on Burnt Stew Trail, an easy path which links the bowls and enables intermediates to glide around the bowl area, an Australian immigrant, Pete Dize, skiing a steep, ungroomed part of Harvey's above the trail, triggered a small but potentially lethal avalanche and fell in its wake. He was swept down to the path and buried 10 yards from me. With two other skiers, I hurried to dig him out. Stunned by a blow to his head, he could have 'drowned' if he had been alone. On January 1, Arnie Wilson embarked on an FT Round the World Ski Expedition. Arnie will be sending monthly expedition reports. This article was written before he set off. Arnie Wilson travelled to Whistler with Crystal Holidays, Crystal House, The Courtyard, Arlington Rd, Surbiton, Surrey KT6 6BW. Tel 081-399 5144 and Canadian Airlines, 2nd floor, Rothschild House, Whitgift Centre, Croydon, Surrey, CR9 3HN. 0345-616767. He stayed at the Chateau Whistler resort. Helicopter skiing is available with Tyax Heliskiing (a three-run package including lunch on the mountain costs CDollars 350) plus weekly packages which include accommodation, meals, a guide and an avalanche transceiver. An introductory week costs around CDollars 3,000. A full seven-day package with 100,000 vertical feet of heliskiing costs approximately CDollars 4,690.</p>

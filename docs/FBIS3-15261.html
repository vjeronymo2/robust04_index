			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Liana Minasyan report under the "Conflict" rubric: "No </F> Truce in Karabakh Although Protocol on it Is Signed"]    [Excerpts] A protocol signed in Moscow by representatives  of the military agencies of Russia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and  Nagorno- Karabakh calls for the creation of a united staff of  representatives of the four sides, and the deployment of  mixed-personnel posts in the security zone along the line of  confrontation. Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev, Russian  deputy defense minister, stated in this regard that the staff  should be composed of some 250 people with 69 servicemen to be  contributed from Russia's armed forces. After the cease-fire as  of 1 March and the start of the withdrawal of troops and heavy  equipment, the Russian part of the united staff will be  immediately moved to the conflict area. The move envisions the  creation of three small zonal staffs so as to enable full  control over the entire area of military operations. In Georgiy  Kondratyev's view, the implementation of the Moscow protocol  will make it possible to pave the way for talks on a political  settlement. [passage omitted]    At any rate, the military situation that has taken shape  allows for a somewhat greater optimism in hoping for  reconciliation. During February, Karabakh's armed forces closed  the gaps in their defense lines formed in the course of the New  Year Azeri offensive. Azeri formations, too, are with time  coming to resemble an army more and more, which unavoidably  happens as combat experience builds up. This equilibrium signals  the fact that there will be no territorial gains by military  means. But Aliyev has been left a chance to receive "from the  hands" of peacekeepers Azeri territories occupied by Karabakh's  army, waiving the principle of Russian military nonpresence in  the republic. This question will perhaps be postponed until the  summit since it would signify a radical change in Azerbaijan's  policy.</p>

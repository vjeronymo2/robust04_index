			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 30 Jun (MENA) -- Zuhdi al-Qidrah, Palestinian  ambassador to Cairo and representative of the Fatah Movement,  has said that Palestinian-Israeli talks will resume next week.  The talks, he said, will address various topics not discussed  in previous talks as well as the early transfer of authority to  Palestinians in the West Bank and the deployment of Palestinian  police and security forces in various West Bank towns and  villages.    Speaking to MENA following his return from a brief visit to  Gaza, al-Qidrah said that the Palestinians will move into Rafah  checkpoint offices in the next few days and that visa procedures  for visitors to Rafah have been coordinated with various  Palestinian Authority departments. The first such visas will be  issued in the first week of July, he stated.    Al-Qidrah said that he presented a detailed report to  Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat about the visit he and Dr.  Nabil Sha'th paid to Gaza. Al-Qidrah added that he briefed  Egyptian Assistant Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmi on the situation  in Gaza and on a number of points in the Cairo agreement with  which Israel has failed to comply.    The Palestinian ambassador said that, during his visit to  Gaza, he called on Israeli officials to fulfill the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement in its entirety and release all  detainees immediately.</p>

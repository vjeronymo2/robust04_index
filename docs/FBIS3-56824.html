			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] International experts have been in Tbilisi for  several days now. At the invitation of the Georgian Health  Ministry, they are to take part in a forensic examination of  Zviad Gamsakhurdia's body.    According to messages published in the press, members of the  ex-president's family categorically rule out the possibility of  carrying out a forensic examination, and set other categorical  conditions.    A SAKINFORM correspondent asked Head of State Eduard  Shevardnadze to assess the current situation. He said: The  will of God is involved in the birth of every person.  Therefore, anybody's departure from this world is a regrettable  event. This also applies to ex-Georgian president Gamsakhurdia.  One should not talk now about who is to blame for the disasters  that have befallen the country. As for the decision on the  place of burial, this is an exclusive privilege of the family.  The burial can take place in Groznyy, as demanded by the  family. The Georgian authorities regard the request to carry  out an international forensic examination as completely lawful,  despite the fact that the ex-president's family opposes this.  Of course, this can only happen after the place where the  deceased was buried is revealed.    I think that any sensible person would agree, Eduard  Shevardnadze pointed out, if I say that the cause of Zviad  Gamsakhurdia's death should not be wrapped in mystery and people  should know the truth. This is why it is necessary to carry out  an examination.    A group is working at the Georgian Cabinet of Ministers  which  is entrusted with reaching agreement on these issues with Zviad  Gamsakhurdia's wife.</p>

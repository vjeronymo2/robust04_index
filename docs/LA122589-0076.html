			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMEN'S MOVEMENT: TIME'S BAD TIMING  </P> <P> Nikki Finke's article on the women's movement ("Time Picks on Feminism," Nov.  30) was right on target when it pointed to Time magazine's failure to define  feminism. Feminism never has been the one-dimensional white, middle-class  struggle the media persist in presenting.  </P> <P> It is the fight for basic human rights for all women -- more than half the  world's population. It is integral to the fight against racism, anti-gay  bigotry, child abuse, poverty, dismal health care and much more. This is why  feminism is simultaneously trivialized and fiercely resisted.  </P> <P> The murderous rampage in Canada that left 14 women dead and ongoing right-wing  terror at abortion clinics are riveting examples of the life-and-death struggle  that the women's movement truly embodies.  </P> <P> The heart and ferocity of feminism comes from poor and working women,  especially women of color. From hospital and cannery workers and teachers  waging militant labor strikes to the student who writes editorials in her high  school newspaper condemning sexual harassment, the message is clear: Women will  not retreat.  </P> <P> "The Third Wave of Feminism: A Candidly Revolutionary Approach" is the timely  theme of the upcoming 23rd Anniversary Conference of Radical Women, a socialist  feminist organization. It is expected to draw hundreds of feminists, radicals,  community activists and students from across the country and abroad. Scheduled  for Feb. 17-20 in Santa Monica, this national conference will focus on the  theory and strategies needed for making the third wave of feminism a winning  one.  </P> <P> JENA STARA  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

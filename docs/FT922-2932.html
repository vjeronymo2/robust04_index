			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / International Company News: Monsanto warns on second quarter earnings MONSANTO, the US chemicals group, said current results show that second-quarter earnings may be 20 to 30 per cent below Wall Street analysts' estimates of Dollars 1.60 to Dollars 1.80 a share, Reuter reports from St. Louis. The company said Wall Street had been reducing estimates to that range in recent weeks. Monsanto cited costs associated with the launch of its Searle unit's new anti-infectant drug Maxaquin, inventory reductions for its hypertension drug Calan and additional costs related to a January plant explosion in Texas. Mr Nicholas Filippello, chief economist for Monsanto, declined to quantify the specific financial impact of the three developments. This year's first-quarter earnings slipped to Dollars 161m or Dollars 1.26 a share, from Dollars 166m or Dollars 1.31 a year earlier.</p>

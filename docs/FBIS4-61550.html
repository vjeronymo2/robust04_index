			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business SNARK" file: "Transcaucasia Economic </F> News: Energy"]    [Text] Yerevan -- The energy system of Armenia, in its time  one of the best in the former USSR, now is on the decline,  declared Miron Shishmanyan, Armenian Minister of Energy and  Fuel, at the International Energy Conference, held in Yerevan.    In his opinion, the main ways of overcoming the crisis are  re-opening of the Armenian Nuclear Station, optimum usage of the  acting thermal plants and hydro-stations, building of the gas  pipeline and high-voltage line from Iran to Armenia. It's also  very important to stimulate fuel import to Armenia and to build  here an oil-refining plant. Mr. Shishmanyan also mentioned the  importance of using nontraditional sources of energy.    He reported that the European Bank has already given 57  million dollars for the reconstruction and expansion of the  Hrazdan Thermal Plant. As to the Iran-Armenia gas pipeline, the  sides are preparing to sign the final agreement on its building.</p>

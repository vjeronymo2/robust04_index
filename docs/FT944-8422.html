			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Profit from renting - Briefcase, Q&amp;A My wife and I have been renting our houses in England while we have been living in Germany where I am employed by a German company (my wife does not work). This year will be the first when we will see a profit from our UK rental income. The houses are in both our names. Are we each entitled to a UK personal tax allowance for this year - and, if so, how much is it? Yes - Pounds 3,445 each, plus a married couple's allowance for you of Pounds 1,720 at 20 per cent (viz, Pounds 344 actual tax relief). You forgot to tell us if the houses are let furnished (and thus fall within Schedule D case VI) or unfurnished (Schedule A), and whether the rent is being paid direct to your joint bank account, for example (and thus having 25 per cent tax withheld by the tenants), or to an agent in the UK (and thus having no tax deducted). If it is being paid to an agent, the tax for the present year, 1994-95, is due for payment on New Year's day. The way in which the New Year's day liability is calculated (subject to adjustment after April 5 1995) depends upon whether the profits are assessable under Schedule A or D. If you are in doubt, the solicitor who acted for you in the lettings are best placed to advise you, since he has ready access to the relevant facts, figures and dates - as well, of course, as knowing the tax law and practice relating to domestic property letting. Ask your UK tax office for the free booklet IR20 (Residents and non-residents: liability to tax in the UK). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

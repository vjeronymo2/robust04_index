			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: Successful auction encourages Treasuries US Treasury bond prices jumped yesterday afternoon after a successful supply auction allowed the market to build on its morning gains. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up 15/16 at 100 1/2 , with the yield slipping to 7.457 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was  3/32 better at 100 3/32 , to yield 6.183 per cent. Bonds forged ahead in the early hours after the Commerce Department announced that factory orders of durable goods had plunged 4.2 per cent in July. Analysts were forecasting a slight increase, so the data came as a pleasant surprise to traders anxious about any sign of economic acceleration, which could erode the value of fixed-rate investments. However, their enthusiasm was short-lived. Closer examination of the report revealed that the unexpected weakness had stemmed primarily from a massive drop in aircraft orders and a seasonal shutdown of automotive plants. Excluding the volatile transportation component, the decline was relatively tame. After the market had time to digest the implications of the report, bond prices receded to just above their opening values, even though a firmer dollar was providing additional support. The cautious mood reflected uncertainty over the outcome of the Treasury's sale of Dollars 11bn in five-year notes later in the day. However, in the event, the sale drew much better demand from retail accounts than anticipated, allowing bonds to resume their forward advance in the final hours of trading. In the end, however, the day's gains were probably exaggerated by the sluggish activity that characterises most summertime sessions. The unexpected fall in US durable goods orders for July caused European government bond markets to jump, but the rally was short-lived as profit-taking set in almost immediately. Analysts said it would have been dangerous for the markets to have read too much into the fall, given the notorious volatility of this series. 'The market shot up and then came back,' said Mr Adam Chester, international bond strategist at Yamaichi. He said the fall in the data did not call for a reassessment of the Federal Reserve's position on inflation. The other main economic news of the day was the release of cost-of-living data for August from two of Germany's most populous states. North Rhine-Westphalia reported that prices were up 0.1 per cent in August for a yearly increase of 2.8 per cent. Prices in Baden-Wuerttemberg rose 0.2 per cent for an annual 3.1 per cent increase. Although the market is still waiting for data from other states, analysts said it was more than likely that the national figure would be at least 3 per cent. Even though the yearly rate should fall below 3 per cent later in the year, it was inevitable that the downward progress on the inflation front was slowing, now that the economy was picking up steam, they added. 'It is a swift reminder that the interest rate cycle is turning,' said Mr Kit Juckes, international economist at SG Warburg. On Liffe, the September bund future ended almost unchanged on the day, down just 0.02 point at 91.41, well off the day's low of 91.60. Sterling's recovery against the D-Mark helped to underpin the UK gilts market, though trading remained thin. On Liffe, the September long gilt future stood  3/16 point higher at 100 31/32 in late trading. The recent stream of better-than-expected inflation and wage data has prompted Kleinwort Benson to cut its 10-year gilt yield projection for year-end from 9.25 per cent to 8.5 per cent. 'We are looking for gilts to outperform bunds and Treasuries from now until the end of the year,' said Mr Julian Callow, European economist at Kleinwort Benson. He also noted that index-linked yields were now close to their 10-year average of 3.8 per cent, and probably did not have much further to fall. 'As a result, we would suggest a switch out of index-linked into conventional gilts,' he said.</p>

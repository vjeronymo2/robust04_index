			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: Havelock Europa loss climbs to Pounds 3.07m HAVELOCK EUROPA, the storefitting company, saw pre-tax losses increase from Pounds 2.47m to Pounds 3.07m over the 1992 year but said it was 'cautiously optimistic' about its prospects, mainly because of last autumn's financial restructuring. The outcome was reached after an exceptional loss of Pounds 893,000 (Pounds 458,000), mainly reorganisation costs of Pounds 696,000. Losses per share were 15.4p (10.2p). No dividend is declared for the year; an interim of 1.5p was paid in 1991. Difficult market conditions pushed turnover down 13 per cent to Pounds 32.9m (Pounds 37.7m). Last October the company reacted to continuing poor trading conditions by raising Pounds 2.97m via a placing and open offer and setting up a trading alliance with SAS, a private building systems supplier. SAS took up nearly 4 per cent of the increased equity and has a director on Havelock's board. The company also carried out a cost cutting programme in which it cut its workforce by 220 to 609. Staff salaries have not been reviewed since late 1990. It reduced its overheads by Pounds 1.7m in 1992 Gearing was reduced from more than 50 per cent to 26 per cent at the year-end. 'We have now got the cost base to a level where we can survive with lower levels of activity,' said Mr Norman Lessels, who at the beginning of the year took over as chairman from Sir Lewis Robertson. 'We have tailored the business to operate on turnover of Pounds 32m.' Mr Hew Balfour, chief executive, said that Havelock's survival had owed much to strong orders from its traditional customers, Boots and Marks and Spencer. It had entered the storefitting market for food retailing and had increased the proportion of turnover from financial services companies from 11 per cent in 1991 to 18 per cent.</p>

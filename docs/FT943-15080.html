			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Boeing, Airbus in costs dogfight - Paul Betts on the battle to make aircraft more quickly and more cheaply The two leading commercial aircraft manufacturers, Boeing of the US and its European rival Airbus, are dreaming of out-jumboing each other by building the world's biggest airliner with seating for 800 or more passengers. However, the real commercial battle between the two is to build their current aircraft more quickly and more cost-effectively in response to structural changes in the airline market, provoked by the biggest slump in the history of the airline industry. 'It is no longer so much what you build but how you build it that will make the difference,' said a senior Airbus executive. 'Aircraft manufacturing is now shifting from a purely product-, research- and development-driven business to one where the manufacturing process will give a manufacturer the edge over its rival,' he added. Although air traffic is recovering after four years in which airlines lost more than Dollars 15bn (Pounds 9.8bn) on international scheduled services alone, this is unlikely to lead to a rapid rise in returns generated by passenger numbers. 'It is becoming more and more evident that revenue, rather than traffic, is the key to airline profitability,' says Mr Adam Brown, the head of strategic planning at Airbus. 'In many markets, air travellers have now become accustomed to paying a particular fare level; and if fares are increased, they simply don't fly. So the airlines now have no choice but to find a way to provide a service at this fare level rather than as in the past seeking to maximise the fare charged for providing the service,' he says. With pressure on yields continuing, airlines will have to rely increasingly for their profits on cost reductions and operational efficiencies. In turn, they will seek aircraft that cost less to buy and less to run. 'We are all having to adapt to this new environment,' says Mr Claude Terrazzoni, head of the commercial aircraft division of Aerospatiale, the French partner in the four-nation Airbus consortium, which includes Deutsche Aerospace, British Aerospace and Casa of Spain. 'Boeing is now cutting its production costs by 25 per cent: either they want to kill us because they think Airbus can't match such cuts, or they are adapting to the structural change in the airline industry with low fares, or they are trying to do both,' he adds. Boeing recently reaffirmed its commitment to drive down costs and manufacturing time 'to make sure we remain the world's most competitive manufacturer of commercial jets'. Mr Ron Woodard, the head of Boeing's commercial aircraft operations, said in the company's staff magazine: 'We decided to prepare for the future today, while we're number one because number two is unthinkable'. The Seattle-based company has already reduced the order-to-delivery time of its wide-body aircraft, such as the 747 and the 767, from 18 months a few years ago to around 10.5 months and wants to bring it down to eight months. It eventually hopes to achieve the same target for the new 777 which flew for the first time last month. Boeing has already reduced the production cycle time for its narrow-body aircraft, including the 737 and the 757, to nine months and is planning to make it six months by 1996. Airbus says it is confident it can meet the productivity challenge set by Boeing. Although the European consortium's complex four-nation structure is a handicap, Mr Jean Pierson, the Airbus chief executive, has set similar targets for Airbus aircraft production. 'For narrow-body aircraft we are also aiming at an order-to-delivery target of six months in 1996. Today it is 12 months, next year it will go down to nine,' he said. For wide-body aircraft such as the A330, A340, A300 and A310, Airbus has already reduced production cycle times from 15 months to 12.5 months and plans to go down to nine months by 1996. Mr Woodard of Boeing said the reduction in manufacturing cycle times was already producing big payoffs for the US company. 'One payoff is in the area of inventory. By the end of 1993, as a result of our cycle time reduction efforts, we had reduced our inventory by more than Dollars 1bn compared to business as usual,' he said. Boeing's cost-cutting drive has included extensive workforce cuts involving 28,000 people in 1993 and 1994; the application of new commuter and automated manufacturing techniques; and new organisational structures to improve internal working relations and practices. Some 60,000 employees have already attended during the past three years special courses which Boeing calls 'World-Class Competitiveness'. The response at Airbus has been to cut up to 8,000 jobs between 1992 and 1995; maximise the use of investments in automation and computer aided manufacturing; and simplify and streamline the consortium's complicated manufacturing and assembly processes. This has led to improvements in Airbus productivity. BAe, for example, now takes 85 days to build a wing for an Airbus airliner instead of double the time 18 months ago. Deutsche Aerospace is phasing out a number of plants and regrouping its Airbus work on fewer and more efficient sites. But the task for Airbus remains daunting. The challenge for the European group is to transform what was at first conceived of as a job and wealth creation consortium to compete against the dominance of the US aerospace industry into an independent company, mature enough to rationalise and restructure and stand on its two corporate feet. It has started transforming itself, but the process is a slow and difficult one. Unless it accelerates the tempo, it will find it hard to keep up with the pace of change at Boeing.</p>

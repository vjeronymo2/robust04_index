			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / GM opens car plant in Warsaw General Motors, the US carmaker, has begun to assemble cars in Poland in a joint venture with Fabryka Samochodow Osobowych (FSO), the Polish state-owned carmaker. GM Poland, which is 70 per cent owned by GM and 30 per cent by FSO, is aiming initially to assemble 10,000 cars a year at the Warsaw plant with a workforce of 125 following an investment of around DM30m (Dollars 20m) The FSO plant is also one of several locations in Europe under investigation by GM for a much more ambitious investment in the production of a new range of small cars. GM Poland will produce initially the Opel/Vauxhall Astra small family saloon car in an SKD (semi-knocked-down) kit assembly operation. Painted bodies will be delivered to Warsaw by train from the Opel plant at Antwerp, Belgium, along with engines, transmissions and other components from the group's plant at Bochum, Germany. The Astra, GM's best-selling car worldwide, with sales of 700,000 forecast for 1994, is currently assembled at plants in the UK, Belgium and Germany and at smaller facilities in Hungary, Turkey and Taiwan. Mr Jack Smith, GM chief executive, said at the weekend at the opening of the Warsaw plant that GM was also planning to begin Astra production in Brazil, Indonesia, India and Thailand. The assembly operation in Warsaw is GM's third investment in vehicle production in east Europe following the building of a car plant at Eisenach in eastern Germany, and an engine and small volume car plant at Szentgotthard in Hungary. Mr Smith said that 'Poland is and will remain a potential for future Opel car and component production.' GM is also committed to examining the prospects for producing a replacement vehicle for FSO's outdated Polonez saloon car in Warsaw. The Warsaw workforce can be increased to 250 for two-shift working and GM said that the operation had the flexibility to raise output to 33,000 a year with additional investment and employment.</p>

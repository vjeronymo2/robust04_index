			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / How Uncle Sam won over a sceptic 'No man whose mind is alive and active . . . can keep his political and spiritual opinions, much less his philosophical consciousness, at a standstill for a quarter of a century. . .'  - George Bernard Shaw in The Perfect Wagnerite (1898) GBS is always there when you need him. Recently I have been wondering how to respond to remarks that my opinions have changed since I moved to Washington. How, I am asked, can someone who rarely hesitated to find fault with Thatcherism now write so sympathetically about market forces? Is it the climate? Or perhaps the food? Am I being blackmailed by some arch-conservative think-tank? Shaw provides the perfect answer. My views have not changed. I have simply managed to avoid an intellectual 'standstill'. I may not have written for the Financial Times for a quarter of a century. But it will soon be a decade. And much has changed in those years. As people age, a coarsening of their thought is sometimes evident. Youthful idealism gives way to knee-jerk punditry, sometimes of a reactionary nature. Sympathy for the disadvantaged can evaporate. As the old adage goes: 'If you are not a socialist at 20 you don't have a heart; if you are not a conservative at 40, you don't have a head.' I am not conscious of any loss of idealism. But my views on the kind of policies that are likely to be effective in the long run have evolved. Compared with a decade ago I am more sceptical of government solutions and more willing to rely on market forces. I realise this runs directly counter to spirit of the times. President Clinton is in power, not President Reagan. In the early 1980s, there were high hopes for monetarism and markets. The pendulum has since swung back in favour of interventionist policies. Keynes's critique of classical economics is again taken seriously - especially in Britain. Various forces - some external, some internal - have contributed to my change of heart. The most significant political event of this past half-century is the demise of communism and central planning. This has occurred not just in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe but in Asia, where China is moving toward a market system, and in most of the rest of the developing world. Billions have opted to replace bureaucrats by markets. The relevance of the global collapse of communism for the advanced industrial economies can be endlessly debated. Since the west rejected full-blown central planning and stuck with parliamentary democracy, many people conclude we have nothing to learn from events in Russia, Poland or China. This strikes me as less than intellectually honest. In the days before the fall of the Berlin Wall many western economists greatly exaggerated the success of economic planning and suggested that, with a different political regime, it could provide a viable alternative to capitalism. We now know better. Communism was a logical extension of 19th-century socialist ideas. People like Shaw believed in state ownership of the means of production, in the elimination of the profit motive and in a near complete equalisation of incomes. The failure of socialism as a national economic system ought to make us more sceptical of applying similar principles on a smaller scale within industrial democracies. On a personal note, leaving Britain in 1990 before the economy imploded, has left me in a less pessimistic frame of mind than many UK commentators. Nothing fuels hostility to market forces more effectively than a depression. When unemployment is high, the well-intentioned naturally recoil against the apparent waste and cruelty of the market system. Had I lived through the latest UK recession, which was much deeper than the US downturn, I would be more receptive to anti-market rhetoric. But living in the US has illuminated some of the virtues of the market. For all its chronic social problems, America's smoothly-running market economy offers a sturdier ladder of opportunity than Britain's. There is plenty of old money around. But the link between wealth and social class is far less pronounced: if somebody is wealthy, the presumption is that they worked for it. There is a greater sense of optimism, a deeper confidence that free enterprise, for all its imperfections, will reward ability and hard work. Britain might have developed US attitudes if Gladstonian liberals had been able to resist the intellectual advance of socialism. If the Liberal party had seen off the challenge from Labour and retained its commitment to free trade and free markets, political power might have see-sawed between two parties broadly committed to free enterprise. The Liberals could have played the role of American Democrats - a role which the Labour party could yet play with distinction. Looking back, I can see that gut hostility to market forces came naturally to someone of my generation. I was, after all, raised in a welfare state. I enjoyed 'free' state education (at university as well as school) and 'free' state healthcare. I took for granted the government's right not only to steer the economy but to regulate the whole of society. I had no interest in industry or commerce. Entrepreneurship? The profit motive? These were concepts dismissed with disdain by the intellectuals I admired. I had what I would now describe as a 'hang-up' about social justice. Since our needs are similar, shouldn't we have roughly equal incomes? Why? A society must provide an ample safety net for the poor, but surely the left's obsessive desire to redistribute incomes reflects a crass materialism or, worse still, sheer envy of the good fortune of others. Nobody is qualified (not even a parliamentary majority) to judge what income their neighbour deserves. The beauty of a market system is that judgments of worth are not required: in the absence of artificial barriers to competition, what we get will usually be determined by the usefulness of our services to others. Unfortunately, market forces remain deeply unpopular. The terminology is certainly unhelpful. 'Market' sounds hideously impersonal, while 'forces' conjure up images of authoritarian repression. Why should any society subject itself to so unnatural a discipline? To appreciate the market you have to consider its nature more carefully. It is not something external forced on us. It is us: it is simply the sum total of free exchanges between individuals. It is the only genuine form of social co-operation because no exchange occurs unless each party expects to benefit. Of course, our 'voting power' on the market is not equal because our incomes differ. But the combined voting power of ordinary people vastly exceeds that of rich elites, which is why snobs so dislike commercial television. And in the market we get to vote several times a day, not once every four or five years. And we are voting on specific issues rather than consigning virtually limitless powers to a bunch of politicians. Millions of people cannot physically co-ordinate their decisions except through the market. The only alternative to the market is thus the transfer of power to bureaucratic elites, nominally supervised by their parliamentary masters. Do such opinions make me a conservative? I would say, emphatically, no. Somebody who advocates more competition and more reliance on market forces is no friend of vested interests or the status quo. Today's true conservatives are the people who have learned nothing from the 20th century, the people whose attitudes and actions distantly echo the arguments of 19th-century Fabian socialists such as Shaw. Indeed, given his optimistic temperament and commitment to human progress, I am confident that had Shaw been born in 1956, rather than 1856, he would not be a Shavian. He would be waving the market banner.</p>

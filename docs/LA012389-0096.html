			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> CENTRAL BANKS' SELLING DRIVES DOLLAR LOWER  </P> <P> Nine central banks launched a new wave of open-market dollar sales today,  driving the U.S. currency lower in their fourth-straight trading day of  intervention.  </P> <P> Dealers said the banks appeared determined to stamp out any rebound by the  dollar after they had hit it particularly hard last week by dumping up to $2  billion on the market to stop a disruptive new-year rally.  </P> <P> They struck again today when new buying lifted the dollar near 1.85 West German  marks. The dollar had opened higher in slow New York trading, with cautious  optimism resurfacing for the currency, but the intervention soon took it lower.  </P> <P> sh Numerous Banks  </P> <P> The Federal Reserve sold dollars around the day's high of 1.8480 marks. It was  joined by the Bundesbank, the Bank of Canada and six other European central  banks.  </P> <P> At 12:30 p.m. EST the dollar stood at 1.8330 West German marks and 127.65  Japanese yen, down from 1.8375 marks and 127.75 yen at Friday's close.  </P> <P> The dollar stumbled last week after the central banks' selling and coordinated  interest-rate increases in Europe, which brought the U.S. currency off its  three-month highs against the West German mark. Firm U.S. rates and hopes that  the Bush Administration will sharply cut the budget deficit had bolstered the  currency.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Caution Abroad  </P> <P> But the new central-bank dollar selling has sown new caution into the foreign  exchange market, keeping a lid on the dollar's upside potential, dealers said.  </P> <P> "It seems like more people are letting dollars out," said Charles Spence of  First Interstate Bank. "The top side is limited by the central bank  intervention."  </P> <P> Much of today's activity focused on dollar-mark trading. The yen has shown  little movement, given the continued absence of the Bank of Japan from the  central bank intervention.  </P> <P> But traders said there was still some support for the dollar. "It's an orderly  decline," said Stuart Frost of National Westminster Bank, adding that  underlying corporate demand was still evident for dollars. "I still believe  people want to buy dollars."  </P> <P> This week's key U.S. economic indicator is expected to be Friday's release of  fourth-quarter gross national product. Economists forecast the GNP to rise by  2.4%, down from 2.5% in the previous quarter. But excluding the effects of the  drought, growth last quarter would have been higher.  </P> <P> Gold for February delivery was down 60 cents at $408.60 in midday trading on  the Commodity Exchange in New York.  </P></p>

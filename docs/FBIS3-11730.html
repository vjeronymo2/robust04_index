			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Miguel Barcenas; from the "Upon Awakening" </F> newscast]    [Text] Finance Secretary Pedro Aspe attended the ceremony  held at Los Pinos official residence where the pact [for  stability, competitiveness, and employment] was signed. We  asked him how things are in the economic sector after Luis  Donaldo Colosio's assassination. Aspe said clearly Mexico has  the necessary economic stability to face the situation, and he  announced economic and stock market activities will be resumed  in our country today. He then explained clearly and in detail  the $6-billion line of credit the U.S. Government has extended  to Mexico.    [Begin recording] [Barcenas] Finance Secretary Aspe, what  can  we expect in Mexico's economic sector following the latest  events?    [Aspe] As everyone knows, following the deplorable events  which occurred yesterday and which resulted in the death of our  friend, Luis Donaldo Colosio, today the financial sector  endorsed the appeal issued by the president of the republic  concerning a day of mourning, and it abstained from working. A  certain nervousness prevailed earlier today, however, in  international markets where constant operations are carried out,  for example, public debt operations, the issuance of shares  registered at the New York Stock Exchange and other types of  documents, and this resulted in a downward trend.    We noticed a return to stability during the day, however,  and  this was a pleasant surprise, meaning the markets are much more  serious and--why not say it--more mature. Banks, stock market  firms, the Mexican stock market, foreign exchange houses, etc.  will return to normalcy; they will open for business as any  other day. The important thing to note about this is the  enormous stability we noticed despite these tragic events. We  truly have bigger, more serious, more stable, and more mature  markets.    [Barcenas] The U.S. reaction, meaning President Bill Clinton  and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, has been to support Mexico  fully; could you explain what this support entails?    [Aspe] Yes, of course. You must have heard today the U.S.  President issued a series of favorable statements concerning  Mexican institutions after talking with the president of the  republic. You know Secretary Bentsen issued two statements:  One was a statement of support, enormous support, for the way  President Salinas has handled economic policy; second, an  unusual thing. We have a reciprocal support agreement between  the two treasuries, meaning, the U.S. Treasury and the Mexican  Finance Secretariat, as well as an agreement between the U.S.  Federal Reserve Bank and our Central Bank of Mexico.    These reciprocal support agreements had involved $1 billion  for many years. In an unusual act and following many talks and  negotiations that we were able to expedite today, we received an  increase in the line of reciprocal support, from $1 billion to  $6 billion, a 600-percent sudden increase. Why is this  important? It is important to have a good economic policy, not  to have a deficit, to have a cautious monetary policy, and to  have an autonomous central bank, which will begin operations in  April; in addition, we must have ample international reserves,  which we fortunately have.    This has been achieved throughout the years thanks to the  efforts exerted by workers, peasants, businessmen, and--why not  say it--the government. We have ample reserves, but the  reciprocal support agreement means, in addition to the reserve  levels, we have $600 billion so markets may operate in an  orderly manner, to prevent any erratic movement, and to support  the stabilization of foreign exchange markets and, of course,  the economy as a whole.    I had the opportunity to talk with Secretary Bentsen  yesterday and today, and it is truly something that pleases us,  because it represents great trust, the idea that we are truly  trade partners, that we are partners with long-term visions and  mechanisms. This give us what is necessary to maintain  stability at a time when we may face short-term turbulences.    We must not forget real stability is achieved at home, and  this stability has been built progressively; hence, we will have  no fiscal deficit this year. We will not have it because this  is a pledge assumed by the president of the republic: To  deliver an economy with a very low inflation, comparable with  international inflation; a growing economy, which is being  recovered; an economy with reserves; an economy with order,  vision, and guidelines.

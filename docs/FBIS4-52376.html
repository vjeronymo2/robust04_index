			<p>BFN     [Text] Malaysia's trade with Japan, which showed a surplus  of about RM [Malaysian ringgit] 2 billion a year in the  mid-eighties, has plunged to a deficit of RM16.5 billion last  year after widening since 1988.    The latest external trade figures released by the Department  of Statistics showed that the deficit grew by 32.6 percent last  year alone.    Exports to Japan in 1993 were worth RM15.729 billion against  RM13.921 billion in 1992, but imports totalled RM32.229 billion  against RM26.366 billion in the previous year.    The trade gap widened as imports expanded at a faster rate  of  22 percent compared with the 12.9 percent growth in exports.    Bilateral trade with Japan was in Malaysia's favour in 1987  when a trade surplus of RM1.906 billion was recorded.    The following year, the pattern of trade changed and  Malaysia  experienced a deficit of RM805.9 million and since then, the  trade balance has continued to slide in Japan's favour.    In 1989, the trade deficit stood at RM3.817 billion, doubled  to RM6.480 billion in 1990, and soared to RM11.449 billion the  following year.    This have been attributed mainly to the increase in  Malaysia's import of capital goods, intermediate goods and  components, required largely for Japanese investment projects  here.    Mineral fuels and lubricants and crude and inedible  materials  were the top two exports until 1993 when it was overtaken by  machinery and transport equipment. Other major export were  manufactured goods.    In 1988, exports of crude and inedible materials were valued  at RM3.489 billion and machinery and transport equipment  amounted to merely RM914.6 million.    Last year, machinery and transport equipment emerged as the  biggest export component with exports worth RM4.613 billion or  29.1 percent of total exports, followed by mineral fuels and  lubricant RM4.307 billion (27.3 percent), crude and inedible  materials RM3.218 billion (20.4 percent), and manufactured goods  RM1.387 billio] (8.8 percent).    Exports of other sector such as food, beverages and tobacco,  and animal and vegetable oils and fats have also grown since  1988, but they remained a minor segment of the total export  volume.    The food export bill almost doubled to RM113 million last  year from RM69 million in 1988.    As for imports from Japan, machinery and transport equipment  has remained the top import item since 1988. Other major  imports are manufactured goods and chemicals.    Machinery and transport equipment amounted to a staggering  RM21.849 billion or 67.7 percent of total imports last year, and  manufactured goods were a far second with only RM5.392 billion  or 16.7 percent, and chemicals 2.026 billion.    Motor vehicle imports which fall into the machinery and  transport equipment category amounted to RM2.696 billion.    Apart from Japan, Malaysia's major trading partners in 1993  were the United States, Singapore, Taiwan, Germany, United  Kingdom, and South Korea.    Surpluses were recorded with the U.S. of RM4.777 billion,  Singapore RM8.421 billion, UK RM1.435 billion, and South Korea  RM579 million and with Taiwan RM2.405 billion deficit.</p>

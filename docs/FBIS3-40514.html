			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Toshifumi Hirai, general manager of the Aircraft </F> &amp; Ordnance Division of MITI]    [Text] The aircraft industry is in a predicament worldwide  as a result of cutbacks in defense spending and poor business  conditions among the airlines. Although the Japanese aircraft  industry has been growing steadily up until now -- first, in  connection with overcoming the handicap of being left behind by  the rest of the world as a result of Japan's defeat in World War  II and, second, in connection with surviving in the narrow niche  in the market -- it has yet to face many problems that are now  known to other high-tech industries.    Historically, it is a universal fate of the aircraft  industry  of any nation that it can not live without the support of the  government, because of its close ties to the defense industry  and because of the huge risks involved in development projects.  In addition to that, the Japanese aircraft industry is unique in  that the degree of its dependency on defense needs is much  higher than that in the United States and Europe; there are only  a few manufacturers that are dedicated to aircraft production;  defense needs consist of mostly license productions; and the  bulk of commercial aircraft and engine productions are also  limited to subassembly-level productions.    Although we cannot deny that such an industrial structure  has  made sense up until now, it is obvious that, in light of the  situation the world aircraft industry will be at the threshold  of the twenty-first century, an increase in the ratio of  commercial needs is urgently needed and supporting factors such  as R&amp;D capabilities and human resources need to improve.  <H5>  Pursuit of Autonomy </H5>   If the first task consists in maintaining an optimum balance  between risk-free defense needs and the risky commercial needs,  the second task consists in tackling various projects that  maintain the optimum balance. The projects that are currently  under way can be divided into those that require developments  under Japan's own leadership, such as YSX (commercial jet,  seating 75-90 passengers) and the ``small engine'' project, and  those futuristic large-scale international projects such as the  ``supersonic airplane'' and the ``ultralarge airplane.'' In  addition to the above, there are projects that are already in  the production or marketing phases, such as the ``B 777'' and  ``V 2500 engine'' projects. Development of new technologies such  as helicopters and new materials should not be overlooked,  either. While all of those projects need to be promoted in a  concerted manner to order to keep an optimum balance, it is  important for us to realize that the premises for it have to be  aggressive challenges in technological innovations and the  pursuit of Japan's autonomy under the framework of international  cooperation.  <H5>  Maiden Flight in 21st Century </H5>   YS-11 was developed in Japan about 30 years ago (182  airplanes sold since); more than 100 of them are still in  service around the world today. Many people wonder why that  turboprop airplane seating 60 passengers is, for whatever  reason, the only commercial airplane ever produced in Japan, a  country of such technological capability. But times are  changing, and many promising buds are about to unfold.    The YSX project has entered the feasibility study phase  already; if an economically and politically favorable conclusion  comes out of it, development will start within two years, and  the maiden flight will probably take place at the beginning of  the twenty-first century.  <H5>  Enhancing International Cooperation </H5>   Despite its current stagnation, the number of airline  passengers worldwide is predicted to increase by 6 percent  annually on a long-term basis. Amidst the worldwide trend of  expectations of long-term stable growth of the aircraft  industry, which is certain to bring about innovations and have  synergistic effects on related industries, Japan must try to  further advance and expand its horizons while enhancing  international cooperation at the same time.</p>

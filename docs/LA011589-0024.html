			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAIME ESCALANTE  </P> <P> I read with interest Jay Mathews' "The Escalante Equation" (Nov. 27), extolling  the exemplary efforts of Jamie Escalante. Those of us in the educational  community have been aware for some time of his effective teaching methods. I  must express some dismay, however, with your opening paragraph, which, in my  opinion, denigrates the efforts of such educators as Marva Collins and Dr.  George McKenna. It is unfair to compare these individuals to Escalante. One is  not better than the other; rather, their efforts are complementary.  </P> <P> ERIC V. GRAVENBERG  </P> <P> Riverside  </P></p>

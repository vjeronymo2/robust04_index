			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / UK Company News: Gearing up in preparation for a change of culture - Scottish Privatisation / The prospects for Scottish Hydro-Electric as privatisation nears BOTH nature and the privatisation process have been bountiful to Scottish Hydro-Electric, and agile management is making the most of that endowment. The consequence is one of the more attractive companies the government has ever brought to flotation. Hydro-Electric is easily the smaller of the two vertically integrated Scottish electricity companies, generating, transmitting and distributing power, which are to be floated at the end of May. It serves the northern two-thirds of Scotland, a quarter of the UK landmass but with only 600,000 domestic customers. A low 18 per cent of its Pounds 435m turnover comes from industrial users. That might not seem a very promising basis for a successful electricity company. Until privatisation loomed Hydro-Electric concealed its promise. As the junior partner of the much larger Scottish Power, which called the shots in Scottish electricity, it tended its network of 53 dams and their related hydro-electric power stations in the Highlands, but also built a large power station at Peterhead which can be run on either gas or oil. It saw itself as a utility with a social function, taking power up the glens and out to the islands, though the bulk of its customers live in Aberdeen and Dundee. It had an agreeable public image which persists to this day, and which few other electricity companies in Britain can match. The run-up to privatisation brought separation from Scottish Power and a swapping of generating assets. In the new British electricity industry, in which generators compete and Scotland's ample surplus capacity is now available to England, Hydro-Electric is well placed. Consider its advantages: in power generation its 2,800MW of generating capacity includes 1,000MW of hydro-electric plant, highly dependent on rainfall but operating at with zero marginal cost. Hydro-Electric has access to Scottish Nuclear's nuclear plants and a share of Scottish Power's coal-fired capacity. Peterhead is being adapted and increased to take relatively cheap untreated gas from British Petroleum's Miller field in the North Sea from 1992. Between 50 and 70 per cent of Peterhead's 1,300MW output is committed for sale to Scottish Power. This low cost and flexible mix of power sources enables Hydro-Electric to offer the lowest average domestic tariffs in the UK and competitive tariffs for commercial and industrial customers. Since it has relatively few industrial customers taking more than 1MW it faces little threat from other generators and last year lost only 0.6 per cent of its industrial customers to rivals. The retirement of most of the former management enabled Mr Roger Young, the chief executive who came to Hydro-Electric from the manufacturing company Low &amp; Bonar, to create an almost entirely new senior management mainly from the private sector. With the help of consultants the new team embarked on a big reorganisation, aimed at switching Hydro-Electric from being a state-owned utility to a profit-oriented business. The difficult change of culture, given Hydro-Electric's background, was helped by the fact that it is a relatively small organisation, employing only about 3,700 people, a number which has fallen faster than any of the English regional electricity companies. Roger Young, an affable but intensely determined manager, perceived from the start that most of Hydro-Electric's growth would have to come from outside its own relatively small area, where power consumption is likely to rise by between 1.5 and 2 per cent a year. Hydro-Electric was quicker than some companies in adapting to the new power trading regime in England and Wales when it began a year ago, and also achieved a coup by signing an options contract with BOC, the industrial gases group, as well as Wiggins Teape, the paper manufacturer. Power sales to England have added about 11 per cent to Hydro-Electric's sales in terms of volume and may be worth an extra Pounds 50m on top of expected 1990/91 sales to its own region of about Pounds 430m. But as with Scottish Power, exports from its surplus capacity are limited by the size of the interconnecting power lines to England, with only 300MW of capacity available to Hydro-Electric. Although planning permission is being sought to increase the size of the interconnector, which would give Hydro-Electric an extra 500MW of export capacity, the company has other plans to develop south of the border. Its most promising project is a planned 51 per cent stake in a 700MW combined cycle gas turbine plant to be built at Keadby near Scunthorpe, in partnership with Energy Resources, a north of England company. So far financial backing, gas supply and customers have not been announced but Hydro-Electric believes the Pounds 300m scheme will go ahead. The Keadby project has overtaken the Neptune project for a 1,000MW plant on Teesside, where Hydro-Electric is involved with Northern Electric (BOC recently pulled out of it). If Keadby goes ahead and the interconnector expands, Hydro-Electric could in five years time be selling as much power in England as in Scotland. It is from England that most growth in Hydro-Electric's profits is likely to come. Profits growth in Scotland may be sluggish, with Hydro-Electric being obliged by the regulator to keep its increases in domestic tariffs to just below the rate of inflation (unlike the English regional electricity companies), entailing further improvements in efficiency, though production costs will fall with Miller gas coming onstream from 1992. The government is expected to float Hydro-Electric with a stiff gearing ratio of nearly 50 per cent, knowing that it needs no large new generating plant in Scotland and that it made a respectable Pounds 50m operating profit in 1989/90. That gearing may intially fall but is then likely to increase as Hydro-Electric invests in expanding the interconnector, bears its share of de-sulphurisation costs at Scottish Power's coal-burning plant and tests its management skills in building new generating plants in England.</p>

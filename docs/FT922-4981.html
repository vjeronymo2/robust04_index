			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Labour's hopes rise in Israeli election: Hugh Carnegy assesses the prospects for the two main parties in the June 23 poll AS television campaigning got underway last night in the battle for the June 23 Israeli general election, the slogan of the opposition Labour party blared 'Israel is waiting for Rabin'. Certainly Palestinians in the occupied territories, the wider Arab world, and, albeit silently, the US government, are hoping Labour's brash assertion is right that Mr Yizhak Rabin, its new leader, is about to sweep the party back into power. Mr Rabin has promised to abandon the ideological extremes of the Likud party, in government since 1977, substituting its refusal to give up any land with a commitment to trade territory for peace in the hitherto deadlocked Middle East peace negotiations. He says he would curb Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and reach an agreement for interim Palestinian self-rule in the territories within six months. Buoyed by favourable opinion polls and a stuttering performance by Likud, Labour is showing greater verve and confidence than it has for years. But is Israel indeed waiting to put Mr Rabin back in office (he was previously an unremarkable prime minister in the mid-1970s)? Is it really any closer to resolving the bitter internal divisions over what to do about the territories that have persisted for 25 years since Gen Rabin, then chief of staff, led Israel to victory in the June 1967 Six Day War? The paradoxical answer may be yes to the former, but no to the latter, leaving a question mark over whether Israel will be able to move forward decisively in the peace process. In contrast to Labour's well-organised campaign, the Likud is suffering the fatigue of long years in office, and is beset by angry feuding among potential successors as party leader to the tough but uninspiring Mr Shamir. Labour has apparently successfully shrugged off Likud allegations that Mr Rabin is a heavy drinker who suffered a nervous collapse before the 1967 war. Opinion polls have shown Mr Rabin as easily the most popular candidate for prime minister. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence of widespread dissatisfaction with Likud. Labour faces a hard struggle nonetheless. Neither Labour nor Likud has ever won a majority in the 120-seat Knesset and neither will come close this time. Mr Rabin's stated target is that Labour and its allies in the smaller parties will win at least a 60-seat block and then induce at least some or all of the three religious parties into a majority coalition based on Labour's agenda. Labour's prospective allies are Meretz, a new unified alignment of three 'dovish' liberal and leftist parties, and three parties which draw their support from the country's Arab minority. Even Labour supporters are sceptical that together the 'block' can add five new seats to the 55 they won in the 1988 election in a system where swings tend to be marginal. 'It means Labour, Meretz and the Arab parties must all achieve the very best they are capable of and I'm afraid that is too much to hope for,' says Mr Nimrod Novik, a senior Labour campaign leader in the last election. Things are far from rosy on the right. Apart from Likud's difficulties, Tehiya, Moledet and Tzomet, the three extreme right-wing parties previously in coalition with Likud, failed to agree on a vote-maximising election pact. But polls show about one- third of voters are still undecided. Likud, its campaign starting to look more coherent, is confident many waverers will return, especially once it has hammered home its message that a Rabin government would be hostage to 'doves'. 'There is anger in the field against the Likud, no doubt about it,' says Mr Rafi Shitreet, Likud campaign manager in the southern city of Beersheba, a Likud stronghold. 'But Labour can't make a coalition without the extreme left and the Arabs. People know how to count. They won't vote for that.' In fact, there are strong grounds for believing Mr Rabin doesn't want it either. He has always been uncomfortable in the company of doves. Since the mid- and late-1980s when Labour and Likud were in coalition, he has believed that they can move forward together in the peace negotiations at least to the first stage of limited Palestinian self rule. Mr Rabin may well be happy for Labour just to overtake Likud as the biggest party (the difference was only 40 to 39 seats in 1988). He would then seek to cajole the Likud into a grand coalition in which he was prime minister and clear senior partner. He would attempt to go forward in the peace talks, but the old divisions about the long-term solution would remain unresolved. Whatever happens, forming a coalition will take time, as it always does in Israel. 'It will take a minimum of six weeks - more likely eight to 10,' predicted Mr Novik, a veteran of coalition wrangling.</p>

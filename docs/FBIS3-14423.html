No force was used. Hundreds of Qiryat Arba'  residents yesterday tried to reach the Cave of the Patriarchs to  hold the Passover seder there. The Army prevented their exit  from Qiryat Arba'. There were clashes between the soldiers and  the settlers, and nine of them were transferred to the Hebron  police. Later in the evening it was decided to detain five of  them, and they were transferred to a Jerusalem detention center.  They were dispossessed of their arms.    Moledet Knesset Member Ba-Gad told our correspondent that  the  number of detainees is 15. According to Ba-Gad, Rabbi Waldman  held the seder on the road since he was not allowed access to  the Cave of the Patriarchs. The residents of Bet Hadassah in  Hebron told Rabbi Ba-Gad that they are not allowed to leave  their place of residence. The settlers in Hebron are afraid to  leave the town lest they will be forbidden to return and thus  the number of settlers in Hebron will decline. Rabbi Hayim  Druckman, one of the National Religious Party leaders, told our  correspondent Mikha'el Tuchfeld that the security forces  desecrated the holiday by erecting barbed-wire fences at the  exit from Qiryat Arba', by bringing in hundreds of male and  female soldiers by bus, and by carrying out other work in the  area. [passage omitted]    Two border policemen and three Israeli civilians were  slightly injured by stones during incidents in the territories  today. They were treated and released to their homes. Twenty  six Arab residents were wounded by soldiers' fire in Tulkarm,  Ramallah, Hebron, and Gaza.</p>

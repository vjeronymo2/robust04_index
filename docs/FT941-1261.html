			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee ignores retention cut - Market Report The London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures market shrugged off confirmation yesterday morning that the recent rise in prices had triggered the halving to 10 per cent of the amount of exports producing countries are obliged under their retention scheme to withhold from the market. And in the afternoon it kept its head in the face of a decidedly shaky New York market. At the close the May position stood at Dollars 1,360 a tonne, Dollars 8 below the peak reached earlier but still Dollars 13 up on the day. At the London Metal Exchange an expected break below support levels in the COPPER and ALUMINIUM markets did not materialise as late bouts of short-covering in the afternoon mingled with trade and commission house buying to stem early losses. Dealers said both metals were under pressure from the outset, although solid underlying chart patterns remained supportive. Three months delivery copper spent most of the day probing below the Dollars 1,940 support level but as the selling pressure lifted slightly prices moved higher. LME stocks and deteriorating charts continued to erode ZINC'S recent gains, while LEAD prices eased further, with traders suggesting that a test of underlying support at Dollars 450 a tonne was likely to be made soon.

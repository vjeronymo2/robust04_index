			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Planning Minister Maria Teresa Orellana de  Rendon announced yesterday that the Argentine Government will  provide economic and technical assistance to El Salvador to  prevent drug abuse and fight drug trafficking in the country.  Orellana de Rendon, who was accompanied by Argentine Ambassador  Roberto Horacio Magnacca, Argentine International Affairs  Director Eduardo Gonzalez, and several representatives of the  Argentine Embassy, commented on the need for bilateral efforts  against drug trafficking.    Although she did not give any figures, the deputy minister  said the assistance will consist of four seminars on preventing  drug consumption and will focus on education, health, security,  and law enforcement.    Some of the topics to be discussed at the forum are  upgrading  security and police forces to fight drug trafficking, providing  preventive education in schools, and formulating a Latin  American plan to teach health professionals.    "I believe this a very important step by the two countries  to  fight drug trafficking," the Argentine ambassador noted.    The joint seminars could be held from September to October  this year with the participation of institutions such as the  Foreign Relations, Health, Education, and Justice Ministries;  the Prosecutor General's and Attorney General's Offices;  security corps (National Police and Civilian National Police);  and Fundasalva [expansion unknown].</p>

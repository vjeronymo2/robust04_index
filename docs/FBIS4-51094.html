			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, May 24 (XINHUA) -- Presidents from  universities in 20 countries and regions and officials from the  United Nations as well as from China are attending a four-day  international conference on talents flow, which opened here  today.    The problem of brain drain from the developing nations to  the  developed nations has drawn wide-range attention from the  developing countries, and the meeting is expected to exchange  views on that problem and to probe for solutions, said Wei Yu,  vice-minister in charge of China's State Education Commission.    Talents flow along with greater regional economic  cooperation  and an open international market, Wei said at the meeting.    He said that from a long-term viewpoint, the shift of  talented people helps promote cultural and technological  exchange between different countries.    But developing nations often suffer from a brain drain that  has negative effects on the local economy because often more  talented people drift from the developing nations to the  developed countries than in the reverse direction, he said.    "Talented people are a kind of wealth," he said. "The  training of talented people costs a long term investment."</p>

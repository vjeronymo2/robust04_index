			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Swedish socialists reject coalition Mr Ingvar Carlsson, Sweden's prime minister-elect, said yesterday he would form a minority government following the victory of his Social Democratic party in Sunday's elections. His announcement, after talks with other party leaders, disappointed financial markets and business leaders who had hoped for a majority coalition with the Liberal party. However, the news was not unexpected and markets responded calmly. Bond yields edged up and both the krona and share prices weakened slightly. Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, reaffirmed its rating on Sweden's long-term senior foreign currency debt at AA+. Mr Carlsson said a minority government would be able to deal more effectively with the country's large budget deficit and better assure the country's accession to the European Union than a coalition. He stressed he was confident of being able to work across party boundaries and gain support for spending cuts and increased revenue worth SKr61bn (Pounds 5bn) to the budget. 'The government which has the best chance to create broad agreement in the Riksdag (parliament) is a Social Democratic government,' he said. The Social Democrats hold 162 seats in the Riksdag, 13 short of a majority. They are likely to rely on the former communist Left party or the Green party on some issues and the Liberals or the Centre party, both members of the outgoing centre-right government, on others. Any one party could provide the necessary support for a majority. Mr Bengt Westerberg, the Liberal party leader, resigned immediately after Mr Carlsson's statement, criticising the Social Democratic leader for not trying to build a coalition. He indicated during the election he would step down if his party lost support - which it did - but it was clear he would have been prepared to stay on to discuss a possible coalition. Financial markets wanted a Social Democratic coalition with the Liberals because they believed it would lead to tougher action to curb Sweden's fast-growing debt and its budget deficit, which last year amounted to 13 per cent of gross domestic product. The yield on five-year Swedish bonds rose 6 basis points to 10.86 immediately after Mr Carlsson's statement.</p>

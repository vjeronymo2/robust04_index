			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / How do you say federalism in Castilian? Spain has been taking a searching look at itself this week and its many and varied parts have decided it is time to move a bit further apart. The push for what could prompt a first amendment to Spain's 1978 constitution follows a three-day debate in the senate. It underlined the complexity of a country that is multi-lingual, multi-cultural and, as some would have it, multi-national. At an immediate level the cleavages in the Spanish state are expressed linguistically; five of the 16 autonomous community presidents at the debate (there are 17 such areas, but the Basques stayed away) delivered their speeches in languages other than Spanish, or, as Spaniards say, languages other than Castilian. The spectacle of senior Spanish politicians avoiding their common language to sort out their differences prompted one Madrid political commentator to write that the senate sittings had 'gone beyond the limits of what is imaginable, to become hallucinatory'. The constitution set off the decentralisation process, dividing administration of Spain into 17 so-called autonomous communities. Some have acquired powers more quickly than others, although by the end of the process, which is open-ended, it is intended there should be no discrimination between them. Over the next two years a committee of more than 60 senators and judicial experts will be putting together a constitutional reform package. 'We are looking towards a properly functioning territorial chamber that will borrow elements from the US senate and from the (German) Bundesrat,' said Mr Oswaldo Brito, a senator representing the Canary Islands. The founder and leader of Catalonia's ruling nationalist party and president of the Catalan autonomous community of north-east Spain, Mr Jordi Pujol, told the senate gathering that there would always be qualitative differences between historic nationalities such as his homeland and other communities. 'There can be no doubts that Catalonia is a nation,' he told the senate in his native Catalan language. Speaking in the lisping Castilian that characterises the south of Spain, Mr Manuel Chaves, the socialist president of the Andalucia, the most populous and one of the most economically deprived of the autonomous communities, warned that any change to the existing guidelines would have to 'respect the principle of equality that is enshrined in the constitution'. Andalucia has already opposed an arrangement negotiated by the Catalans which allows the community governments to spend 15 per cent of the income tax raised in their jurisdiction as they see fit. It says this would allow wealthy Catalonia to widen regional imbalances. The position of Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, is an awkward one as his minority Socialist government is dependent on the support of Mr Pujol's Catalan nationalists. An altogether more prosaic, but no less keenly felt, issue was a squabble over the transfer of water reserves from central Spain to the drought-ridden fruit orchards by the Mediterranean coast. Many of the present problems originate in Spain's fast switch to democracy after the death of General Franco in 1975. The transition government had to address the long repressed nationalist sentiment in Catalonia and in the Basque country but, wary of the right wing and of Franco's army, it sought to defuse home rule in those areas by extending it to the rest of Spain. The result has been an unsatisfactory mix between certain communities which can claim genuine political and cultural identities and others, like the Madrid autonomy that sprawls out from the Spanish capital, that lack any such attributes. For all its shortcomings the autonomous system set up by the constitution has served a purpose; applauding it El Pais, Spain's leading newspaper, noted that its critics should 'just think about Yugoslavia'. The Basque Country's president, Mr Jose Antonio Ardanza, best illustrated the sort of differences that lie ahead. He chose to stay away from the senate debates, saying they constituted a 'theatrical experiment' and a 'dialogue of the deaf'.</p>

He  will serve this sentence at the Callao Naval Base where he will  be Abimael Guzman's neighbor.    According to a document circulated today by the Supreme  Military Justice Council, Chavez was sentenced to life and will  serve it at the maximum security prison at the Callao Naval  Base, possibly in a cell next to or near terrorist leader  Abimael Guzman Reynoso.    Demetrio Limonier Chavez Penaherrera, alias El Vaticano, has  been condemned for treason against the fatherland and the state,  but he will be tried for illegal drug trafficking in a civilian  court. El Vaticano, however, will not go the Justice Palace  offices. Instead, the penal judge will go to the naval base  installations just as has already been done once, according to  information given by a military spokesmen.    El Vaticano was captured in Cali, Colombia, where he was  living. According to what has been established, however, he  continued handling the drug business in the Peruvian jungle.  The criminal, who is now serving a life sentence, was  considered Peru's most powerful drug trafficker due to the  amount of drugs he collected and shipped to Colombia to be  converted into cocaine for subsequent shipment to the U.S. and  European markets.</p>

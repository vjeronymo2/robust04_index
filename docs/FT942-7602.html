			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Lloyd's confident on solvency tests: Annual meeting told of 'an improving trend' Lloyd's of London will pass its annual solvency tests later this year in spite of recent losses, Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive of the insurance market, said yesterday. He told the annual meeting - which was low-key in comparison with some recent gatherings - that he had 'no doubt at all' Lloyd's would be able to pass the tests in August. 'We are going to be able to pass; we have been through the methodology with the Department of Trade and Industry and they are comfortable with the way we are proceeding,' Mr Middleton told some 1,350 Names, the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market. He said Lloyd's had used computers to forecast the impact of the 1991 loss on Names. Losses for the 1991 year - reported last week in line with its three-year accounting system - amount to Pounds 2.05bn, and have led to repeated allegations by critics that the market's ability to pass solvency will be impaired. Cumulative losses since 1988 amount to about Pounds 7bn and Lloyd's expects to report a fifth consecutive year of losses when it announces its results for 1992 next year. The market must pass two solvency tests each year. The first, which Mr Middleton described as 'the more critical in the eyes of the DTI', compares the overall level of premium income received by the market with the level of its reserves. The second matches the assets and liabilities of individual Names with any shortfalls 'earmarked' from the Central Fund, which pays claims when Names cannot meet their obligations. A leaflet distributed outside the meeting yesterday by the Parliamentary Lobby Group, an action group of loss-makers, repeated forecasts of impending insolvency, arguing that Lloyd's 'will be wound up. The only question is when.' But the sentiments were not echoed to any appreciable extent inside the meeting. Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, said its 1991 result showed the 'beginnings of an improving trend which will carry on through 1992 to good profits in 1993'. The meeting was also told that Lloyd's was exploring ways in which Names forced to reschedule their debts through so-called 'hardship' arrangements could have direct access to any compensation won from legal action against their agents. Names in hardship transfer all their assets to Lloyd's but are allowed to retain an income of about Pounds 17,000 a year - net of tax and mortgage payments - and to live in a 'modest' home, typically valued at about Pounds 150,000. In return they agree to hand any recoveries from legal action to Lloyd's. The new arrangements could help those who have used all their assets to pay losses and have insufficient funds to generate an income. Mr Middleton said after the meeting that 102 of the 266 writs issued against Names failing to pay losses had been withdrawn. Several Names speaking from the floor were critical of the market, although those protesting at alleged failure by Lloyd's in the early 1980s to disseminate information about asbestos-related losses among Names received the greatest applause. Mr Rowland said Lloyd's had already investigated these allegations and 'innuendo and gossip wasn't enough to mount inquiries'. Other loss-makers repeated allegations of incompetence and negligence, already the subject of legal action.</p>

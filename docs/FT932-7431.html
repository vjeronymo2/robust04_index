			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Management: Stepping out in a new direction - Process re-engineering is sweeping across the Atlantic / In a new series Christopher Lorenz looks at its disciples Until last year it took Bell Atlantic, the Philadelphia-based telecommunications company, between a fortnight and a month to connect customers to the long-distance carrier of their choice - unless they defected in the meantime to speedier rivals. By late 1992, waiting time was down to a highly competitive three days and it is about to be cut to just a few hours. In Dallas, an AT&amp;T unit which makes custom-designed power supplies for personal computer manufacturers has slashed its design-to-delivery cycle tenfold since 1991, from 53 to five days. And in Connecticut, IBM Credit, one of the few increasingly profitable parts of beleaguered 'Big Blue', has squeezed from a week to four hours the time it takes to approve and issue financing deals. These quantum leaps in productivity and competitive performance have all been achieved in the same way: by a radical type of organisational re-shaping called 'process re-engineering'. Though the term was scarcely known when IBM Credit began its redesign in the late 1980s, 're-engineering' has now become one of the biggest fashions ever to grab western business. Confusingly, it also masquerades under about a dozen variants of that name, depending on which consultancy is trying to promote its services, or which author wants to sell his book - of which no fewer than five have been published since December. The fashion also misleads: Many a conventional 'delayering', 'downsizing' or 'restructuring' (ie redundancy) exercise is being relabelled as re-engineering, to the extreme annoyance of the 'father' of the subject, American consultant Michael Hammer. He also distinguishes re-engineering entirely from the popular 'continuous improvement'. False impressions have also been created about its impact on employment. Re-engineering can cause striking job losses, but in many cases it creates none at all, Hammer says. Instead, companies often find that it improves their competitiveness to such an extent that they generate considerable extra business - and work to be done. With a surging market share, IBM Credit now handles 100 times as many deals as before and has had to trim its headcount only slightly. Bell Atlantic and the AT&amp;T unit have also boosted their market shares sharply and people displaced from their old jobs have been transferred to others. Purist though he is, even Hammer hypes a little. In Re-engineering The Corporation*, his book with James Champy which was published in the US this month, he allows the chief executive of Taco Bell, the American-Mexican fast-food chain, to apply the re-engineering label not only to his organisation as a whole, but also to the rearrangement of his kitchens. That is over-egging things. The hype is misleading in a different sense, too. Many consultants claim to be re-engineering 'the organisation' or 'the business', when in reality the human, political and technical challenge of the exercise is such that, at least in large companies, they have not got much further than re-engineering one or two processes in a single subsidiary. Exceptions in the US include parts of Texas Instruments, Ford, Kodak, Motorola and Hallmark Cards - where re-engineering has been far more extensive than a recent consultancy study suggested. As in almost all re-engineering, Hallmark's organisational changes are much more significant than those in its information technology, on which the study focused. In Hammer's words, the essence of re-engineering is 'starting over: beginning again with a clean sheet of paper'. It does no less, he claims, than 'reject the assumptions inherent in Adam Smith's industrial paradigm' - including both the division of labour and the need for hierarchical control. Better than any expert's formulation, the practical actions of Bell Atlantic, AT&amp;T and IBM Credit provide the key to what proper re-engineering is all about. Its essence lies in the way they have abandoned their traditionally fragmented, start-stop myriad of work tasks, routines and procedures, and have replaced them with a handful of unitary processes which have been designed from scratch to operate smoothly from end-to-end, starting with first customer contact and going right through to completion. In most western organisations, orders and projects pass tortuously up, down and across a succession of separate, vertically structured departments of 'functional' specialists, often waiting hours or days for each next task to be carried out. As Hammer puts it: 'Companies consist of vertical silos built on narrow pieces of a process.' For Bell Atlantic, its original 15-30 day cycle contained only about 10-15 actual hours of work on each project; the rest of the time was consumed in waiting and departmental hand-offs. For AT&amp;T, the proportion of real work in its product development cycle was higher, but was slowed as badly, by 80 hand-offs and 24 meetings; these have now been cut to 17 and one respectively. For IBM Credit, there was a similarly slow hand-off process as each financing request passed through the hands of four different specialists. In a re-engineered organisation, these previously separate tasks are replaced by a seamless process and functional boundaries are either bridged or removed entirely, with a 'process owner' often overseeing everyone involved. Narrow job descriptions are abandoned. At IBM Credit the four types of specialist have been replaced by a single, multi-skilled 'deal structurer', who can call on a small central pool of specialist back-up staff in the few cases where they are needed. At AT&amp;T the succession of specialists in five different departments has been supplanted by a set of multi-functional 'design cells' which handle each project from customer request right through to delivery. And at Bell Atlantic a 'case team' now carries out all the previously separate tasks; soon, all their work will be combined into the hands - and brain - of one multidisciplinary 'case worker'. A further facet of the changes at Bell Atlantic helps explain why there are, as yet, so few other convincing examples of 'real' re-engineering. To make its process changes effective, the company has already had to spend four years on a 'culture change' programme aimed at replacing the old 'command and control' mentality of managers and employees with 'new behaviours' such as empowerment, teamwork, coaching, feedback and customer-responsiveness. That programme is still running. Bell is no isolated case. A cultural transformation of this magnitude is vital to the success of re-engineering within any company, according to four Coopers &amp; Lybrand consultants whose book is published on Thursday**. Since a string of other changes must be also made at the same time - notably a refocusing of performance measurement and incentive systems from individuals onto teamwork - they argue that re-engineering requires sustained commitment by top management over a matter of years. Thomas Davenport, an Ernst &amp; Young partner, whose book*** on what he prefers to call 'process innovation' is one of the most comprehensive, goes further. In many companies radical culture change has proved unpalatable and has blocked re-engineering, he says. Even if re-engineering does not hit the cultural buffers, it is certainly a very tall order. As the Coopers team says, the financial, emotional, organisational, training and time-costs of 'ramping up into a process-oriented business' are 'not insignificant'. Re-engineering promises glowing rewards, in other words, but also great risk. * HarperBusiness Dollars 25.

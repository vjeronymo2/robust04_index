			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> MONORAIL CLOSES FOR 2 HOURS DUE TO FIRE  </P> <P> A small fire on on the Disneyland monorail track Sunday closed the train for  about two hours but only caused minor damage and resulted in no injuries,  according to officials at Disneyland and the Disneyland Hotel.  </P> <P> Paul Goldman, a spokesman for Disneyland, said a spark from the "live,"  electrified, third rail on the monorail track near the hotel caught fire after  passengers had already exited from the train.  </P> <P> Hotel officials noticed smoke and notified Anaheim and Disneyland fire units  shortly after 10:30 a.m.  </P> <P> Disneyland firefighters were first on the scene and extinguished the blaze  before their Anaheim counterparts arrived.  </P> <P> "There weren't any people affected," Goldman said. "This happened down the  track from the boarding area."  </P> <P> Investigators are still trying to determine the exact cause of the fire, but  Goldman said early signs point to a spark igniting either debris or a  fiberglass awning that sits beneath the track. A section of awning several feet  long was damaged in the fire and will have to be replaced, he added.  </P> <P> Windy conditions in and around the park Sunday afternoon could have blown  debris onto the track, Goldman said, and that debris might have been ignited by  a spark from the rail.  </P> <P> "Like any train that runs on a live third rail, there is occasional electrical  sparking," he said.  </P> <P> There was no damage to any of the monorail train cars, and the monorail was  back in service about 12:30 p.m. JIM NEWTON  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IBM TARGETS AD FIRMS TO PITCH NEW TECHNOLOGY;  </P> <P> MARKETING: THE PUSH IS PART OF A LARGER CAMPAIGN TO GO AFTER SMALL BUSINESSES  AND LESSEN APPLE COMPUTER'S DOMINANCE IN DESKTOP PUBLISHING.  </P> <P> It's not exactly a computer manufacturer's dream market: a bunch of  artistically inclined users who cringe at the thought of having to learn  computer operating instructions.  </P> <P> Yet mighty International Business Machines has launched an all-out campaign to  woo a group of creative types decidedly more finicky than back-office bean  counters.  </P> <P> Armed with new software technology that it is heavily promoting, the Armonk,  N.Y., company is zeroing in on advertising agency creative departments -- a  market now dominated by Apple Computer. While these art directors, designers  and copywriters constitute a small part of the desktop publishing population,  they nonetheless present a formidable proving ground: an eclectic group hungry  for new visual tools, whose passions tend to set design and style trends  watched closely by other industries.  </P> <P> IBM's new push pits its enormous resources against those of its smaller but  feisty competitor, Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple, with its widely popular  Macintosh that is by far the machine of choice in ad agency creative  departments.  </P> <P> For instance, at Zam &amp; Kirshner &amp; Geller Inc., a small Garden City,  N.Y., agency that owns two Apple Macintoshes, creative employees use the  computers to dream up copy, design typography for headlines, develop rough  layouts and send copy through phone transmissions to advertisers for approval.  </P> <P> "If you're talking about computers in the creative arena, there isn't much of a  contest. It's all Apple, just about," said Tom Phelan, staff executive at the  American Assn. of Advertising Agencies, an industry group representing roughly  770 agencies.  </P> <P> IBM's ad agency drive is part of a larger marketing campaign due to break early  next year that also targets small businesses, such as commercial printers and  civic associations, that may not already own desktop publishing computers.  </P> <P> "We anticipate this to become a big part of company revenues," said Kim  Johnson, IBM's manager for new business for media. "It's the fastest-growing  area for computer resources today."  </P> <P> In making its personal computers appealing to advertising creative departments,  IBM has increasingly been relying on Microsoft's OS/2 operating system, which  allows its PCs to perform a wide variety of graphic functions. OS/2 is the  basic software driving IBM's most powerful personal computers and IBM  compatibles.  </P> <P> IBM hopes to use OS/2 on most of its personal computers, replacing the MS-DOS  software that some users regard as more difficult to learn. Yet to date, sales  of OS/2 have been languishing -- only 180,000 copies have been sold since it  became available 2 1/2 years ago, according to Dataquest Inc., a market  research company in San Jose.  </P> <P> In a bid to bolster OS/2 sales, IBM and Microsoft last week announced several  measures to make the software available on a wider range of computers.  </P> <P> Unlike the MS-DOS software, the Mac-like OS/2 operating system makes it  possible for users to choose from different edit and design options simply by  moving the cursor onto any one of several easily recognizable images: For  example, choosing an image of a garbage pail allows the user to delete a file.  </P> <P> Some critics say that text display, manipulation and printing on the OS/2  operating system is inferior to that of the Macintosh.  </P> <P> Apple's popularity, however, isn't deterring IBM. Next year it will conduct a  direct-mail and telemarketing campaign aimed at businesses with 50 or fewer  employees -- including small agencies, design firms, churches and civic  associations. A planned ad campaign could begin as early as next month in  publications such as Adweek, Advertising Age and Marketing &amp; Media  Decisions magazine. Big Blue will also try to attract new customers by holding  seminars on new technology.  </P> <P> The $60-billion company continues to spend more in advertising than the  much-smaller Apple, which had roughly $4 billion in revenue in 1989.  LNA-Arbitron, an industry research group, reports that IBM spent $36 million  last year advertising its PS/2 computer, the personal computer on which the  OS/2 operates, topping Apple's spending for the Macintosh by about $5 million.  In the first half of 1989, IBM spent $8.9 million for its PS/2, compared to  roughly half that amount spent for the Mac.  </P> <P> Moreover, IBM has forged what it terms "business partnerships" with software  companies in an attempt to get them to unify their offerings and custom-tailor  software to the needs of specific industries.  </P> <P> IBM's approach contrasts with Apple's focus of spectacular ad campaigns on  widely watched television programing such as the Super Bowl, which attract  general audiences instead of specific industry markets.  </P> <P> There are several reasons for this. Big Blue has been trying to shed its image  as the Big Brother of technology, exploited by Apple's "1984" television  commercial introducing the Macintosh. Super Bowl audiences five years ago  watched a lithe runner hurl a hammer through the image of a dictator on a giant  TV screen -- apparently symbolizing Apple's liberation of the masses from the  Orwellian enslavement of hard-to-learn technology.  </P> <P> There are some who do not think IBM's image has changed much since.  </P> <P> "Buying desktop publishing from IBM is sort of like buying skis from an  Egyptian company," said Steve Hayden, executive creative director at BBDO-Los  Angeles, who coordinates computer purchasing for the agency's New York office  as well. Both are heavily dependent on Macs. "IBM may have the concept, but  they don't have the execution."  </P> <P> In addition, analysts say, IBM has had a hard time getting software developers  to create applications that work well together. The differences can be  confusing to users.  </P> <P> "IBM's problem is that it has so many products that have such a hard time  working with each other it is forced to spend most of its time working with  customers' problems," said Francis McInerney, an analyst at Northern Business  Information-Datapro, a New York-based industry research firm. "IBM has to live  with a flawed technology base."  </P> <P> Besides delays in launching the much ballyhooed OS/2 operating system and the  software to go with it, the biggest stumbling block to getting people to scrap  their Apples seems to be the enormous popularity of the Macintosh brand name --  which since its introduction in 1984 has become synonymous with desktop  publishing.  </P> <P> The agreement announced last week between IBM and Microsoft is intended to make  OS/2 available on a wider range of computers. The companies last Monday said  they are currently developing a new version of OS/2 that would run on cheaper,  low-end machines with only two megabytes of internal memory. Current OS/2  versions aren't recommended for use in computers with less than four megabytes  of memory.  </P> <P> While Apple denies that heated rivalry is the reason, observers say that an  unusually aggressive marketing campaign is perhaps the best indication that  Apple takes IBM's threat seriously. Reviving and strengthening a concept that  has been dormant two years, Apple this fall is letting prospective customers  "test drive" a Macintosh and, if not satisfied, return it by mid-January. Two  years ago, the trial period was much shorter.  </P></p>

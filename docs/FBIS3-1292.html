At present, many MPs continue to hold the commercial  jobs they held when elected, earning additional incomes as  businessmen, lawyers, farmers and company directors. MPs  currently earn a state income of R179,800 [rand] a year,  comprising a salary of R90,800, a transport allowance of R55,000  and a daily expenses allowance of R34,000.    Mr Niehaus said the restriction on other work would ensure  MPs devoted their full attention to parliamentary duties. It  would also minimise corruption.    If the proposal is accepted by the ANC, there is a strong  possibility it will be tabled in Parliament as a measure  applying to all MPs.    A National Party MP who did not want to be named said there  were two reasons why MPs should be allowed to continue other  work: it made them financially independent and so less  vulnerable to corruption, and it gave them valuable practical  skills that could be directed to parliamentary work.    Whenever a commercial concern was discussed in Parliament,  any MPs with links to it were obliged to declare their interests  and recuse themselves from the discussion, he said.    Although MPs' incomes looked high, there were many hidden  costs; for example, they had to maintain two households, one in  Cape Town where Parliament sat and one in their constituency.</p>

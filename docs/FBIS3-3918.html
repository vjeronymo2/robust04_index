			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Pei Jianfeng: "Electronic Information Network Is On </F> Horizon"]    [Text] While the United States, the European Union and  Japan are poised to build their "Information Highways," China is  also gearing up to enter the information era.    The ambitious plan, called "The Golden Bridge" project, was  put forward last July by Hu Qili, Minister of Electronics  Industry, and is now a national priority.    According to experts from the ministry, the massive project  would set up a nationwide channel devoted to making economic  information available to the public.    This information network would cover all provinces and  autonomous regions, 500 main cities, 12,000 large enterprises,  and some key projects such as the Three Gorges dam and the Daya  Bay Nuclear Power Plant.    Experts say the network would transmit data, voices, images  and faxes by way of fibre-optic cable, satellites, microwave  transmissions and programme-controlled and mobile  telecommunications.    In addition, financial networks would accommodate the  demands  of foreign trade, customs and banking.    Such a project could greatly strengthen the government's  macrocontrol over the economy and bolster the development of  information services, experts say.    The first stage of the project is called "Golden Customs;"  the second stage, the "Golden Card."    "Golden Customs" would link all customs and foreign trade  enterprises electronically, with the intention of creating a  paperless trade.    Experts say the project would ensure accurate and timely  statistics on the country's foreign trade and would help check  malpractices regarding licenses, quotas, settlement of foreign  exchanges, and taxes.    The aim of "Golden Card" is to replace cash with electronic  money -- credit cards.    China, with nearly 1.2 billion people, has issued only 4  million credit cards. In the United States, on the other hand,  more than 1 billion credit cards are used by a population of 260  million. In other words, the average American has nearly four  credit cards.    "Golden Card" would spread the use of credit cards  throughout  the major urban areas within 10 years.    The "Three Golden" projects would open massive opportunities  for the electronics industry, said Minister Hu Qili.    Electronics enterprises would have to provide large  quantities of hardware and software for the projects, Hu said.    The ministry would also actively co-operate with foreign  companies to inject capital and advanced technology into the  projects, said Qu Weizhi, Vice-Minister of Electronics Industry.    But Qu stressed that the projects would follow a unified  standard. Local authorities are prohibited from negotiating  with foreign companies to import products and technology of  varying standards.    The overall design for the Golden Bridge project will be  worked out this year, Hu said.    Satellite stations for Golden Customs will be linked  together  during the first half of the year.    Some cities will be selected to test the Golden Card project  this year. The likely candidates include Beijing, Shanghai,  Tianjin, Dalian, Qingdao, Guangzhou.</p>

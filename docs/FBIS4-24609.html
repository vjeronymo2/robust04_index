			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Huang Changrui 7806 2490 3843] </F>   [Text] Valletta, 26 May (XINHUA) -- When interviewed by  this reporter before his departure for China at the Prime  Minister's Office on 26 May, Maltese Prime Minister Fenech Adami  said "Malta and China have maintained a very good relationship  since their establishment of diplomatic ties. The purpose of my  upcoming visit to China is to explore ways to make the bilateral  relationship even better."    Fenech Adami recalled his first visit to China in 1978 when  he was the leader of Malta's opposition party. He said: "It was  at that time that I began to realize the importance of  developing the Maltese-Chinese relationship." He said Malta and  China may further explore means of cooperation in other areas,  including economics and finance. He added that he would  exchange views with Chinese leaders over bilateral relations and  over mulilateral international cooperation while in Beijing.    Discussing the domestic economy, Adami said that Malta is  readjusting its economic structure and that Malta has scored  positive results in the areas of developing the economy, foreign  trade, and in raising the people's living standards. He said  that while Western Europe's economy is still in a downturn,  Malta is enjoying continued economic growth. Its unemployment  rate is only 4 percent. Both its tourism and electronic  industry have achieved gratifying developments. He also  stressed that Malta is striving to join the European Union,  which is very important to Malta economically and politically.    Turning to the situation in the Mediterranean, Adami said:  "As a country situated in the middle of the Mediterranean, Malta  stands for promoting cooperation with other countries in the  region and for establishing a permanent organization that will  serve as a place for dialogue and cooperation for the countries  in the region."    He also noted that the situation in the Mediterranean  sometimes becomes critical or even very turbulent. However, as  a whole, a situation that is cause for undue concern has yet to  develop. Still, there is a need to keep a close watch on the  development of negative trends.</p>

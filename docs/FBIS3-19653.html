			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ulrich Rosenbaum report: "SPD: Those Who Earn More -- as </F> of 2,500 Marks"]    [Text] Bonn -- Yesterday Social Democratic Party of  Germany [SPD] Chairman Rudolf Scharping presented his party's  draft for a government program. On Monday [21 March] he will  also present it to the SPD Executive Committee. By doing this,  he is attempting to anticipate indiscretions and, at the same  time, counter reports that the SPD is planning massive tax  increases, Scharping said. He made it clear that, if the SPD  wins the elections, he does not want to go beyond the tax quota  of 1995. However, "redistributions" in the tax system at the  cost of those who earn more are intended.    The SPD chairman affirmed that his party wants to replace  the  solidarity surcharge of 7.5 percent for all taxpayers, which has  been in effect as of 1 January, with a 10-percent supplementary  tax. This is to be levied as of an annual income of 50,000  German marks [DM] for singles and DM100,000 for married couples.  According to calculations made by DIE WELT, this corresponds to  a monthly net income of about DM2,500 for singles and DM5,000  for married couples (without deduction of health insurance  contributions). According to the SPD, the bottom line is to be  the same as in the case of the solidarity surcharge: DM27  billion per year.    Scharping also recalled the assignment of the Federal  Constitutional Court to exempt the subsistence minimum from  taxes as of 1996 at the latest. The SPD will tackle this matter  immediately. By easing the tax burden on lower and medium  incomes, the party expects increased demand and thus a  stimulation of the economic development.    The SPD wants to find a basically new regulation for the  equalization of burdens on families. The tax-free amount for  children is to be abolished and replaced with a unified  children's allowance of DM250 per child, which is to be deducted  directly from the taxes owed. If someone is entitled to more  children's allowance than he pays in taxes, he gets the  difference directly from the financial authorities. On the  other hand, a still unspecified upper limit is to be introduced  for spouse's tax splitting.    In order to abolish the "fairness gap" in financing German  unification, which has developed over the past years, high  private incomes and large fortunes are to make a greater  contribution. This includes, among other things, a higher  inheritance tax.    The program also mentions the "ecological tax reform," but  it  does not speak of raising the petroleum tax. Scharping pointed  to the planned unified energy tax of the European Union.    Government Spokesman Dieter Vogel criticized that the  supplementary tax will lead to serious disturbances in the  economy. Finance Minister Theo Waigel called Scharping's  proposals dubious. The supplementary tax, which already hits  average wage-earners, does not yield one single mark to finance  the other SPD projects.</p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan under pressure after interest rate warning The bear market in bonds continued to wreak havoc in European equity markets, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN came under renewed pressure as worries about the outlook for the economy and interest rates further soured the mood. The Comit index, which had posted losses on each of the previous five sessions, fell another 14.73, or 2.1 per cent, to 700.69, prompting expectations that it would test support at the 690-point level before upward momentum could be regained. Mr Tancredi Bianchi, head of the Italian Banking Association, warned late on Wednesday that Italian rates could rise by a full percentage point before the end of the year if there were no change in the international outlook. This compounded an already nervous mood as the new account began with the market facing a hefty round of cash calls. Blue chips bore the brunt of the selling, with Fiat off L212, or 3.3 per cent, at L6,200, Olivetti down L85, or 3.4 per cent, at L2,405 and Pirelli losing L119, or 4.5 per cent, at L2,519. Against the trend, Mondadori, which had been marked sharply lower earlier in the week, bounced L1,080, or 7.1 per cent, to L16,380 as its L900bn share offer began. FRANKFURT was sandbagged again by bond market weakness, said Mr Eckhard Frahm at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, but it was worried, too, about the weaker dollar, and about technical aspects of the market with DTB contracts due to expire today, and the Daimler rights issue to begin on Monday. The Dax index fell 19.79 to 2,054.91 on the session, hit 2,040.89 at the bottom of the post-bourse and recovered to 2,047.29 at the end of the day on the hope that there might be some recovery potential on options expiry today. Turnover fell from DM7.6bn to DM6.7bn. Veba, the energy, chemicals and oils group, recovered intraday, moving from DM498.50, down DM8.90 on the session to DM506 at the end of the afternoon. Merck Finck, Hoare Govett and Goldman Sachs have all lauded the group's earnings potential. PARIS maintained its downtrend, although early weakness was softened slightly by a further easing from the Bank of France in the intervention rate, something which had largely been discounted by investors. The CAC-40 index lost 23.58 or 1.2 per cent to 1,942.81, putting in a late spurt at the end of the day to rise above a session low of 1,931. Baring Securities said that investors should return to the market during the third quarter before the publication of first half results in mid-September/October, likely to show a significant improvement in company earnings. St Gobain closed unchanged at FFr629 and said that it might increase its stake in Essilor, the manufacturer of spectacle lenses. Schneider went against the trend, up FFr8.10 to FFr356.90, as it announced that it was to sell FFr700m worth of assets which would bring it a pre-tax capital gain of FFr350-400m. The group also said that it expected to report a significant rise in 1994 profits. AMSTERDAM closed at a new low for the year as the equity market continued to take its lead from weakness in bonds. The AEX index dipped 5.04 or 1.2 per cent to 395.74, just above the session low of 395.42. DSM was dragged down by Fl 3.50 to Fl 124.30 as selling on the options exchange took hold. There was also reported switching out of the group into other European chemical groups. Akzo also weakened in line with the day's trend, finishing off Fl 3.00 at Fl 206.70. Ahold, which reported first quarter profits of some Fl 110m, eased 60 cents to Fl 46.50, while Royal Dutch fell by a similar amount to Fl 198.30 as the oil price hit its highest level for 12 months. ZURICH failed to sustain an afternoon recovery and the SMI index gave up 35.2 to 2,666.6 in response to the weakness of bonds and the dollar. Financial shares remained under pressure with UBS bearers losing SFr34 or 2.9 per cent to SFr1,140. CS Holding was SFr15 lower at SFr550 and SBC lost SFr10 to SFr385. Among pharmaceuticals, Roche certificates gave up SFr80 to SFr6,600 while the recently weak Ciba registered lost SFr1 to SFr825 and Sandoz registered dipped SFr4 to SFr715. Nestle fell SFr15 to SFr1,145: UBS, which recommends the stock, commented that the favourable medium-term outlook for the group should help it to outperform its European peer group. Swissair lost SFr10 to SFr767 as the market awaited a statement after the market closed, following a press report that the group planned to take a near 50 per cent stake in Sabina. In the event, Swissair said it was holding talks with several airlines. MADRID lost just over 2 per cent, the general index closing 6.49 lower at 311.31 with turnover up again, to nearly Pta44bn. Construction stocks were hardest hit with Dragados down Pta100, or 4.4 per cent to Pta2,090 and Valderrivas Pta480, or 4.1 per cent lower at Pta11,220. ISTANBUL leapt 7.4 per cent as the supreme court over-ruled an application to block the government's aim to speed up the privatisation process. The composite index added 1,320.75 to 19,321.67, after touching a midsession high of 19,611. WARSAW rallied nearly 6 per cent but traders said that the outlook remained mixed. The Wig index rose 452.5 to 8,386.5 and turnover by 34 per cent to 1,200bn zlotys. Brokers added that the market's rise could signal that the market was bottoming out from a two-week fall, during which the index hit its lowest level since last October.

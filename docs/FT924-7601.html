			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Turkey seeks consensus on Kurds THE suffering of the Kurds should not be used by outside powers as a pretext to partition Iraq, Iran warned over the weekend after a meeting of the foreign ministers of Turkey, Iran and Syria in Ankara. A joint statement reiterated their shared concern about the evolution of a Kurdish state, despite repeated assurances from the Kurdish leadership that it does not seek to divide Iraq. Mr Ali Akbar Velayati, Iranian foreign minister, said the situation in the Kurdish regions was chaotic, with a total absence of responsible government, despite the election of a Kurdish assembly in May. Mr Hikmet Cetin, Turkish foreign minister, warned the situation 'should not become consolidated or legalised'. In the run-up to the Gulf war, Turkish President Turgut Ozal had warned Syria and Iran not to exploit the power vacuum if Iraq was defeated. The latest meeting is the first time Turkey has broken ranks with its western allies by seeking a common stance with its regional neighbours on the Kurdish issue. Iran and Syria both expressed concern about the 'interference' of outside powers, an apparent reference to the air exclusion zone over Kurdish areas provided by British, French and US aircraft flying out of Turkish bases. The UK has proposed a meeting to discuss an extension of the operation, which must be approved again by the Turkish parliament this year. It is certain to be discussed during Turkish Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel's visit to London next week. Turkey, like Iran and Syria, fears moves to establish a separate Kurdish state could fuel separatist tendencies among its own Kurdish minorities. Turkey is also concerned that the security provided by the allies has allowed the Kurds to further their political goals. Turkey is to link its electricity power grid to Iran's, in a further move aimed at strengthening Turkey's economic links with its neighbours. Turkish and Iranian officials meeting in Tehran decided to join their power lines within two months, according to Turkey's official Anatolian news agency. The project follows a protocol signed in Damascus in October to create a common grid among Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Egypt and Iraq. Turkey is close to agreeing financing for a 692MW hydro-power plant at Biricek on the Euphrates which will provide electricity to Aleppo in Syria - the first leg of this five-country project.</p>

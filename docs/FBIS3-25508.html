			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Malawi Customs at Kamuzu Airport, Lilongwe, have  announced the interception of a cargo that could be very  embarrassing for somebody: a container load of arms and  ammunition flown in from neighboring South Africa. It comes at  a highly sensitive time, with multiparty elections coming up on  17 May. On the line to Lilongwe, Jeremy Skeat asked our  reporter, Charles Simango, what was in the cargo.    [Begin recording] [Simango] There were about 71 kg of  bulletproof jackets, 81 kg of shotgun accessories, 345 kg of  shotgun ammunition, and about 360 kg of (?pellets) -- I am not  quite aware what that is -- totaling around 857 kg of guns,  ammunition, and bulletproof jackets.    [Skeat] Now, you say all these arms and bulletproof jackets  were found in a container. Where was the container due to go to?    [Simango] The container was addressed to the Agricultural  Development Corporation of Malawi, which is (?Admac). (?Admac)  here deals in agriculture, loaning farming inputs [as heard] to  farmers, and buying farm produce.    [Skeat] Can you think of any reason at all why this  Agricultural Development Corporation would need arms?    [Simango] That was very puzzling indeed, because Manica  Freight, which deals in air cargo, cargo in general--air or land  cargo--were contacted today and they say that the addressee,  really, they do not know who it is. So, we do not know. Maybe  the Agricultural Development Corporation has just been framed.  Or they know something--it was something that was done by the  back door.    [Skeat] What are the police and customs officials saying  about this whole (?thing)?    [Simango] The customs officials just managed to hand over  the  arms and ammunitions to the Malawi Army and Police and,  apparently, at the moment the police have taken over the case.  So far, we have not heard anything, any comments from the  police, so definitely they are investigating.    [Skeat] You say these arms were flown into Malawi. Where did  they come from?    [Simango] It is quite clear that these arms and ammunition  have originated from South Africa, because there is a document  which clearly indicates an import and export permit from the  South African Police. In fact, this document, half of it is  written in English and half of it, particularly the import and  export permit, is written in Afrikaans.    [Skeat] Has there been any political reaction to this arms  [word indistinct]?    [Simango] Not at the moment. Apparently, most of the  politicians are not aware of this discovery yet.

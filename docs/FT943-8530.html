			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / US pension funds benefit from foreign holdings US pension funds earned an average return of 11.3 per cent on their investment portfolios last year, outperforming US stock markets, according to a new survey. The Wyatt Company, a leading pension and benefits consulting firm, said the performance reflected the funds' holdings of non-US stocks and bonds. The average US pension scheme held 9 per cent of its total assets in non-domestic securities. Of this, 7 per cent were in equities and a further 2 per cent in fixed income securities. Over the past three years, US pension funds have returned an average of 14.8 per cent annually. Of the 12 countries surveyed, pension schemes in all countries increased their weightings in equities. Malaysian funds, for instance, increased their average weighting in equities from 27 per cent last year to 62 per cent a year later. Median balanced pension fund returns, adjusted for local currencies, were highest last year in Malaysia, where they totalled 91 per cent. Hong Kong provided the second highest returns, and pension funds there earned an average return of 53.3 per cent. The country whose pension funds earned the lowest returns was Japan, where the average fund earned only 5.1 per cent, the survey said.</p>

			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: A'S SIGN CANSECO FOR $1.6 MILLION  </P> <P> Jose Canseco, voted most valuable player in the American League last year,  avoided arbitration and nearly quintupled his salary Friday by agreeing to a  1-year contract with the Oakland Athletics.  </P> <P> Canseco will earn $1.6 million in 1989, an increase of $1.245 million over the  $355,000 he made last year, his third full season in the major leagues.  </P> <P> Canseco's raise is the largest ever in baseball, topping the $1.15-million  increase Andre Dawson of the Chicago Cubs received for the 1988 season.  </P> <P> Canseco had sought $1.64 million in arbitration. The Athletics were offering  $1.3 million.  </P> <P> "I think it's a reflection of our feeling that the number he submitted was a  fairly reasonable one," Oakland General Manager Sandy Alderson said.  "Obviously, it reflects a certain evaluation of the case on their part and  ours."  </P> <P> Last season, Canseco became the first man in baseball history to hit 40 home  runs and steal 40 bases in a season.  </P> <P> He also is the first player to have hit at least 30 home runs and driven in 100  runs in his first 3 full seasons. He led the major leagues in 1988 with 42 home  runs, 124 runs batted in and a slugging percentage of .569 while polling the  most votes of any member of the 1988 American League All-Star team.  </P></p>

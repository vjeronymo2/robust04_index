			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / China unveils tighter property controls to curb credit boom CHINA announced at the weekend a 10-point 'clean-up campaign' to calm its chaotic property market which is regarded as one of the main causes of an explosion in credit over the past year. Mr Wang Xianjin, director of the State Land Administration, spoke of 'chaos in the land market' and said lax controls had created openings for 'unlawful' speculation. Among the measures to check rampant speculation will be tighter land use regulations. These would require an advance payment of at least 20 per cent of the total project, excluding land price, before the land use right was legally transferred. Stringent controls will be imposed to ensure market prices for land sales. Most land transfers in China have been by private treaty, opening the way for widespread corruption. Mr Wang also vowed to crack down on the unrestrained spread of economic development zones which had mushroomed in the country. He estimated that about 3,000 zones were in the planning stage or had been established. The government had given approval for about 300 development areas which offer tax breaks to foreign investors. Mr Wang said a review was being conducted and zones that had not complied with procedures would be closed down or would be turned into industrial parks, which do not have tax incentives. The Chinese official stressed that measures to clean up the property market would not affect normal business, but he urged prospective purchasers of property to familiarise themselves with the law. Chinese attempts to cool the overheated property and land market coincide with a government drive to bring the economy under control. China's economy grew by nearly 13 per cent last year, and continued to expand rapidly in the first six months of 1993. The authorities have instituted a credit squeeze, and curbed speculative loans. This seems certain to take some of the steam out of the property boom which was already showing signs of faltering, especially in China's southern areas. The property 'clean-up campaign' also coincides with attempts to check land speculation by the military, which has become deeply involved in business, including property development. The Central Military Commission, China's top military body, recently issued a directive, warning specifically against speculative activities. It also said the army had no business becoming engaged in building luxury holiday resorts, office buildings and hotels. Worry over air crashes, Page 6</p>

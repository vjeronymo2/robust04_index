			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / World Trade News: US takes world lead in chip technology SEMATECH, the US semiconductor consortium backed by government and industry, has demonstrated world-leading chip production technology using all-American process equipment. US semiconductor production equipment makers have increased their share of the world market from a low of 43.9 per cent in 1990 to an estimated 53.4 per cent in 1992, according to VLSI Research, a US market research firm. Sematech's 10 member companies as well as other US chip makers will have access to the consortium's technology. Sematech has produced demonstration chips with feature sizes of just 0.35 microns. Such chips contain electronic devices so small that 72,500 of them in a row would measure just one inch long. The most advanced chips currently in production have feature sizes of about 0.6 microns. 'By achieving this technology with all-US tools, we have enhanced America's ability to compete in world markets - with exciting prospects for increased US market share. . . ,' said Mr Bill George, the consortium's chief operating officer.</p>

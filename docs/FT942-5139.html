			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Arts (Openings): Geneva opera A new production of Wagner's 'Lohengrin', opening on Friday, brings to a climax one of the best seasons in recent years at Geneva's Grand Theatre. The staging is by Robert Carsen, the Canadian whose stylish, sometimes controversial productions in continental Europe have established him as one of the leading opera directors of the younger generation. The conductor is Christian Thielemann, and a strong cast is headed by Thomas Moser, Eva Johansson and Marilyn Zschau.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Stuttgart (DPA) -- The plutonium seized in  Baden-Wuerttemberg in early May is weapons-grade material. As  DPA learned from a well-informed source on Friday [27 May], the  material, which was not recognized by the authorities for weeks,  is 56 grams of plutonium-239 in powder form. According to the  information, the highly poisonous material was found during the  search of an apartment in Tengen near Konstanz in the course of  investigations involving counterfeiting. [passage omitted]    So far, no information has been provided about the origin of  the material. The Environment Ministry announced on Thursday  that the material probably came from East Europe. The Land  Office of Criminal Investigations (LKA) in Stuttgart, which is  responsible for the investigations, has announced that it will  issue a statement on Friday. The Konstanz Public Prosecutor's  Office has not yet commented. [passage omitted]</p>

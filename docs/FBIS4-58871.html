			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 7 May (MENA)--AL-AHRAM newspaper regrets what  is happening in Yemen. It says it is difficult for an Arab to  see brothers shed each other's blood in the same country,  destroying everything that the one Yemeni people have both in  the north and south.    In today's editorial, the paper notes that since it began a  few months ago the Yemeni crisis has portended grave  consequences and that it entails grave dangers, especially since  the exchange of air bombardments in Aden and Sanaa and  resolutions declaring the vice president illegitimate and  dismissing the defense minister.    The paper says the Arabs have not learned much from the hard  lessons they have suffered in their modern history. What is  happening in Yemen is the best proof of this, as the Declaration  of Unity through harmony and peace is retracted and replaced by  war and conflict.    The newspaper notes Egypt's efforts to contain the Yemeni  crisis before it worsens. President Mubarak, it says, has sent  an envoy who has almost become a resident there. So far he has  addressed two appeals to the Yemeni brothers to stop subjecting  their country to destruction, but all this has been in vain.</p>

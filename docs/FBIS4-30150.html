			<p>BFN     [Text] Protests have continued in Jakarta following this  week's closure of Indonesia's three leading news magazines.  Michael Maher reports from the Indonesian capital that there  are signs that the military are not fully behind the Suharto  government's action.    [Maher] About 400 journalists and students, many dressed in  black, gathered outside the department of information to demand  the return of press freedom. Riot police tussled with  demonstrators who spilt out on to the road waving banners  critical of the government's action. It now appears sections of  the military are also opposed to the bans on the news weeklies  TEMPO, DETIK, and EDITOR. The official spokesman of the armed  forces, Syarwan Hamid, is quoted in the Jakarta newspaper SUARA  PEMBARUAN as saying that the closures are very regrettable and  should not have happened.    Indonesia's human rights commission has described the bans  as  a step backward. However, government officials have since  issued warnings to at least four other news journals about their  reporting. Demonstrators say they'll continue their protest  actions until freedom of expression is restored.    [Melbourne Radio Australia in English at 0800 GMT on 23 June  adds: "The continuing protests come just days ahead of a visit  to Indonesia by the Australian prime minister, Paul Keating.  Mr. Keating will meet President Suharto in Jakarta on Tuesday  [28 June], but it's not clear if the issue of the magazines'  closure will be raised. A senior Australian official in  Canberra said that if the media ban is discussed it will be done  privately and quietly. Graeme Dobell reports.    "[Dobell] The senior government official said Mr. Keating's  meeting with President Suharto would be unscripted and it was  not possible to say whether the prime minister would raise the  closure of the three Indonesian magazines. He said the foreign  minister Gareth Evans had put Australia's position in parliament  yesterday, when he described the ban as very disappointing.  That statement had been passed to the Indonesian ambassador and  Australia's view on freedom of the press had been registered.  Mr. Keating leaves on Monday afternoon for a 48 hour trip to  Jakarta to open an Australia-Indonesia business forum."]</p>

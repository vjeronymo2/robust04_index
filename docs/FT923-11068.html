			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Change of heart on peace talks: Britain has reluctantly accepted the need for an enlarged conference to end fighting BRITAIN'S decision to call an international conference on Yugoslavia, probably to be held in London at the end of next month, represents a remarkable change of heart. After persistently maintaining that the European Community-sponsored peace conference, chaired by Lord Carrington, remained the best forum for negotiating a settlement between the warring parties in Bosnia-Hercegovina and other parts of the former Yugoslavia, Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, has pragmatically, if reluctantly, accepted the view that it must be widened. Under Mr Hurd's proposal, made in his capacity as current president of the EC, not only the United Nations and the 52-member Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) will be represented at the enlarged conference, but other 'principal governments and parties concerned', such as the US and Russia. Mr Hurd, who disclosed his proposal over the weekend in a BBC radio interview in Manila, where he was attending a conference between the EC and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean), described the new forum as 'an evolution of the EC peace effort'. He said he would chair the conference, but that Lord Carrington would remain co-chairman. The conference would look at 'all possible options' to end fighting, initially in Bosnia-Hercegovina, where about 7,500 people have been killed since the region's Serbs rose up against a vote in March by the republic's Moslem and Croat population in favour of independence. However, Mr Hurd made it clear he did not consider the use of military force to impose a political solution to be a feasible option. Following the repeated failure of ceasefire agreements negotiated by warring parties under the umbrella of the EC peace conference, a ceasefire on the ground will not be a precondition for holding the enlarged conference. But it is clear that, in the absence of a halt to fighting in Bosnia, it will not be any easier to negotiate a political and constitutional settlement than it was in the EC forum. It was a public outburst last week by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, who complained about the lack of consultation between the EC conference and the UN, which was being asked to perform supervisory functions in Bosnia beyond its present capacities, which brought matters to a head. Mr Hurd made a stopover in New York on his way to Manila to smooth Mr Boutros Ghali's ruffled feathers. It was then that the groundwork was laid for the new conference. However, an enlarged international conference was originally proposed by President Francois Mitterrand of France, on the grounds that the Carrington conference had, in the words of his foreign minister Roland Dumas, 'reached its limits'. Not surprisingly, France has welcomed Mr Hurd's initiative. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said one of the advantages of an enlarged international forum was that it would bring in the Russians, who were best placed to exert pressure on the Serbs, while the Germans, with their close relationship with Croatia, could also have a bigger individual role to play in a wider conference. Notwithstanding the fact that the EC conference is on the point of being superseded, Lord Carrington is going ahead with a meeting in London today of the three warring parties in Bosnia. This was called on July 17 following agreement on a ceasefire, which was supposed to last at least 14 days but which collapsed almost as soon as it was signed. Acceptances to attend the meeting have been received from Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of Bosnia's Serbs, and Mr Mate Boban, the region's Croat leader. Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic has said he will send a representative. Lord Carrington has made it clear he will no longer attempt to negotiate a ceasefire, but will try to focus the talks on a constitutional settlement.</p>

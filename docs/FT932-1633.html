			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Japanese reassure on trade meeting JAPANESE officials were optimistic yesterday that recent political turmoil in Japan would not upset trade talks taking place in Tokyo from today. Mr Yoshiro Mori, minister for international trade and industry, said yesterday that while the government was divided on political reform, there was no fundamental disagreement over trade policy. Trade ministers from the US, Canada, the EC and Japan are meeting in Tokyo for two days of talks designed to spur the stalled Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The countries are aiming for agreement on market access, centring on mutual elimination and harmonisation of tariffs, by the end of the year. Mr Peter Sutherland, newly appointed director general of Gatt, said earlier this month that failure to agree on market access in Tokyo could sink prospects for concluding the Round. Mr Mori indicated that market access agreements on such issues as tariff reductions for Japanese processed farm products, for example, were not likely to come now. According to a government official close to the talks, there is only limited Japanese scope for further tariff cuts in two contentious areas  - distilled spirits and forest products. Japan has implemented a 50 per cent reduction in tariffs on distilled spirits since the Uruguay Round talks were started in 1986. 'Importers have increased market share and the Japanese industry is not in a strong situation so it is difficult to talk about a zero-for-zero option,' the official said. On forest products, the Japanese also believe they have made substantial concessions in a bilateral agreement with the US, made on the understanding it would be part of the Uruguay Round. 'We feel that we cannot go much further,' the official said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Forza Italia Popularity Up, Directa </F> Poll Says"]    [Text] (ANSA) Milan, May 13 -- Forza Italia has increased  its popularity with voters by 4.6 points since the March general  elections, according to the Directa polling institute today,  saying that 25.6 percent of those questioned judged the party of  Premier Silvio Berlusconi favorably.    The Milan polling institute said that from now on it would  sound out the voting propensities of Italians on a weekly basis  right up to the European elections in June.    The latest poll was taken at the request of Telemontecarlo  which commented on the results this evening. The full results  of the survey will be published tomorrow.    In telephone interviews, Directa questioned 1,020 people  from  96 cities and towns over a three-day period (May 9-10-11). The  sample was said to be representative in terms of age, sex and  socio- economic class.    Forza Italia was found to be the only political group to  show  any significant rise in popularity since the March 27-28  elections.    Directa said that 13.3 percent of the sample did not reply  when asked who they would vote for in the June 12 elections for  the European Parliament.    Below is a table showing the percentage of party preferences  voiced for the coming European elections and the percentage each  party gleaned in the last general elections in March:    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Voting Intention  |General Election  |European Election |Difference        |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Forza Italia      |25.6              |21.0              |+ 4.6             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Left Democratic P-|20.1              |20.4              |- 0.3             |  |arty              |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |National Alliance |12.1              |13.5              |- 0.9             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |People's Party    |9.8               |11.1              |- 1.3             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Northern League   |8.0               |8.4               |- 0.4             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Communist Renewal |6.3               |6.0               |+ 0.3             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Segni Pact        |4.2               |4.6               |- 0.4             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Socialist Party-  |3.3               |3.4               |- 0.1             |  |Democratic Allian-|                  |                  |                  |  |ce                |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Pannella List     |3.0               |3.5               |- 0.5             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Greens            |2.9               |2.7               |+ 0.2             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Rete              |1.7               |1.9               |- 0.2             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Others            |2.5               |1.5               |- 1.0             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

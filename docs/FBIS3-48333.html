			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 19 KYODO -- The Central Union of  Agricultural Cooperatives (Zenchu) on Wednesday [19 January]  approved the resignation of its President Yoshiharu Sato, union  officials said.    The officials of the governing body of farming cooperatives  nationwide said Sato's successor will be chosen at its general  meeting on March 4. But sources close to the organization said  selection of the new president may hit a snag, as the group is  split over the government's decision on a partial opening of the  nation's rice market under the Uruguay Round of global trade  talks sponsored by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    The organization will hold a meeting on February 16 to  select  candidates for the presidency, the officials said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] [Announcer L. Panova] Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of  the Federal Assembly [as heard], held a routine traditional  roundtable in Moscow today. The journalists who assembled there  learned about his views on a number of currently topical issues,  specifically, on developing cooperation between CIS countries.    [Begin Shumeyko recording] As chairman of the Council of  Heads of State, the president has proposed drawing up a  long-term plan. Two councils of ministers -- the Council of  Foreign Ministers and the Council of Defense Ministers -- have  been instructed to prepare an initial document, a draft plan for  CIS development toward integration. [end recording]    [Panova] In Vladimir Shumeyko's view, after such a plan is  adopted, the CIS charter will be somewhat amended.    [Begin Shumeyko recording] The point is that it was very  clearly mentioned at the Council of Heads of State and at the  Council of Heads of Government that members of the Commonwealth  must not be in a state of war with each other. There is,  perhaps, no other case in the whole world when members of the  same commonwealth are fighting each other. I am speaking about  Azerbaijan and Armenia. [end recording]    [Panova] Regarding Russia joining the NATO Partnership for  Peace program, Shumeyko stressed that a clear mechanism for  implementing decisions is the main condition to be observed here.</p>

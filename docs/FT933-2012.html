			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: 42% expansion puts Close Bros on Pounds 18m  -Winterflood makes significant contribution CLOSE BROTHERS, the merchant bank, recorded a 42 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 17.8m, against Pounds 12.6m, following its acquisition of Winterflood Securities, which makes markets in the shares of small and medium-sized companies. Close Brothers' share price rose 17p to 430p yesterday. The acquisition was the largest contributor to a 38 per cent rise in assets to Pounds 575m (Pounds 417m). But the bank said that other operations had grown, including a 16 per cent rise in asset finance receivables. The final dividend is 7.8p (6.5p), making a total of 11p (9.5p). Earnings per share rose by 22 per cent to 27.5p (22.5p). Mr Rod Kent, managing director, said the purchase of Winterflood, largely financed by a Pounds 17.3m vendor placing of 5.5m shares, had been successful because there had been strong demand for market-making in small companies. He said that Winterflood, which contributed Pounds 4.2m to profits, had performed 'jolly well'. However, the bank had also benefitted from the uniformly good performance of its other operations including investment management. Profitability of the commercial lending division had been rebuilt through both margin and fee income, while Treasury deposits had also risen. Development capital had been aided by recent rises in valuations. Century, the bank's debt factoring business, was said to have had a 'satisfactory' year and its consumer finance arm had done well. The bank's buildings in the City were severely damaged in the Bishopsgate bombing last April. It said this had caused 'no measurable financial loss' but had 'made life frustrating for City staff'. Mr Kent said the company remained committed to growth both organically and through acquisition. 'We are permanently acquisitive, and we always have been,' he said.</p>

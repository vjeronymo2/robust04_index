The OTS is today adopting a final rule that is consistent with the approaches agreed upon by staff of the other federal banking agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Summary of Comments and OTS Response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The OTS solicited public comment on all aspects of its proposed amendments to its risk-based capital regulation concerning multifamily mortgage loans and MBS secured by or representing an interest in such loans. The OTS received a total of 31 comment letters. Those who submitted comments included 20 savings associations, 9 thrift and housing trade groups, and 2 governmental-related entities. The discussion that follows identifies the principal issues raised in this rulemaking and summarizes the OTS's response to these issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Appropriate Risk-Weight Category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All of the commenters supported the proposal to amend the risk-based capital regulation, although several commenters suggested revisions. Generally, commenters believed it was appropriate to risk weight multifamily loans at 50 percent because of the lower risk presented by these loans as compared with other real estate and commercial loans. Commenters also indicated that this regulation would aid credit availability and cause more rental housing to become available because lenders would have greater incentives to originate multifamily mortgage loans due to the lower capital charge on such loans meeting the prudential criteria set forth in this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As required by section 305 of FDICIA, the OTS has analyzed the loss data on multifamily mortgage loans for savings associations to determine the appropriate risk weight for such loans. The average annualized ratio of net charge-offs to the amount of outstanding permanent multifamily mortgage loans was 0.59 percent for the thirteen quarters beginning March 1990 and ending March 31, 1993, as reported on the quarterly Thrift Financial Reports. In contrast, the average annualized net charge-off rate over the same period was 0.11 percent for permanent 1&hyph;4 family residential mortgage loans, 1.17 percent for permanent nonresidential property loans, 1.19 percent for permanent commercial loans, 1.41 percent for multifamily construction loans, and 2.19 percent for commercial construction loans. The average annualized net charge-off rate over this period for all assets in the 100 percent risk-weight category was 0.83 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The average net charge-off rates for these assets for the four quarters of 1992 were the following: 0.74 percent for permanent multifamily mortgage loans, 0.22 percent for permanent 1&hyph;4 family residential mortgage loans, 1.29 percent for nonresidential property loans, 1.37 percent for permanent commercial loans, 2.43 percent for multifamily construction loans, and 2.32 percent for commercial construction loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the net charge-off rate for permanent multifamily mortgage loans exceeded that for permanent 1&hyph;4 family residential loans, it was substantially below the net charge-off rates for the other types of loans specified above during the entire period reviewed. Permanent multifamily mortgage loans also had a net charge-off rate well below the average annualized aggregate net charge-off rate for 100 percent risk-weight assets for the twelve-month period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the OTS believes that it is appropriate to accord a 50 percent risk weight to multifamily mortgage loans satisfying the conservative underwriting and performance standards set forth in section 618(b) of RTCRRIA and two of the three additional prudential criteria proposed by the federal banking agencies. The additional prudential criteria retained in the final rule are: (1) The loan must be performing and not 90 days or more past due; and (2) the loan must comply with prudent underwriting standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gatt sees Uruguay Round settlement lifting cheese exports by 50 per cent Cheese exports could increase by up to 50 per cent as a result of market opening moves under the Uruguay Round trade pact, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade says in a report out today. Gatt's latest annual survey of the world dairy market says the phased reduction of tariffs and establishment of minimum access levels for dairy products will provide new export opportunities in what has been hitherto one of the most protected of all industries. Under the Uruguay Round deal, which is due to come into effect on January 1, countries must offer import access equivalent to at least 3 per cent of total consumption, rising to 6 per cent after six years. For cheese this translates into additional imports of 110,000 tonnes (up from 213,286 tonnes to 323,819 tonnes), the EU market alone accounting for an extra 86,000 tonnes. For milk powder and butter the extra access is more modest at 13 per cent (53,000 tonnes) and 21 per cent (22,000 tonnes) respectively. The trade pact also requires almost all import restrictions to be converted into tariffs and reduced by 36 per cent by the end of the decade. Even after these cuts dairy tariffs will sometimes be very high  - over 100 per cent for Canada, Norway, Finland and Poland, among others. However, Gatt points out that for exporters the tariffs, which normally cannot be raised again, are a more transparent and predictable form of trade protection than the plethora of import quotas and variable levies they are replacing. Competitive exporters will also benefit from the planned export subsidy cuts. Gatt notes that the actual decrease will be higher than the required 21 per cent over six years because exports, especially of cheese, have risen since the 1986-90 reference period. Reviewing the current market situation, Gatt says world milk production continued to decline this year, with lower output in Europe - especially in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union - outweighing record production in Australia and New Zealand. World production and consumption of butter are also on a long-term downtrend. But cheese production is rising and an even faster increase in demand for cheese is expected to sustain high prices and buoyant exports.

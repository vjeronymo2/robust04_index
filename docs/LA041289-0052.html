			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE REJECTS 8 WITNESSES TO SPEED MCMARTIN TRIAL  </P> <P> Citing concern about "the real possibility of a mistrial," the judge in the  McMartin Pre-School molestation proceeding -- certain to become the longest  criminal trial in U.S. history -- angrily eliminated eight prospective  witnesses from the defense roster Tuesday and cautioned that the jurors appear  to have lost interest and no longer even bother to take notes.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge William R. Pounders, in blunt comments  made while the jury was excused from his courtroom, said he was "desperately  concerned" that there might not be enough jurors left to deliver a verdict.  </P> <P> The trial in the highly publicized case started two years ago with the  painstaking selection of 12 jurors and six alternates. Four alternates since  have been excused -- two for medical reasons, one because of career  difficulties posed by the case's duration and a fourth who was deemed  inattentive to testimony.  </P> <P> If a minimum of 12 jurors cannot be maintained, the judge would be forced to  declare a mistrial in a case that already has cost county taxpayers $12  million.  </P> <P> "I have an obligation to see that it's a fair trial and that it gets to a jury  that's still there," Pounders told defense attorneys as he eliminated the eight  prospective witnesses. "I am desperately concerned that we are not going to  have a jury to complete this case, the most illogical case that's ever gone to  a jury."  </P> <P> The judge noted that several of the remaining jurors have asked him to call  their irate employers because the proceedings have lasted far beyond the  original estimate of one year.  </P> <P> Pounders said that at the present pace a verdict might not be reached before  1990, even if he continues to eliminate all witnesses whose testimony he deems  "frivolous and unnecessary." The defense, he said, has yet to call such  critical witnesses as the two defendants, Raymond Buckey, and his mother, Peggy  McMartin Buckey, two former defendants and at least one physician to rebut  medical evidence presented by the prosecution.  </P> <P> The defense, which so far has introduced testimony from 37 witnesses, has not  made public a full roster of the witnesses it wants to call.  </P> <P> When the defense concludes its case, a prosecution rebuttal will follow and  take an estimated two months. After that, there is expected to be a month of  defense rebuttal, followed by jury instructions and deliberations. A three-week  vacation is scheduled for mid-summer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Goes Down With the Ship'  </P> <P> Pounders said he had just talked with fellow judges at a weekend conference  about the need for them to take control of of their courtrooms, and then  observed ruefully of his own trial: "I'm the captain and the ship is sinking,  and the captain goes down with the ship."  </P> <P> At another point, his voice raised and his face reddened with apparent anger:  "I will not allow it to run into a situation where it has to be mistried. It  should have been tried in much less time."  </P> <P> The prosecution's case lasted more than 14 months as it sought with a total of  61 witnesses to prove 65 counts of molestation and conspiracy against the  Buckeys. Nine children testified that they had been raped, sodomized or forced  to have oral copulation, that they were photographed nude during "naked games"  and that they were terrorized into silence by threats from Raymond Buckey, who  allegedly made them watch as he mutilated and killed animals.  </P> <P> The prosecution also called the alleged victims' parents, who testified about  behavioral changes in their children; a physician who examined all of them and  testified she found physical evidence of molestation in most; and videotaped  interviews in which they first disclosed their nursery school experiences.  </P> <P> Cross-examination of several of the witnesses was lengthy.  </P> <P> The defense has been putting on its case for nearly six months.  </P> <P> Pounders directed his stern lecture to the defense attorneys. He warned that,  because of time, the jurors might return a verdict based solely on "gut  reaction," but that if they do not reach a quick decision and sift through the  mountains of evidence instead, "it could well take them into 1990."  </P> <P> "I don't think you have the attention of the jury anymore," Pounders told the  defense attorneys. " . . . It is boring. There are a lot of aspects that put me  to sleep."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Vigorously Denied'  </P> <P> His comments came as the defense asked Pounders' approval of eight prospective  witnesses: five parents, a woman who interviewed the alleged victims and two  court administrators. The motions were "vigorously denied" by Pounders, who  said he was angry and insulted by the continued waste of time.  </P> <P> The judge told defense attorneys Dean Gits and Danny Davis that he has grown  weary of giving them warnings.  </P> <P> "I've used the scalpel," he said, referring to limits he has placed on the  scope of certain testimony. "Now the ax."  </P> <P> He said he will refuse to admit testimony from any witness he deems "not  critical" and told the lawyers they do not have to present "every scrap of  evidence. . . . At some point you exceed what is relevant and necessary. . . .  We've covered all the bases."  </P> <P> He said much of the testimony presented by the defense has been "collateral,  cumulative and time-consuming."  </P> <P> "Don't start rattling sabers about constitutional rights," Pounders shouted at  Davis at one point in the heated proceedings. "I know the law. I've studied it  for two decades."  </P> <P> Davis, who represents Raymond Buckey, said he fears that "our presentations are  going to be inhibited by the anger of the court."  </P> <P> Replied Pounders tersely: "I hope so."  </P> <P> Outside court, Gits said he felt "like the guy that happened to be under the  piano when it fell. The prosecution got to put on their case for 14 months.  We've been responding to their case 5 1/2 months. We're on the receiving end of  the scalpel."  </P> <P> Gits said the complicated nature of the case has prolonged the defense, as the  attorneys have attempted to anticipate and provide answers for all questions  jurors might take into deliberations.  </P> <P> Prosecutor Lael Rubin said, "The stall-and-delay tactics by the defense are  finally over. There is now a real end in sight to this case."  </P> <P> At the end of next week, the McMartin trial will become the longest criminal  trial in U.S. history, surpassing that of Hillside Strangler Angelo Buono, who  was convicted after a trial that consumed two years and two days.  </P></p>

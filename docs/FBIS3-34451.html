In a statement today, the council noted the need to call on  the Islamic nations and their political and party institutions,  trade and professional unions, labor, youth, and student  federations, and economic, trade, cultural, tourism centers to  boycott the Yugoslav interests and companies in Islamic  countries, to suspend all dealings with Yugoslavia, and not to  offer services for its communications companies at ports and  airports.    The council stressed the need for an immediate response to  the world intention to use military power to enforce  international legitimacy, lift the blockade of Sarajevo  disregarding impediments that some countries face in  implementing this policy, and to adopt a political, military  plan to lift the international embargo on arming the Bosnian  people with all means to enable them to defend themselves.    The statement explained the importance of setting up an  international popular tribunal that should have access to  information and be impartial and neutral to pursue and punish  the Serb criminals in line with human (?principles),  international laws, and human rights documents.    The statement called on banks, economic institutions, and  financiers and businessmen in the Islamic world to open funds to  collect contributions to help the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina,  eliminate the effects of aggression, and urge Islamic  organizations to increase their aid to the victims of the  oppressive Serbian aggression.    The council emphasized the importance of coordinating stands  between the Islamic Conference Organization and the Arab League  and similar official and public regional and international  leagues to rally all sincere efforts in support of the  principles of right, justice, and peace.</p>

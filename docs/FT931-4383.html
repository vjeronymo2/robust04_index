			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Letter: No problem about lunching at the Garrick Sir, Regarding Observer's story, 'Lady in waiting' (February 22), I would recommend that you contact the Garrick Club to ascertain its rules and regulations on the matter. If you had done so, you would not have suggested someone having a 'quiet word' with the Venezuelan ambassador as there was no possibility of a 'diplomatic incident'. Ambassador Arcaya has organised numerous luncheons at the Garrick at which ladies were present, and is very much looking forward to meeting Ann Coffey, the new Labour MP for Stockport. Adriana Pulido, Charge d'Affaires, Embassy of Venezuela, London</p>

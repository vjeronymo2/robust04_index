			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Weaker Europe restrains Canning W CANNING, the speciality chemicals and electronic components distributor, reported a fall in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.02m to Pounds 1.83m, after an exceptional charge of Pounds 942,000 relating to the sale of an offshoot. Turnover for the six months to June 30 fell to Pounds 56.2m (Pounds 59.1m). The Birmingham-based company said that there had been a modest increase in demand in the UK but continental Europe, where a high proportion of sales are generated, continued to be weak. As a result of further cost cutting and action to increase market share, profits in the period were higher than in the second half of the previous year. The performance of the electronics division was particularly encouraging. Gearing fell over the period from 63 per cent to 38 per cent. However, this was expected to rise in the rest of the year due to seasonal factors. On prospects Mr David Probert, chairman, said he could see few signs of improvement in the group's markets. The cost cutting carried out, however, should help profits in the second half. Earnings per share came out at 2.1p (5.9p). The interim dividend is held at 2.94p.</p>

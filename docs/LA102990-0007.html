			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INSURANCE COMMISSIONER  </P> <P> Your endorsement of Republican Bannister is an endorsement for more Sacramento  gridlock. Whoever is elected must go to the Legislature for laws that will put  his policies into effect.  </P> <P> The October issue of the California Journal lists 16 of the 20 Senate and 42  Assembly seats as "safe Democratic" in the November election. If the GOP wins  all the other seats (unlikely), the state Legislature will still be controlled  by Democrats.  </P> <P> Some of your past editorials have deplored the effects of the Deukmejian-Honig  feud on California education. Why promote another?  </P> <P> The only sensible vote in 1990 is to vote a straight Democratic ticket. That  way if the Democrats don't produce before 1994, "Throw the rascals out" will be  a real option for California voters. If every incumbent was turned out this  election, the gridlock mix would still be in place, only the party affiliations  would be changed.  </P> <P> ERNEST HANNA, Long Beach  </P></p>

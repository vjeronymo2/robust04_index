			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Bronislav Lisin, professor and board chairman of </F> the New East Society for Supporting Economic Cooperation,  Munich: "Social Portrait of Russian Entrepreneurship"]    [Text] It was only a few years ago that a layer of  entrepreneurs began to be reborn in Russia -- first, through  cooperatives; later, the road was opened to partnerships with  limited responsibilities, joint-stock companies and, finally,  private enterprises. Many political forces link their plans for  economic and political reforms in Russia with these people.  During the recently held elections, there were no voting blocks  which did not declare their support for entrepreneurship. An  even larger number of parties, associations, funds, etc.,  claimed that they, and only they, have the right to speak in the  name of the entrepreneurs and to represent their interests. Who  is he, the Russian entrepreneur?    Primarily, it is not the political sympathies of the  entrepreneurs but their parameters as business partners that  interest us.    Let us avail ourselves of the materials from a survey of  participants in the Second International Congress of Small and  Average Entrepreneurship in Russia, which was held in Moscow  during the summer of 1993. A total of 1,300 entrepreneurs from  all regions of Russia participated in its work at the time.  One-tenth responded to the questionnaire of the New East  Society, which conducted this survey jointly with the Russian  Management Personnel Consulting and Research Center.    There were no big businessmen at the congress. Those, who  had  practically not yet begun active entrepreneurial activity but  who were just taking the first steps in it, were also not  present. In a word, we will talk about the normal Russian  entrepreneurs.    Where did they come from? The opinion is prevalent that  former CPSU workers and criminal elements basically became  entrepreneurs. Possibly, such exist. However, our information  says that 46.6 percent of the entrepreneurs came from  production, 18.8 percent worked in VUZ [higher educational  institutions] and scientific establishments, another 6.75  percent were students, and 3 percent were servicemen. Only 13.5  percent came from the state apparatus and less than 3.3 percent  from the party and Komsomol. With all the shake-ups that have  occurred in the management staff during recent years, one should  only welcome the fact that a part of the bureaucrats decided to  earn money on their own and not settle into the next "office."    The opinion that, except for cunning and cleverness, an  entrepreneur does not need either special brains or education,  was also not confirmed. It is difficult to talk about intellect;  we did not conduct an intellectual testing. There is total order  with respect to the entrepreneurs' education. A total of 90  percent have a higher education and 13.5 percent an academic  degree besides. The majority (63.9 percent) are engineers; 30.8  percent -- economists; 12 percent -- humanities graduates; 3.75  percent -- jurists, etc. Several have two and even three higher  educational diplomas. Almost half have a good command of the  English language; 18.8 percent -- the German; substantially  fewer know other languages.    There were not so few women among the respondents -- 20.3  percent. A total of 83.5 percent were married. Despite the  widespread opinion that entrepreneurial activity has a bad  influence on family life, there were not many among those  surveyed who were divorced -- 6 percent.    Here is the composition of the surveyed entrepreneurs by age  (see Table No 1).    Table 1   Age         Up to   26-30     31-35     36-40     41-50     51-60     Older              25                                                        than 60    Percent     1.5     9.0       12.8      19.5      37.6      13.5      1.5      Thus, it is basically people, who are already mature and who  have a good life experience, that engage in entrepreneurship.  The motivation for their activity also confirms this.    To the question: "What motivates you to engage in  entrepreneurial activity?" the following answers were received:    - the desire for independence and self-realization -- 52.0  percent.    - the desire to provide material independence for myself --  45.1 percent.    - the wish to carry out my own plans and to incorporate my  own ideas and works -- 45.1 percent.    - the wish to make my own contribution to the forming of a  market economy --32.3 percent.    - the absence of other types of activity -- 0.75 percent.    It is quite clear that not hopelessness but a completely  deliberate choice led the respondents to entrepreneurship. When  answering another question about whether they would again make  this selection now, 91 percent confidently said: "Yes" and only  0.75 percent said: "No."    This is particularly important because 57.2 percent of the  surveyed entrepreneurs can be called veterans. They began to  engage in this activity during the period from 1985 to 1990,  inclusive. A total of 32.3 percent became entrepreneurs during  1991-1992 and only 2.25 percent can be called beginners. (In a  number of cases, the total is somewhat less than 100 percent  because some did not answer this question; in other cases, it is  more than 100 percent because a respondent could mark several  versions of answers).    The information about the type of the activity and the  nature  of the enterprises is of undoubted interest. Based on form of  ownership, 50.4 percent are joint-stock companies: 33 percent --  private individual ones; and 6.0 percent -- cooperatives. A  total of 5.3 percent have foreign capital. Among the surveyed  entrepreneurs, 42.1 percent are joint owners of their  enterprises, 30.0 percent are stockholders, 20.3 percent work on  contract, and 9.0 percent are individual owners.    Based on number of workers, the enterprises are distributed  in the following manner (see Table No 2).    Table 2   Number     6-10    11-20    21-50    51-100    101-250    251-500    More                                                                       than                                                                       500   Percent    8.3     14.3     15.8     16.5      20.3       5.3        4.5      From the cited table, it is clearly seen that we are dealing  in a very strict sense with small and average entrepreneurs.    Almost half of these enterprises are located in oblast and  kray centers and other large cities; 30.0 percent are in small  cities. A total of 22.5 percent of the respondents were from  Moscow or Saint Petersburg. As was already mentioned above,  practically all regions of Russia were represented in the  sampling.    Before describing the type of activity, one should point out  that the majority of firms in Russia have been forced to engage  in different types of work. Under conditions where a market is  only being formed and where the norms regulating the activity of  entrepreneurs frequently change, it is impossible, as they say,  to put all your eggs in one basket. In addition, assets have a  very rapid turnover in trade. Nevertheless, the strategic trend  in the development of Russian entrepreneurship -- the production  of goods and services -- is being clearly tracked; this is  evident from the table:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 3                                                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Types of activity                     |Percent                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Industrial production, construction a-|48.7                                  |  |nd repairs                            |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Retail and procurement activity       |37.6                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Commercial middleman operations       |29.3                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Diversified activity                  |24.8                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Innovation activity                   |13.5                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Consulting activity                   |12.0                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Transport services                    |9.0                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Agricultural production               |9.0                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Operations with money and securities  |7.5                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Organizing spare time                 |6.0                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Housing and municipal and consumer se-|4.5                                   |  |rvices                                |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Artistic trade                        |3.8                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Other types                           |9.7                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Among the most important factors having a positive or  negative impact on the activity of small and average  enterprises, almost three-quarters of the surveyed entrepreneurs  mentioned state laws; half -- relations with banks; 30.8 percent  each -- monetary assets and the qualifications of personnel; and  26.3 percent -- relations with local authorities. Other factors  disturb them considerably less, for example, production  practices -- 7.5 percent; and production costs -- 6.3 percent.  Only 6.7 percent of the respondents mentioned the racket, about  which so much is said and written.    However, even the mentioned problems do not reduce the level  of optimism in our respondents. To the directly posed question  about the degree of their confidence in the success of their  business, they answered: Have complete confidence -- 37.6  percent; basically convinced -- 44.4 percent. Only 0.75 percent  have a complete lack of confidence.    The block of questions concerning the foreign economic  activity of the entrepreneurs was extremely full. A total of  62.3 percent of them have foreign partners. However, only about  half have specific projects with them. Just as many respondents  regularly go abroad. A total of 23.3 percent of those surveyed  have never traveled abroad.    An absolute majority of the entrepreneurs (87.2 percent)  emphasized that they need the assistance of consulting firms to  establish contacts with the necessary organizations and  businessmen abroad and an organizational accompaniment for  implementing agreements and contracts.    A total of 38.3 percent of the entrepreneurs indicated their  lack of sufficient information about the interests of foreign  partners and conditions for activity abroad as the main  difficulty in their foreign economic activity.    In the opinion of the entrepreneurs, the most preferred  types  of cooperation are:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 4                                                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Types of cooperation                  |percent                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Investments in Russia                 |54.9                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Joint enterprise                      |45.1                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Selling products abroad               |31.6                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Purchasing products abroad            |29.6                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Using Western technology and know-how |24.8                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Using Russian technology and know-how |18.3                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Russian investments abroad            |3.0                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      The proposal about possible investments from Russia occupies  the last line. Meanwhile, this is a completely realistic  possibility. Actually, free capacities frequently exist in  Western countries for producing a number of the products  required by Russia. The problem is not a simple one; however, it  deserves very careful study.    The problem of Western investments in the Russian economy  still has great urgency. We are talking about private  investments. The following conditions are required for this:    1) The possibility to select an investment project from  correctly formulated proposals of equal value;    2) Support and written guarantees from regional (oblast,  kray, republic) management bodies;    3) Professional consulting accompaniment for organizational,  legal and all other types of questions on the part of a Russian  or Russian-German firm.    If one is talking about the projects of small and average  business, this is quite sufficient to begin work. The political  risk has practically no serious relationship to this subject.    The political line of entrepreneurship itself is the policy  of concrete affairs in the area of a market economy. It is no  accident that 70.7 percent of those surveyed did not participate  in the activity of parties and social movements. They are  engaged in business and building the foundation of a new economy.    Of course, we are not pioneers in the area of a market  economy; many countries have achieved great success on this  path. In the opinion of the Russian entrepreneurs, which one is  of most interest to us?    Germany -- 39.1 percent, USA -- 28.6 percent, South Korea --  21.0 percent, China -- 17.3 percent, Japan -- 15.8 percent,  Sweden -- 13.5 percent    A considerably smaller number of respondents indicated the  experience of other countries.    This information makes one wonder. Look at the bookshelves  of  Russian stores. Are there many books on the experience of the  FRG? At a minimum, nine out of ten books are devoted to the  experience of the United States or other English-speaking  countries. The lack of the required amount of necessary  knowledge and experience transfers is becoming a serious problem  that must be solved by joint efforts.</p>

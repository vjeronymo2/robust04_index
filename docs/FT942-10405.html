			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Labour faces Histadrut defeat Israel's governing Labour party faced defeat last night in nationwide elections for Israel's biggest labour federation, at the hands of Mr Haim Ramon, a former Labour minister set on breaking the mould of Israeli politics. Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin congratulated Mr Ramon on his win, put by an Israeli TV exit poll as 47 per cent of the vote compared to 33 for the Labour candidate, Mr Haim Haberfeld, and 16 for the opposition Likud candidate. Final results were expected today but Mr Rabin acknowledged his party had 'suffered a blow' and raised the possibility of forming a coalition with Mr Ramon to rule the trade union. 'I really hope that the Labour party and Ramon's people will remember one thing, that the main enemy is the Likud, both in the national and the Histadrut arena,' Mr Rabin said. 'I hope very much that. . . we will find a way to co-operate.' Mr Ramon answered that 'the first possibility is to form a coalition with the Labour party'. If the exit poll is confirmed, it will be a stunning victory for Mr Ramon. Analysts believe Mr Ramon, 44, who resigned as health minister in February, intends to use his victory as a springboard to challenge Mr Rabin inside the Labour party, or form his own party, named the Social Democratic party. Mr Ramon, who is standing on an independent list, represents the young generation of the Labour party who are desperate for reform and a change from the old-guard leadership symbolised by Mr Rabin, 72, Mr Haberfeld, 62, and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, 70. They also want to break the Histadrut's stranglehold on Labour party policy, and speed Israel's transition from socialism to the social market. Mr Ramon, in coalition with the left-wing Meretz bloc and the ultra-orthodox Shas party, focused his campaign on social issues and vowed to curb Histadrut's bureaucracy. If the exit poll is correct, Mr Ramon will be short of an absolute majority and will be forced to form a coalition.</p>

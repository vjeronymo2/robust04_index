			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Lloyds / Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester: City shows its approval for the merger - Share price for Abbey National slips as investors wonder if it will be a casualty of new organisation The wide divergence of the share prices of Lloyds Bank and Abbey National yesterday indicated the size of the stone thrown into the stagnant pool of the UK retail financial services market by Lloyds' Pounds 1.8bn bid to be the first bank to take over a building society. The rise in Lloyds shares was a vote of faith not only that it was paying a good price for the country's sixth biggest society but that the two organisations together would be a menacing new force in the mortgage market. Abbey National, the former building society, would be an obvious casualty. The logic of a large bank joining forces with a building society is obvious. The gradual consolidation of the society movement from 110 societies in 1991 to 84 today is part of a process by which the UK mortgage market is increasingly dominated by a shrinking number of powerful players. The slump in the UK housing market has reduced the total market heavily. Total net new mortgage lending was Pounds 16.9bn in 1993, compared to Pounds 18.3bn in 1992, and Pounds 33.2bn in 1990. At the same time, banks have strongly stepped up their competition with societies to sell new mortgages. Banks' market share of new advances rose to 39 per cent this year, compared with 21 per cent in 1992, as they used cheaper wholesale funds to undercut societies. Societies have to rely more heavily on retail deposits, which they have to use to fund 60 per cent of mortgages under law. British banks are facing very weak loan demand from small and medium-sized companies, which makes them eager to sell more mortgages. But despite their flexibility, they have not sold as many mortgages as they would like. Only 4 per cent of Lloyds customers have mortgages with the bank. Mr Brian Pitman, Lloyds' chief executive, attributes this to greater specialist knowledge of how to manufacture and distribute new products by societies. Banks have also failed thus far to break decisively the British perception that a society is the natural place to buy a mortgage. A second advantage for a bank is that it diversifies the earnings stream from cyclical corporate lending. Despite the savage slump in house prices in the late 1980s, the total bad debts of the top 20 societies last year were less than Barclays' Pounds 1.9bn provisions against bad lending. Mr Pitman has constantly emphasised that Lloyds must push down its cost of capital in order to boost return on equity. Somewhat improbably, he attributed a large part of the rise in Lloyds' share price yesterday to a reduction in the cost of capital arising from a diversified earnings stream. From the point of view of societies, acquisition by a bank has clear attractions. First, it breaks the wholesale funding limit which societies are pressing the Treasury to raise. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester only funded 25 per cent of mortgages from wholesale funds, but others are more pressed. More importantly, acquisition by a bank gives a society at least theoretical access to a much wider distribution channel. Lloyds has 1,930 branches compared to the 230 C&amp;G branches, and also offers it the potential of selling mortgages through Lloyds Abbey Life and financial services agencies. This was the heart of the reasoning which led Mr Andrew Longhurst, C&amp;G's chief executive, to approach Lloyds through C&amp;G's investment banking adviser, JP Morgan, last autumn. He believed there was an urgent need to find ways of selling more products - and raising income  - from the same cost base. Wide distribution of mortgages through few branches has been the reason why C&amp;G has achieved an extremely low ratio of costs to income of 26 per cent, compared with a 48 per cent average ratio for the top 10 societies. Mr Longhurst thought it could only improve this ratio with more income. C&amp;G is already strongly dependent on other sources of income than its branches. Only 20 per cent of business comes from branches, with 22 per cent of mortgage loans being made to existing borrowers, and 58 per cent coming through referrals from independent financial advisers. 'The key to Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester is that we stuff more product through fewer branches, but thereby hangs the problem,' said Mr Longhurst yesterday. 'We have not got very good distribution in a static market, and if we can get extra distribution somehow, we can push down costs more.' For all these reasons, the two men are confident that they had struck a large blow to others. They will together supply 7 per cent of domestic mortgages, and become the fourth largest mortgage provider. Mr Pitman said that both Halifax Building Society and Abbey National would be his prime competition. 'This will definitely change the competitive equilibrium of the market,' said Mr Pitman. 'Some of the small societies may combine with others. There might well be other societies approaching banks to take them over. Whether they can get as good a deal out of them is another matter.' Yet the apparent logic of the deal - combined with support from the deal from ratings agencies and analysts - raises the question of why it has not happened before. In fact, the big regulatory, cultural and structural differences between societies and banks have prevented such moves. The regulatory hurdle is the Building Societies Commission, whose guidance against third parties such as banks making payments to members will be tested in the High Court in May. Although the commission is officially neutral, it is thought to be cautious about its charges being taken over. This was thought to be one factor behind the failure of the only previous attempt of a bank to take over a society. The bank was a vehicle called Bank of Edinburgh which abandoned its attempt to acquire the Heart of England society for reasons thought to include regulatory difficulties. The structural problem is that because societies are mutual organisations, it would be virtually impossible for a bank to take one over without the agreement of the board. The stiff requirements for members' approval in most societies' rules mean that boards could easily scupper hostile bids. These voting requirements also mean that even with the approval of top managers, a society may be difficult to acquire. Although many of C&amp;G's 1.4m members will be happy to accept the Pounds 500 minimum offer, the bid could easily come unstuck if a hostile lobby group emerges among them. Lloyds has tried to prevent the possibility of fuel being added to such a fire by agreeing with C&amp;G that its board will not recommend any other offer within a set period. But if another bank made a larger offer, it could be hard for C&amp;G's board to resist putting it to members indefinitely. Both men were sounded confident on this point yesterday. Mr Longhurst said it would be hard for another bank to make an offer mixing cash with shares because of the difficulty of dividing payments to members. 'I do not think it would be easy for anyone else to participate,' said Mr Pitman. Yet even if such hurdles are surmounted by next year, the theoretical attractions of the relationship could yet prove difficult to achieve in reality. C&amp;G was careful to set its terms for an acquisition, insisting on maintaining its managerial independence and a separate board. In order to maintain this divide without tension between the two organisations, C&amp;G will have to fulfil what for the moment remain theoretical attractions. If Lloyds cannot in practice sell many more mortgages through its branches with the society's help, the vision will not succeed. Mr Pitman insisted that Lloyds in any case did not want to tinker with C&amp;G's winning formula. 'We knew we were buying a brand, and we knew that if we damaged the brand we would destroy what we had bought.' He said Lloyds had also supported the idea of maintaining a separate board. Yet both men admit that the theoretically attractive and amiable alliance would come under severe strain if C&amp;G failed to perform as expected under Lloyds' umbrella. 'In a disaster scenario, if you own something 100 per cent, then you have to do something about it,' said Mr Pitman. 'To a certain extent, we have to take it on trust,' said Mr Longhurst. 'But the price they are paying suggests that they value what we are doing and they are not going to mess around with it too soon.' That was the mood in both organisations yesterday; it remains to be seen how long it lasts.</p>

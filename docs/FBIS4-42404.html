			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ennio Caretto: "Second Landing"] </F>   [Text] On the Capitoline Hill, from which he will address  the Italian people, in the Vatican, and at the Palazzo Chigi  [government seat], this evening [President Bill] Clinton will  issue to Europe what he describes as "the challenge of  democracy." It is a political and economic challenge -- that of  the integration of the former Soviet bloc into the Partnership  for Peace (if not into NATO) and into a great trading community.  But it is also a challenge between different generations --  that of continuity between the Liberation 50 years ago and the  present struggle for democratic principles. Clinton will ask  the young Europeans to avoid the mistakes of the thirties and to  espouse the ideals of Europe's liberators.    His visit to the heart of World War II, which will also take  him to Britain and France, culminating in Normandy, the scene of  D-Day, will be an implicit appeal to the values of the  Resistance. His security adviser, [Tony] Lake, said that the  President will ask Europe to "display the same unity of intent"  in strengthening democracy that it displayed on the battlefields  against Hitler. At a time when neofascist thrusts are emerging,  he gave to understand, Clinton's message will leave no doubts  about America's position.    The choice of Italy as the first leg of his tour was no  coincidence. His visits to France and Britain, the major allies  in the conflict, were obligatory. But Italy was an enemy. "We  have come here," Clinton will say, "to bring to your attention  the fact that 1944 was the victory of a principle that unites us  not only with Italy but also with Germany and Japan." And he  will praise our country for what it did to free itself from  fascism, and will not enter into the recent controversy over the  AN [National Alliance] and Mussolini.    Clinton brings with him two specters -- that of Reagan, who  10 years ago in Normandy put himself forward as the symbol of  freedom from the Soviet Union, and his personal specter as a  "malingerer" who dodged the draft for the war in Vietnam. It  will not be easy to get rid of them. This is why he has  prepared himself very carefully, with a daily diet of footage of  the Anzio and Normandy landings and discussions with the most  famous historians.    Clinton is the first American leader born since World War  II:  At the personal level his only link with it is his father's  participation in the Italian campaign in a support unit based at  Caserta (he never knew his father, who died three months before  Bill was born). The President will defend the legacy of the  builders of Europe. And he will consign it to the young people.  His day tomorrow at the Nettunio and Anzio cemeteries will  impart the tone to his entire European visit. Clinton will  surround himself with World War II veterans. In practice he  will show that America has forgotten nothing; that it is not  isolationist; that it is Europe's big sister. There will be  thousands of Americans there. The older ones will remember the  bravery of paratroop General Maxwell Taylor, who in September  1943 entered Rome secretly, woke up [Prime Minister Marshal]  Badoglio, asked him whether the Eternal City could be conquered,  and, having received a negative reply, halted the bombers that  were already on their way. They will recall another event in  1944 -- the lightning advance of Commander of the Fifth Army  Mark Clark, who ordered his men to enter Rome by 1600 hours  (they did so) in time to be photographed for the following day's  newspapers. And they will return to America convinced that they  have contributed to a historic turning point. Of course, there  will be controversies. Over Germany's and Russia's exclusion  from the commemorations, over Fini's assertion that his party is  basically an Italian equivalent of the Gaullist party in France  and of the Republican Party in the United States. But they will  not spoil this great celebration for Italy and Europe.</p>

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / International Company News: Deere returns to black but forecasts loss in next quarter DEERE, the US farm equipment group, yesterday returned to profit in the fourth quarter and the year to end-October 1992, but forecast a loss for the first quarter of the coming financial year. The company cited weakness in the worldwide sales. Fourth-quarter earnings were Dollars 4.2m, or 5 cents per share, compared with last year's loss of Dollars 81.5m, or Dollars 1.07 per share. Worldwide sales were virtually static at Dollars 1.9bn. For the year, Deere reported a profit of Dollars 37.4m, or 49 cents per share, on sales of Dollars 6.96bn, compared with a loss of Dollars 20.2m, or 27 cents, on sales of Dollars 7.05bn in 1991. Fourth-quarter results were boosted by a Dollars 20.7m reduction in inventories. In the same 1991 quarter, the inventory benefit to results was Dollars 65.0m. Deere's credit, insurance, and health care subsidiaries posted strong sales and profit gains in the quarter. However, its core business of agricultural, industrial and lawn and grounds care equipment suffered. The company's worldwide equipment operations posted a net loss of Dollars 33.7m in the quarter, compared with a deficit of Dollars 103.2m a year ago, which included a Dollars 120m restructuring charge. With North American grain production expected to level off in 1993, and farm income projected to be flat, Mr Hans Becherer, chairman, said he expected North American retail sales of farm equip-ment to remain flat. European agricultural equipment was expected to continue to decline, he said, because revisions to government agricultural policies would probably lead to reduced farm incomes and crop production in 1993. 'First-quarter 1993 production tonnage is expected to be approximately the same as in last year's depressed initial quarter,' Mr Becherer said. He added that several factories would be closed for one or two week periods, in addition to normal holiday shutdowns. As a result, he said, Deere expected to incur a loss in the usually weak first quarter. Last year the company recorded a first-quarter loss of Dollars 19.9m.</p>

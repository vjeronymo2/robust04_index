			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Survey of Housing Associations (6): Like ducks to water - Trusts are eager entrants to the capital markets Among all the changes in the way housing associations have operated in the past two years, one of the most dramatic was their brisk entry to the City. Associations that hardly considered tapping public markets five years ago, have suddenly become among the most active issuers of sterling bonds. The traditional source of finance to supplement public grants was loan capital from banks and building societies. But associations have now moved briskly into sterling debentures, raising Pounds 800m from issues in 1992 and 1993. About half was issued in the last two months of 1993 alone. Until the end of last year, the UK insurance companies and pension funds which buy long-dated fixed rate paper displayed a healthy appetite for what associations were offering. But as tends to happen with a change of diet, institutions showed signs of indigestion three months ago. Associations and the lead managers of issues from securities houses such as NatWest Markets and Hambros now face the question of how to respond. Some believe that associations will simply have to take things more slowly; others argue that they will have to devise ways of widening the investor base. Four factors have stimulated the growth of association interest in the capital markets: the funding requirement has grown. Housing association grants have been cut from 80 per cent of the cost of projects in 1988 to 62 per cent in the 1994-95 financial year. This means associations may have to raise Pounds 650m a year in private finance in the medium-term. Building societies have been keen to increase loan funding to associations to augment slack demand for their traditional mortgage products. But although funding from banks and societies has increased, capital markets issues have grown quickly to take equal share of association funding. there is a good match between the maturity of bond issues and associations' assets. Banks in particular are often unwilling to lend for more than seven years, whereas associations want a source of finance that matches the longer term cash flows from private rented housing. UK interest rates and bond yields are at a historically low level, which offers the chance for associations to lock in a low cost of funding. Re-financing after seven years through banks means taking the risk that interest rates will rise significantly by then. there has been demand for associations' paper. Ms Caroline Shah, an associate director of Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, says that investors have been 'hungry for paper'. There was a lull in debenture issues by property companies which increased interest in associations. These factors created not just a rise in the number of bond issues, but a growth in the number of issuing vehicles. The original vehicle was The Housing Finance Corporation (THFC), which enabled associations to band together, and has made six issues totalling Pounds 770m since 1990. However, this structure did not satisfy all investors. It was open-ended, allowing a variety of associations to join; it lacked credit enhancement to insure against the failure of one association. Some investors also thought that its board lacked people known in the City and independent of associations. This led three lead managers to devise their own vehicles. Kleinwort Benson started with HACO, which issued Pounds 115m in two tranches starting in July 1992. It was followed by Hambros' FFH vehicle last March which gave credit enhancement through a 5 per cent levy on the participating associations. These new vehicles gradually widened the net to cover most of the 35-odd institutions who might be expected to buy bond issues from associations. All was well until NatWest Markets was left with much of a Pounds 125m issue through its HALOS vehicle which it offered in November. The shock of that led to Hambros delaying a planned issue for medium-sized associations called Housing Securities, and a general reassessment of the market. Market participants have come up with varying explanations for the problem and with varying remedies. One problem that many agree on is that institutions may be perplexed by the variety of issuing vehicles in a relatively new sector. 'There is a certain amount of confusion around because investors do not seem to be as clear as they were about which vehicle to pick,' says Ms Shah. Mr David Wallis, director of NatWest Capital Markets, says that investors are still coming to terms with the sector as a whole because it is so new. 'We still have a task explaining to investors exactly what associations are. I had a hard time understanding them myself two years ago,' he says. One issue not easily assessed by investors is the political risk affecting associations. The government has no commitment to bailing out an association in trouble, and income support provides about half the rental payments from which associations must meet bond interest payments. Some participants believe this unfamiliarity, combined with the rapid growth of issues, is the essential problem which came to a head before Christmas. Mr Charles Arbuthnot, a director of Hambros, says the sector grew too rapidly. 'You do not build a market by going suddenly from Pounds 200m of issues to Pounds 600m the following year. That is very, very fast,' he says. Mr Arbuthnot argues that the task facing associations is to be 'boring and controlled' and ensure a steady flow of issues rather than allowing sudden bursts. Others argue that associations must find ways of broadening the investor base. No issue has so far been rated formally by credit ratings agencies. One securities house is thought to be working on a structured issue which would have credit enhancement and be formally rated. An advantage of such a rating would be that associations could draw on a wider investor base. Mr Wallis of NatWest Markets says that associations will have to employ 'a more sophisticated approach' to stimulate investor interest, possibly varying maturities or enhancing credit. Some large associations could also follow the approach of Peabody Trust in making their own issues. After associations started by banding together no matter what their size and competence, this year may see a more cautious approach to capital markets, and a more diverse approach.</p>

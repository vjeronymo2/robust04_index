			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Oleksandr Kramarenko, an independent journalist </F> from Luhansk, supported by: Valeriy Teplyakov, an independent  journalist from Luhansk; Rayisa Lukyanchuk, chairman of the  Luhansk Oblast Taras Shevchenko Prosvita Society, member of the  Writers Union of Ukraine; Ivan Nyzovyy, chairman of the oblast  organization of the Writers Union of Ukraine; Oleksandr Tykhyy,  chairman of the Luhansk Oblast Organization of the Ukrainian  Conservative Republican Party [UKRP]; Valentyn Tkalych, chairman  of the Luhansk Oblast Organization of [line or lines illegible]:  "The Donbass Is Following in Crimea's Footsteps (What the  Elections to the Supreme Council in Luhansk Oblast Have Shown)"]    [Text] The elections of people's deputies in Luhansk Oblast  were valid in all 25 electoral districts. Deputies were elected  in 24 of these districts. Sixteen districts were won by KPU  [Communist Party of Ukraine] candidates, and one was won by a  candidate of the Socialist Party. These deputies make up nearly  71 percent of the new delegation to the Supreme Council from  Luhansk Oblast. This is probably the most decisive leftist  victory in all of Ukraine.    A particularly striking fact is that not a single (!)  representative of the national-democratic forces opposed the  Communists in Luhansk Oblast in the second round of elections.  The national democrats did not place higher than fifth in any  district in the first round....    What is going on in this eastern oblast of Ukraine, if in  the  second round of elections its residents voted only for  Communists, the party of power, Russian chauvinist imperialists,  and only infrequently for sharp businessmen from the  Kuchma-Hrynyov bloc?    First and foremost, there are subjective factors at play  here. Despite the fact that 57 percent of the oblast's residents  are Ukrainians, in a regional referendum nearly 91 percent voted  in favor of granting the Russian language official status. If we  ignore this, in the next Donbass referendum, the same percentage  will vote for autonomy or secession from Ukraine.    This author had the opportunity to take part in the election  campaign in the oblast's Ukrainian-speaking Lutuhyne Rayon. Even  there, the absolute majority of the population has a negative  attitude to Rukh (which personifies the national-democratic bloc  here). Under the circumstances, what can one expect in the  several rayons of Luhansk Oblast that are populated by  indigenous Don Cossacks?    Of course, Luhansk Oblast is the Donbass--the "all-Union  smithy" and the "dormitory of Soviet peoples." But there are  several such dormitories in Russia. What about the Tyumen  region, yet we see no evidence of anti-Russian sentiments there.    As it turns out, the main reason for the pro-Russian  sentiments in Luhansk Oblast lies in the influence of the local  mass media, which are promoting anti-Ukrainian attitudes with no  opposition from official Kiev to speak of.    There are currently six newspapers in Luhansk that can be  regarded as more or less influential on the oblast level. Three  of them--LUGANSKAYA PRAVDA, GOLOS DONBASSA, and SUBBOTNIY  KALEYDOSKOP (all published in Russian)--are vying with one  another to prove which is most leftist and which loves the lost  empire of the USSR most. Every issue of each of these newspapers  carries letters from workers, who blame the Ukrainian  nationalists in power for all our troubles.    The organ of the oblast state administration, NASHA HAZETA  (the only bilingual newspaper among all of the oblast's  periodicals), and of the local council, ZHIZN LUGANSKA, can be  regarded as centrist, making their pages available to all public  movements and parties. Recently, however, because of the  economic crisis, they have been showing a distinct preference  for advocates of the imperial idea, camouflaged either under a  restored Union or a union of Slavic states.    Another newspaper, the organ of the Liberal Party of  Ukraine,  VZGLYAD, deliberately avoids political issues, concentrating  exclusively on purely economic and business matters, and on  advertising.    Interestingly, during the last election campaign, all these  newspapers gave their main support to the representatives of the  party of power, with businessmen, chauvinists, and Communists  taking second place.    As far as the rayon newspapers of Luhansk Oblast are  concerned, Lutuhyne's TRUDOVAYA SLAVA attests that the winds of  change have not yet reached all the editorial boards. The only  difference is that now, instead of being dependent on the  Communist leadership, they are wholly dependent on the party of  power. Consequently, it is impossible to speak of candidates  having had equal access to the press in the election campaign.  Thus, in contrast to the programs of other candidates, the  programs of all three democratically oriented candidates were  all published in the same issue. If one were to compare the  space reserved for their materials in TRUDOVAYA SLAVA with the  space allotted to the candidates from the party of power, one  would find the ratio was 1:5.    As before, Luhansk Oblast radio sings the praises of the  working people (mostly the leadership), and therefore,  obviously, the nomenklatura was much more widely represented on  the air during the election campaign than provided for by the  election law.    Oblast television is especially apolitical. When it granted  additional time to the voters [as published], it was for large  sums of money. Yet the election campaign of the agro-industrial  nomenklatura was presented against the background of  preparations for spring field work (in all likelihood with no  cost to the candidates in question).    On the other hand, the Efir-1 commercial television company  of Luhansk maintains a pro-empire and antistate political  position, taking full advantage of the silence on this issue on  the part of both the Luhansk and Kiev authorities. If this is  democracy, than it is of a unique Ukrainian variety, because it  is impossible to imagine an antistate channel in England, the  United States, Germany, France, and so on.    In summarizing what has been said above, it is not difficult  to see that the Luhansk press is generally leftist and  pro-empire in its orientation and engages in the ideological  indoctrination of the population in the interests of the  regional headquarters of the party of power and its  chauvinistically oriented puppets.    The consequences of this state of affairs speak for  themselves. The overwhelming majority of Luhansk residents  regards the national-democratic forces as fascists, because the  local media do not "bother" to explain the difference between  Nazism and patriotism and are waging a battle against the latter  as if it were Nazism.    It is difficult to overestimate the success of imperialistic  propaganda. In one of the electoral districts of Luhansk, a  candidate advanced to the second round of voting who claims that  the Ukrainian government is made up of Rukh-Banderites and  states insolently in his autobiography that in addition to  Russian, he is fluent in English, Polish, and Italian with the  help of a dictionary....    The question arises: What should we do? Anything but what  the  leaders of national-democratic forces do when they occasionally  pay courtesy visits to the Donbass. Evidence of this  "productive" activity is seen in the fact that the overwhelming  majority of the population of Luhansk Oblast honestly believes  to this day that V. Chornovil and L. Lukyanenko are criminal  offenders, despite the tolerant conduct of these politicians  during their visits.    In my opinion, if the Donbass is to remain Ukrainian, there  is an immediate need to establish a network of Ukrainian mass  media in the region, whose goal would be to combat the  anti-Ukrainian propaganda of the local media and to foster a  civic consciousness among the residents of this coal mining  region to replace the "Soviet-Communist" [sovkova] mentality  that reigns here now.    It is especially important to create the necessary  conditions  in Luhansk Oblast for the publication of a bilingual weekly with  a circulation of no less than 50,000. This matter should be  decided in Kiev, and not in Luhansk, where the necessary funds  are not available.    It does not really matter who in Kiev assumes the  responsibility of financing such a newspaper. But if the  government refuses to do so, this will serve as perfect proof of  its concern for the territorial integrity of Ukraine in real  terms. If the national-democratic forces refuse, this will be  proof of their conscious capitulation to communist-chauvinism in  the Donbass.    Bilingualism in the Donbass is a necessity today, because  for  the past three decades, Ukrainian schools in the region have  constituted a tiny percentage as against Russian-language  institutions. This is one aspect. Another is that I can confirm  as an author that my Ukrainian-language articles on patriotic  themes elicit no response from my political opponents, in  contrast to my articles in Russian.    Another reason why such a newspaper is needed in Luhansk is  that the city has a creative potential to make this a leading  publication in the oblast. If the newspaper becomes a reality,  knowing the creative potential of Luhansk's independent and  democratically oriented journalists, I can almost guarantee this.    First of all, we will draw the population's attention with a  series of materials exposing instances of "grabitization" in the  oblast. This is something that is not reported by any medium of  mass information in Luhansk Oblast.    Secondly, we will become the most popular newspaper because  we will publish analytical articles on political, economic,  artistic, and sports subjects. The weekly will need several  months to accomplish this. By thus winning the respect of our  readers, we will be able to deal a serious blow to  communist-chauvinistic propaganda in Luhansk and throughout the  entire oblast.    Such a publication, though expensive, is the cheapest means  by which to prevent the Donbass from following the example of  Crimea, which is already costing Ukraine much more than it would  have cost to create a full-fledged alternative network of mass  media on the peninsula (when this was still possible).    Thus, the preservation of the territorial integrity of the  country is unquestionably a national matter. It is time to move  from words to deeds. That is, of course, if our statesmen are  not merely playing at statehood and using this as camouflage for  something quite different.</p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / International Company News: Monsanto sells stake in Mexican venture MONSANTO, the US chemicals group, said yesterday it had agreed to sell its 40 per cent stake in Grupo IRSA, a joint venture commodity chemicals company in Mexico. Financial terms were not disclosed, but it is understood Monsanto will receive about Dollars 50m for its shareholding and the sale will occur before year-end. The buyer is DESC Sociedad de Fomento Industrial, Monsanto's partner in the Mexican venture and the holder of 60 per cent of its equity. The Mexican joint venture, which was formed in 1971, has about Dollars 400m of annual revenues and 19 plants in Mexico. Mr Robert Reynolds, a Monsanto vice-president and managing director for Latin America, said changes in Monsanto's worldwide product portfolio had led to the decision. Mr Reynolds said Monsanto still had a significant presence in Mexican markets through local subsidiaries, and that co-operation would continue with DESC in some areas. Last August, Monsanto agreed to sell its Fischer Controls subsidiary in the US for Dollars 1.275bn. Last month, the company disclosed an extraordinary after-tax charge of Dollars 425m against fourth-quarter earnings, and said it planned to cut 3,200 jobs.</p>

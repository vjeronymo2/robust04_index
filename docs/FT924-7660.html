			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Travel: The greatest show on girth - Tokyo is pricy. But some of the best sights are free MOST SURVEYS that compare costs for business and tourist travellers put Tokyo at the top of the world league. But if you want to get a feel for Tokyo, there are a number of attractions that will not cost an arm and a leg. In fact, they are free. Two of them will entail getting up early, but what the heck. Start with a three-mile walk around the Imperial Palace. Once on the perimeter of this green oasis you can walk round in perfect safety, as no public roads are allowed to cross the 285 acres. Even the subways are not allowed to pass beneath the Emperor's temporal home, which makes some subway journeys complicated. A walk around the palace, anti-clockwise from the British Embassy, will reveal a microcosm of a city that has been dubbed the 'safe monster.' Reason: the chances of being mugged in Tokyo are extremely slim. There is crime, but it is well-organised and disciplined (protection rackets, prostitution) and not random, confrontational and drug-related as in the US or, increasingly, some parts of Europe. In any event, there are so many security police in the area that the walk can be made at dawn or dusk or at any hour of the day or night. The Japanese word for policeman is omawarisan, which translates, roughly, as 'honoured Mr Plod,' and their presence on the street and in their police boxes with a red light on top will reassure the faint-hearted. On the walk, to your left, is the massive, impassive stone walls of the Imperial Palace, overhung by gnarled pines; steep grassy banks fall away to the moat, which in winter is home to thousands of ducks from Siberia. As you walk around, you go between massive guarded gateways and cross a great gravelled open space, something extraordinary to find in one of the densest conurbations on Earth. Its purpose remains the same as when it was designated four centuries ago, by the shogun, the supreme military dictator, as a refuge for when the unthinkable happens. Visitors could well experience an earthquake, though hopefully not one of the magnitude of that that devastated Tokyo in 1923. To your right is the National Theatre where bunraku (puppet theatre) and kabuki are regularly performed, and then the Diet and the ministries and the soaring and (supposedly) earthquake-proof buildings of the great trading companies. At dusk the contrast is striking: on one hand Tokyo's dark, dramatic past, with the Emperor hidden away; on the other, the confident dynamic future, with businessmen and bureaucrats in their office blocks and serried ranks of lights blazing. Tsukiji (pronounced skee-ji) is the world's busiest fish market, and is well worth getting up early for (or not going to bed). It is located on the waterfront south of the Ginza, where the Sumida river spills into Tokyo Bay. Most of the fish, however, arrives by road and rail, from all over Japan and abroad. Porters using yellow motorised carts or hand-pulled wooden barrows whizz the fish to the auction rooms and dealers in a cavernous, open-sided hall just inland from the waterfront. On any one morning as many as 3,000 tuna fish, most frozen stiff and white-frosted, are laid out, corpse-like. Men move among them silently, shining torches, taking notes. The impression is of medical staff taking details of casualties on a battlefield. In reality they are prospective buyers checking for quality and assessing how much to bid at the 5am auction. A fresh 6ft tuna can sell for as much as Y4m (Pounds 20,000), which helps explain why Tokyo heads most 'expensive city' lists. (For the cheapest and freshest sushi in Tokyo, breakfast with the porters and mongers at one of the numerous tiny bar-restaurants adjacent to the fish market). The aproned fish-mongers use samurai-sharp knives to swish the bones of the fish from the flesh at extraordinary speed while yelling to potential customers. In the manner of market traders worldwide, porters engage in banter with everyone, particularly foreign visitors. There is all manner of marine life here; and death. Eels have their throats cut and are then dumped in tin buckets to thrash around in their death throes; mottled stone fish sulk in tanks and grotesque sea slugs await a happy eater; fugu - the deadly poison fish that can only be prepared by approved restaurants - blow themselves out in an apoplexy of indignation when a customer seals their fate. Further up the Sumida river is Ryogoku, where the sumo wrestling hall and museum is located. Most of the sumo stables (the hostels where the wrestlers live and train) are located nearby. When the wrestlers are not on the road - there are six 15-day tournaments a year, three outside Tokyo - you can watch the greatest show on girth, for the daily training sessions are open to the public. The most junior wrestlers enter the clay ring first at about 6am. They are naked except for a coarse cotton loincloth and they perform bending and strengthening exercises before crashing into each other in practice bouts. Life for the lower ranks is spartan not just because of the strict training discipline but because they are obliged to act as servant-valets to those above them. Those that make it to the top, like the 40-stone Samoan, Konishiki, enjoy superstar status. The senior wrestlers waddle into the ring after 8am. Most of the stables have their own hairdresser who combs the wrestlers' hair into the distinctive top-knot every day. One of the most lingering memories of a trip to a sumo stable may well be an olfactory one, rather than the brute force on display and the rituals of a centuries-old sport. The oil that wrestlers use on their hair is a mix of waxes and oils, some of which are so strong and unpleasing that they have to be disguised by aloes-wood perfume.</p>

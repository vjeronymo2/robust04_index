			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN TROUBLED POLAND: IT'S POLITICS OF SALAMI OR POLITICS OF SALOME;  </P> <P> WARSAW: RECOVERING FROM THE DEVASTATING LEGACY OF COMMUNIST RULE, THE POLISH  GOVERNMENT TRIES TO PICK UP THE PIECES AND REPAIR THE ECONOMY.  </P> <P> The Communists have fallen from power in Poland, but the Poles have not lost  their talent for bitter political humor. One joke making the rounds says that  there are two solutions to the Polish economic crisis: one miraculous, one  political. One solution would have the Archangel Michael appear over the center  of Warsaw at the head of the millions of angels in the heavenly host. The  angels sweep through every corner of the realm, renewing the infrastructure,  paying the foreign debt and cleaning up the environment. That, say the Poles,  is the political solution. And the miraculous way out? The Poles put their  differences behind them and get down to work.  </P> <P> Under communism, the Poles had money, but there was nothing to buy. A year of  market reforms has produced just the opposite condition: There is plenty to buy  -- oranges and bananas can be found in even the remotest of hamlets -- but most  Poles have no money. With wages at about $50 per month, and prices for most  goods at world levels or moving rapidly up, many Poles are unable to do more  than press their noses against shop windows glittering with long-dreamed-of  consumer goods from the West.  </P> <P> The Poles had expected economic problems with the transition from communism --  not quite as many problems as they are having, perhaps, but the economic bad  news is not so surprising. More troubling to many Poles -- who lack experience  with the normal rough-and-tumble of democratic politics -- is the split between  the leaders of Solidarity. With Lech Walesa fighting for the presidency against  the man he himself appointed to mastermind Poland's transition to freedom,  Poles must choose between rival tendencies in the Solidarity movement.  </P> <P> There are, says one Polish journalist, two kinds of politics: salami and  Salome. Salami politics is about raising standards of living: a chicken in  every pot. Salome politics takes its name from the Biblical dancing girl who,  given the choice of any gift in the kingdom, insisted on the head of John the  Baptist on a platter. This is a politics of scapegoats and symbolism, and it is  looming larger and larger on the Polish horizon.  </P> <P> The reason? There just isn't much salami to distribute -- and some of the  biggest victims of Polish austerity were the strongest supporters of the  revolution.  </P> <P> Take Poland's farmers. The 2.2 million independent small farmers of Poland  fought off the Communists for years, but market reforms spelled their doom.  Tiny Polish plots tilled by horses and donkeys can't compete with the  agro-industrial complexes of the capitalist West. In the long run, reform  should make Polish agriculture more efficient and enrich the small number of  canny farmers who manage the transition. But that's the long run -- Poland's  farmers are hurting now.  </P> <P> The same goes for the industrial workers, backbone of the Solidarity movement.  So far, capitalism has meant wage cuts and unemployment for Poland's workers.  The economic benefits remain far in the nebulous future.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, farmers and workers are rallying to Walesa's attacks on the  government's program of reform. Adding to the bitterness is the widespread  evidence that the chief beneficiary of the revolution is the old nomenklatura.  Who else, after all, has the money, the experience and, above all, the  contacts, to prosper in an era of rapid change?  </P> <P> Not only in Poland but throughout the East Bloc today, ordinary people suspect  that the old nomenklatura is using its enormous resources of networking,  trickery and chicanery to get control of state enterprises under favorable  conditions.  </P> <P> These suspicions are well-founded. Throughout the region the old elites are  working overtime to use their experience in dealing with government  bureaucrats, their knowledge of the enterprises under their control and the  financial resources they amassed under the old regimes to feather their nests  in the new.  </P> <P> Some of this is inevitable, and is even beneficial. Who, after all, is in a  better position to value or manage these enterprises than those now running  them? On the other hand, to many in Poland this looks like Communist injustice  under a new name: Stir the pot all you want, but the same scum rises to the  top. And there's worse to come. Poland's economy faces new shocks in January,  when it must pay world prices -- in dollars -- for Soviet oil. More bad news:  The Soviet Union is Poland's largest customer by far, and the accelerating  disintegration of its economy will reduce Poland's export potential.  </P> <P> The salami shortage is increasingly bad; Salome is waiting in the wings.  Poland's government -- widely believed to be staffed by such unpopular types as  liberals, Freemasons, ex-Communists, homosexuals and Jews -- offers many  targets for the politics of scapegoating.  </P> <P> Poles don't like understatement; some worried intellectuals speak of "Weimar  Poland" -- of a situation reminiscent of Germany before the rise of Hitler.  That is too dark by far; Poland is no Nazi Germany, and Walesa, its most  populist politician, is no anti-Semite.  </P> <P> Still, Polish anti-Semitism has a long and deep history, and if Salome politics  take over, some of the heads on some of the platters will be Jewish. Fifty  years after the massacre of Poland's Jews, anti-Semitism remains widespread.  Groups of Israeli schoolchildren visiting the memorial to the Warsaw ghetto  have been heckled in the streets. Some Poles, with an air of repeating  scandalous gossip, name names of "hidden" Jews in the government, the media or  among their own friends.  </P> <P> Walesa, the favored candidate in the coming presidential election, probably  wants, like most politicians, to govern by salami methods -- but that option is  closed in Poland today. In interviews and statements during the summer, Walesa  called for symbolic steps such as accelerated dismissals of government workers  with a Communist past to satisfy a restless population. The question now is how  far Walesa, or anyone else trying to govern Poland under these trying  conditions, must go down this dangerous, unappealing road.  </P> <P> Despite all its problems, Poland remains in better shape than many of its  neighbors. If Walesa strikes some as a dangerous demagogue, he is also a  convinced anti-Communist who looks westward for ideas and values. Other Eastern  countries such as Romania and Bulgaria have no anti-Communist populists of his  stature. In those countries, the reformers are even more isolated, and the  overall outlook remains, at best, bleak.  </P> <P> Poland's democratic leaders have won the easy battles. They've driven the  Communists from power. Now they must fight the much harder war against  backwardness, poverty and the devastating legacy of Bolshevik misrule. In this  war they will need all the help they can get -- from St. Michael, the angels  and everybody else.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHAMORRO'S UPSET WIN IN NICARAGUA  </P> <P> With all due respect for the retirement philosophy of one of history's greatest  generals, Douglas MacArthur, the freedom-fighter Contras shouldn't lay down  their arms forthwith, and "just fade away" into the Nicaraguan hills.  </P> <P> Why demobilize an existing viable force for protecting the new democracy from  internal subversion?  </P> <P> Rather, these soldiers who, with only irregular U.S. support, fought long and  hard for the democracy they now have, deserve an opportunity to use their hard  earned experience and special skills to help preserve it!  </P> <P> What better way to demonstrate true unity in Nicaragua than for these soldiers  (sans former hard-core Somoza supporters) to be offered positions as fully  legitimate regulars in the Nicaraguan defense and police forces -- answerable  directly to President Chamorro or her own ministers?  </P> <P> This would not have to be inconsistent with achieving the goal of an overall  reduction in the size of the army, since there are probably tens of thousands  of unwilling Sandinista conscripts eager to return to civilian life.  </P> <P> HARVEY PEARSON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

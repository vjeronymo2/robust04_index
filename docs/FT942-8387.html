			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Policy Portfolio matches forecast Policy Portfolio, the marketmaker in second-hand endowment policies which joined the main market in July last year, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 839,144 for the year to end-March. The outcome was achieved on sales of Pounds 11.6m and compared with a profit of Pounds 816,630 last time on turnover of Pounds 7.91m. Sir Stephen Waley-Cohen, chairman, said the result was in line with the statement on trading and market conditions made in January. A final dividend of 3p makes a forecast 4.5p total. The dividend is more than twice covered by earnings of 9.8p (7.6p). The shares closed up 4p at 102p; they were placed at 130p. Securitised Endowment Contracts yesterday reported substantial increases in sales and profits for its first half to March 31. Turnover almost doubled to Pounds 9.08m (Pounds 4.58m) and pre-tax profits jumped 87 per cent to Pounds 562,000 (Pounds 301,000). The company said the progress was helped by a large increase in marketing and promotional efforts. It was confident that a similar level of activity would be maintained in the second half. Earnings per share advanced to 3.03p (2.31p). An interim dividend of 1.5p is declared and the board expects to recommend a final of at least 2p. The company joined the USM in December at 60p; the shares added 4p to 80p yesterday.</p>

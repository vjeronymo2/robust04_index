			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Arts: Roots of Cunningham and Morris Mark Morris, whose L'Allegro, Penseroso, Moderato has been the glory of this year's Edinburgh Festival, has been known to say that the living choreographer he admires the most is Merce Cunningham 'whom I love more than I love God'. Could two choreographers be less alike? And yet I am more sure that these two are great artists than I am about any other artists alive. Now, only six days after the last performance here of L'Allegro, the Edinburgh Festival (after 15 years) has brought back the Cunningham company. The two works they are dancing are by no means Cunningham's finest - whereas Morris has never surpassed L'Allegro  - and yet they plunge us deep into the extraordinary experience that Cunningham alone affords. But let me first proceed a little further with the Morris-Cunningham compare-and-contrast exercise. Morris's works take their roots from music, and they keep drawing from music, whereas Cunningham's exist independently from the scores that accompany them. In the Morris world, people belong first and foremost to a large community; though they have some existence as soloists and in small ensemble groups, they seldom develop any sustained one-to-one relationships in duets. In Cunningham's world, by contrast, people are seen as private soloists above all, each dwelling in his or her private space; solos are frequent and powerfully individual, and duets more remarkable yet in the many ways they show interaction between two utterly distinct lives. Morris's dancers are vividly human, and he often excels in showing a large ensemble of people all sharing the same vital human impulse. People, however, are only one part of Cunningham's vision, and his stage seems often to be a view of flora and fauna - now as seen by some travelling safari camera, now through the window of an aquarium. Morris's rhythms are lyrical, full of cantilena fluency, and often marked by a thrillingly regular pulse; Cunningham's rhythms are irregular, staccato, unpredictable, sustained by the coolest but most powerful current of phrasing. Morris's works have beginnings, middles, and ends; whereas Cunningham's usually give us the illusion that the curtain and the wings are preventing us from seeing a longer and larger moving canvas. Perhaps, however, the differences between Cunningham and Morris only reveal a more profound similarity. In both, we are seeing broad and probing views of the world. We see human energies refined to exceptional levels of mastery. We are, in fact, watching classical art, which almost nobody else in the world makes any more. Cargo X, the first and shorter of the two works shown here this year by Cunningham, is one of his more daffy constructions, with a certain silly use of flowers and a stepladder. (Those who look for symbolism everywhere can waste a lot of time on this kind of nonsense.) And yet hardly has the curtain risen than we are off into an enthralling solo, in which (at the performance I watched) the great Frederic Gafner swings in the air between huge, hanging jumps of alternating convex and concave shapes. At once rhythm and space and human energy are made vital in the ways only Cunningham knows. Cargo X and Enter are accompanied by two of the most stupidly cacophonous scores I have ever heard. Usually I can take the Cunningham sound-world in contentment, but David Tudor - an abstract expressionist of music whose works I have sometimes admired - has made music for Enter in which whole gaggles of geese protest at the passing of whistling V2 rockets, computors breed with one another and then get divorced, and so on  .. This is not merely silly but actually so intrusive as to be, in spirit, anti-Cunningham. Even so, anyone can see that about 40 per cent of Enter ( a long 90- minute composition) is on Cunningham's highest level, notably in its solos and duets. In ensembles it is always interesting when Cunningham has more than one activity, and more than one speed, going on at the same time; but when he has everybody doing more or less the same thing the interest drops. Elsewhere, however, it is still true, as when I reviewed the premiere of this work at the Paris Opera in 1992, that this dance makes one wonderfully conscious of vertical space; each dancer seems to be merely the base of some mighty and moving cylinder. The work contains both extremes of slow-motion and speed, both beautifully achieved; and sculptural stillness is often contrasted with either staccato brilliance or unbroken slow phrases. When Cuuningham is great - which is often enough here - nothing in the world is more peculiar or more marvelous.</p>

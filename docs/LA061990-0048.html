			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PICUS PROPOSES DAY-CARE CENTER FOR YOUNG, ELDERLY;  </P> <P> INTERGENERATIONAL CARE: THE COUNCILWOMAN'S PLAN CALLS FOR THE TWO GROUPS TO  MEET FOR MEALS, RECREATION AND OTHER ACTIVITIES.  </P> <P> Children and the elderly would mingle, enriching each others' lives by sharing  experiences and perspectives, at an "intergenerational day-care center" in the  west San Fernando Valley that would be part of a package of care measures for  senior citizens proposed Monday by Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joy Picus.  </P> <P> "Just as child care was the important issue of the 1980s, elder care is going  to be the important issue of the '90s," Picus told a news conference, noting  the growing number of elderly Americans.  </P> <P> The centerpiece of Picus' program, the intergenerational center, would not be a  city institution, but would be run in cooperation with the Valley Senior  Service and Resource Center, a private group in Reseda, Picus said. It is  expected to begin operation by the end of next year, with funding expected to  come from charitable organizations, state and federal funds, and fund-raising  efforts, Picus said.  </P> <P> "It will be the first of its kind in Los Angeles and it will carve new roads in  the care of seniors," Picus said.  </P> <P> The value of the center will lie in the interaction between children, who will  come from lower-income families, and the elderly, she said.  </P> <P> The center is still in the planning stages, but Picus aide Jackie Brainard said  the program would most likely be run by a partnership between a nonprofit  organization expert in caring for elderly adults and another experienced in  working with preschool children.  </P> <P> The center would function on two levels. Elderly enrolled in the center would  participate in activities similar to those at other senior citizen centers, and  children would have a typical preschool program. But two or three times during  the day, the two groups would come together to share meals, recreation and  other organized activities.  </P> <P> "That's what's supposed to really enrich the lives of both," Picus said.  "Children who are on the site will essentially have grandparents helping them  enjoy life during the day, and the seniors will get renewed vigor and enjoyment  in life as they are around the young children."  </P> <P> In another measure aimed at senior citizen care, Picus said she will introduce  an ordinance in the City Council today that would allow for licensed in-home  day care for the elderly, patterned after home day-care centers for children.  Such centers would increase the quantity and quality of elder-care facilities  and provide families with an alternative for elderly members who are too  healthy for a nursing home but too ill to be left alone during the day, she  said.  </P> <P> In addition, the ordinance would allow city employees to donate vacation or  personal-leave days for use by co-workers who need to care for an ailing family  member and would set up a hot line providing elder-care information.  </P> <P> Brainard said there are about half a dozen intergenerational care centers in  the United States. The West Valley center will be modeled after a similar  center run by the Stride Rite shoe company, which was opened earlier this year  for employees at its corporate headquarters in Cambridge, Mass., Picus said.  </P> <P> But the Stride Rite center is a rare move by business, she said. Picus and  other elder-care advocates maintain that businesses lose $15 billion a year  because of a failure to address the need for elder care in their policies and  employee benefits packages.  </P> <P> Workers must take time off -- often unpaid -- to care for relatives, and the  stress and emotional drain of caring for ailing relatives decreases worker  productivity, Picus said.  </P> <P> The burden of care falls most often on women workers, she said. "Many very  capable, experienced women are forced to leave the work force in order to care  for their relatives, so that we lose dependable well-trained people," Picus  said. "Providing for our aging relatives is vitally important to the work force  today."  </P></p>

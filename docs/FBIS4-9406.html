			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Josef Michl: "United States and Israel Are in </F> the Game for Participation in the Production of Czech Military  Aircraft"]    [Text] On the occasion of a reception for Israeli members  of parliament on 8 April, Defense Minister Baudys publicly  announced the possibility of cooperation between the Czech  Republic and Israel in the sphere of arms industry. At the same  time, he said in his report for CTK that it would be premature  to speak about a specific form of cooperation. According to  information obtained by RUDE PRAVO from reliable sources, the  aforementioned cooperation could concern supplies of Israeli  avionics for the light training and combat aircraft L-159  developed by Aero Vodochody Co. This aircraft, in addition to  use by the Czech Army, should succeed in the U.S. and Australian  markets and the markets of the European NATO member countries.  In fact, this cooperation would be just a continuation of the  cooperation with the Israeli firm Elbit that is participating by  supplying military equipment in the production of L-59 aircraft,  a contract on the delivery of 36 pieces of which was signed with  Thailand.    Aero Vodochody Director Zdenek Chalupnik told RUDE PRAVO on  20 April that the observation regarding the supplies for the  L-159 by the firm Elbit is "only a small part of information."  "Of the approximately nine offers," he continued, "we have  short-listed three, and no further selection has been done so  far." He admitted at the same time that Elbit is on this short  list of firms that are capable of satisfying the demands from  the Army of the Czech Republic and added that the other two  firms are from the United States. Moreover, he confirmed that  one of them is the Rockwell International Corporation.    According to the RUDE PRAVO findings, this corporation  showed  great interest in the production of the Czech military aircraft,  as testified by its letters to Defense Minister Antonin Baudys  and Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy, in which it  appeals to the Czech representatives to seriously consider its  initiative, with due attention to the prestige of the firm and  the contacts to which it can provide access. It submitted a  detailed official offer of cooperation to the management of Aero  Vodochody last February. In it, the U.S. corporation provides  information on the objectives and conditions of the proposed  joint venture that would concern an exclusive partnership in the  sale of the L-159 aircraft on the world markets, avionics  supplies, teamwork in the modernization of the aircraft for use  within the framework of NATO, assistance in providing credits,  and cooperation in the development of the Czech fighter aircraft  of the next generation. Subcontractors from Great Britain and  Italy are taking part in the bid of the U.S. manufacturer.    The Aero Vodochody company conducted its own preliminary  comparison of the two bids. The results RUDE PRAVO managed to  obtain indicate the superiority of the Rockwell bid. The  internal material of Aero specifically states that the markets  to which Rockwell promises to introduce the Czech military  aviation production will not be, as opposed to the limited  possibilities of the Israeli company, limited by political  concerns and risks. The material describes the worldwide  reputation of Rockwell as excellent, and it refers in the same  manner to the firm's technical, marketing, and information  possibilities and results and the offered financial assistance  by means of its own credit company and commercial banks. It  emphasizes its possibilities in the training of technicians,  providing top-quality avionics, software, and NATO logistics,  and especially notes that Elbit does not have such  possibilities. The offer of exclusive cooperation in selling  L-159 in the world markets is noted (while the possibilities of  the Israeli company are limited in this respect to Singapore,  India, and Australia) and the firm's own production potential,  while Elbit must purchase a large quantity of equipment from  other manufacturers.    Consultations by RUDE PRAVO with industry and military  experts in aviation give rise to certain doubts regarding the  orientation toward Israeli supplies also from the vantage point  of the future market for Czech military aircraft production,  particularly with respect to the desirable compatibility with  the NATO standards and the conceivable application in the armies  of the North Atlantic Alliance member states. Because of the  significance of the matter, Chalupnik refuses to provide  official information regarding the scope of individual bids, but  he considers them approximately equal. At the same time, he  points out the necessity for speedy processing of the concept of  restructuring the Army and setting priorities in the development  of military production. "We are waiting," he said in a  telephone conversation with a RUDE PRAVO correspondent, "for the  establishment of that program (L-159 production). We are waiting  for the decision. Of course, to the extent of some hundred  million korunas, we are working on the preparations so that,  when the time comes, we can start at full speed. It will have  Western-type avionics, corresponding to NATO standards, and the  selection process has not been concluded. Period."</p>

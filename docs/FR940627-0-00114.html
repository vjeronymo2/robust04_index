			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Content of Tiers.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Except as may be modified by any applicable special provisions, the requirements of Tiers 1 and 2 are mandatory for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all fuels and fuel additives. These requirements may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfied by manufacturers either on an individual basis or by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> way of a group submission consistent with the provisions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grouping system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under Tier 1, F/FA manufacturers are required to perform a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> literature search on the health and welfare effects of F/FA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions, characterize the emissions, and provide a qualitative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure analysis based on total annual production volume and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market distribution data (see Section VII for details on Tier 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements). The modeling analyses proposed in the NPRM have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been eliminated from Tier 1 as explained in Section III.C of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preamble. Tier 2 (see Section VIII) includes biological testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for specific health effect endpoints, as well as general systemic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and organ toxicity. The Tier 2 biological testing requires the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure of laboratory animals to the whole emissions of fuels or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additive/base fuel mixtures. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  To the extent that previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted studies are available which are at least comparable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the specified guidelines for the chemical and/or biological tests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required in Tiers 1 and 2, such existing data may be submitted in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lieu of performing and reporting on new duplicative tests (see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section VII.A.2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> An additive must be mixed with the base fuel of its associated fuel family prior to generating emissions for testing (see Sections IV.A and IV.B.1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The results of Tiers 1 and 2 are to be reported to EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> according to the report formats described in Section XII. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will evaluate these results to determine if additional testing or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis may be indicated under the provisions of Tier 3. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the purpose of peer review during this evaluation process, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may furnish the submitted data to, and consult with, other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organizations, such as the Health Effects Institute. Tier 3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests will be determined on a case-by-case basis at EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discretion, as discussed in Section IX. The specific objectives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and scope of Tier 3 tests will vary depending on the concerns  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified in the earlier tiers or any other information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Timing of Requirements: Registered F/FAs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA proposed to require that Tier 1 and Tier 2 data be submitted within three years for registered F/FAs. In their comments on the proposal the regulated industry suggested that it would not be possible to complete Tier 2 testing within three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years. As detailed in the Summary and Analysis of Comments,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these commenters stated that the number of F/FAs to be tested,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the time needed for development of detailed test protocols, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the lack of available test facilities were inconsistent with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three-year time frame for completion of Tier 1 and Tier 2 for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F/FAs (or groups). None of the commenters, however, suggested an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative time frame within which the testing of all F/FAs (or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> groups) could be completed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has thoroughly considered these comments and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordingly, has taken a number of measures to streamline the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. As discussed later in this preamble, such measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include the deletion from the final rule of some requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed in the NPRM (e.g., quantitative modeling requirements),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification of the Tier 2 testing scenario for greater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency, simplification of some of the grouping rules, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition of special provisions which will result in a smaller  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of F/FA products requiring testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nevertheless, EPA recognizes that the number of laboratory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities currently available to conduct the required emission-based toxicological tests is very limited. EPA expects that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgation of this rule will create a demand for testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratories which will encourage the reactivation, modification,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and/or expansion of existing laboratories, as well as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of new facilities, to accommodate the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the F/FA registration program. However, there is likely to be a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lag between the demand for and the availability of laboratory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capacity. Thus, while EPA believes that some groups could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete the testing required by the rule in three years, it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likely that not all of the F/FAs to be tested could complete the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements in the three-year time frame.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Considering these factors, the final rule allows a six-year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period for the conduct of Tier 2 testing for registered F/FAs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This longer period will provide the necessary start-up time for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratories with previous experience in conducting studies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonably similar to those required in Tier 2 to adapt or build  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the necessary facilities, organize the key technical personnel,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and conduct verification procedures. In this regard, it is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary for each laboratory providing services for this program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to employ experts in each of the toxicology specialty fields  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered by Tier 2. EPA recognizes that some of the required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expertise may be in short supply, and envisions that laboratories  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may subcontract with subspecialists as needed for evaluation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test results. Furthermore, biological laboratories which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently offer inhalation toxicology testing services, but are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not equipped to generate and deliver engine emissions for such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing, should be able to obtain the additional equipment and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engineering expertise they will need in a relatively short period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of time. Addition of emission generation capabilities by such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratories will be facilitated by the fact that the final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allows the use of relatively inexpensive and possibly portable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine dynamometers for generating the required emissions for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxicological testing related both to light-duty and heavy-duty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

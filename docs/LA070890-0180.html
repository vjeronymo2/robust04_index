			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HANDYMAN Q&amp;A: HOW TO CLEAR DEPOSITS FROM NEW TOILET VALVE  </P> <P> QUESTION: I had a Fluidmaster 400-A tank valve installed in my toilet recently,  and have since noticed a gurgling sound coming from the toilet. It sounds as if  the valve is stuck open, allowing water to run into the bowl. The water level  in the bowl doesn't change. Any ideas as to what's happening?  </P> <P> ANSWER: The condition may be the result of a sediment buildup. Often, sediment  in the plumbing is loosened when the new valve is installed and is carried by  the water stream into a Fluidmaster valve.  </P> <P> To flush out the deposits, turn off the toilet's water supply. Unscrew the  valve's cover by pushing down and turning counterclockwise. Hold an overturned  cup above the valve and turn the water on again. Flush out the valve  thoroughly.  </P> <P> Check that an angle adapter has been installed on the overflow pipe. Without  it, water will be siphoned from the tank, down the pipe and into the bowl.  Also, check that the flusher is properly aligned over the valve seat so water  won't leak past it.  </P> <P> If sediment continues to clog the valve, you may need an in-line water filter  in the house water-supply line.  </P> <P> </P> <P> May Need to Open Wall to Fix Pocket Door  </P> <P> Q: Can I fix pocket sliding doors that came off the rail without cutting into  the wall to gain access? The hangers and rollers either come loose, or the rail  becomes loose due to screws falling off.  </P> <P> A: You may be able to solve the problem by adjusting the hardware the door  hangs from. If, however, there is a problem with the tracks inside the wall, it  may be necessary to open one side of the wall for access.  </P> <P> </P> <P> When Paint Blisters, Check Ventilation  </P> <P> Q: Last spring, I scraped every speck of defective paint from the siding on our  house, then primed and painted with a high-quality topcoat. By November, the  new paint had blistered. My neighbor painted two years earlier and his house  remains in pristine condition. Why?  </P> <P> A: Cut open some of the paint blisters. If bare wood shows beneath, it's almost  certain you have a moisture problem. Check the venting on your neighbor's house  and compare it with your own. Does he have a stationary attic vent? Has he  installed vents in his siding? Good venting allows moisture to pass to the  outdoors from inside a house before it can penetrate the siding and lift the  paint. As a further precaution, use paint on interior walls that is rated as a  vapor barrier. Also, make sure caulking and flashing are sealing out leaks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Root of Sidewalk's Problem Is Tree  </P> <P> Q: Whole sections of my concrete sidewalk have heaved because of tree roots. Do  I have to tear out the old walk and pour new concrete?  </P> <P> A: Pouring a new walk would solve your problems only temporarily. The real  problem is the tree roots. Since your concrete is in good condition, it should  be a relatively easy matter to pry up the sidewalk in sections. Use a pry bar  to move slabs out of the way. Chop out the tree roots. You may need to dig the  subgrade deeper if the level has shifted. Tamp the earth firmly. For good  drainage, put in six inches of gravel. Then replace the slabs on the gravel  bed.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The movement towards peace in Liberia continues to  be painfully slow. Since the outbreak of civil war almost four  years ago, many thousands of people have died and inevitably as  the man who began the insurrection against former President  Samuel Doe, the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia]  leader, Charles Taylor, has made no secret of his desire to take  his place. Network's Cello Brooks has just visited Mr. Taylor's  headquarters in Gbarnga. There, he asked him first why the  people of Liberia should trust him with the leadership of their  country.    [Begin recording] [Taylor] The Liberian people know very  well  that I will not sell out, that I will not kneel and bow to any  nation, no matter how powerful, when it comes to the sovereign  rights, liberties, and protection of the Liberian people. We  started this revolution. We have the largest army in this  country. We showed we have not blinked at the most powerful  countries in this region.    [Brooks] What do you think are some of the qualities the  Liberian people will look at to say: Oh yes, this man is the  man?    [Taylor] We all need a leader that we can trust -- a leader  who says that he can do something and do it. We do not need a  puppet in this country. The Liberian people know very well that  I will not sell out, that I will not kneel and bow to any  nation, no matter how powerful, when it comes to the sovereign  rights, liberties, and protection of the Liberian people. They  need a strong leader, they do not need a little roach in this  country. They need a man that has guts, a man that has  credibility, a man that is strong, firm and I think that I have  these qualities. And if Liberians make a mistake by putting  someone who is incapable, after the crisis, of bringing all  parties together, to reconcile the parties from a position of  confidence and strength, that will be the biggest mistake this  country could ever make and it would lead us probably back into  conflict. They need someone they can trust; I think I am that  person.    [Brooks] And so, are you really prepared to start up with  the  entire process, I mean, in terms of disarming, encamping, and  demobilizing your men?    [Taylor] Well, why wouldn't I be prepared? We've said for  months ...[pauses] do not let us forget here that we've advanced  all or most of the initiatives so far from the Geneva meeting to  the Cotonou meetings to recuse ourselves from the process to  give peace a chance. We have unilaterally declared certain  aspects of the peace process. We have always been ready, we've  insisted on fair play, we are very glad that the United Nations  is here, we are very glad that the expanded ECOMOG [Economic  Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] is  here. We, however, regret that they have not entered our area,  our controlled area, we hope they can move as quickly as  possible. We have always hoped to move the peace forward.    [Brooks] Are you hoping to enter Monrovia in high spirits?    [Taylor] I expect to win a landslide victory in these  general  and presidential elections and my party, I expect, will lead  with a majority in the parliament; and so I have no qualms about  going to Monrovia. We will judge the safety factor [words  indistinct] given the extent of hostilities and after that we  will go in when we think and feel that it is right. [end  recording]</p>

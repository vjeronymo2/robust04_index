			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News and Current Events" program] </F>   [Text] Mr. Chiao Jen-ho, vice chairman and secretary  general of Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF], and his  party arrived in Beijing on 31 January to hold talks with Tang  Shubei, executive vice president of the Association for  Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS]. (Yin Xin,) an  editor of this station, wrote a news commentary about the talks:  "We Hope the Tang-Chiao Talks Will Yield Positive Results." The  following is the commentary, read by Wen Liang:    The Tang Shubei-Chiao Jen-ho talks will be held in Beijing  1-4 February. The current talks are the fourth ones between  ARATS and SEF following the successful Wang-Ku talks in  Singapore in April last year. The current talks are being held  to discuss the full implementation of the agreements signed at  the Wang-Ku talks. At the previous three rounds of ARATS-SEF  talks -- the first was held at the end of August last year in  Beijing, the second in early October last year in Xiamen, and  the third in mid-December in Taibei -- the two sides discussed  issues concerning the repatriation of plane hijackers, civil  disputes, repatriation of personnel, and the procedures for the  exchange of visits by ARATS and SEF personnel. At these rounds  of talks, the two sides also exchanged views on Taiwan  investors' rights and interests on the mainland and related  problems, as well as on the exchange of visits by businessmen on  the two sides of the strait. Some common understanding was  reached between the two sides on these issues, laying a  foundation for work consultations between the two sides.    According to an agreement reached at the Wang-Ku talks, in  principle, the executive vice president of ARATS and the vice  chairman of SEF, or the secretaries general of the two  organizations, will hold talks every six months on the two  organizations' work, alternately on one side of the strait or in  a third place agreed on by the two sides. On 20 November last  year, ARATS invited Chiao Jen-ho, who just took office as vice  chairman and secretary general of SEF, to visit Beijing to  discuss the two organizations' work. At that meeting, the two  sides also decided that the third work meeting between ARATS and  SEF would be held in Taibei. The SEF also twice invited Tang  Shubei to visit Taiwan. Regrettably, Chiao Jen-ho's invitation  for Tang Shubei to visit Taiwan was not carried out reportedly  because an agreement was not reached at the Taibei talks.  Later, ARATS and SEF formally decided that Tang Shubei and  Chiao Jen-ho would meet in Beijing at the end of January this  year. However, Taiwan again deliberately created obstacles to  the meeting, going so far as to say that China and France  signing a joint communique in which France guarantees that it  will not sell arms to Taiwan and China's restoring diplomatic  relations with Lesotho were unfriendly acts of the mainland  toward Taiwan, and declared that it would reassess the  Tang-Chiao talks. There was a public outcry in Taiwan over the  matter, saying Taiwan's such emotional display put people at a  loss and perplexed the public. Under the pressure of Taiwan's  public opinion, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Committee finally  decided that the Tang-Chiao talks would be held in Beijing as  scheduled.    The open contacts and regular meetings to discuss matters of  interest between the only novgovernment organs authorized by the  governments of the two sides of the strait are a historically  important step in the development of cross-strait relations over  the past 40 years and more. The great significance and  far-reaching effects of the development have made it a major  event that people on the two sides of the strait as well as the  international community have been concerned about. We should  treasure this hard-won result. To create a cooperative  atmosphere between the two sides, they should do everything they  can to reduce all kinds of disturbances in the process of  communicating with each other. Now that Taiwan's Mainland  Affairs Committee has agreed to let Chiao Jen-ho go to Beijing  to meet Tang Shubei as scheduled, it should endeavor to enable  the talks to yield positive results, with the aim to bring about  a virtuous cycle of development of the cross-strait relations.    There is no need for reticence. Currently some political  differences still exist between the two sides of the strait, and  these differences canot be ironed out for the time being. But,  as long as the two sides work to increase exchanges and contacts  and as long as high-level responsible persons of the two sides  maintain regular contacts and communications, dismiss their  misunderstandings, deepen their mutual understanding, and  continue to increase their common understanding, we believe that  Chinese people's own affairs will be settled sooner or later.</p>

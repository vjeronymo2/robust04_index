			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Effect on interim benefits.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interim benefits will not be granted based on an application or petition held in suspense for the submission of requested initial evidence, except that the applicant or beneficiary will normally be allowed to remain while an application or petition to extend or obtain status while in the United States is pending. The Service may choose to pursue other actions to seek removal of a person notwithstanding the pending application. Employment authorization previously accorded based on the same status and employment as that requested in the current application or petition may continue uninterrupted as provided in 8 CFR 274a.12(b)(20) during the suspense period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (11)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Submission of evidence in response to a Service request.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All evidence submitted in response to a Service request must be submitted at one time. The submission of only some of the requested evidence will be considered a request for a decision based on the record.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (12)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Effect where evidence submitted in response to a request does not establish eligibility at the time of filing.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An application or petition shall be denied where evidence submitted in response to a request for initial evidence does not establish filing eligibility at the time the application or petition was filed. An application or petition shall be denied where any application or petition upon which it was based was filed subsequently.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (13)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Effect of failure to respond to a request for evidence or appearance.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If all requested initial evidence and requested additional evidence is not submitted by the required date, the application or petition shall be considered abandoned and, accordingly, shall be denied. Except as provided in &sect;335.6 of this chapter, if a person requested to appear for an interview does not appear, the Service does not receive his or her request for rescheduling by the date of the interview, or the applicant or petitioner has not withdrawn the application or petition, the application or petition shall be considered abandoned and, accordingly, shall be denied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (14)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Effect of request for decision.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When an applicant or petitioner does not submit all requested additional evidence and requests a decision based on the evidence already submitted, a decision shall be issued based on the record. Failure to submit requested evidence which precludes a material line of inquiry shall be grounds for denying the application or petition. Failure to appear for a required interview, or to give required testimony, shall result in the denial of any related application or petition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (15)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Effect of withdrawal or denial due to abandonment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service's acknowledgement of a withdrawal may not be appealed. A denial due to abandonment may not be appealed, but an applicant or petitioner may file a motion to reopen under &sect;103.5. Withdrawal or denial due to abandonment does not preclude the filing of a new application or petition with a new fee. However, the priority or processing date of a withdrawn or abandoned application or petition may not be applied to a later application petition. Withdrawal or denial due to abandonment shall not itself affect the new proceeding; but the facts and circumstances surrounding the prior application or petition shall otherwise be material to the new application or petition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (17)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Verifying claimed permanent resident status.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The status of an applicant or petitioner who claims that he or she is a permanent resident of the United States will be verified from official records of the Service. The term official records, as used herein, includes Service files, arrival manifests, arrival records, Service index cards, Immigrant Identification Cards, Certificates of Registry, Declarations of Intention issued after July 1, 1929, Alien Registration Receipt Cards Forms AR&hyph;3, AR&hyph;103, I&hyph;151 or I&hyph;551), passports, and reentry permits. To constitute an official record a Service index card must bear a designated immigrant visa symbol and must have been prepared by an authorized official of the Service in the course of processing immigrant admissions or adjustments to permanent resident status. Other cards, certificates, declarations, permits, and passports must have been issued or endorsed by the Service to show admission for permanent residence. Except as otherwise provided in 8 CFR part 101, and in the absence of countervailing evidence, such official records shall be regarded as establishing lawful admission for permanent residence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (19)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Notification.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An applicant or petitioner shall be sent a written decision on his or her application, petition, motion, or appeal.

Any motion to reopen a proceeding before the Service filed by an applicant or petitioner, must be filed within 30 days of the decision that the motion seeks to reopen, except that failure to file before this period expires, may be excused in the discretion of the Service where it is demonstrated that the delay was reasonable and was beyond the control of the applicant or petitioner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Filing Requirements_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A motion shall be submitted on Form I&hyph;290A, and may be accompanied by a brief. * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (C) Accompanied by a nonrefundable fee as set forth in &sect;103.7;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Requirements for motion to reopen.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A motion to reopen must state the new facts to be provided in the reopened proceeding and be supported by affidavits or other documentary evidence.

A motion to reconsider a decision on an application or petition must, when filed, also establish that the decision was incorrect based on the evidence of record at the time of the initial decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Processing motions in proceedings before the Service.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A motion that does not meet applicable requirements shall be dismissed.

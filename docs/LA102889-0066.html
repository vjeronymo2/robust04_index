Robenson, 57, announced Friday that he will take  an extended medical leave beginning Monday.  </P> <P> Continuing high blood pressure and the stress of 14-hour days overseeing  Pasadena's 220 sworn officers have caused him to develop heart problems,  Robenson said. The leave could last for months, he said.  </P> <P> During his absence, Cmdr. Bruce Philpott will take over day-to-day operations  as acting police chief. But Robenson said he will continue to make decisions on  promotions and will oversee the department's move into the new $18.9-million  police building, scheduled in March.  </P></p>

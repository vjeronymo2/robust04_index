			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy After the fourth monthly fall in a row it is difficult to believe that the trend of unemployment has not turned. Doubtless Jobcentres are putting pressure on people to leave the register, and the workforce may be shrinking for other reasons too. But yesterday's figures also suggest employment is increasing. The slightly worrying aspect is that the turnround comes when average earnings are still rising at a rate as high as 4 per cent. With settlements around 3 per cent and falling, though, it could be some while before wage pressures resurface. Meanwhile, industry continues to reap large productivity gains. Coupled with encouraging retail price figures, this is good news for the long end of the gilt market, which perceives an attractive combination of low inflation with growth that may help reduce the PSBR. The short end has to come to terms with the realisation that a rate cut is not imminent. After the latest data, the chancellor need not hurry. This is not to say that decisions on rates will be easy. The cabinet decision to stick to existing public spending control totals next year is fairly tough. But it may leave Mr Clarke having to resort to more tax increases if growth turns out insufficient to revive tax revenues significantly. At that stage, a rate cut would be a useful option. The question is what will happen to sterling - back above DM2.50 yesterday  - if he waits till the budget. The Bundesbank is moving at a snail's pace, but even it will surely have lopped some more off the Lombard rate by November.</p>

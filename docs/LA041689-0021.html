			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW LESSONS AT STANFORD  </P> <P> Last week a bucolic corner of the Stanford University campus produced one  rather commonplace lesson: Never throw anything away just because it is not  absolutely up to date. From that, though, will flow cosmic lessons almost  beyond the imagining of ordinary folk, let alone their comprehension. As Burton  Richter, director of Stanford's Linear Accelerator Center, puts it, what comes  next will help scientists who are "trying to understand what's in the mind of  God."  </P> <P> The something not quite up to date is the 20-year-old accelerator, which  Richter and a team of scientists modified for $115 million -- peanuts in the  big-science business where people think in billions -- by adding a loop to the  end of an existing 2-mile-long tunnel through which sub-atomic particles ride  waves of electric power. The accelerator now sends positrons into the loop in  one direction and electrons in the other so that they collide at nearly the  speed of light. The nuclear debris from what used to be called atom-smashing is  scattered into a big concrete pillbox packed with instruments that sort out and  identify the bits and pieces.  </P> <P> The cosmic aspect stems from the fact that after two anxious years of trying to  calibrate the modified atom-smasher, Stanford's instruments detected a Z  particle in the debris Wednesday.  </P> <P> The Z particle is what Richter and his colleagues had been looking for. With  the tricky business of calibration apparently solved, according to spokesman  Michael Riordan, Stanford may become the world's largest supplier of Z  particles by the end of summer.  </P> <P> What makes the Z particles important to physicists is that they existed  naturally for about one-trillionth of a second after the Big Bang that  scientific theory says created the universe, and then they decayed. By creating  Zs in a collider and observing the artificial particles decay, physicists can  add one more level to what they know about how and why our galaxy and other  galaxies arranged themselves as they did.  </P> <P> It also is a crucial step toward what Sidney Drell, co-director of the  accelerator center, calls the Holy Grail of physics, a grand unifying theory  that would explain the relationship between gravity and electromagnetism.  </P> <P> Stanford's Z is not the first ever trapped in an atom-smasher. The first was  detected six years ago in the collider of the European Center for Nuclear  Research near Geneva by a team of researchers who were awarded the Nobel prize  for physics for their effort.  </P> <P> But Stanford may become the first mass producer of the heaviest sub-atomic  particle now known to exist, the one that may hold the key to understanding  how, in a trillionth of a second, the pattern was set for everything that  exists billions of years later. It is good to see California again on the  cutting edge of science. But the real cause for celebration is one more lesson  wrung from science, one more lesson that compels us to ponder once more the  wonders of physical discovery, discovery with the power to make the mind both  wince and dance.  </P></p>

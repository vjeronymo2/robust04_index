			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRANSFER OF RIGHT-TO-DIE PATIENT HALTED  </P> <P> The father of a brain-damaged patient at the hospital where Nancy Cruzan was  allowed to die after a court fight has been blocked from moving his daughter to  a state where her feeding tube could be removed with less legal strife.  </P> <P> Pete Busalacchi says his daughter should be allowed to die.  </P> <P> But Don Lamkins, director of the Missouri Rehabilitation Center, contends  Christine Busalacchi has mental functions and responds to commands.  </P> <P> Christine Busalacchi, 20, has spent 3 1/2 years in a vegetative state similar  to that of Cruzan, who died after becoming a focus of national debate and a  landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the right to die.  </P> <P> The Busalacchi case renewed warnings Sunday from euthanasia opponents that a  "tidal wave" of death for hopeless patients would result from the Cruzan case.  </P> <P> Lamkins said Sunday that a 10-day restraining order issued Saturday will give  doctors time to examine Christine Busalacchi. A judge has scheduled a Jan. 8  hearing to hear results of the tests.  </P> <P> Busalacchi said that he was angry and frustrated about the legal action.  </P> <P> "My feeling is my daughter died a long time ago, and all that's left is just a  machine," he said.  </P> <P> "I will not see my daughter held prisoner in Missouri."  </P> <P> Busalacchi expected to move his daughter on Saturday to Minneapolis, where  specialists were to decide whether her tube should be removed.  </P></p>

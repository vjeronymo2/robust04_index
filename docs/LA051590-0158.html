			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GLIMPSES  </P> <P> More than 160 young girls were treated for hysteria and fainting at a New Kids  on the Block concert in London Sunday night, which had to be rescheduled from  Friday because of a power outage. The girls were passing out even before  members of the Boston-based group came on-stage, but the supervisor of the  arena said the scene still didn't compare to Beatlemania.  </P> <P> "It was nowhere near it," he said. "If there wasn't any Beatles I should  imagine this would have been in the history books." . . . The greatest show on  Earth isn't a rock group. The band Kiss says it will no longer advertise its  tour, which started during the weekend in Lubbock, Tex., as the greatest show  on Earth after being hit with a cease-and-desist order from the Ringling Bros.  and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus.  </P></p>

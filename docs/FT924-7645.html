			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Records: Sing on demand - Richard Fairman reviews recent opera recordings TRYING to apply the usual economic theories of demand and supply to the world of opera is a Humpty Dumpty business. The demand for the product is probably higher than ever before, but the supply of top singers to meet it is never likely to grow at the same pace. Show a record company an opera singer who can sing almost anything and the chances are she soon will. In the last few years the American soprano Cheryl Studer has become that omnipresent recording star. Mozart's stratospheric Queen of Night, Wagner's noble Elsa, Rossini comic sopranos - Studer has had a go at them all and her voice has stretched up and down, this way and that, with a commendable degree of success to meet each in turn. It was inevitable that Verdi's La traviata would soon follow. The role of Violetta is among the most technically demanding in all opera and is often said to require three different voices, one for each act. Her new recording for DG shows that she has no fear for its difficulties. Perhaps the vocal fireworks of the first act do not get airborne without an effort. But the lyrical music is filled out with bright and warm singing, which is generous in its emotional openheartedness. Her Violetta sounds a healthy, outgoing young woman. Not a portrait always easy to reconcile with Dumas's fragile lady of the camellias, but it is of a piece with what is going on around her. James Levine, the conductor, is only in his element as a Verdian when he can set the thunder and lightning ringing around the ears and the performance is vague about what it wants to say until the big moments, where he lets himself go. The effect is of an all-purpose, generalised theatricality. By coincidence another set of the opera has turned up at the same time. The buyer has a real choice, too, as this Teldec recording is the mirror image of its rival. Where Studer was unspecific, Edita Gruberova is precise and detailed. Where Studer let her emotions open out, Gruberova closes up into studied unspontaneity. What the Czech soprano does manage, however, is to use beautiful vocal phrasing in its purest form to convey her emotions. The setting of La traviata is here plausibly Gallic, a world of delicate sensibilities and moral propriety. The Italian conductor, Carlo Rizzi, is generally stylish, but not very theatrical. If Levine's way of showing his enthusiasm for Verdi's music is to hug it and shout his affection out loud, Rizzi whispers his intimate knowledge of its beauties in one's ear. He and Gruberova are at their best when Violetta is alone or in dialogue. A choice between the two is awkward and the supporting singers do not help. Nobody would generally buy a set of La traviata for the Alfredo, though they might when the tenor is Luciano Pavarotti (on DG), slightly less golden of voice than usual, but still preferable to Teldec's Neil Shicoff. With the baritones the advantage is round the other way, for Giorgio Zancanaro on the Teldec set makes more of Germont pere's role than DG's dull Juan Pons. The Teldec, though, has the better recording quality. That is the more stylish and would be my choice. For variety one might prefer to turn to Offenbach's Les Contes d'Hoffmann - though not in the cast, as Cheryl Studer promptly turns up again. She has had time to change her nationality, but not her profession. Here she plays the Venetian courtesan, Giulietta, a portrayal that lacks any distinct personality, though the music is more than capably sung. Unfortunately, for other reasons entirely, her participation in this set has to be judged an opportunity lost. The enticing question here is whether Hoffmann's three loves are, in fact, three women-in-one, a fantastic triple vision of a single feminine ideal. To have the multi-voiced Studer in the cast and yet restrict her to one of the roles is a shame, and not least because Eva Lind's squeaky Olympia and Jessye Norman's grande dame of an Antonia are respectively inadequate and inappropriate in the other two. Francisco Araiza's Hoffmann also lacks charisma; Samuel Ramey is vocally impressive in the bass roles. Jeffrey Tate conducts. The set may still yield some interest, however. It uses new material from an edition of the score that is currently in preparation, which will utilise music found in Offenbach's sketches. The additions and excisions that have been practised here are by no means uniformly successful: the opera takes an age to get started and then finishes very abruptly. We are still feeling our way to a version which might be as true as possible to Offenbach's intentions and this is the latest step in that direction. The new recording of Poulenc's Dialogues des Carmelites also marks a step forwards, in this case towards securing for the opera a future at all. There are few chances to catch this piece in the theatre: the opera may be easy on the ear (Poulenc was happy to clothe his religious scores in lasciviously sensual harmonies) but it is not easy on the intellect. This is a drama of the mind: a good opera, in fact, to listen to on disc. It is set in a Carmelite convent during the French revolution, but all contact with the outside world is shut off by the thick convent walls. Inside, the nuns find themselves facing death, some through old age, others because of the political turmoil, and the opera shows us the different feelings with which they go to meet their end. Some go in fear, others see it as the road to glory; one rejects her faith, another finally embraces it. There are a lot of good roles and the new recording (only the opera's second) is well cast. Catherine Dubosc as Blanche, the fearful novice, heads a roll-call which includes many of the finest French-speaking singers of the day, including Martine Dupuy as the hard Mere Marie, Rita Gorr as the wise Old Prioress, Jose Van Dam and Francois le Roux. Only Rachel Yakar's New Prioress is a disappointment vocally. The set is based on live performances in Lyon, conducted with evident sympathy by Kent Nagano. The recording quality is exemplary, the best of the month's selection. Finally to Maria Callas. To mark 15 years since the soprano's death, EMI has issued a new recital disc, featuring a few rare live recordings from her early years (exciting Mozart and Rossini) and some rather sad alternative takes from the later ones. The company may be scraping the barrel, but with Callas the dregs can still be as good as another singer's champagne. And what a range of music] With her vocal ability to shine in roles of so many guises, whatever operas might she be recording, if she were alive now? Verdi: La traviata.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The race for the presidency of Colombia between  two candidates, Ernesto Samper and Andres Pastrana, is fairly  close, according to EL TIEMPO's latest poll, conducted by the  CNC [National Survey Center].    Samper would win the first and second rounds, based on  responses of people who intend to vote. But of the total  respondents surveyed, Pastrana would win the first round, with a  tie in the second round.    In comparing these results with the EL TIEMPO poll conducted  by Yankelovich in September 1993, the same trend is evident.  Three months ago Pastrana was winning the first round among the  total number polled by 1.2 points, while in the second round the  two candidates would each win 38.3 percent of the votes.    In the same way, among people who said they intend to vote,  which at that time was 57 percent of the total number polled,  Samper led Pastrana by 0.7 percent.    Now, of the total number polled, 39 percent think Pastrana  is  going to be the next president, followed by Samper with 38  percent.    Those who said they are going to vote think Colombia's next  president is going to be Ernesto Samper, by a three-point  difference.    These results show that the race between Samper and Pastrana  is a real neck-to-neck contest, as the poll has a 3-percent  margin of error for the total population.    The poll results show without a doubt that Andres Pastrana  and Ernesto Samper would be chosen as their party's presidential  candidate, both in the liberal primary and in a conservative  primary, if the conservatives decided to hold one.  <H5>  Voters and Nonvoters </H5>   Of the total population, over half the people polled said  they intend to vote in the next elections; 64 percent are now  registered.    Of this group who intend to vote in the next presidential  election, 89 percent always intended to vote for the same  candidate, while 9 percent had thought of voting for someone  else.    In the total population, 19 percent are still undecided  about  whether or not they will vote.  <H5>  Age and Sex </H5>   In breaking down the population by sex, age, and  socio-economic level, the results among the total number polled  show that Pastrana would get more votes from women than men,  while Samper would receive more votes from men than from women.    In terms of age, the majority of Pastrana's votes would come  from people between 18 and 39, while the majority of Samper's  votes would come from people over 25.    In terms of socio-economic level, classified for the  purposes  of this poll as lower, middle, and upper, both candidates would  get most of their votes from the middle class, followed by the  upper class. A difference was found among voters from the lower  socio-economic group, where more people intend to vote for  Samper.  <H5>  How the Total of Poll Respondents Would Vote </H5>   If the liberal primary were tomorrow, for which of these candidates would  you vote?

When compared with the May and September polls, these  figures  show that the president's ratings have improved in both aspects.    In May, 34.5 percent approved of his performance; in  September, 47.1 percent, and in December, his approval rating  was 53 percent.    The president's positive image rose from 15.1 percent in May  to 31.2 percent in September, and to 33 percent in December.    In the latest poll, 14 percent have a poor image of the  president and 38 percent disapprove of his performance.    On the nation's situation, 59 percent describe it as  average,  33 percent as bad, and 8 percent as good.  <H5>  The Government's Image </H5>  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |How Would You Describe the Nation's Situation Today?                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Bad                      |Good                     |Average                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |33%                      |8%                       |59%                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |What is your opinion of President Gaviria right now?                       |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Bad               |Good              |Average           |Do not know; did  |  |                  |                  |                  |not answer        |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |14%               |33%               |52%               |2%                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Do you approve of how the president is doing his job?                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Approve                  |Disapprove               |Do not know; did not ans-|  |                         |                         |wer                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |53%                      |38%                      |9%                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  How the Poll Was Conducted </H5>   EL TIEMPO hired Yankelovich of Colombia which, as it is now  working for the Andres Pastrana campaign, subcontracted the  poll, with EL TIEMPO's permission, to the National Survey Center.    The telephone poll was conducted among 1,298 persons in  Bogota, Medellin, Cali, Barranquilla, Bucaramanga, Cartagena,  and Santa Marta, from middle, lower, and upper socio-economic  levels.    In all, 589 men and 700 women between 18 and 65 were  surveyed.    The poll's margin of error is 3 percent.</p>

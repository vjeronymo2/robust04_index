			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Books: The frontiersman of American poetry WALT WHITMAN: From Noon to Starry Night by Philip Callow Allison and Busby Pounds 19.99, 394 pages WHITMAN is a curious figure in literary history. He stands on the indeterminate border between greatness and absurdity, his work a mixture of extraordinary genius and mere bombast. Philip Callow has performed a service in helping us to understand Whitman. The inexorably rolling periods of Whitman's chief poetic work, Leaves of Grass, make better sense when we learn that it is modelled on opera; it is, Callow suggests, a collection of arias and recitatives, made for utterance in the grand theatrical manner because its subject is itself grand and theatrical: human destiny; the energy of America, America's prairies, vast skies and burgeoning cities. Whitman himself becomes explicable when we see him selfconsciously rising to a challenge facing the US in its boisterous 19th-century adolescence: the need for a national poet. Many had called for this; Alexis de Tocqueville, when visiting America, noted the absence of a major poet; Ralph Waldo Emerson yearned for one; the press called for a 'Homer of the mass' to arise. At the age of 36, after years of miscellaneous drifting, Whitman discovered himself to be that Homer. Whitman was born on long Island in 1819, one among the large family of a bibulous carpenter and his Dutch wife. He left school early and was apprenticed to a printer, graduating to journalism after spells as a teacher in various rural schools. Because of the proliferation of newspapers in New York, and the hectic warfare of political factions, Whitman found plenty of journalistic work. His first editorial appointment came in his early twenties. The New York tuppenny sheets were not unlike our own odiferous tabloids, but Whitman relished his task, particularly the preaching and opining which the customary high-moralising style of Victorian editorials demanded. In his poetry Whitman appears as a frontiersman, a fearless traverser of prairies, rejoicing in health and independence. In fact he made few journeys beyond the environs of New York: the longest being to New Orleans where he worked for several months. Despite wishing to take a romantic view of America's splendours, he found the Mississippi merely muddy: and the bone-rattling rigours of stagecoach travel disagreeable. But all he needed was a hint. In his poems the vastness of America unfolds cinematically, and Whitman hymns the promise and beauty of mountains, lakes, rivers, cities and people as if he knew everything about each one of them personally. It is a mystery how Leaves of Grass sprang from Whitman in 1855: given the undistinguished character of his preceding writings. He published it at his own expense, and promoted it by anonymously contributing glowing reviews to newspapers. He need not have done so; Emerson was ravished by the book and other eminent critics agreed. Praise was not, however, unanimous, and many readers found it obscene. But once it was launched, Whitman's name was made. The book went through many editions, with Whitman adding to it and changing it constantly. The largest single addition is the sequence of poems called Drum Taps, recording Whitman's Civil War experiences as a visitor to victims of battle in Washington's hospitals. Despite the deep emotion of these poems, they are not in the same class as the centrepiece of Leaves of Grass, the extraordinary Song of Myself. Whitman saw himself as the spokesman of that new human phenomenon, the American individual, a robust and democratic free spirit striding into a confident future. The 'I' of the poems is this overflowing character, embracing as a birthright everything good in life: sex, joy, independence, the wild woods and the comradeship of man. There is much beauty in Whitman's poetry, but it can also be pompous and bathetic. Whitman spent his last years paralysed by strokes, living modestly in a grimy New Jersey suburb. His reputation grew steadily, and among those who read and admired him were Swinburne, Yeats and DH Lawrence - even, Callow tells us, Vincent van Gogh in Arles. With his flowing white hair and beard he looked to one visitor like 'a great old Angora Tom'. To the last he kept his secrets: was he homosexual? What were his real views of slavery? Callow, if he knows, keeps us guessing; but at the same time gives us a compelling portrait of the poet and his place and time.</p>

			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> LIBEL SUIT AGAINST REGISTER IS UPHELD  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge refused Thursday to dismiss a libel suit by Harbor  Municipal Judge Calvin P. Schmidt against the Orange County Register and two  reporters over their coverage of a sex and influence scandal.  </P> <P> Register attorney Duffern H. Helsing argued that the lawsuit should be declared  legally flawed because Schmidt did not allege that the newspaper had actual  malice when it published a series of stories about him in 1988 and 1989.  </P> <P> But Superior Court Judge William F. Rylaarsdam said the lawsuit may stand  because Schmidt's contention that the newspaper knew it was publishing false  information is tantamount to an allegation of actual malice.  </P> <P> The Register articles that prompted the lawsuit detailed an investigation of  Schmidt by the state Commission on Judicial Performance, a judicial watchdog  agency. He was under scrutiny for various forms of alleged misconduct,  including giving lenient treatment to two prostitutes in exchange for sex.  </P> <P> Last December, the commission rebuked Schmidt for giving preferential treatment  to a wealthy friend's stepdaughter and making improper campaign contributions  but cleared him of the accusation that he did legal favors for a prostitute.  The commission never lodged a formal disciplinary charge against Schmidt over  his dealings with the other prostitute.  </P> <P> Another Harbor Court judge, Brian R. Carter, was also targeted in disciplinary  proceedings by that agency for similar allegations, but that inquiry was  dropped when he retired from the bench in February, 1989.  </P> <P> Named as defendants along with the Register are the two reporters who wrote  many of the articles: Dan Weikel, who has since joined The Times Orange County  Edition, and Donna Wares, a Register reporter. The Register has said it  believes that the lawsuit is without merit.  </P> <P> Details of the Harbor Court investigation were reported in several newspapers,  including The Times.

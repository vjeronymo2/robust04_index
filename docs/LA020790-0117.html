			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADS: GOOD OR BAD?  </P> <P> Question: There have been a lot of negative comments about advertising, but one  of the positive things about it is that it has encouraged my children to ask  for specific foods that I believe are good for them. For example, they will ask  for a certain brand of cereaL that I suppose is healthy.  </P> <P> Isn't that positive?  </P> <P> Answer: I would much rather have children learn about the factors that make a  food nutritious, rather than have them learn a brand name. The most popular  brand of cereal, which may be the brand most heavily advertised, is not  necessarily the most nutritious.  </P> <P> Moreover, while some children may learn about cereals through advertising,  others may become as familiar with the brand names of candy, cookies, and  potato chips. I don't think we can rely on advertising to educate our children  about nutrition; the primary responsibility is still the parents'.  </P></p>

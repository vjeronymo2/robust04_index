			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Russian ship held by Estonia ESTONIAN border guards have seized a Russian navy-support ship inside Estonia's territorial waters, and have been holding it for over 24 hours, officials said yesterday, AP reports from Moscow. The Russian hydrographic ship was removing buoys from Estonia's Paarnu Bay when it was seized on Wednesday night, a spokesman for Estonia's border guards said, 'because its actions had not been co-ordinated with the Estonian authorities'. The head of the Commonwealth of Independent States naval press centre in Moscow said the ship was part of the Russian-controlled Baltic Sea Fleet. Crew members had been taking measurements when the boat was boarded by armed Estonian border guards. It was still being held late yesterday, in spite of Estonian assurances it had been released. The Baltfax news agency said Estonia's border guards and Maritime Administration had agreed to release the ship yesterday morning on condition it replaced the buoys it had removed. Hydrographic vessels belong to the navy but are usually manned by civilians and have about 15-20 crew members.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh, March 28 (AFP) -- The ultra-nationalist  Khmer Rouge said Monday it was willing to work for a negotiated  settlement of Cambodia's civil conflict after the fall of its  "capital," Pailin, to government forces last week.    "We are going work for a negotiated settlement," in Sopheap,  a representative for the guerrillas in Phnom Penh, told AFP.    The comments contrasted with a combative statement made  earlier Monday by Khmer Rouge radio.    The Khmer Rouge representative could not confirm rumors  circulating here that the guerrillas' nominal leader, Khieu  Samphan, would soon be arriving in Phnom Penh.    Cambodia's co-Prime Minister, Hun Sen, told AFP Monday that  the government "left the door open" to negotiations with the  Khmer Rouge.    Cambodian government forces launched a major offensive  against Khmer Rouge-held territories early this month either to  flush out the guerrillas or force them to the negotiating table.    The government, elected under UN-sponsored elections in May  1993, wants to take back full control of the country to  establish stability and enhance international investment and  spur the economy.    The Khmer Rouge has demanded representation in the  government, but has refused to give up its weapons or cede areas  under its control, which are mostly along the border with  Thailand.    Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk, who was treated for cancer  in Beijing the last six months, is expected to return to Phnom  Penh April 8 and hopes to restart negotiations with the Khmer  Rouge, said the country's foreign minister, Prince Norodom  Sirivut.    The negotiations were suspended in mid-January, but Hun Sen  added, "Our position has not changed. We are keeping the door  open. We are also thinking of the possibility of a meeting when  the king (Sihanouk) returns."    Hun Sen said: "The Royal Cambodian Government is ready to  join the discussions."    But a representative of the "hardline" anti-Khmer Rouge  faction said, "I am not sure if the (Khmer Rouge) problem can be  resolved."    The offensive against Pailin was decided in concert with the  Sihanoukists, represented in the government by Prince Norodom  Ranaridh, co-prime minister, and supporters of Hun Sen.    Hun Sen said, citing military sources, that former Khmer  Rouge chieftain Pol Pot, who still controls the guerrilla  movement of 8,000 soldiers despite his official retirement, was  with the group's leaders in the village of Kum Reang, a few  kilometers (miles) north of Pailin, during the government  offensive.    "They left two days before the fall of Pailin," he said,  without saying where they were headed. Pailin, the Khmer Rouge  stronghold near Thailand, fell on March 19, according to the  government, or March 22, witnesses at the scene said.    Khmer Rouge leaders have veiled themselves in almost total  secrecy since the group's founding in the early 1960s.    About 85 Khmer Rouge soldiers were killed in the defense of  Pailin, Phnom Penh said. Government losses, without official  estimates, are estimated at several dozen killed or wounded.    Pailin, rich in rubies, has helped finance the rebel  movement  since 1989 with contracts from the Thai business community.</p>

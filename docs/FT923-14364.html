			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bartering for the riches of cash-starved Turkmenistan - Steve Levine on the economically-backward republic's efforts to capitalise on its wealth of resources A COUPLE of dozen western businessmen gathered last month in what must have been the unlikeliest site in the former Soviet Union for a sales exhibition, and at the end they had one, unanimous opinion. 'They don't have any money,' says Mr Ian Forrester, managing director of the Kent-based food company Healthyfood Marketing, one of the disappointed participants in the week-long exhibition. The westerners were attracted mostly by talk of Turkmenistan's coming riches. The most discussed subject was its 10 trillion (million million) cubic metres of proven natural gas reserves. About 85bn cu m - worth about Dollars 6bn at present prices - is extracted annually. Initial engineering has also begun on a Dollars 1bn Italian proposal for a refinery to exploit Turkmenistan's oil reserves. The republic has 213m tonnes of proven oil reserves, according to the government, and is producing 5m tonnes of oil and condensate a year. 'This country is richer than Qatar,' claims a senior diplomat. The trouble is that so far little of this wealth has translated into cash for the 4m people of this Central Asian backwater that borders Afghanistan and Iran to the south and the Caspian Sea to the west. 'The only way these people will do business is with barter,' says Mr Forrester, who plans to barter his product for another of Turkmenistan's natural resources, dried fruit and nuts. 'And while others won't, we will barter. These fruits and nuts are the basic components of the products we are producing anyway.' Mr Forrester is discussing a deal in which his muesli breakfast food product of raisins, nuts and other dried fruit could be manufactured in Turkmenistan, slowly and cheaply at first. The goal would be eventually to develop a new market for the cereal, which at present has a turnover of just Dollars 4m a year. In contrast to the Slavic and Baltic states, business in former Soviet Central Asia has evolved slowly since the superpower broke up. Other than in Kazakhstan, there is no private enterprise to speak of. Decisions are made almost solely in the president's office. President Saparmurad Niyazov, for example, recently declared that there could be no private sale of apartments or homes for another 10 years. And, for now, the Turkmen government is talking only in terms of joint ventures with foreign companies rather than allowing them to buy whole plants or concessions, says Mr Abdi Kuliev, the foreign minister. 'There are people now who have enough money to buy all state property. But we don't want to let them buy it. That's why we want joint ventures - to control both sides.' Until the republic became independent with the Soviet Union's collapse in December, Moscow exploited Central Asia largely as a resource store, carting away cotton, natural gas, oil, silk and gold to factories in Russia and other republics. So the Asian republics are now starting largely from scratch economically, and indeed are virtually broke. The situation is not helped by the resistance of their authoritarian leaders, steeped in centuries of feudal history in addition to the 70 years of communism, to anything less than complete control of every undertaking. In Turkmenistan, there is money to be made - if one can get to President Niyazov to talk about it. Much of the money will probably be earned from the natural gas deposits. The trouble for Turkmenistan is that most of the natural gas until recently went to Russia and the Ukraine; only about 20bn cu m could be exported elsewhere. Because of a dispute over Turkmenistan's decision to start charging former Soviet republics hard currency for its gas the government has shut off the pipeline to the Ukraine and is looking elsewhere for customers. Unfortunately that pipeline is just about the only way to transport the gas anywhere. Turkey, Iran and Turkmenistan have signed what one diplomat describes as a 'gentlemen's agreement' to build a Dollars 3bn natural gas pipeline from Turkmenistan, across Iran and into Turkey. But that deal is on hold for now. As Turkey and Iran are in fierce competition for influence in Central Asia, the Iranian government is reported to be less than fully co-operative in getting the deal finalised. Moreover, international bankers are thought to be worried about Tehran's reliability as a business partner. 'If there is trouble, Iran could just turn off the pipeline,' says one Asian businessman who operates in Turkmenistan. Another proposal is to add value to the gas by building a petrochemical plant to produce liquefied natural gas, some of which could be shipped to Kazakhstan, Iran or Turkey to make polymers. One businessman who is optimistic about opportunities in Turkmenistan is Mr Paul Aouizerate, the 28-year-old president of Alpax, the Paris-based company that sponsored the exhibition. He is comparing Turkmenistan to Kuwait a few decades ago. Turkmenistan has a few other enthusiastic supporters as well, but most of them see in it something to watch and deal with carefully. 'To compare Kuwait and Turkmenistan, well, I could compare a donkey and a duck, but I would not try to eat a donkey, nor ride a duck,' says Mr Daniel Perrin, director general of the French company Amca Chimie et Plastiques. For the present creative barter seems almost the only way to go. Rome-based Tecnologie Progetti Lavori has signed a Dollars 250m deal to build a 100,000 sq m textile plant at Ashkabad, Turkmenistan's capital. The contract, by far the largest Turkmenistan has concluded with a foreign company, was endorsed personally by President Niyazov. The state-owned plant, under construction 5 km (3 miles) south of the city centre, is to be finished by October 1994. Initially it is to produce terry cloth and, eventually, clothes, according Mr Pierre Stainier of TPL. Payment is complex, he says. TPL is to receive the hard-currency equivalent of its fee in cotton. But, under to the deal, Turkmenistan is to 'convert' the cotton to hard currency itself by selling it abroad, then hand over the proceeds to TPL. Turkmenistan produces 1.4m tonnes of cotton a year, until now using all but 300,000 tonnes at home. The cotton itself is a guarantee of eventual payment. 'Sometimes we've had to stop construction because they've been slow paying us. But then they do pay us, and we begin building again,' Mr Stainier says. TPL has now begun moving earth in a desert site 300 km north-east of Ashkabad, near the Amu Darya River, for a proposed Dollars 1bn oil refinery. The plant, 2 km long and 1 km wide, will provide Turkmenistan's first opportunity to produce petrol for export. Only the engineering stage has been agreed to so far. If the government agrees to a construction contract, the two sides will probably employ a barter arrangement - based on refined crude - for payment, Mr Stainer says.</p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIRM ORDERED TO PRODUCE WORKER SAFETY VIDEO  </P> <P> A year after one of its employees was killed in a cargo handling accident, a  Wilmington container company has been ordered to produce a bilingual worker  safety video in the hope it will help reduce injuries and deaths in one of the  nation's most dangerous industries.  </P> <P> The sentence, imposed this week in Los Angeles Municipal Court against Martin  Container Services Inc., is similar to others issued around the country that  emphasize preventive rather than punitive actions, according to federal safety  officials and local prosecutors.  </P> <P> In the Wilmington case, Martin Container Services was placed on three years'  probation and ordered to produce the video for the container industry after the  company pleaded no contest to three violations of the state Labor Code. The  violations stem from the death on April 28, 1989, of Adrian Sanchez Jacinto,  21, a welder from Long Beach who was crushed by a 5,000-pound container that  fell from a forklift.  </P></p>

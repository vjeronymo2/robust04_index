			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CARWASH SUPPORTERS TO 'FAX WACHS';  </P> <P> MONUMENT ADVOCATES DIAL LAST-DITCH APPEAL TO COUNCILMAN  </P> <P> Studio City leaders hope electronics can keep their save-the-carwash campaign  from bursting like an overblown soap bubble.  </P> <P> Residents said they will set up a facsimile machine at the carwash counter on  Monday so carwash supporters can ask Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs to  use his influence to get the structure designated a city cultural monument.  </P> <P> Studio City residents have pressed for the monument designation as a way of  delaying demolition of the carwash and a Unocal gas station and Tiny Naylor's  coffee shop by a developer who wants to build a $15-million mini-mall at the  corner of Ventura and Laurel Canyon boulevards.  </P> <P> Wachs, whose council district includes the corner, is chairman of the council's  Recreation, Library and Cultural Affairs Committee.  </P> <P> That committee oversees the city's Cultural Affairs Department, whose Cultural  Heritage Commission on Wednesday rejected a bid to designate the carwash as a  cultural landmark.  </P> <P> "We're starting the 'Fax Wachs' program," Jack McGrath, the carwash campaign's  organizer, said Friday. "It will be instantaneous democracy."  </P> <P> Hours after the commission's 4-0 vote, McGrath urged Wachs to ignore the  commission action and ask council colleagues to approve the cultural  designation anyway.  </P> <P> Wachs said late Friday he did not know what he will do.  </P> <P> "I haven't really decided," he said. "I'll talk to a few people next week and  review the commission testimony. I'll talk to both sides before coming to a  conclusion."  </P> <P> Greg Nelson, one of Wachs' chief deputies, said his staff was researching a  series of questions about the carwash that the councilman raised Friday. The  primary one is whether Wachs can legally take up the issue.  </P> <P> Carwash supporter Walter McIntyre said he tested the "Wachs Fax" on Friday by  sending a letter to the councilman that characterized the carwash's  55-foot-tall boomerang-shaped tower as "an above-ground time capsule" that  could be used to illustrate the 1950s to Studio City residents in the 2050s.  </P> <P> A landmark designation would delay demolition of the carwash for up to one  year. McIntyre said that would give the community time to come up with a way of  incorporating the carwash, gas station and coffee shop into developer Ira  Smedra's proposed two-story Laurel Promenade project.  </P> <P> "Council members pay attention to what's going on in their districts. I'm  optimistic," McGrath said.  </P></p>

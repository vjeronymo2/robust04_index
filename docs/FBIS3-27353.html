			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "990 Morning News" program] </F>   [Text] In deliberating the municipal government's work  report during a panel discussion with people's congress deputies  from Nanshi District yesterday afternoon [19 February], Deputy  Wu Bangguo, member of the CPC Central Committee's Political  Bureau and secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee,  once again reiterated: We must cherish and firmly seize  opportunities. Our comrades should always bear in mind Comrade  Xiaoping's dictum that development is the last word. In  discussing this year's work, deputies asked whether  deficit-ridden, district-owned collective enterprises should be  allowed to declare bankruptcy. Wu Bangguo noted: Some small  district-owned enterprises may be sold to individuals in a  step-by-step manner, whereas enterprises incurring substantial  losses may be allowed to go bankrupt. We must, however,  approach this matter very prudently.    When deputies from educational circles discussed educational  issues, Wu Bangguo said: It is not easy to undertake  educational service. Shanghai now suffers an acute shortage of  skilled personnel; the training of skilled personnel in demand  brooks no delay.    Wu Bangguo exhorted: While maintaining Shanghai's strong  momentum for economic development, we should earnestly solve  several problems of concern to the people. First, we should  ensure that shopping baskets are filled, stabilize and develop  production bases of nonstaple foodstuffs, actively develop  agriculture with distinctive features, and improve commodity  distribution. Second, we should heed issues relating to  state-owned enterprises, especially those pertaining to  deficit-ridden enterprises. Properly dealing with enterprises  making meager profits or incurring losses not only affects  Shanghai's economic development but also the vital interests of  many workers. We should be determined to solve these problems.  Third, we should resettle [words indistinct]. Fourth, we  should show concern for people's lives and earnestly solve the  problems of low-wage workers regarding their livelihoods.</p>

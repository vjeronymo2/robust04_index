			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA '90), Public Law 101&hyph;508, enacted on November 5, 1990, made additional changes to both the mandatory and optional groups of pregnant women, infants, and children. OBRA '90 created a new group of mandatory categorically needy children who are at least age 6 but have not yet reached age 19. These are children born after September 30, 1983 with family income at or below 100 percent of the Federal poverty level. OBRA '90 made corresponding changes to the mandatory eligibility group of qualified children to include children born after September 30, 1983 who have not attained age 19 and to allow States to use an earlier date of birth in order to include older children sooner than is mandated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, OBRA '90 mandated that a State provide continuous eligibility to pregnant women throughout the pregnancy and postpartum period without regard to changes in income. (This had been a State option.) OBRA '90 also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changed the requirement for newborns who are deemed to be eligible as a result of their mothers' eligibility status. Previously, a newborn was considered eligible at birth if the newborn's mother was eligible for and receiving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid. The newborn could remain eligible for as long as a year if the mother remained eligible and the infant was a member of the mother's household. With the OBRA '90 change, a newborn may still remain eligible for as long as a year if the mother loses eligibility but would remain eligible if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> she were pregnant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, OBRA '90 made several changes to presumptive eligibility for pregnant women by eliminating the existing time limit on the presumptive period and allowing a pregnant woman to remain presumptively eligible until the State makes a determination on her regular application for Medicaid or,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if she does not file a regular application, the last day of the month following the month in which she was determined presumptively eligible. OBRA '90 also provided that the application given to a presumptively eligible pregnant woman could be the application used by the State to determine the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regular Medicaid eligibility of low-income pregnant women under section 1902(1)(1)(A).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This document proposes to incorporate provisions of OBRA '86, '87, '89, and '90, the Homeless Eligibility Clarification Act, MCCA, and FSA in the Medicaid regulations, as outlined and discussed in the following section of this document. (Additional related provisions in these laws are being addressed in separate rulemaking documents.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Discussion of Legislative Provisions and Proposed Amendments to Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Low-Income Pregnant Women, Infants, and Children  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 9401 of OBRA '86 amended the Social Security Act by adding new sections 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX) and 1902(1) to establish optional categorically needy groups of pregnant women and women during the 60-day period beginning on the last day of pregnancy, infants, and children up to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> age 5 whose income does not exceed a State-established standard that is a specified percentage of the Federal nonfarm poverty income guidelines. Under OBRA '86, a State could establish this income standard at a level at or below  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 100 percent of the Federal poverty guidelines. A State had to cover both pregnant women and infants (it could not cover either group separately) and it had to cover both of these groups in order to cover children.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OBRA '86 also amended section 1902(e) to provide that States that have chosen to cover infants and children under section 1902(1) must continue to cover those infants and children under certain circumstances. Under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1902(e)(7), if the infants and children are receiving covered inpatient services at the time they reach the age limits under the State plan, the State must cover them until the end of their inpatient stay if they remain otherwise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible. Also, OBRA '86 specifically exempted the group of individuals described in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX) from the limits on family income which affect a State's Federal financial participation (FFP) under section 1903(f)(4) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Later legislation changed the age limit for children and the percentage of the poverty level for the income standard. Specifically, section 4101(c) of OBRA '87 raised the maximum age for low-income children from age 5 up to age  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Section 4101(a)(1) of OBRA '87 increased the percentage of the poverty guidelines at which the income standard could be set to 185 percent for pregnant women and infants under age 1, effective July 1, 1988. However, for children age 1 up to age 8, section 4101 retained the percentage level at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no more than 100 percent of the Federal poverty guidelines (or, if the State had chosen to cover pregnant women and infants with a percentage of income below 100 percent, the percentage for children had to equal the percentage used for the pregnant women and infants). Section 4118 of OBRA '87 also removed the reference to ``nonfarm'' in the description of the Federal poverty income guidelines to be used. In addition, section 4101(d) of OBRA '87 amended section 1916 of the Act to allow States to charge a premium to optional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> groups of low-income pregnant women and infants who have family incomes above a specified level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

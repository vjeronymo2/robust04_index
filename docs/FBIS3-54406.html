It heard two detailed reports by the supply and  health ministers.    In light of this and in reply to a question posed by the  JORDAN NEWS AGENCY on this issue, the acting prime minister said  that the government, since it was formed, has been working to  serve the citizen and to provide him with the best health, food,  and environmental conditions. He added: The food and medicine  control process has always been continuous and active. However,  there are some gaps and complications, and some times there are  conflicts between powers that encouraged certain people to  exploit this control process.    Some time ago, the Health Ministry began work to achieve the  highest degree of health and preventive guarantees. The health  minister's remarks fall within this framework.    Dr. Abu-Nuwar added: Redressing the health and medicine  situation and checking for negligence and attempts to tamper  with this situation is a basic issue. The government will  accept no violation or negligence in this regard. The  government will not excuse anyone and will take every possible  measure to deter violators. To guarantee this, the Council of  Ministers has decided to form two ministerial committees. The  first committee will discuss food affairs and is chaired by the  supply minister. Specialized experts will be included as members  of this committee, whose task is to discuss the food issue,  including importing, transporting, storing, distributing, and  pricing foodstuffs. The second committee will discuss medicine  affairs and is chaired by the health minister. It will discuss  the medicine issue, including its fitness for human consumption,  as well as importing, controlling, and pricing medicines. The  two ministerial committees will submit their report to the  Council of Ministers as soon as possible.    The acting prime minister stressed that Jordan is a country  that attaches great importance to safeguarding the citizen's  health and preventing all exports that do not meet Jordanian and  international food and medicine standards and specifications.    The acting prime minister said: The government appreciates  the concern of the majority of our honest merchants for the  interests of the citizen and the homeland, as well as that of  the majority of workers in the health field. However, it will  never tolerate any violation, exploitation, or any attempt to  tamper with the citizen's health, food, and medicine security,  which is happening among a very limited segment of workers in  this important field.    The government has already begun work on a host of legal and  administrative measures to meet and achieve these important  objectives in order to upgrade the level of health control on  food and medicine in the service of the citizen and the homeland.</p>

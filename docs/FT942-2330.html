			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Observer: Really smelly Brazil's long-awaited new currency - the real - is designed to kill inflation and inspire pride. But it's got off to a poor start. A bag of reals was found in a rubbish bin in the capital, Brasilia. The money, in the form of apparently genuine new 1 Real coins - equal in value to Dollars 1 - was found by a couple of scavengers combing through a rubbish heap. They spent some of the cash to pay off debts and buy cigarettes and alcohol - even though the currency is not legal tender until July 1 - and were caught when they tried to deposit the remaining coins at a local bank. Brazil's inflation has eaten up four other currencies since 1986. It is therefore customary to find old notes in the bin; though a trifle unusual to find them there before they have even been launched.</p>

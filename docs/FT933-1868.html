			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Geneva officials see hope for Gatt THE EC decision not to reopen the Blair House deal on farm subsidies with the US was greeted with relief by trade negotiators, who said the way was now clear to complete the Uruguay Round of world trade talks by the end of the year. 'On balance, the outcome must be positive for the Round,' said one trade diplomat. 'The EC has avoided a crisis, and there was no commitment to back down from the Blair House accord.' The farm trade agreement, although it has not yet been extended to all 116 nations taking part in the Round, underpins crucial negotiations taking place in Geneva on opening markets to imported farm goods. These talks are seen as vital to acceptance of the Uruguay Round package by a large number of agricultural exporting nations, especially in Latin America. Diplomats discounted threats from Paris that a veto might again be brandished if Washington fails to respond adequately when Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, presents French concerns to his US counterpart, Mr Mickey Kantor, next week. 'I think people now have an interest in letting the Geneva negotiations continue,' said one, pointing out that some 'clarifications and additions' as demanded by the French could well come through the process of 'multilateral-ising' the Blair House agree-ment. Elsewhere, negotiators have reported 'very good progress' in talks on improving market access for services. For goods, progress has been slower but countries are 'fully engaged'.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yu. Koltsov, candidate for people's deputy of </F> Ukraine for Electoral District 34: "And, As a Result, What?"]    [Text] The president of Crimea appeared on Crimean  television two days prior to the elections on 27 March 1994,  splitting his speech into two parts: an official part and,  appended to it, "the position simply of a citizen of Crimea."    The official part expressed hostility toward elections in  Crimea of people's deputies of Ukraine, and he said plainly in  the "unofficial" part that he would not participate in this  ballot and would take his ballot paper away with him. This was  what 18 percent of the electorate did in Feodosiya, following  the president's example.    And, as a result, what?    These events are quite serious and wide-ranging. It is  impossible to step over them without making an attempt to  comprehend this.    Unfortunately, the president does not see the need for the  creation of a "support group" of deputies from Crimea in the  Ukrainian parliament. A candidate for deputy of Ukraine from  Sevastopol, who had come from the Baltic, points out directly in  this connection that the "Russian speakers" also decided there  formerly to boycott the parliamentary elections and paid a cruel  price for this.    A powerful "counterrecoil" on the part of the western  oblasts, where 85-90 percent of the population goes to the polls  and elects at the first attempt fierce supporters of a  strengthening of Ukraine's "independence" who see Crimea's  policy only as "separatism that needs to be suppressed," can be  seen at the present elections in Ukraine.    In this atmosphere in the parliament of Ukraine, does Crimea  not need a "first line of defense" in the form of its own  deputies, who would oppose the adoption of extreme decisions?    The president of Crimea quite recently supported the  Kuchma-Grinev bloc uniting antinationalist forces in Southeast  Ukraine. The bloc, which assembles judicious social forces in  Ukraine, is being countered by Kiev officialdom, which is why a  complex situation is taking shape. And under these difficult  conditions the president of Crimea in fact changes his former  position and does not consider it necessary to form a cohesive  group of Crimean deputies in the parliament of Ukraine  reinforcing the Kuchma-Grinev bloc.    I am inclined to think that in this case the president of  Crimea has occupied a mistaken position, and it was not  supported at the elections: 80 percent of people voted and did  not carry their ballots away with them.    The president's mistake can still be rectified at the second  stage of the elections of deputies of Ukraine, activists of the  Russia bloc being oriented toward support for the candidates for  deputy of Ukraine--participants in the Interregional Reform Bloc  (IRB)--of the Kuchma-Grinev bloc: It is the authors of the  mistaken position who should be rectifying it. Otherwise the  situation will get worse. The president of Crimea could,  perhaps, need 23 Crimean deputies in the parliament of Ukraine  more than as many additional deputies of "his" in the parliament  of Crimea: It is simpler for him to sort things out at home.    I consider it necessary to point all this out not on account  of a desire to "force my way into power": The prospect of  participation in the gloomy squabbles of the parliament of  Ukraine is not particularly inspiring.    But the truth is dearer....</p>

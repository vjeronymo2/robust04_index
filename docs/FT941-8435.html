			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Global bond markets fall sharply on reports of heavy US selling World bond markets fell sharply yesterday afternoon as reports of heavy selling by US investors created nervousness among international investors. 'There was an air of panic in the markets,' said Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International (Europe), describing conditions at one stage as a 'bloodbath'. Stocks were hit on Wall Street by a fall in the US bond market. The activity in Europe was mainly in the futures markets and bond dealers said the main culprits were the US hedge funds - private pools of funds which are managed very aggressively and are highly geared. Such funds were buyers of European government bonds - particularly in the futures market - last year and now appear to be liquidating their positions. Dealers at US securities houses in London said rumours had swept the bond markets of hedge funds being forced to close out their positions in order to stem losses. 'There are rumours that some of the big hedge funds are in trouble because they are highly leveraged players, and they are being forced to liquidate their positions,' said one trader. On Wall Street, longer-dated US Treasury bonds went into a steep fall for a second consecutive session, prompting a sell-off on the share market. Mixed news on inflation made the prospect of a second increase in short-term interest rates loom larger, with Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, set to deliver his twice-yearly Humphrey-Hawkins testimony on monetary policy to a congressional committee next Tuesday. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond climbed to 6.621 per cent, the first time it has broken 6.60 per cent since last July. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 35.18 lower at 3,887.46 on volume of 289m shares. In the UK, analysts said the gilts market had not responded to economic statistics, which pointed to low inflation and subdued growth. Gilt futures closed down nearly 1 1/4 points. Bonds, Page 10</p>

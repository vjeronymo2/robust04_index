			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "My Ministers Will Give All Necessary </F> Assurances to the President"]    [Text] Rome -- "Relations between me and the president are  excellent, they have always been good, we fully cooperate, we  are constantly in touch." Thus [Prime Minister] Silvio  Berlusconi tried to minimize the story of the letter he had  received from the head of state inviting him to guarantee that  all the ministers in his cabinet would comply with institutional  rules. In an interview with GR [Radio News] Director Livio  Zanetti, the prime minister also denied that Scalfaro had named  any of the ministers in particular. Scalfaro's concern,  according to Berlusconi, stemmed from "the possible inclusion in  the ministers' list of personalities who may have given rise to  reservations being expressed by a certain section of the press  and, particularly, by a certain section of the international  press." Berlusconi further explained: "I believe that the  ministers' list has provided the president with the assurances  that he requested from me."    The prime minister then denied the existence of a "[Judge]  Di  Pietro case," following the news of contacts having taken place  -- while the government was in the process of being formed --  between himself and the most famous Clean Hands public  prosecutor. "I kept on reading in the press," Berlusconi said,  "about offers that were actually never made, about negotiations  and talks that had never taken place. I therefore decided to  check the situation personally with Di Pietro." "We had a  friendly, straightforward, honest, pleasant meeting, and that  was it. In my view," he added, "Di Pietro did well to decide to  continue the work that he had started and that he is currently  carrying out."    As for the government's next moves in the economic field,  Berlusconi said that he did not have a "magic wand," but that he  would be aiming, in particular, to revive the public works  sector and to reform the tax system. Concerning foreign policy,  he stressed that his government would not change European policy  in any respect: "We are staunch Europeanists," he asserted.    Finally, having been asked what he intended to do with RAI  [Italian Broadcasting Corporation], he replied: "I will watch  it and listen to it."</p>

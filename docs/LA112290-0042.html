			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ARCHITECTURE: AN ONION TO PEOPLE'S CHOICE PROGRAM;  </P> <P> AWARDS: PREDICTABLE KUDOS AND BARBS ARE DOLED OUT AT THE ANNUAL EVENT.  </P> <P> Something was missing at this year's Orchids &amp; Onions program, the People's  Choice awards of local design.  </P> <P> Maybe it was people. Fewer than 800 seats in the 3,000-seat Civic Theatre were  occupied last Thursday night, and the cavernous space seemed empty. In past  years, 1,200 have attended.  </P> <P> Or maybe it was just the salty spray that the event, now 16 years old, has  thrown off in past years. This year, that bite was watered down when the  program's organizers prevented the jury from awarding a couple of well-deserved  Onions.  </P> <P> And instead of the refreshing directions the program might have taken if the  lay public had been given a significant role, the process has remained too much  under the thumb of the design and planning professionals who run it.  </P> <P> Without the reek of the discarded Onions, jurors were left with several solid  -- but fairly predictable -- winners.  </P> <P> Among the Orchids were the Oceanside Civic Center (designed by architect  Charles Moore with Urban Innovations Group), the San Diego Convention Center  (designed by architect Arthur Erickson with local help from Deems Lewis),  Uptown District in Hillcrest (designed by SGPA Architecture &amp; Planning with  Lorimer Case Architects) and the 103-unit Columbia Place condominiums downtown  (Lorimer Case again).  </P> <P> Onions were given in two areas that had deserved them for years but never  before received them.  </P> <P> Carmel Mountain Ranch, the 3,200-home master-planned community along Interstate  15, with its "endless rows of ticky-tacky boxes" resting atop recklessly graded  landforms, according to the jury, served as a scapegoat for many badly designed  tracts throughout San Diego County.  </P> <P> Coronado was finally chastised for years of negligent planning that led to  high-rises on the beach and the "scraping of charming, older homes to make way  for oversize, under-designed shoeboxes."  </P> <P> But the best of the best and the worst of the worst weren't very daring, and  that's why the show was a bore.  </P> <P> The outlawed Onions would have helped.  </P> <P> One would have gone to an industrial glass box in Carlsbad, as a symbol of  dozens of lousy glass boxes that litter the county; the other to a towering  house in Ocean Beach that looks more like a commercial office building place in  the midst of a residential neighborhood. When jurors drove by, a little girl  was bouncing a ball off its looming back wall -- probably the only redeeming  value of it.  </P> <P> According to awards Chairman Larry Pappas, the glass box award was overruled by  the program's 29-member organizing committee because it wanted the jury to  focus on choosing individual winners from more than 300 nominations, instead of  using one project as a symbol of a larger trend.  </P> <P> The O.B. house represented a more serious derailing of the program's ambition  to serve as a barometer of public taste. The house received 12 Onion  nominations, making it one of the most popular.  </P> <P> "When the program was established, certain by-laws were written that prevent us  from going after one man's castle," said awards chairman Larry Pappas. "I can  appreciate that, but . . . ."  </P> <P> Pappas said the board of directors of the local American Institute of  Architects, which oversees the program, ultimately squelched the O.B. Onion,  adhering to the established policy of not honoring individual homes.  </P> <P> Otherwise, the awards were interesting and well-deserved, if not controversial.  </P> <P> Moore's Oceanside Civic Center was praised for respecting nearby buildings  designed by Irving Gill, for creating a source of civic pride and for  "magnificent fountains (that) provide a refreshing retreat and also help remove  hot air from City Hall." (The fountains serve as part of the projects' cooling  system.)  </P> <P> Since opening last year, the San Diego Convention Center has sparked polar  remarks. Many people love the building itself, but hate the way the massive  structure blocks the waterfront from public views and access.  </P> <P> The O &amp; O jury recognized this by giving the project both an Orchid and an  Onion, honoring its bold architecture and recognizing the unfortunate siting.  </P> <P> Uptown District, the mixed-use project along University Avenue, deserved its  Orchid for respecting the scale and character of the surrounding neighborhood,  but it lacks public art and high-quality storefront designs.  </P> <P> Columbia Place, like other Lorimer Case projects, is a competent but bland  piece of architecture. Its Orchid was given for the way the architects  accommodated the older buildings on the block.  </P> <P> Postmodern architect Michael Graves' only San Diego design -- the Aventine  hotel/office complex in La Jolla -- had jurors at each other's throats. It  received more nominations for Orchids -- and for Onions -- than any other  project.  </P> <P> Although not spelled out during the awards ceremony, jurors meant for the award  to go only to the Hyatt Hotel portion of the project; they considered the  nearby office complex an awkward juxtaposition of forms.  </P> <P> Several jurors lobbied against the Orchid because they didn't approve of such a  large, loud project in a sensitive location, but the Aventine's excellent  detailing and originality carried a majority.  </P> <P> Smaller projects had their place too. Orchids went to the year-old Church of  the Nativity in Fairbanks Ranch, designed by architect Charles Moore with the  firm of Moore Ruble Yudell, to a gem of an underground parking garage at  Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, and to the Bookstar bookstore in Point  Loma, a renovation of the art deco Loma Theatre.  </P> <P> Other Orchids went to murals in Chicano Park south of downtown, and the mural  by artist James Jackson in the lobby of the Symphony Towers high-rise on B  Street downtown; a park-like desiltation pond in Carlsbad; the Anza Borrego  Visitors Center, designed by San Diego architect Robert Ferris and completed in  1978, which blends smoothy with surrounding desert landforms; architect  Jonathan Segal's tiny 7 on Kettner condominium project, a well-designed in-fill  project downtown, and the County Administration Center's dramatic new lighting.  </P> <P> Additional Onions went to a gaudy plastic surgeon's office, the U-Store storage  complex next to Interstate 8 in Alpine, and an awful adobe-electronic community  monument in San Marcos.  </P> <P> "They need to do something different with the program," confessed one juror  after all was said and done. (The jury included six design and planning  professionals and three members from other professions.) "Based on the turnout,  I'd say people are burned out. They should let the jury do more creative kinds  of awarding, and find a way to get the public more involved in the jurying  process."  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CATHEDRAL CITY VOTERS REJECT GAMBLING  </P> <P> Cathedral City voters on Tuesday soundly rejected a proposal to legalize card  room gambling, spoiling Mayor George Hardie's dream of building a card club and  resort on land he owns in the desert community.  </P> <P> Hardie, co-owner of a casino in Los Angeles County, attributed the outcome in  part to residents' "fear of the unknown" and called it "an unfortunate loss"  for the city.  </P> <P> "The people have spoken and I accept their decision," the mayor said. "I'm  going to go on running the city. It's time to put this divisive issue behind  us."  </P> <P> Anti-gambling crusaders, meanwhile, said the results were particularly sweet  given the well-financed campaign mounted by Hardie and his allies.  </P> <P> "We're delirious, we're floating on Cloud 9," said Jack Zachary, a leader of a  group called No Organized Gambling. "Beating the pants off a powerful man like  George Hardie is a real job."  </P> <P> Unofficial totals showed voters defeating by a margin of nearly 2 to 1 a ballot  measure that would have repealed an existing ban on card rooms in the city,  which sits between Palm Springs and Indian Wells. A second measure that would  have established regulations governing the establishments also was defeated by  the same margin.  </P> <P> Tuesday's vote capped a bitterly contested campaign over perhaps the most  controversial issue to confront local residents since Cathedral City  incorporated in 1981.  </P> <P> Proponents were led by Hardie, 55, managing partner of the Bicycle Club casino  in Bell Gardens. Raising nearly $190,000, supporters billed legalized gambling  as economic salvation for a city struggling to provide services for its  mushrooming population.  </P> <P> A study done by the city estimated that the Emerald Court Resort -- the  $25-million card parlor and hotel that Hardie planned to build if the card  clubs were legalized -- would create 600 jobs and generate $604,000 in annual  revenue for Cathedral City.  </P> <P> But opponents, who raised about $45,000, predicted that legalizing gambling  would increase crime, harm property values and deter vacationers.  </P> <P> Inseparable from the debate over gambling was the issue of Hardie's performance  as mayor. Elected in April, 1988 -- about one year after his proposal to build  a card club in Cathedral City was rejected by local leaders -- Hardie has been  attacked by those who say he ran for office merely for personal financial gain.  The mayor denies the charge.  </P> <P> Card rooms are legal in nearly 120 California cities, but a state law passed in  1984 greatly limited the spread of such establishments. That law gave the state  attorney general regulatory power over card parlors and required approval of  local voters before a club could open. Previously, approval of the City Council  was all that was needed.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLEMING TAKES 142-PIN LEAD IN BOWLING  </P> <P> Rene Fleming of Oklahoma City, Okla., never looks at the scoreboard when she's  bowling and it worked to her advantage Tuesday.  </P> <P> While Michelle Mullen of Matteson, Ill., bowled a 300 game, two 280s and a 269,  Fleming concentrated on her fundamentals and threw strikes in more games.  </P> <P> Fleming, a right-hander, averaged 231 a game to take a 142-pin lead over Paula  Drake of Broken Arrow, Okla., in the Ladies Pro Bowlers tour $30,000 Canoga  Park tournament.  </P> <P> "I don't look at the scoreboard because I find it affects my form," Fleming  said. "I used to guide the ball more when I knew I was winning and overpowering  it when I was losing. Now, I just bowl."  </P> <P> Fleming went 12-3-1 in match play, earning 375 bonus points and has a 8,232  total. Drake is second at 8,090 and Mullen third with 8,048. SEAN WATERS  </P></p>

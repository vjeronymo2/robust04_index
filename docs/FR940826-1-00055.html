(c) HCFA considers the facility's total costs, cost finding and apportionment, including its allocation of costs, to determine if costs are properly reported by treatment modality.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Exception requests for a higher training rate are limited to those cost components relating to training such as technical staff, medical supplies, and the special costs of education (manuals and education material) and do not generally include overhead and other indirect costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Documentation: The facility must provide the following information to support its exception request:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A copy of the facility's training program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Computation of the facility's cost per treatment for maintenance sessions and training sessions including an explanation of the cost difference between the two modalities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Class size and patients' training schedules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Number of training sessions required, by treatment modality, to train patients.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Number of patients trained for the current year and the prior 2 years on a monthly basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Projection for the next 12 months of future training candidates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) The number and qualifications of staff at training sessions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Accelerated training exception: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) An ESRD facility may bill Medicare for a dialysis training session only when a patient receives a dialysis treatment (which normally is three times a week).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If an ESRD facility elects to train all its patients using a particular treatment modality more often than during each dialysis treatment and, as a result, the number of its billable training dialysis sessions are reduced, the facility may request a composite rate limited to the lesser of the_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Facility's projected training cost per treatment; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Cost per treatment the facility would have received in training a patient if it had trained patients only during a dialysis treatment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) An ESRD facility may bill a maximum per patient of 25 training sessions for hemodialysis training and 15 training sessions for continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) In computing the payment amount under an accelerated training exception, to ensure adequate patient training, HCFA uses a minimum number of training sessions per patient, (15 for hemodialysis and 5 for CAPD and CCPD) when the facility actually provides fewer than the minimum number of training sessions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) To justify an accelerated training exception request, an ESRD facility must document that all training sessions provided for a particular modality are provided during the shorter but more condensed period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The facility must submit with the exception request a list of patients, by modality, trained during the most recent cost report period, and the list must include each beneficiary's_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

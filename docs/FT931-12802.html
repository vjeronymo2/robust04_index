			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Porsche sees job cuts and further fall in sales PORSCHE faces another bleak year of falling sales and profits, short-time working and job cuts before it breaks even, possibly in 1993-94, Mr Wendelin Wiedeking, the sports car maker's chief executive, said yesterday. Losses in the first half of the current year, to January 31, are expected to total about DM120m (Dollars 75.4m) on sales of just DM800m, he said. Full-year results would be worse than in 1991-92, but he warned against extrapolating from the interim figures since the sports car industry's spring and summer peak sales season had yet to begin. In 1991-92, Porsche lost DM66m on turnover down 13.5 per cent at DM2.7bn. Some 80 per cent of the decline was incurred in Anglo-American markets, he said. Production this year would be cut by between 2,000 and 4,000 cars, he added. The group will make a maximum of 17,000 vehicles, compared with 19,000 in the year to end-July, 1992. Production will be shut for a further 26 days by the end of July after 60 days' short-time in the first half. Job cuts will reduce the workforce, which stood at 8,430 people at the end of the last financial year to about 6,400 by December, 1993. Models would focus on two lines: one in the DM70,000-DM80,000 range and one in the upper price segment.</p>

			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / International Company News: A mission to cut the labours of Hercules - Tom Gossage has been charged with refocusing the US group MR TOM GOSSAGE is a man with a mission. As the new chief executive of Hercules, a rambling chemicals, materials and aerospace conglomerate based in Wilmington, Delaware, he has set two goals. The first is to become cash-positive by 1992. The second is to increase the group's return on equity from 5 per cent to 14 per cent by the end of 1995. His goals will not be easy to achieve. At his first board meeting last January as chief executive, Mr Gossage told his board he had searched the US chemical industry for a company worse than theirs for return on shareholders' capital. He couldn't find one. Hercules's recent past is not one that shareholders remember with fondness. After selling a 40 per cent stake in a polypropylene joint venture to Montedison in 1987, Hercules frittered away the Dollars 1.5bn proceeds, says Mr Gossage. A third disappeared in tax, a third was spent buying back stock, and a third was used to purchase some companies that would help the group escape the cyclical nature of the basic chemicals industry. 'Frankly, the group had been drifting,' admits Mr Gossage. 'There has been no real enhancement of shareholder value. Hercules's efforts to break out of cyclical businesses did not have much success.' To achieve his goals, Mr Gossage is examining every part of the business. 'We are now returning to basics. We will operate where we can be market leaders and we will get out of things we are not good at,' he says. That strategy was put into practice last week when he set up a joint venture with Imcera, the US group, to create the second largest American company in the Dollars 2.6bn flavours and citrus specialities market. This is a sector where Mr Gossage believes Hercules can become market leader. Simultaneously, he also announced the sale of Hercules's Dollars 30m turnover fragrance businesses to an unknown buyer. Mr Gossage says it was a promising business, but one that needed substantial investment that Hercules could not afford. The company is undertaking a widespread and unemotional examination of its business with a view to disposals. Both the polypropylene fibre business and the resins operations could be available for the right price. Although Hercules is continuing to make some investments in polypropylene fibre, a Dollars 170m business providing material for the disposable nappies business, Mr Gossage believes its performance has been unsatisfactory. Similarly, the group's resins business had been 'disappointing', according to Mr Gossage. At the beginning of the year, he told its managers that if there was no improvement the operations would be sold. The staff has been reduced by about half, and the division is far more aggressive about pricing. 'The resins operations can contribute, but I still view their future as questionable. If someone came along with a price above book value I might sell them. We're keeping our options open,' he says. Meanwhile, Mr Gossage is looking for strategic partners for his other divisions. In particular, he is looking at an alliance for the advanced materials operations which is having to reposition itself after the collapse of the US defence market. Previously, the division had been geared mainly towards high-value defence contracts. It is now turning its attention to commercial aircraft projects, such as the Boeing 777, and the sporting goods market. Mr Gossage argues the company now has a simple clear direction. When he visited factories earlier this year, some production supervisors were unable to tell him whether particular products were making money. That has changed. Mr Gossage aims to make cost management a way of life at Hercules. To achieve that, he talks about 'empowerment' by putting accountability on to the factory floor. The management shake-up and sales of less profitable businesses has already made some impact on Hercules' performance. But when Mr Gossage lists the financial achievements of his tenure, he is forced to exclude a large hole in his balance sheet. Last June, the company's aerospace division had to write off Dollars 68m after the company's solid rocket booster for the Titan missile exploded during a test firing. The explosion has been described by one Hercules executive as the biggest firecracker in American history. The company had already been forced to write off Dollars 300m in 1987 for the same project, described by Mr Gossage as the company's Achilles' heel. Mr Gossage reels off what the impact of reorganisation and restructuring would have been without that incident. Operating profits this year would have been up 32 per cent. Net income would have grown 11 per cent. And return on shareholder capital would have been 7.3 per cent, up from 5 per cent. There is no doubt that Mr Gossage, a chemical engineer, has a preference for chemicals. He stumbles over the name of the European airframe manufacturer, Airbus, and does not know the title of Boeing's latest aircraft, for which Hercules is bidding as a sub-contractor. 'I have spent a disproportionate amount of time on aerospace. It's an imbalance I want to fix,' he says. 'Chemicals and aerospace makes a strange mixture.' However, before he can dispose of aerospace, he says he first needs to show that the Titan upgrade is viable. He says he then needs to fix the rocket booster before seeing whether the operations fit into the portfolio. Only then will he make a decision whether to spin the operations off, form a joint venture or just sell them. Mr Gossage believes the targets he has set for Hercules are achievable. 'Even 14 per cent return on equity would not make us leaders - we would be part of the pack. But the rest of the industry is proving remarkably accommodating by bringing their results down,' he explains. Raising the company's performance while the rest of the industry struggles with the recession and increasing environmental costs will need considerable skill. To achieve his aims, Mr Gossage has some difficult juggling before him.</p>

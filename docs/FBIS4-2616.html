			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Yu Donghui (0151 2639 2547)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 8 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Wu Yi,  minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, heads the  Chinese Government economic relations and trade delegation  flying to the United States today to attend the Sino-U.S. Joint  Committee for Commerce and Trade. In addition, a 220-member  delegation for talks on Sino-U.S. trade and investments is ready  and waiting and will be attending two large-scale activities, a  seminar on investment and trade and successive talks in Los  Angeles and New York, in mid- April.    These will be largest-scale activities in investment and  trade China will have sponsored in the United States since  China's reform and opening up in the 15 years since Sino-U.S.  diplomatic relations were established. This shows China's  aspirations and sincerity in expanding opening up, strengthening  Sino-U.S. relations in trade and economic cooperation, and  welcoming U.S. businessmen to make investments in China.    On the eve of her departure for the United States, Jiao  Sufeng, foreign investment administration director of the  Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, agreed to a  special interview with this reporter.    Jiao Sufeng disclosed that the current activities in  investment and trade include trade talks and inviting  investments, with 927 projects in that category. The members of  the delegation are from nine of China's central ministries and  commissions, 26 provinces and municipalities, and a dozen or so  trade companies.    Viewing the investment projects and the members of the  delegation, we find three major characteristics, namely:    --The focus is on infrastructure projects. There are 175  projects involving energy resources, transportation, and  telecommunications, with a capacity for absorbing $5 billion to  $6 billion of foreign funds. From this we can see that China's  absorption of foreign funds will gradually change from leaning  toward regions to leaning toward industry.    --A high proportion of the projects are of the capital- and  technology-intensive type. There are 338 projects concerning  raw materials, electronic machinery, the petrochemical industry,  the light and textile industries, and the metallurgical  industry. Beyond a doubt, they are very attractive to large U.S.  transnational companies.    --Central and western provinces are taking an active part.  Out of the 26 provinces and cities represented on the United  States visit, 16 are provinces, cities and autonomous regions in  China's hinterland, namely Xinjiang, Qinghai, Ningxia, Gansu,  Shaanxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Henan,  Jilin, Shanxi, Xian, and Wuhan. This is related to the  structure of the projects, while demonstrating the momentum of  China's opening up in all directions.    The current visit to the United States will once again show  the world that China, this largest developing country, has a  huge market filled with temptation. China's bountiful  resources, industrial foundation and technological force of an  initial range, and cheap labor match very well U.S. abundant  funds and advanced technology. The key to developing Sino-U.S.  relations should be augmenting trade and economic cooperation  characterized by mutual interests and benefits.    U.S. investments in China grew steadily between 1979 and  1993. By the end of last year, China had already approved 12,000  projects involving U.S. investments. The negotiated sum was  $10.6 billion, with an actual investment of $5.2 billion, next  only to Hong Kong. In 1993 in particular, U.S. businessmen  invested in some 6,700 projects in China, with a negotiated sum  of $6.8 billion, of which some $2 billion was already invested.    All the signs are that although some troubles and  contradictions often surface in Sino-U.S. trade and economic  relations, U.S. political and entrepreneurial circles continue  to show strong interest and great confidence in China. That is  evidenced by the fact that since the beginning of this year,  U.S. Government officials, nongovernment delegations, large  companies and financial groups have come to China one after  another.    In view of this, the current large-scope activities in trade  and economic relations are aimed chiefly at establishing  extensive ties with U.S. figures from economic and  entrepreneurial circles, briefing them on China's policy of  reform and opening up and conditions in economic development,  and providing them with opportunities for investment and trade.  Jiao Sufen indicated that strengthening ties and deepening  understanding is more important than signing some contracts.    A relevant figure stressed that China welcomes U.S.  investments, and the United States needs the Chinese market.  Harmony between the two sides spells mutual benefits; and  confrontation means crippling both. The best policy is to seek  common ground while reserving differences, and seek cooperation.</p>

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / International Bonds: Credit rating review clouds Turkey's prospects THE REPUBLIC of Turkey returned rapidly to the international bond market last week despite the decision by Moody's, the international rating agency, to place the country's long-term credit rating under review for possible downgrading. Last Monday, Turkey raised DM1bn through an offering of five-year Eurobonds, following on the heels of a Pounds 100m 10-year Eurobond issue the previous week. This week, Turkey could launch a seven-year Y50bn issue in the Samurai market, the domestic Japanese bond market for foreign borrowers. Moody's announcement, on October 8, could not have come at a worse time for Turkey since it has been relying more on the international bond market to fund its growing public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR). If Moody's does lower Turkey's credit rating from investment to sub-investment grade, this would close off a whole range of institutional investors who might otherwise take on Turkish risk. Because of the shallow state of its domestic capital market, there is real worry that Turkey could find difficulty financing its balance of payments if its ability to tap international markets is impaired. There already appears to be a growing reluctance among foreign banks to take on new Turkish risk. They are concerned at the failure to bring down the budget deficit and the current account deficit. The current account deficit is expected to exceed Dollars 5bn by the end of 1993 compared with a deficit of just under Dollars 1bn last year. On both foreign and domestic borrowing, the government has sought to improve the maturity of its debt in order to reduce its servicing costs, which account for more than 20 per cent of recurrent budget expenditures. However, Turkey's foreign debt measured in absolute terms - as opposed to the effects of currency fluctuations - is rising. At the end of June, total public and private debt stood at Dollars 59bn, up from Dollars 54.7bn at the end of 1992. Much of the increase relates to short-term borrowing as private Turkish banks seek to fund their Turkish lira loan book with cheaper offshore finance. Foreign government debt, however, has also expanded. Before the latest spate of bond issues, Turkey's new foreign borrowings in 1993 totalled Dollars 2.3bn, the largest issue being a Y100bn Samurai issue. The attractions of the Samurai market have seen a rise in the yen portion of Turkey's debt, to 18.6 per cent from 13.6 per cent in 1990. Given the yen's recent appreciation, this will also have added to Turkey's problems. The success of Turkey's foray into the international bond market has always depended on improvements in the fiscal picture. After the latest wave of economic statistics, it remains to be seen how long Turkey can sustain this strategy. For 1994, the government envisages a budget deficit of TL192,000bn (Dollars 14.7bn). Taken with the projected transfers to loss-making state enterprises, the government forecasts a PSBR of 14 per cent of GNP compared with a 1993 target of around 9 per cent. However, PSBR is now officially expected to reach 16 per cent of GNP this year. Syndicate managers involved in Turkey's recent Eurobond issues have played down the impact of Moody's announcement, noting that Standard &amp; Poor's, the other leading rating agency, re-affirmed Turkey's triple-B rating on October 14. They believe that any downgrading has already been discounted by the market, and that in any case, it is not a foregone conclusion that it will happen. In addition, current demand from investors for high-yielding paper has meant that the spread - the margin over the yield on government paper - on both issues has only widened by a small amount.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Edmundo Galiza Matos] </F>   [Text] As usual, UN Special Representative Dr. Aldo Ajello  granted his Friday news conference in Maputo today and he  announced that the Supervision and Control Commission [CSC] will  meet on 3 May to try to find realistic solutions to various  problems in the Mozambican pacification process. Aldo Ajello  noted that the CSC meeting will try to set deadlines for closing  down government and Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo]  assembly areas as well as for winding up the demobilization  process.    The UN special representative in Mozambique made it clear  that he would like to see the whole process concluded in July,  even though he agrees that could be done in June as proposed by  the National Elections Commission, CNE, chairman. The electoral  census is supposed to begin in June.    At another point in his news conference, the head of the UN  Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz] said he was very happy with  President of the Republic Joaquim Chissano's pronouncements in  his provincial tours, but he called for there to be consistency  between words and deeds. He also disclosed that the Renamo  demobilization process is making progress and he added that a  list has been delivered containing more than 1,000 names of men  supposed to go back to civilian life. That process is scheduled  to begin today and be over by 6 May, and Renamo is supposed to  demobilize 4,000 of its soldiers.    Meanwhile, 4,345 government and Renamo soldiers and officers  are undergoing training in Manica, Boane, Dondo, Nacala, and  Catembe. The UN special representative in Mozambique also  disclosed that $8.163 [figure as heard] million is already in  the hands of Unomoz. That money will be used to help Renamo  become a political party. It is expected that a further $5.173  million will be given Renamo for that purpose, in addition to  funds which may also be allocated by the U.S. and French  Governments.    The head of Unomoz also said that $2.006 million will be  placed with the trust fund [preceding two words in English] for  other political parties. He explained that it will be up to  Unomoz to manage those funds. He also disclosed that the UN  Security Council has sent a list of five international judges to  be part of the Electoral Court. Those judges will come from  France, Brazil, Nicaragua, Chile, and Portugal.</p>

			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> BOARD TO SEE IF CITIES BACK SALES TAX BOOST  </P> <P> The Ventura County Transportation Commission on Friday voted to ask the  county's 10 cities if they would support placing a measure on the November  ballot that would raise the sales tax a half-cent to help pay for local street  construction and repairs.  </P> <P> The proposed ballot measure must be approved by the county's 10 cities and the  Board of Supervisors before it can be placed on the ballot in the fall, said  Mary Travis, a county transportation official.  </P> <P> The increased sales tax would generate an estimated $25 million per year for  the next 20 years, Travis said.  </P> <P> Transportation officials acknowledged that county voters might be reluctant to  approve another tax increase after the passage of Proposition 111. That  measure, approved Tuesday, will raise the gasoline tax by 5 cents a gallon  statewide for one year beginning Aug. 1, then go up a penny a year for the next  four years.  </P> <P> But Travis said that because $2 billion of the new gas-tax funds will be  distributed to those counties that can come up with matching funds, it would  benefit residents to support the local sales tax increase.  </P> <P> With the passage of Proposition 111, Ventura County is expected to receive $160  million over the next 10 years for road construction. Travis said if the sales  tax were increased, the county could get as much as $65 million more over the  same period of time. CARLOS LOZANO  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The House of Representatives has condemned and  denounced the U.S. abstention from voting on two clauses of UN  Resolution 904 that consider Jerusalem an occupied territory.  The House also condemned a U.S. statement that the Palestinian  territories are disputed and not occupied territories.    In a statement issued today, the House called on Arab and  Islamic parliaments, as well as the parliaments of states  upholding just causes, to officially protest against the U.S.  position. The House said it strongly regretted the poor  coordination of the Arab delegations at the United Nations,  which contributed to this result.    The House appealed to the kings and presidents of the Arab  states to call for a summit in order to discuss the situation of  the Palestinian and Arab people under occupation and shoulder  their responsibilities toward the brothers who are being exposed  to a continuous annihilation campaign.    The House of Representatives expressed its appreciation for  the steadfastness of the heroic Palestinian people and their  legitimate defense of their lands and rights, emphasizing its  support for these struggling people.</p>

			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / US Money and Credit: Prices increase as fears on inflation subside ALL last week, the US bond market clung to its newfound conviction that inflation is no longer an immediate threat to the economy, and that the forthcoming price data will bear the helpful imprint of the cigarette wars. So bond prices rose, and the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue tumbled to its lowest level since the authorities began issuing this type of paper on a regular basis 16 years ago. In fact, several new 'records' were set during the week. The long bond's yield dipped to a 'record' low of 6.67 per cent on Monday evening, having stood at 6.7 per cent at the end of the previous week. By Friday night, it had fallen further still, entering the July 4 holiday weekend at 6.66 per cent. Bolstering this cavalier approach to the nation's economic fortunes was a series of statistics which indicated that the manufacturing sector remains at low ebb. On Thursday, for example, the National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its index fell to 48.3 per cent in June, compared with 51.1 per cent in May. Any reading below the 50 per cent mark suggests that manufacturing activity in the economy is contracting. But the most significant announcement came on Friday, when the Labor Department reported that non-farm payroll employment rose by just 13,000 in June. The nation's unemployment rate, meanwhile, edged back up to 7 per cent last month, with some 53,000 manufacturing jobs being eliminated. The figures were significantly below the market's formal estimates - most pundits had pitched their predictions for the non-farm payroll employment increase at between 100,000 and 130,000. That said, a suspicion that the data would be weak had grown during the latter half of the week. As a result, bond price movements were relatively muted in the wake of the news. The most noticeable immediate effect was a steepening of the yield curve, with the short-dated end of the market rising in response to the data, and the long-dated end lagging, still hampered by nervousness over rising gold and commodity prices. By mid-morning on Friday, analysts said that the yield spread between two-year notes and the 30-year long bond had widened to around 274 basis points. However, by the time that business had trickled away for the long Independence Day weekend, both ends of the market were at least showing price gains and the long bond yield - although not at its lowest level for the week - was only a smidgeon away. Analysts are virtually unanimous in concluding that the latest run of economic data means that Federal Reserve officials will leave interest rates untouched when the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets later this week. The bond market, however, will have little additional information to guide its path next week. The only significant set of statistics due to be released during the shortened four-day week is the May consumer instalment credit numbers, which will be published on Wednesday. Instead, bond traders are likely to focus their attention on the following week's inflation numbers, with the June producer price index due to be unveiled on July 13, and the consumer price numbers to be released on July 14. Already, analysts are predicting that lower food prices, the drop in the cost of tobacco products, and softer energy quotes should pare back the PPI and leave the CPI unchanged during the month.</p>

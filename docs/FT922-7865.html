			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Determined driver of the 'last train to modernity': Brazil's President Collor talks to FT writers about the Earth Summit and the challenges of economic reform In three weeks Brazil's President Fernando Collor de Mello is due to host the UN conference on Environment and Development, better known as the Earth Summit - an occasion he describes, with perhaps pardonable hyperbole, as 'the conference of the century'. With more than 100 heads of state expected in Rio de Janeiro, Collor's Brazil will be on show at a critical time domestically. The coming months will determine whether Latin America's largest economy can break free from a decade of chronic inflation (still running at 20 per cent a month) and return to its historic pattern of rapid growth, or, whether the government will be forced to abandon its adjustment programme in the face of political pressure and mounting social problems. In an interview Mr Collor seemed determined not to yield to demands to relax his deflationary policy which has prolonged a recession which began in 1989. 'We have caught the last train to modernity. If it's not going as fast as we'd like it's because obstacles are being placed in front of us daily as if to test us. But we are overcoming them.' Lacking a sufficient political base to steer crucial economic reforms through Congress, Mr Collor was forced last month to bring into his government old-style politicians who are already asking for increased funds. But at the same time the government's failure to meet first-quarter targets of an economic stabilisation programme with the International Monetary Fund will mean increased pressure to slash public spending even further to prevent a collapse of the accord. According to official figures, expenditure was already down about 60 per cent in the first quarter, compared with the same period last year, achieved by a virtual freeze on all new spending commitments. At one point even the foreign ministry's telephones were cut off because the bill had not been paid. Mr Collor insists he will resist pressure for higher social spending from politicians who face important local elections this October. 'These pressures are legitimate in the sense of the need for state investment but it is also legitimate for me to insist on sticking to my stabilisation programme. The ministers must obey and are obeying.' Mr Collor's new pragmatism contrasts sharply with the gimmickry of two years ago, when he came into office pledging to 'slay the inflationary tiger with a single bullet.' The 42-year-old president now admits that the people he brought into his initial cabinet were inadequate to the task. 'It was a team of young idealists without experience. I've learnt through time that I needed people with more experience and thus I have now brought into my cabinet older people with professional qualifications and sound ethics.' Himself a political outsider from the backward north-eastern state of Alagoas, Mr Collor assumed office in March 1990 with monthly inflation at 84 per cent and immediately stunned the nation by freezing four-fifths of commercial bank accounts, in between riding jet-skis and flying fighter aircraft. Now after two failed economic plans he has abandoned what is known locally as his 'Indiana Jones' approach in favour of strict fiscal discipline embodied in the staid persona of the economy minister, Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira. The change has taken a visible personal toll on Mr Collor. His hair is now sprinkled with grey, and he admits to having lost 14 kilos (30lb) while in office. There have been persistent rumours about his health, although in this week's interview he appeared relaxed and fit. The austerity programme is extracting a heavy social cost of which symptoms are not hard to find. This week, Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city, has been paralysed by bus strikes. Over the past month 30 supermarkets have been ransacked by mobs in Rio de Janeiro, and there is considerable unease in the military over low pay. Brazil has the world's worst income distribution and last month the minimum monthly salary fell to less than Dollars 40. Mr Collor admits he is concerned but insists that 'improvement of standards will come only with the return of economic growth to the state. At this stage it is necessary to defeat the phantom of inflation, balance public accounts and reduce the role of the state in areas in which it should not be operating. It's a project of extraordinary ambition which will not produce overnight results.' Brazil has come under frequent attack for the widely publicised murders of street children by death-squads, and Mr Collor insisted that the welfare of children is his highest priority. A large part of the budget, he said, is being devoted to 'integrated assistance centres for children', designed 'to rescue children from the streets'. He added that education is essential for Brazil's economic growth. 'We cannot enter the first world with third world labour. Cheap manpower is no longer an incentive to investment.' Pointing to the array of Brazilian-made tank, fighter-jet and rocket models arranged on his shelves, he said: 'It's no good building computers and planes if in the future we're submerged by a wave of ignorance.' Brazil is still lagging behind the rest of Latin America in the reform process. It has the highest inflation in the region and is the most closed market, imports only representing 5 per cent of GDP. But Mr Collor warns against comparisons. 'Brazil is a continent-sized country which has both first-world oases such as Sao Paulo and areas of intense underdevelopment.' He added: 'Brazil has enormous potential and possibilities. With stabilisation I have no doubt that Brazil will be the best alternative for foreign investment.' One of the problems which makes Brazil's difficulties so intractable is its rapid population growth. Despite his somewhat sensitive position as president of the world's largest Catholic country, Mr Collor plans to bring population control into the discussions at the Earth Summit. Mr Collor believes industrialised countries' concern about world population is motivated mainly by fear of uncontrolled migration. But, he says, 'developed countries spend three or four times more to receive an immigrant than the investment it would take to create the conditions to keep him in his country of origin. People move because they are looking for opportunities for survival.' Taking as an example the garimpeiro (wildcat gold miner) in Amazonia, he said 'the garimpeiro doesn't cut down trees because he wants to see logs on the ground, or pollute rivers because he likes seeing fish dying. He has travelled thousands of kilometres into the jungle in search of survival. When we ran an operation to remove garimpeiros from the Amazon one sent me a letter saying, 'Fine, Mr President, but how do you expect me to live now?' Mr Collor said he was now far more confident of the Summit's success than he had been a month ago, particularly since the confirmation this week that US President George Bush would attend. 'It would have been a disaster if the US had not been represented at the highest level,' he said. He believes the importance of the conference cannot be overestimated. 'If we continue as we are today, the planet will not survive the next 50 years.' Reporting by Stephen Fidler, Christina Lamb and Edward Mortimer</p>

The  teams have been instructed to negotiate as long as it takes to  resolve differences.    Foreign Minister Peres says even if agreement is reached on  the security issues, much work still remains, but he says that  he and the PLO chairman have decided to stay on in the Egyptian  capital until all the obstacles are overcome. David Ze'ev  examines the reports from Cairo:    Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres told reporters in Cairo he  has  a mandate to reach agreements with the Palestinians. The  Palestinians say they have been told that Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin has given his foreign minister the green light for what  the PLO ambassador to Cairo said would be a breakthrough toward  drafting an agreement on an Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza  Strip and the Jericho area.    Foreign Minister Peres repeated the Israeli position that  much work remains, but he also said that his discussion with PLO  Chairman Yasir 'Arafat late last night in Cairo was held in a  positive atmosphere and that he was sure both sides will make a  far-reaching effort to achieve agreements on whatever issues  possible, and Peres said he has the authority to sign  agreements. The reference is to the Palestinian anger that he  would not sign after agreements were reached in Davos over a  week ago and the PLO accusing Prime Minister Rabin of vetoing  his foreign minister's achievements.    In the meantime, Peres and 'Arafat will remain in Cairo as  their negotiating teams try to work out the differences. The  teams have been instructed to hold marathon sessions toward  reaching that objective. Despite the war of nerves that  preceded the resumption of the negotiations, both Foreign  Minister Peres and Chairman 'Arafat smiled and were upbeat after  their meeting last night.    Here in Jerusalem, a senior Israeli official said the key in  resolving the differences has been the open line with the  Palestinians: the ability to pick up the phone, in the Israeli  official's words, an option that exists both with the  Palestinians and Jordan but not with Syria, preventing contacts  with Damascus during breaks in the Washington negotiations to  raise such issues as the Syrian role in the violence in Lebanon  that claimed the lives of four Israeli soldiers yesterday.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 8 February  carries a report on a telephone interview with Foreign Minister  Peres in Cairo on 8 February. The report notes that "referring  to the serious incident in the security zone in south Lebanon  yesterday, Minister Peres said that one of the issues in the  peace negotiations with Syria should be that of Damascus'  curbing Hizballah."    [A report by Gay Bekhor and Aluf Ben on page A1 of Tel Aviv  HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 8 February adds: "In a session held at  the prime minister's bureau prior to the departure of the  Israeli delegation for Cairo, Rabin decided to accept Peres'  position not to alter clauses in the understandings reached with  the PLO in Davos. The prime minister rejected the demand by  security elements to introduce certain amendments into the Davos  document in order to underscore Israel's responsibility for  security on the roads in Gaza and along the 'safe passages' of  the Palestinians in the Jericho area."]</p>

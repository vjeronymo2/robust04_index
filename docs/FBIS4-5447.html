			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 11 KYODO -- Japanese Government envoy  Nobuo Matsunaga left for Morocco on Monday night to attend a  ministerial meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT), officials said.    The government decided earlier Monday to send Matsunaga, the  trade representative for external affairs, to Marrakech for the  signing of a new global trade pact concluded under GATT.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said the  government is still considering sending Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata to Morocco for talks with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey  Kantor on the possible resumption of stalled bilateral trade  negotiations.    Takemura said the government wants to reach a quick decision  on whether Hata should be in Marrakech at least on Friday, the  final day of the four-day GATT meeting.    Hata, however, may not be able to undertake the trip amid  the  domestic political turmoil triggered by Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa's decision to step down.    Matsunaga will also attend a quadilateral meeting of Japan,  the United States, Canada and the European Union, expected on  Wednesday, and will deliver a speech at the GATT meeting on  Thursday if Hata is unable to go to Morocco, Vice Foreign  Minister Kunihiko Saito said.    Saito also indicated that Matsunaga will meet Kantor in case  Hata is unable to go to Morocco.</p>

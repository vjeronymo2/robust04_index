			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Property valuations concern Concern over stock market valuations of property stocks was underlined yesterday by a disappointing announcement from Hammerson. The board statement showed Hammerson's net asset value (nav) as 343p a share, well to the lower end of market forecasts. This highlighted nervousness ahead of a batch of impending property share flotations. With the sector undergoing a correction following a powerful performance in the past 18 months, analysts fear these flotations may prove disappointing. First of the batch is Capital Shopping Centres, which begins trading today. Some brokers suggest the shares could open at about 210p, a 20p discount to the issue price of 230p. The issue price was calculated at a 13 per cent premium to net asset value at a time when the property sector was trading at an average premium to asset value of about 20 per cent. However, this has now fallen to around 5 per cent. Last week it was revealed that only 14.4 per cent of the public offer had been taken up. Hammerson's shares, which fell back on the results, later rallied on consideration of a Pounds 143m deal with Postel, the investment group. After dropping to 348p, they finished 8 down on balance at 354p. Mr Graham Stanley at Goldman Sachs said: 'This sensible deal bolsters short term income and provides some interesting medium term redevelopment opportunities.'</p>

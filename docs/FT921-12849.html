			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Halifax launches biggest issue by UK mutual HALIFAX Building Society yesterday launched the largest capital-raising issue by a mutual savings institution in the bond market, although it paid a higher price than originally envisaged for the funds. The issue of Pounds 100m permanent interest bearing shares (Pibs), the deeply subordinated capital instruments approved by the Building Societies Commission last summer, was priced to yield 275 basis points more than long-dated UK government bonds. Halifax first announced its intention to issue Pibs last autumn, arguing that it should pay 230 to 250 basis points over UK government securities. The paper launched yesterday, but largely pre-placed with UK institutional investors by Warburg Securities, carries a semi-annual coupon of 12 per cent and was priced at 100.28. The cost of capital for the Halifax is still substantially less than for smaller building societies. For example, the next largest issue, a Pounds 75m deal by the Leeds Permanent, currently trades at a yield 335 basis points more than UK government bonds. The pricing of this and earlier Pibs issues partly reflects concern among investors over the long-term credit quality of building societies. Falling property prices and rising mortgage defaults have hit profitability and forced the takeover of some smaller institutions by their larger competitors. Halifax is the largest UK building society and carries a Aa1/AA credit rating for senior debt from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit ratings agencies. This is two notches higher than the next best credits in the sector. However, Pibs carry no maturity date and are deeply subordinated, ranking even below depositors' funds held in share accounts in the event of winding up. Interest payments can be suspended if the issuer runs into trouble, hence the instrument can absorb losses in the manner of equity. Yesterday's issue was made in large denominations of Pounds 50,000 and was aimed primarily at institutional investors. Some other recent issues have been made in denominations as low as Pounds 1,000 in an effort to attract more retail investors. However, Warburg commented that buyers included some stockbrokers on behalf of wealthy private individuals.</p>

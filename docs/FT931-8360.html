			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Kleinwort Benson ahead 66% - Advance to Pounds 46.3m helped by cut in bad debt provisions to Pounds 7m KLEINWORT Benson's pre-tax profits recovered sharply in 1992,mainly because of a drop in bad debt provisions from Pounds 39m to Pounds 7m. The merchant banking group also disclosed that Mr David Peake, its chairman, would retire at the next annual meeting on April 28, to be replaced by Lord Rockley, currently a vice chairman. Profits of the merchant banking group increased 66 per cent to Pounds 46.3m. However, after-tax profits rose by only 10 per cent to Pounds 21.3m because Kleinwort was forced to take an exceptional tax charge of Pounds 13.6m in its profit and loss account as an adjustment to the accrued tax losses it carries in its balance sheet. Mr Jonathan Agnew, Kleinwort's chief executive, insisted that the exceptional tax charge was an accounting nicety: 'It has no economic effect on us.' The charge relates to financial transactions carried out by Kleinwort in 1988 with the purpose of generating tax losses. It then included these assets in its balance sheet as an asset. In preparing the latest accounts, Kleinwort re-examined the transactions and decided the losses should be removed from the balance sheet. However, Mr Agnew said that Kleinwort would still be able to benefit from the losses by reducing the tax it pays in future. The losses were now a contingent off-balance sheet asset. The growth in 1992 pre-tax profits was held back by a Pounds 10m charge to cover the costs of the group's surplus off-ice space in the UK and the US. The merchant banking and securities division pushed up profits from Pounds 24.7m to Pounds 38m, while the investment management and private banking division suffered a small drop from Pounds 24.4m to Pounds 22.1m. Within the merchant banking and securities operations, Kleinwort's Japanese securities business made a loss and there was also a drop in profits from the corporate finance department, which is the traditional heart of the group. There were sharp profit increases in the treasury operations and the financing business. The proposed final dividend is maintained at 10.7p, giving an unchanged total for the year of 16p. Earnings per share, excluding the exceptional tax charge, increased from 14.3p to 26.6p. Mr Peake, 58, said he had been thinking about retiring 'for some months', but other board members were putting no pressure on him to go. He preferred to go now, to allow Lord Rockley, who is a few months older than him, to do the job for a few years. Lord Rockley is seen by Kleinwort executives as chairman for a transitional period, while the next generation of senior Kleinwort executives acquire more experience. However, some Kleinwort executives said they were slightly surprised that Mr Peake had not been replaced by Mr Simon Robertson, 51, who was appointed deputy chairman last year. See Observer</p>

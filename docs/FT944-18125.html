			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Business and the Environment: Malls get a mauling - The growing resistance to America's drive-in shopping centres Every morning, millions of Americans roll out of bed and into their cars. They drive to work, drive to lunch, drive to a mall for some shopping, drive to the supermarket and drive home again. It is the American dream: a well-paid job, easy access to consumer goods and a house in the suburbs. To a small but increasingly vocal group, however, it is the American nightmare. Car dependency, they say, exacerbates air pollution and reduces wilderness areas and open space by encouraging suburban sprawl. Large suburban shopping complexes have become a target for their campaign. Wal-Mart, one of the most successful and aggressive retailers in the US, is bearing the brunt of the campaign, concentrated in New England. In August, St Johnsbury became the first city in Vermont to accept the store, after years of bitter opposition across the state. Wal-Mart hailed its entry into Vermont as a victory, but the company made some significant compromises. The store reduced its planned size from about 120,000 sq ft to about 80,000 sq ft and agreed to locate in the downtown area rather than on the city fringes. Town councils and local referendums in Bath in Maine, Saugus, Greenfield and Westford in Massachusetts and Lebanon, New Hampshire have already rejected Wal-Mart. The anti-Wal-Mart campaign has gained momentum in Plymouth and Sturbridge in Massachussetts, St Albans and Williston in Vermont, and North Kingston in Rhode Island. Other retailers are also under fire. Cape Cod is seeking to keep out the discount store Costco, and anti-marters are hoping to prevent Kmart from building in Wallingford, Connecticut. Resistance to shopping malls is mounting in urban centres too. Plans for a gigantic new mall in the city of Providence, Rhode Island, have raised the ire of environmentalists who complain that a 5,000-space parking garage will encourage shoppers to drive to the mall and turn the area into one big traffic jam. The Providence Place developers argue that shuttle buses and a two-person per car minimum for parking will solve the problem. The retail chains also point to the economic stimulus they bring to a community. Wal-Mart argues that each store it builds brings up to 250 new jobs. 'We add jobs, which are of paramount importance everywhere,' says Donald Shinkle, spokesman for the group. 'By selling our products cheaply, we also extend the shopping budgets of every family in the area.' The chief fear of Wal-Mart detractors is that an outlet will sap business from town centres. Dying downtowns lead to sprawl and more traffic as large car parks spread, they say. But Wal-Mart counters that in many areas its presence has benefited downtown businesses by attracting more out-of-town shoppers from far away. Wal-Mart is now running television commercials portraying the retailer as an environmentally-conscious family store. The advertisements feature a Wal-Mart built with recycled materials, and workers who host sales of baked goods for charity on their days off. Anti-marters are sceptical. They say the economic benefits are insubstantial. 'Most of the jobs Wal-Mart creates are minimum wage,' says Albert Norman, an anti-mart activist in Greenfield. 'And when you count the number of jobs lost as the downtown stores go out of business, it's a wash. 'It also doesn't count the added infrastructure the town needs to spend money on like more traffic lights and road repair. The prices may be low now but if Wal-Mart eliminates the competition, they'll have lots of room to raise prices,' he adds. So far, the anti-mall groups have operated only locally, but some are linking with other campaigners. 'We are starting to share ideas and strategies with other, similar groups around the country,' says Joan Pucino, head of the No-Mart Coalition of residents in North Kingston, Rhode Island. Lewis Milford, a lawyer with The Conservation Law Foundation, says his organisation is planning to get more involved, but adds that environmental groups have been slow to respond. Although the environmental dangers are seen as serious, many involved in urban planning development say suburban retailers are not entirely to blame. A number of businesses locate on highway developments including banks, car dealers, fast food restaurants, condominiums and suburban office complexes. 'The retailers are scapegoats,' says Alex Krieger, director of the urban design programme at Harvard University. 'It's easy to target them because they're very big, they tend to replace local shops, and they're seen as large-scale intruders.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) Korea is  under fire for describing Korea as a hell from which foreign  investors should stay away. Government officials have also  found factual errors in its latest report on the Korean  financial market prepared by the chamber.    Ministry of Finance [MOF] officials say the "one-sided,  distorted and unbalanced" report might mislead American policy-  makers and politicians into misunderstanding that Korea is a  closed market, not a liberalizing one.    An MOF official said, "The AmCham report appears to distort  or overshadow Korea's latest efforts to reform the financial  market. Thus we have prepared our own view on what AmCham  members have highlighted."    The MOF, however, is refraining from providing AmCham with  its comments on each subject, believing its comments, as was in  the past, will not be reflected in the revised AmCham paper.    The MOF was said to have sent a "protest letter" to AmCham  President James Riddle and U.S. Embassy commercial attache John  Hoog, sources said.    MOF officials said, "Depending on how you describe Korea or  the United States, it becomes a "heaven or a hell." They added  that one country, be it Korea or the United States, does not  necessarily have only negative aspects."    In fact, AmCham never used the word hell in its report, but  when you read the whole of it, you get the impression that Korea  is a hell for foreign investors, government officials said.    They said AmCham has "made efforts to project a negative  view  of the Korean economy." The paper sometimes contains even  "distorted and incorrect information about Korea's investment  environment for Americans, they said.    "What we are most concerned about is that a distorted or  incorrect description of Korea might mislead foreign investors  interested in Korea," they said.    Whether reliable or not, the AmCham report has been used as  a  barometer by foreigners in evaluating the investment environment  in Korea and a reference for formulating U.S. trade policy with  Korea.    A U.S. government official said, "The position of American  businessmen is not necessarily the same as that of the U.S.  government." But in fact, many American officials were  "embarrassed" when they casually quoted part of the AmCham  report without confirmation in official or private meetings with  Korean government officials.    If foreigners read AmCham's report without any background  information, Korea might be wrongly described as a country that  imposes the serious discrimination against non-Korean bankers  and brokers, he said.    He and many MOF officials said AmCham's report is biased and  might tarnish the otherwise smooth and cozy relationship Korea  and the United States enjoy.    MOF officials said they were disappointed with the "double  attitude" some AmCham members display in meetings, they "praised  us for making efforts to liberalize the market but in written  documents, they are hell-bent on describing Korea as a closed  market," they noted.    They said the report never mentioned what Korea has  deregulated over the past few years and only highlighted the  dark aspects.    Furthermore, the report mentioned that Korea should  "accelerate" its reform program. But the pace of the reform is  a matter to be decided by the Korean government itself, they  noted.    Many American bankers, brokers and insurers are here for  less  than three years and they want to maximize profits during their  stay. Thus it is only natural for them to want to see much of  the pre-announced deregulation implemented while they are in  Korea, MOF officials said.</p>

			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR BODY: GOT THOSE VACATION EXPECTATION BLUES?  </P> <P> Today's the unofficial beginning of summer vacation season, when job-weary  workers dream of getting on a plane and going . . . anywhere.  </P> <P> But, if experience is any teacher, most of us will expect too much from our  vacation, feel at least a little disappointed and return to work wondering why  life's not wonderful, psychologists say.  </P> <P> Vacations improve some parts of our lives but have little effect on others,  said Linda L. Hoopes, an assistant professor of psychology at Colby College in  Waterville, Me., who surveyed 140 vacationers and published the results  recently in the Journal of Community Psychology.  </P> <P> Vacations usually increase our overall satisfaction with life at least  slightly, but they have special impact on marriage and family relationships,  she found. Time off has the least effect, she said, on how we view our jobs and  our feelings about our standard of living. Vacationers with troubled family  relationships tend to return less satisfied, while those with satisfactory  relationships say time off enhances the bonds even more.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Consider Staying Home  </P> <P> Besides believing a vacation will solve most of life's problems, many of us  feel "we're supposed to go away, preferably to someplace glamorous." In lieu of  living out that stereotype, Hoopes tells people to decide what they need from a  vacation. "You may decide on holing up at home and unplugging the telephone."  </P> <P> Other ways to maximize the benefits of time off, suggested by Hoopes and Kenyon  Chan, a West Los Angeles psychologist:  </P> <P> * Before taking family vacations, schedule planning meetings to set up rules  and address "style" differences, Chan suggested. Family members should decide  in advance, for instance, how they'll handle differences in driving styles or  conflict between the family's "plan-ahead" and "spontaneous" personalities.  </P> <P> * If a family vacation is longer than two weeks, members need to schedule some  time alone, Chan suggested.  </P> <P> * Don't feel you have to forget about work entirely. "People highly involved in  their work in a positive way may not be comfortable abandoning it totally,"  Hoopes said. "I don't think it's unhealthy to be thinking about work on  vacation, or even to call the office occasionally."  </P> <P> * Don't try to do too much. Most vacationers overschedule activities and  overestimate how many different places they can see, Hoopes said. "People  schedule their vacations the way they schedule their work lives."  </P> <P> * Solo travelers can boost vacation enjoyment by writing about their activities  in a diary or sending postcards, Chan said. The activity is a nice substitute  for the conversations couples and families enjoy during trips and can make  mealtime seem less lonely, he added.  </P> <P> Tests May Be Redone  </P> <P> Los Angeles area women whose Pap tests were analyzed at a Tarzana medical  laboratory recently closed by the state may be hearing from their doctors soon.  Responding to Department of Health Services demands, Central Diagnostic  Laboratory last week sent letters to 15,000 California doctors, advising them  that free reanalysis of existing smears is available for their patients who  want it.  </P> <P> It will be up to doctors, in turn, to notify patients if they believe  rescreening is needed. The laboratory was closed in April after a state  inspection found an unacceptably high error rate of 21% -- about seven times  the error rate of the best labs.  </P> <P> Women who are advised to have their Pap tests reanalyzed should be sure to  check back with their doctors about the results within four to six weeks, said  Dr. Richard H. Nalick, director of gynecologic oncology at the Hospital of the  Good Samaritan and USC clinical associate professor of gynecologic oncology,  since the reanalyzed smears could be as much as five years old. Nalick added  that women who are advised to have their Pap tests reanalyzed should also  undergo new ones, although he concedes not everyone agrees with that  recommendation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Various Risk Factors  </P> <P> Nalick also believes that women with a history of abnormal Pap smears and those  with human papillomavirus (HPV) -- or genital warts -- should have a Pap test  every six months, rather than the annual test recommended by many. Other than  previous abnormal Pap tests and genital warts, risk factors for cervical cancer  include first intercourse before age 18 and multiple sexual partners.  </P> <P> Recent studies suggest that cervical cancer may develop more quickly than  experts previously believed. In one study, 37% of women with cervical cancer  had a normal Pap test three years before the diagnosis. And the presence of  genital warts may speed the development of cervical cancer, Nalick said.  </P> <P> Low-cost Pap testing is now available for $10 at five county Comprehensive  Health Centers: Edward R. Roybal, (213) 260-3354; H. Claude Hudson, (213)  744-3672; Hubert H. Humphrey, (213) 235-7215; El Monte, (818) 579-8463; Long  Beach, (213) 599-2153.  </P> <P> Tending Toddler Toes  </P> <P> Shoe-shopping parents should ignore traditional advice to buy sturdy leather  shoes for toddlers, according to a USC physical therapist.  </P> <P> "Toddlers seem to do better without any shoes or with flexible tennis shoes,"  said Michelle Larson, an assistant professor of physical therapy, who bases her  recommendation on clinical observations and her recent study of 36 children,  ranging in age from 18 to 30 months. In the study she evaluated the children's  stride, step length, angle of foot placement and other indications of gait  maturity and general stability. She tested them barefoot and wearing canvas  sneakers, leather high-tops with rigid soles, and their own shoes.  </P> <P> Kids performed best while barefoot and in sneakers, said Larson, who emphasizes  her finding applies only to healthy children without orthopedic problems. Going  barefoot -- on safe surfaces -- may also help develop the arches, she believes.  Outdoors, she recommends low-cut sneakers or high-top sneakers made of soft  material.  </P> <P> Such shoes allow free movement of the ankles, important while kids are  developing their gait. "Children don't attain their adult gait until age 3 or  4," she explained.  </P> <P> Many podiatrists agree with Larson's recommendations.  </P> <P> "That's exactly what I tell my patients," said Herschel Rosenblum, a Glendale  podiatrist. "Forget leather shoes. Inexpensive shoes are OK. Athletic-type  shoes are preferable for little kids."  </P> <P> Franklin Kase, a Burbank podiatrist and president of the Los Angeles County  Podiatric Medical Society, offered some additional advice for children's  shoe-shopping: "The arch support is not that critical. Look for a shoe that  fits well around the heel and that allows freedom of movement in the front of  the shoe." As for length: "A child's shoe should be one finger width longer  than the longest toe."  </P></p>

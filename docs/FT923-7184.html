			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Bank sees little significant growth this year THE UK economy is unlikely to grow significantly this year, the Bank of England said yesterday in a report which described prospects of a recovery as 'elusive'. The Bank, in its latest quarterly bulletin, said there were indications of increased business activity, but consumer demand remained weak owing to high debts, particularly mortgages. 'The post-election recovery in consumer demand has proved fragile with no clear sign as yet that demand is moving ahead of last year's depressed level.' The central bank's depiction of an economy continuing to bump along the bottom came amid other generally depressing economic news for Britain: Sterling hit another low against the D-Mark, falling half a pfennig to close in London at DM2.8125, its weakest level since Britain joined the European exchange rate mechanism in October 1990. In New York it edged up to DM2.8153. The number of people out of work for more than a year increased by 64,000 in the three months to July to top 900,000 for the first time since mid-1988. Lower tax receipts owing to the enfeebled economy resulted in a higher-than-expected public sector borrowing requirement last month of Pounds 600m. Government figures today are expected to show that UK output, excluding oil and gas production, remained flat in the second quarter. This measure has so far shown a fall for seven quarters. While stressing the economic gains from lower inflation over the past year, the Bank said 'the general improvement in business and consumer confidence in May has not been sustained'. Consumer spending was flat, while the housing market 'shows few signs of reviving'. The Bank added: 'The outlook remains very uncertain but slow growth in the economy should be evident in the remainder of this year.' The Bank said the signs of weakness should not shake the resolve of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in refusing to consider a devaluation. According to Bank officials, keeping sterling within its ERM bands is vital to the policy of achieving price stability and sustainable growth. Of the depressed housing market, the Bank said measures taken by building societies at the end of last year to help people with high arrears on mortgages had had 'a very modest' impact. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, described the bulletin as 'one of the gloomiest ever'. The government had 'no further excuse for inaction over unemployment, the state of industry and the housing market'. Slow growth, Page 7 Currencies, Page 23 London stocks, Page 32</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Future of Merrett Group in balance THE FUTURE of the Merrett Group, one of the largest agencies at the Lloyd's of London insurance market, was in question last night after the breakdown of a US plan to provide new backing for the group. Merrett said that Travelers, the US insurance company, had withdrawn a scheme to underwrite business alongside syndicates managed by Merrett on a so-called 'consortium' basis. Travelers, recently taken over by Primerica, the financial services group, would also have bought a sizeable stake in the Merrett managing agency, in a deal which would have helped offset a sharp decline in support for Merrett syndicates from Names - the individuals whose assets have traditionally backed the Lloyd's market. Travelers refused to comment last night. Merrett is seeking the backing of other Lloyd's agents, but it is is understood that talks earlier this week between Merrett and AJ Archer Holdings have so far been unsuccessful. The affair completes an unhappy year for Mr Stephen Merrett, one of the market's most powerful underwriters, who is chairman of the Merrett Group. Mr Merrett resigned as deputy chairman of the market after intense pressure from Names and their agents in August. Executives of Primerica are said to have viewed the Merrett deal as an unnecessary complication when their plans to take over Travelers were incomplete. Mr Bob Clements, president of Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, which owns the world's largest broker, and helped engineer the Travelers deal, yesterday reaffirmed support for the group, describing recent criticism of Mr Merrett as 'personalised and without regard to underlying fundamentals'. A Bermuda-based company, set up earlier this year by Marsh and JP Morgan, to provide reinsurance for Merrett syndicates would continue to operate. However Marsh, and JP Morgan, would not now be taking stakes in the Merrett agency, a move they had agreed as part of the Travelers plan. 'There is no point in us taking a stake except in so far as that was a catalyst to attract other capital,' said Mr Clements. Merrett will seek to generate support from members' agents, which handle the affairs of Names. But agents left a meeting with Mr Merrett yesterday distinctly downbeat about the group's prospects. One agent said that the group had 'few options available'.</p>

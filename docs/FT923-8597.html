			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Symbols of hope and hardship: East Germany is a society struggling to come to terms with the stresses of reunification One word spray-painted on the prefabricated wall of the Bavarian Hypo-Bank's new branch in Jena sums up most of east Germany's hopes and fears: it says 'Germoney'. That is what the west means to the east. It is a classic love-hate relationship. Germoney is what people want, and it is what they resent. It is the symbol of their liberation from communism, and equally of their new subordination to the western way of life. There is a weary cynicism abroad in the east, less than two years after unification with West Germany, and a dangerous bitterness about the whole political process. It was obvious in the reaction to the recent homecoming of Mr Erich Honecker, the profoundly unloved former leader of the Communist party: it was as if the majority did not really care whether he came back to face trial or stayed away. They were far more concerned with the battle for daily survival. But not everything is bleak. For a start, there are large sums of Germoney being spent in the east. It is coming at the expense of the western taxpayer, the western banks and the western capital markets and will amount to a net transfer of about DM130bn (Pounds 44.8bn) this year. The effects are highly visible. It is scarcely possible to drive more than 10km in the east without meeting a diversion to avoid either roadworks on the autobahns, which have not been improved since the 1930s, or new water pipes and sewers being laid in every other country town and village. In the city centres the old buildings, which had survived four decades of neglect by the communist authorities, are being restored. In the industrial city of Chemnitz, the former Karl-Marx-Stadt, for example, work starts in the Theaterplatz at 6.30am - before the heat of the day  - on the municipal opera, the natural history museum and St Peter's church, all undergoing comprehensive restoration. When asked how his city can afford to restore the opera, when it is effectively bankrupt, Mr Peter Fittig, the city councillor in charge of culture, replies simply: 'A city without culture is a city which does not deserve to exist.' Along country roads, huge billboards proclaim the words Aufschwung Ost - Upswing East - to identify the source of the funds for whatever village construction project has been identified as the priority for a western cash injection. And yet the gloom and uncertainty prevail. That is the other side of the story. The most obvious reason is unemployment. The less obvious, but more fundamental, reason is the trauma caused by unification. Many people have lost their jobs and they still do not understand why. They do not know how to react to the social and economic revolution they are facing. And they have also lost the will to get back into a system they no longer understand. The economy has bottomed out, but not before suffering an astonishing collapse - gross national product in the former East Germany was down 30.3 per cent last year. It should recover by 9 per cent in 1992. Official unemployment is running at an average 16.9 per cent this year, but only thanks to massive job creation schemes, retraining programmes, short-time working and early retirement, which keep real levels of joblessness below 30, 40 or even 50 per cent in some of the worst-hit areas. Even officially, unemployment is expected to go on rising - to nearly 20 per cent next year. What is happening is that after 40 years of enforced egalitarianism, eastern Germany is rapidly becoming a very divided society - between the have-jobs and the have-no-jobs. The have-jobs are doing fine, but the have-no-jobs are bitter and alienated. 'We have people who are working day and night, and those who have no work at all,' says Mr Rolf Scheibe, deputy mayor of Bautzen, regional capital of east Saxony, which has seen its lorry plant closed, and its railway wagon plant still desperately struggling to survive. At the same time, Philips has taken over a factory producing telephone transmission equipment, and Edding, the west German felt-tip pen manufacturer, has taken over a pen plant, both providing secure and well-paid jobs for the lucky few hundred. Bautzen is potentially a charming medieval town, a gateway to Poland and Czechoslovakia, and the prosperous centre for a thriving regional economy. Today it is remembered only for its prisons - one political, now closed, one criminal. The town council is effectively bankrupt, earning only 10 per cent of its western counterpart because loss-making businesses pay no taxes, Mr Scheibe says. He is now trying to raise rents from the present peppercorn level to make ends meet, against furious resistance. 'People have to learn a different attitude to work, and to money,' he says. 'What is an apartment worth? People storm in here and say they will never agree to pay DM2 a square metre - just a fraction of the rent they would pay in the west. They have no idea of value.' The resentment is part incomprehension, and part the inevitable result of a harsher new system. 'The old GDR social security meant that nobody starved. Nobody fell through the net. Now it is possible to slide down the social scale very quickly,' Mr Scheibe says. 'It is a very complicated time. The people feel themselves betrayed by the politicians. They made too many promises. They believed them, and now they are fed up. 'The warning voices at the time of unification were ignored, because people did not want to hear them. And now there is great insecurity.' It may seem a simple matter of a sudden collapse in material living standards, but the malaise of the east is more profound. Mr Till Noack is a youthful chief executive in the city public utility in Jena, providing district heating to the barrack blocks of apartments surrounding the old town centre. Back in the 1970s he was thrown out of Jena university as a dissident. Now he is one of the new establishment. He believes that materially most people are no worse off than they were under the old system - even on unemployment benefit. 'Two different things are wrong. First, the people have the feeling that, yet again, they are not the ones deciding what is happening: their lives are controlled from outside,' he says. 'Second, there is the insecurity: the uncertain future. There are many people who went to school under the old system, who studied hard and gradually worked their way up. Suddenly they are out. 'Everything used to seem so unshakeable: it wasn't possible to change, but at least it was predictable. Now nothing is certain any more.' Mr Jorg Lesche is an enthusiastic young man who runs the business development department in the East Saxony office in Bautzen. He extols the virtues of the new order, of greenfield sites on the edge of town, of the widening market and possibilities of cross-border trade with Poland and Czechoslovakia. But he admits that it has not been easy for everyone. His mother is 54 years old, a former sports teacher in the world-beating East German system. She was a member of the Young Communist League in the 1950s, a true believer. Today she is out of work, and despairs for the future. She has no will to set up as a private practitioner - as a physiotherapist, for example. She has simply lost the will to work, he says. 'She is waiting two years, and then she will simply survive on social security.' Dr Gunter Hasel is a geologist, 61 years old, who has worked all his life in the foothills of the Erz mountains, prospecting for uranium and tin. He is an example of the competent and devoted professionals who came to terms with the old system against their better instincts, and now have no time to come to terms with the new. In the 1950s, he worked for the Russians, mining the uranium for their nuclear weapons. He is writing an official history of the mines, which will take him another year. Then he will have to retire. 'I told friends in the west I was forced to take early retirement,' he says. 'They said I was a lucky man. They would love to do the same. But they don't understand. In the west you have saved up for retirement. You have got a good pension and savings. I have got nothing to look forward to except a pittance.' The feeling in the east is that westerners simply do not understand the extent of the adjustment being demanded. And yet the feeling of well-informed westerners is that it is the easterners who have not realised how much their world has changed. Dr Dieter Angst, the appropriately named state secretary for planning and the environment in Saxony, is a westerner who has moved east to Dresden with his wife, rather than commuting every week like most of his western colleagues. He believes the whole unemployment problem is misunderstood - in the east. 'The problem everyone knows, but nobody mentions, is about the proportion of potentially active people in employment,' he says. 'In the GDR, it was 85 to 90 per cent. That was crazy. In the west it is 55 to 60 per cent. That means 30 per cent of all people formerly employed here are not going to be able to work again: they are nominally unemployed, but not in the western sense.' What he is referring to is the inevitability of a major structural change in the labour market in the east. Whereas in socialist times, female employment rates were well over 90 per cent, in the west they are far lower - so the brunt of the change is likely to fall on women in the east. 'This simply is not accepted by people here. They want to be the same as the west in material terms, but not in social and economic terms.' He rejects the prevailing pessimism as unjustified, but he does accept that there is this awful sense of insecurity. 'That I understand,' he says. 'They never knew it before. But insecurity is the price of freedom. We cannot take that insecurity away.' There are no simple conclusions. In purely economic terms, things are not as gloomy as they may appear on the surface. Recovery will not be quick, but it could well happen within a decade - if west Germany can keep up its massive transfers. That cannot be taken for granted but, nonetheless, there is a feeling that unification is condemned to succeed, economically. In the east, however, the greatest problem is not material, but psychological: the challenge of coming to terms with insecurity. That could take a generation or more to resolve.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by KBS General Bureau in Taejon] </F>   [Text] On the morning of 22 June, the Army held a  conference of major commanders--such as commanders at the corps  and above level, and commanders of the Army units under the  direct control of Army Headquarters--at the Army Headquarters in  Kyeryongdae under the chairmanship of Kim Tong-chin, Army chief  of staff. They confirmed their resolve to secure a complete  military preparedness in connection with the recent North Korean  military movements.    The Army analyzed: North Korea is in a status in which it  can  launch a provocation at any time, while maintaining the highest-  level combat readiness by having recently deployed to the front  area long-range guns, including 170-mm self-propelled guns, and  waged large-scale military exercises.    On the analysis of this, while looking squarely at the  reality concerning national security, the Army decided to secure  military preparedness, achieve reform of consciousness, and push  for the tasks of developing the Army during the latter of half  of this year.</p>

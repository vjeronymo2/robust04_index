			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / German N-waste plan clears legal hurdle A local court in Luneburg, in the state of Lower Saxony, yesterday gave its approval for work to resume on investigations for Germany's first full-scale nuclear waste disposal site in the disused salt mines at Gorleben, on the banks of the river Elbe. The decision amounts to an important victory for the federal government in Bonn, and the nuclear energy industry, in their long-running battle with environmentalists and the local state authorities to establish proper nuclear waste disposal facilities at Gorleben. If the Gorleben site eventually gets approval, it is supposed to provide facilities for long-term disposal of high-level nuclear waste in addition to interim storage facilities. That could mean Germany will no longer need to send its highly radioactive nuclear waste for reprocessing in Britain, at the Thorp plant at Sellafield, and in France. The waste disposal plans for Gorleben have been resisted by the state governments of Lower Saxony for almost 20 years, both by the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), and the left-wing Social Democratic Party (SPD). The decision on Gorleben means the issue could now once again blow up into a political campaign theme, for state elections are due next Sunday. The SPD, represented by environment minister Ms Monika Griefhahn, and its Green Party partners in government, have insisted that Germany must abandon nuclear energy. The court order means state mining authorities are obliged to allow further exploratory work on the salt mine workings, and the state government must extend planning permission for the Gorleben complex as a whole. It also overruled objections to the plans by the local landowners. Yesterday's victory in Luneburg was tarnished by a setback for the nuclear industry in another key battle in the state of Hesse. A fire in the 20-year-old nuclear power plant at Biblis, near Darmstadt, meant the station could not be restarted as planned yesterday after routine maintenance. The fire has given Mr Joschka Fischer, the Green party environment minister in Hesse, new ammunition in his battle with Mr Klaus Topfer, CDU environment minister in Bonn, over restarting the plant. Last week Mr Topfer ordered Mr Fischer to let it go ahead. Mr Fischer's greatest success in his campaign against nuclear power generation has been in preventing operation of the Siemens MOX plant at Hanau, where reprocessed plutonium from Britain and France is supposed to be turned into mixed-oxide fuel elements for re-use in German nuclear power stations. By holding up that process, he has called the whole nuclear cycle into question. There is growing pressure on the government and industry for direct disposal of nuclear waste - at a site such as Gorleben - instead of reprocessing. In Lower Saxony, however, the government is adamant it will not allow direct disposal unless it knows quantities of radioactive waste are limited - that is, that Germany will eventually abandon nuclear power generation.</p>

			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> INGLEWOOD EX-PRINCIPAL'S FATE TO BE DETERMINED IN NEW VOTE  </P> <P> Inglewood school board members reversed themselves this week and voted to  demote rather than fire a former high school principal accused of embezzling  school funds.  </P> <P> But that 2-1 vote was illegal because two of the five board members had left  Monday's school board meeting and three votes are required to approve an  action, officials said Wednesday. At the recommendation of lawyers for the Los  Angeles County Counsel, a special meeting has been scheduled for this afternoon  to consider once again Supt. George McKenna's recommendation to demote rather  than fire Leonard Matthews, the former principal of Hillcrest High School.  </P> <P> Matthews diverted at least $4,000 from employee paychecks, a school store and  private donations to his personal use while he was principal of Hillcrest High  School, according to a sworn statement by police investigators. A yearlong  investigation found that Matthews used school money for personal expenses,  including clothes, cosmetics and an outdoor Nativity set, according to the  affidavit. The case has been turned over to the district attorney's office.  </P> <P> In October, the school board voted to initiate dismissal proceedings against  Matthews, who had been reassigned to work as a central office administrator  when investigations by police and the district began late in 1987.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Demotion Instead  </P> <P> This week, however, board members voted to rescind the dismissal action.  Instead, they voted to demote Matthews from his $55,000-a-year administrative  post to an unspecified teaching position paying $42,000 a year.  </P> <P> Board members Larry Aubry and Joseph Rouzan voted in favor of rescinding the  decision to dismiss Matthews. Board members Caroline Coleman and Lois Hill-Hale  left the meeting early but expressed support for demoting rather than firing  Matthews.  </P> <P> Zyra McCloud, the only board member who opposed the decision to drop dismissal  proceedings, complained that other board members were being lenient with  Matthews because he had worked on their political campaigns.  </P> <P> The district has evidence that about $10,000 was misspent and Matthews has  agreed to pay that amount in restitution, board members said.  </P> <P> Matthews had no comment Monday evening, when his attorney met with school  district attorneys before the board meeting. His attorney, Carl Douglas, also  had no comment.  </P> <P> Consulted by a reporter on the legality of the 2-1 vote, County Atty. Edward  Pozorski said Wednesday that the state Education Code states that school board  actions must be approved by a majority of the membership -- or three members of  the five-member Inglewood board -- not just a majority of those present.  </P> <P> "If you have a five-member board, you need three votes to do anything,"  Pozorski said. "It's immaterial how many board members are present."  </P> <P> A district spokeswoman said Wednesday that county lawyers told district  officials a new meeting would be necessary.  </P> <P> McCloud, district employees and others said Matthews was treated leniently  because he has worked on the political campaigns of Aubry, Coleman, Hill-Hale  and Rouzan. McCloud said the dismissal action should proceed to a hearing  before the state Commission on Professional Competence.  </P> <P> "My vote would be not to rescind this decision, because of the controversy and  the political ramifications," McCloud said Monday. "We need to send it on to  the state."  </P> <P> A district administrator who asked for anonymity said that an employee without  Matthews' connections would have been fired, not demoted, for a similar  offense.  </P> <P> Former board member William (Tony) Draper said McKenna's recommendation  indicates that the new superintendent has caved in to political pressure from  Aubry, Coleman, Hill-Hale and Rouzan, the city's former police chief who was  elected to the board in November.  </P> <P> McKenna, a former Los Angeles high school principal with a national reputation  for toughness and independence, was hired in October and hailed as the man who  would clean up a district crippled by politics. One of McKenna's first actions  as superintendent was to recommend the dismissal of Matthews on administrative  charges of "dishonesty and immoral conduct."  </P> <P> "It's totally crazy," Draper said. "I'm really disappointed in George McKenna."  </P> <P> McKenna and the four board members have denied that their treatment of the  Matthews case has anything to do with politics. McKenna said Tuesday that the  reversal of his recommendation resulted from "new information" -- board members  said it was Matthews' offer to pay restitution -- and a new willingness on the  board to deal with the matter internally. McKenna said the district would  receive "100% restitution" and Matthews could still face dismissal if he is  convicted of a felony.  </P> <P> "My motivation was not political," McKenna said. "I think it was a laudable act  to take. We did not diminish our authority at all. The board has exercised its  decision-making authority in a very forthright way. It has shown it is not  unwilling to make a decision internally. . . . This is very fair to both  sides."  </P> <P> Rouzan, who is up for re-election in April along with Aubry and Coleman, said  he did not feel Matthews had committed a "dismissable offense."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Some Very Foolish Things'  </P> <P> "I think you have to take into account a lot of considerations," Rouzan said.  "I think some very foolish things were done. I think the punishment is  adequate. It was kind of a nickel-and-dime offense that accumulated to a  substantial amount."  </P> <P> Asked if his position conflicts with his law-and-order image, Rouzan said: "If  you look at my track record carefully, it would show that I've always been very  lenient on the first offense. I've always felt that severe punishment should  occur once you step over that line again."  </P> <P> Matthews was previously disciplined by the board in 1987 for using school  district equipment to prepare political flyers for candidates, according to  Coleman and Draper. Rouzan said he was unaware of that.  </P> <P> Aubry said he does not think the Matthews decision will be an election issue.  While he said his vote was not politically motivated, he acknowledged that it  may be perceived that way. He also said that Matthews' adversaries may have  political motivations in pushing for his dismissal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unauthorized Account  </P> <P> The police affidavit, which was filed in Inglewood Municipal Court to obtain a  search warrant, says Matthews spent at least $4,000 in school funds on clothes,  groceries, beauty supplies and an elaborate Christmas Nativity scene for his  east Inglewood home. Much of that money came from an unauthorized bank account,  police said, to which Matthews diverted donations that had been made to the  school: profits from a student store, and money from employee paychecks that  had been padded with extra hours.  </P> <P> In December, Inglewood detectives searched Matthews' home and his four cars --  two Mercedes-Benzes, a Cadillac and a Mercury, according to the affidavit. They  seized numerous personal and school financial records, as well as parts of the  Nativity scene.  </P> <P> The police investigation involved an exhaustive review of school and bank  records and interviews with current and former school employees. It began in  late 1987 when school district officials discovered Matthews' unauthorized bank  account and reported it to police.  </P></p>

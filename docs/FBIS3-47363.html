It should be recalled that after the UNTAC [UN  Transitional Authority in Cambodia] organized elections, the  Vietnamese communists, their puppets, and the entente have  staged a closed-door coup d'etat setting up this current  two-headed government. In the meantime, in August 1993, the  Vietnamese communists and the U.S. entente have mustered up  their forces and launched attack against the Phnum Prah hill and  Phnum Chhat in northern Sisophon, against Stoung in Kompong  Thom, destroying everything, burning down houses, killing people  indiscriminately, and plundering all sorts of property. The  population fled their houses, farms, and rice fields while women  were raped savagely.    What is the true nature of this act?    Firstly, it is actually the continuation of the Vietnamese  aggression war against Cambodia.    Secondly, it is an act of flaming the war by the U.S.  entente  through the two-headed government set up by them. They have  mustered up their destructive forces in order to fight against  Democratic Kampuchea.    Therefore, who started the war at the end of 1978 and who  continued to fan the flames of war by launching attacks against  Phnum Chhat and Stoung last August? And who mapped out the  so-called largest military operation ever against Anlung Veng in  last September?    Presently, overexcited by their criminal feats in Phnum  Chhat  and Stoung, the Vietnamese communists, their puppets, and the  entente hurriedly mounted a largest operation aimed at capturing  Anlung Veng. In this regard, the puppet Hun Sen has shouted:  "Fight, fight, fight. Fight against and totally exterminate the  Khmer Rouge!." While in New York, he went so far as to declare  that he would mobilize up to hundred thousand men and spend  thousand lives to take over the Anlung Veng for Vietnam. Who is  then responsible for the continuation of the current Vietnamese  war of aggression? However, their large-scale military  operation against Phnum Chhat in September 1993 met with  crushing defeat.    II. Since November and December 1993, the two-headed  government, Hun Sen, and others, have talked only about fight,  fight, fight. They have called for launching military campaigns  and making war against the Khmer Rouge. All these are  Vietnamese communist slogans who have used them for a long time  against the nation and people of Cambodia. They have not said a  word about national reconciliation. They have overlooked and  failed to notice the fact that Democratic Kampuchea has  succeeded in defending and safeguarding the Cambodian nation and  people because it forms part and parcel of the whole nation and  people. In other words, because the nation and people have  always been with Democratic Kampuchea in its struggle against  the Vietnamese aggressors.    Specifically, since the end of October 1993, the Vietnamese  communists, their puppets, and the U.S. entente have mapped out  and prepared their military campaigns of the 16th dry season  against Anlung Veng, Stoung, Malai, and Pailin. This is a large  mobilization of forces of the Vietnamese communists and of the  U.S.-financed forces. The U.S. and France are the financial  backers. They, together with Australia, have also been  responsible for the propaganda and psychological warfare  campaign. They have done all this with the aim of destroying  the Khmer Rouge, making it impossible to be part of a national  army and in the government. Their goal is to force the Khmer  Rouge, through military means, to accept their three-point  conditions, namely laying down their arms, handing over the  Democratic Kampuchea-held areas, and dissolving the National  Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK].    They have propagandized repeatedly about those conditions.  They have opposed the king's five-point guideline for national  reconciliation. The whole nation and people of Cambodia have  welcomed and supported the king's five points. Still, they are  adamantly oppose to them. In so doing, they aim at putting  aside the king's five-point guideline, preventing the roundtable  meeting or talks on national reconciliation and unity.    III. What are the concrete results of these military  campaigns?    They have launched these large-scale operations since  November 1993 but they met with crushing defeats in December  last and this early January. What are the causes of their  failure?    Firstly, they lack fighting forces. The people are strongly  against them. They are against the war. Some who have been  enlisted by force have deserted for lack of money, salaries,  rice, salt, et cetera. The people need to care about their own  lives. They refuse to be killed for the two-headed government,  the Vietnamese communists, and the entente. They don't want to  die and they don't want to see the nation and people disappear.    Secondly, they lack ammunition. So far, no one has agreed to  sell them ammunition. Everybody wants peace and national  reconciliation in Cambodia.    Thirdly, they have no economy, no food. In the course of the  13th, 14th, and 15th years of the Vietnamese war of aggression,  everything has been plundered. The country has been devastated.  The people's land, water, and cattle have been destroyed.  Moreover, the two-headed government has conscripted them into  the army. As a result, the economy is in a shambles. In such a  situation, they have been forced to put off their military  campaigns again and again. They have postponed their initial 17  December 1993 plan to early January 1994.    Their activities and failure can be summed up as follows:    1. Malai battlefield. They launched a three-pronged  military attack on the 1 January 1994: the first prong along the  Mongkolborei river; the second from Route 5 to Dong Aranh; and  the third from Poipet into Thailand at Nang E, aimed at  attacking from the rear. They deployed infantry along Route 5  backed by several pieces of heavy artillery, multiple rocket  launchers, and armored vehicles.    The forces in this campaign were the 12th Division at Nimit  in charge of the Banteay Meanchey region; the 6th Division  stationed along the Stoeng Mongkolborei river; and the 7th and  8th divisions, respectively stationed along Route 69 and at  Phnum Srok. All together, four divisions from the Vietnamese  communist puppets, ANKI [National Army of Independent Cambodia],  and Dien Del [Khmer People's National Liberation Front] forces.    The NADK and the people in the Malai region were aware of  this scheme beforehand. Together, they foiled this so-called  large-scale military campaign by displaying their high spirit of  strong determination and responsibility toward the nation and  people, preventing the enemy from carrying out their strategy  and tactics to destroy the national forces and the people and to  swallow up Cambodia. In the course of fighting which lasted for  three days from 1-3 January 1994, the NADK and people  successfully held the military campaign in check using mines,  booby traps, and attacking from the front, the rear, and the  flanks. This was combined with some heavy artillery along with  political and economic activities.    During this campaign, Pol Saroeun, the puppet military  commander in Phnom Penh; Hul Savoan from Battambang and Prum  Moranak, the zone military commander, were shamefully beaten  back. These Vietnamese puppets were defeated but their masters  continued stubbornly to desperately carry out their strategy.    The Cambodian nation and people and the NADK living in the  Malai region remain vigilant and prepare to struggle against the  enemy. The latter must clearly realize that Democratic Kampuchea  enjoys the support of the whole nation and people. Thus an  attack against Democratic Kampuchea would amount to an attack  against the whole nation and people. In the past, they have  mounted countless attacks--large or medium or small--against  Democratic Kampuchea. But they all failed. If they pursue  their venture, the result would surely be the same, as in the  case of the Vietnamese aggressors in the last 13 years.    2. Anlung Veng battlefield: They have prepared their  military campaign against Anlung Veng and the Dangrek zone since  November 1993. But they have failed to carry it out for lack of  fighting forces, ammunition, and food.    At the end of December, they tried again by dividing their  forces in three prongs: the first from Route 68, particularly  from Samraong eastward; the second from Varin and Sre Noy in  Siem Reap Province; and the third from Kulen in Preah Vihear  Province. Their combined forces deployed in that campaign  include those of the Vietnamese communist puppets, ANKI, and  Dien Del under the command of many so-called generals based on  Route 68. Among them were Pol Saroeun, (Chuon Sovantha), (Uy  Sopheap), Long Sopheap, Keo Pisit, (Prak Sovanna), and Nhoek  Bunchhai. All of them were in desperate straits. Thus, their  forces were decimated by mines everyday, armored vehicles were  destroyed, and corpses were left on the ground.    It is to be recalled that during their large-scale  operations last September, their forces suffered a heavy loss by  mines, malaria, and starvation. Besides, in order to attack  Anlung Veng, they mobilized their forces in Ampil, Ku, Romchong,  Thmar Puok, Kouk Mon, Kouk Khpos, Boeng Trakuon, and Banteay  Chhma before sending them to Route 68 and Anlung Veng. But the  NADK and the population have attacked their bases both on the  east and west of Route 68 making them flee in disarray.    As a result, the Route 68 battlefield and the enemy forces  were divided in two parts, causing serious harm to the  Vietnamese puppet forces' Divisions 286, 179, and 3 at O Smach,  the 9th Division on Route 68, the 8th at Phnum Srok, and the 7th  on Route 69.    The present fighting causes panic among the two-headed  government's forces. They desert daily in large numbers. Field  commanders dare not show up in the field. Only the rank and  file do so. But the latter refuse to die for their commanders,  for the two-headed government, the Vietnamese communists, and  the entente whose only objective is to exterminate the Cambodian  nation and people.    In summary, one can say that the military campaign against  Anlung Veng was transformed into the battlefields east and west  of Route 68, that of Varin-Siem Reap and Kulen-Preah Vihear,  which form a large and active fighting area directly affecting  the Vietnamese puppet forces, the U.S.-supported forces, and the  entente who are responsible for the continuation of the war in  Cambodia.    It should be noted that in this battlefield, the people who  have been angry since last September 1993 were actively  participating in making the two-headed government's military  campaign a failure. The enemy forces can be compared to people  entering a bush fire which engulfs them from all sides.    3. Stoung battlefield in Kompong Thom Province. They have  launched operations on the Stoung battlefield and Route 12 for  quite some time. Their puppet commanders have been mobilized  for that purpose. They began to seriously prepare their  campaign in November and December 1993. However, they were  successively checked by the NADK and the local population.    All people in Kompong Thom, soldiers, policemen, even  foreigners, were fully aware of who attacked whom. The  population and the NADK in Stoung, exercising their right to  self-defense, fought back and put them to rout. The main causes  for their defeat are:    A. The nation and people of Cambodia, as well as the  peace-loving countries the world over, are opposed to the  continuation of the Vietnamese war of aggression.    B. The people want national reconciliation and peace while  they flame the war.    C. The enemy forces have committed mass killing destroying  everything. As a result, people have fled their homes and  villages and taken refuge in forests. These people have then  become a people's force of hundreds of thousands of men and  women fighting back both militarily and economically. They cut  off the enemy's supply routes, laid mines and booby traps, and  encouraged and called on their children to desert.    Therefore, the NADK has closely identified with hundreds of  thousands of people and together fought against enemy forces  everywhere like sparrows landing in a ricefield.    Democratic Kampuchea should not be looked (?alone) as a  litter. It is closely linked and united with the people and all  the national forces, making it an enormous force fighting for  the defense and security of the Cambodian nation and people to  this day.    One may ask whether the aggressors fighting against the  whole  Cambodian nation and people have lost or won their war. They  cannot escape defeat before the nation and people of Cambodia,  who are so oppressed by anger that they would fight [word  indistinct] to the end.    IV. How to resolve the Cambodia conflict    The only way is to achieve national reconciliation based on  the five-point guideline of Samdech Euv, His Majesty the King.  This five-point guideline represents the profound aspiration of  the nation and people of Cambodia and that of peace-loving  countries in the world.    Whoever challenges these five points is against the  Cambodian  nation and people and against peace-loving countries in the  world, in particular those in the region. Therefore, the trend  of the Cambodian nation and people is leading toward national  reconciliation in order to restore peace and provide opportunity  for the rebuilding of the country and raising the people's  standard of living. This would contribute to stability in the  region as well.    Hence, the beginning of 1994 is the last occasion for the  thorough assessment of the situation. The fighting has lasted  for already 13, 14, and 15 years. It must end. What has  happened to the Vietnamese aggressors who have been well-known  for their fighting skills? All the people have already learned  this lesson. They have to see clearly who is with Democratic  Kampuchea, that is, the whole nation and people of Cambodia.    The five-point guideline of Samdech Euv is of paramount  importance. Democratic Kampuchea has been now acclaimed as the  one who holds the banner of national reconciliation and fights  for that purpose. This is to say that the people and Democratic  Kampuchea are one. Whoever opposes national reconciliation and  continues the war would be doomed to fade away.    [Dated] 10 January 1994    [Signed] The spokesman of the NADK.</p>

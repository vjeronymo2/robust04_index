			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Observer: Early bird Whatever other sorts of soldiers do, ex-paratroopers apparently never even fade away. Take for example the performance of near 77-year-old Sydney Robin at yesterday's Control Securities annual meeting. Pressed to take on the executive chairmanship when former boss Nazmu Virani was arrested in connection with the BCCI affair, Robin has been working full time trying to balance the competing claims of banks, shareholders and bondholders. Those who remember him at Great Universal Stores - he was known to take off a shoe in a meeting and bang it on the table Khrushchev-style - will not be surprised at the success of the tough line he took with the shareholders. All the resolutions were carried, and the proceedings were over by 10am. That led Robin to sympathise with the assembled company, who'd been called out for a 9 o'clock start in case the meeting carried on for hours. He himself had been in the office since 7.</p>

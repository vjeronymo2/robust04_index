			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / IMF and Egypt in loan accord THE International Monetary Fund has endorsed Egypt's compliance with the Fund's first stand-by agreement with the country, triggering the forgiveness of Dollars 3bn worth of official debt and enabling the start of talks on a fresh stand-by accord, writes Mark Nicholson in Cairo. The Fund's board approved Egypt's economic reforms late on Thursday in Washington, freeing the final tranche of a Dollars 370m loan agreed in a deal originally struck with the IMF in May 1991. Endorsement of the programme had been due by last November, but was delayed first by disagreement over the scale of cuts in Egypt's budget deficit, then by IMF concern over the speed of the government's privatisation programme. Thursday's approval signals IMF satisfaction with Cairo's progress on both. Talks can now begin on a second stand-by agreement with the IMF which, if approved, would trigger further debt forgiveness under the terms of a Paris Club deal agreed with Egypt in 1991.</p>

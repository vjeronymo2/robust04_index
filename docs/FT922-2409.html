			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market report GOLD held steady on the London bullion market, maintaining support at Dollars 342 a troy ounce. 'Gold hasn't really done anything since its rally up last Thursday and Friday. We're not sure whether the precious metals are consolidating or running out of steam. Short covering doesn't seem to be a solid basis for a bull run,' said one dealer. Others said gold had held above Dollars 340 in the absence of feared producer selling and might be able to hold around Dollars 341 if good physical offtake emerged. The key upside target on the charts remains Dollars 345. London's September COCOA contract touched a new 16 1/2 -year low of Pounds 529 a tonne before recovering most of the loss by the close. Dealers said the market continued to be pressured by sentiment that key origins still have substantial tonnages to sell. On the LME three-month TIN consolidated above Dollars 6,600 a tonne, absorbing selling, with the market maintaining its uptrend. In Chicago WHEAT remained higher at midsession, with support keyed to short covering after recent losses, and in sympathy with moderate gains in maize and soyabeans. New York raw SUGAR touched lifetime highs in early trading.</p>

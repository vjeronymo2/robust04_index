			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Articles by Aleksandr Pilat and Vitaliy Portnikov under the </F> heading: "The Crimea Train Has Left?: The Inhabitants of the  Autonomy Have Supported Their President Once Again"]    [Text] Following the elections to the Supreme Council of  Crimea and the poll of residents on the peninsula, Yuriy  Meshkov's slogan "Reunification of Crimea and Russia Is My  Goal," thanks to which he in fact won, is acquiring increasingly  real outlines. But, as Viktor Alsufyev, chairman of the Central  Election Commission of Crimea, declared at a news conference on  28 March, elections were not held in five of the 66 districts  because there was a turnout of less than half of the electorate.  Repeat elections will be held in these districts. In 10  districts the deputies have already been elected, and they all  represent the Russia bloc (it was this bloc, we would recall,  that brought Yuriy Meshkov to power). It is mainly candidates of  the Russia bloc that have gone on to the second round scheduled  for 10 April, and it is they that have realistic changes of  victory.    The Russia bloc is leading in the vote by party slate also.  The Kurultay of the Crimean Tatar People was the winner in the  Crimean Tatar multiple-seat national district: According to  preliminary figures, it has won 13 of the 14 seats in the  Supreme Council of Crimea. One seat, evidently, will be gained  by the opponent of the Kurultay--the Crimean Tatar National  Movement, which, incidentally, supports the Russia bloc.  Deputies for four single-seat national districts--Armenian,  Greek, Bulgarian, and German--were elected also.    Observers note that the most radical deputies in respect to  Russia: Anatoliy Los, chairman of the Crimea Russian Society,  and Aleksandr Kruglov, chairman of the Russian Party of  Sevastopol and currently a deputy of the Supreme Council of  Crimea and the Sevastopol City Council, did not make it to the  second round. Sergey Shuvaynikov, chairman of the Russian Party  of Crimea, and Viktor Mezha, chairman of the People's Party of  Crimea, which is a member of the Russia bloc, made it through to  the second round from a Simferopol district. It is assumed that  Mezha has the best chance of being elected.    As observers believe, representatives of the Russia bloc  will  obtain in the future parliament no fewer than two-thirds of the  seats, which is entirely sufficient for the adoption of any  constitutional decision. And if the representatives of the  Kurultay in parliament boycott the adoption of this decision or  the other, this will have no legal consequences.    The Central Election Commission, which was appointed by the  president of the Republic of Crimea, is tallying the results of  the poll of inhabitants of the peninsula. As Sergey Nikulin,  aide to the president of the Republic of Crimea, said in  conversation with our NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent, "the  poll was conducted under referendum conditions" (we would recall  that questions concerning treaty relations of Crimea and  Ukraine, dual citizenship, and on an edict of the president of  Crimea having legislative force were asked in the poll). Sergey  Nikulin informed our NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent that,  according to preliminary figures, more than 60 percent of the  electorate had taken part in the poll, as in the elections. "No  fewer than 80 percent of those who took part in the ballot,  possibly more, responded 'for' to all three questions." The  figures for Simferopol are already final: 84 percent responded  affirmatively to the first question, 87.8 percent to the second,  and 83.6 percent to the third.    And although the poll is not legally binding, observers are  convinced that at the first session of the new Supreme Council  of Crimea the deputies will recognize it as a referendum with  all the ensuing consequences. It is hard to say as yet what Kiev  would do in such a case. Much will depend on the new parliament  of Ukraine.    On 28 March a news conference for Crimean, Ukrainian, and  foreign journalists was conducted by the leaders of the Crimean  Tatar National Movement Organization, which supports the  Kurultay of the Crimean Tatar People, the Ukrainian Citizens  Congress of Crimea, the Crimea organization of the Ukrainian  Republican Party, and the Crimea With Ukraine Committee. It  spoke of the illegality of the poll of inhabitants of the  peninsula, which, according to the organizers of the news  conference, was boycotted by the majority of Crimean Tatars and  Ukrainians. A joint statement was read out to the journalists,  which said: "The greatest urgency is attached at this worrying  time to the cooperation of the Crimean Tatar and pro-Ukraine  organizations. The Ukrainian organizations will be even more  scrupulous in their defense of the rights and interests of the  Crimean Tatars via their central offices in Kiev and via their  deputies in the Supreme Council of Ukraine. The Crimean Tatar  National Movement Organization will support the Ukrainian  organizations on questions of the preservation of the  territorial integrity of Ukraine and the affirmation of  Ukrainian statehood on the territory of Crimea."    As already reported, Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the  State Duma of the Russian Federation CIS Committee, and Sergey  Stankevich, member of the State Duma of the Russian Federation  International Affairs Committee, are in Crimea as election  observers. They are both part of the leadership of the Party of  Russian Unity and Accord. In the evening of 28 March Zatulin and  Stankevich declared that "Ukraine and Crimea are confronted with  the need for a reform of power. The political elite of Ukraine  is not wholly prepared for the challenge of the times, not  wholly prepared for federalism." Stankevich declared that  "resolution of the problem of the Black Sea Fleet is a matter of  the next three months."    Konstantin Zatulin and Sergey Stankevich met with Yuriy  Meshkov, president of the Republic of Crimea, Viktor Semenov,  chairman of the Sevastopol City Council, Mustafa Dzhemilev,  chairman of the Majlis of the Crimean Tatar People, and his  deputy, Refat Chubarov, who was elected, incidentally, deputy of  the Supreme Council of Crimea for the Crimean Tatar single-seat  national district.    [Signed] Aleksandr Pilat    There is nothing sensational about the results of the  Crimean  poll, come to that: It would have been odd had the inhabitants  of the peninsula, who had quite recently elected Yuriy Meshkov  their president, suddenly denied his first major initiative  their trust. The question now is exclusively one of how the  Crimean leadership wishes to dispose of the results of this  poll--especially since it will now have at its disposal a  controlled parliament, in which representatives of Meshkov's  Russia bloc constitute the majority. On the eve of the second  round of parliamentary elections in Ukraine and, particularly,  before what are now entirely possible presidential elections,  Leonid Kravchuk has found himself faced with a new insoluble  problem.    The tactics chosen in respect to the Crimean aspirations  were  fool-proof, seemingly: They were based on the cooperation of two  bureaucratic teams. One of them, Kiev's, gave its Simferopol  counterpart carte-blanche, demanding in exchange merely  nondisruption of the territorial status quo. Thus in the place  of Crimea Oblast appeared the Republic of Crimea, in the place  of the oblast soviet, the Supreme Council, and provincial  politicians began to call themselves ministers, speakers,  presidents.... Nikolay Bagrov's fiasco confounded this  protracted tightrope flirting. President Meshkov has obtained a  fortunate opportunity to avail himself of the attributive  achievements of his predecessor to acquire real power. Kiev,  which is endeavoring to preserve the status quo, can hardly opt  for some successful version of relations with the peninsula. But  the development of events around Crimea could prove undesirable  for Moscow also: It is, for all that, a question of a peninsula,  not an island, and if Yuriy Meshkov suddenly conceives a desire  to play his role through to the end and become a Simferopol  Vladislav Ardzinba, a dangerous new conflict would then unfold  not in the Caucasus but on Russia's European borders.

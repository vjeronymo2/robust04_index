			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Survey of Uganda (7): Brewing up exports of tea and coffee - Leslie Crawford investigates the revival in agriculture Along the south-western route to Mbarara, the steady traffic of lorries piled high with plantains is evidence of Uganda's agricultural recovery. Political stability has breathed new life into war-shattered villages, while the liberalisation of agricultural prices has lured peasants out of subsistence farming into cash crops. Rural Uganda is humming with the activity of carpenters, bricklayers, bicycle repair men and tailors. The once bare shelves of village shops are again filled with goods. But the poverty which engulfs most rural households is testimony to 25 years of foregone development. Uganda today produces only 20 per cent of the cotton it grew in 1970, and less than half the tea crop of pre-Idi Amin years. Sugar and coffee have yet to recover pre-1970 production levels. It is a sad indictment for a country uncommonly blessed with fertile soils and abundant rainfall. More than 80 per cent of land is suitable for agriculture, compared with less than 20 per cent in neighbouring Kenya. 'Uganda should be the grain basket of the region, but only one third of its land area is being sensibly cultivated,' says James Cartwright, a consultant on agricultural exports. 'It should be exporting maize and beans and plantains to neighbouring countries. These are the crops that hold the greatest export-earning potential.' The Robusta coffee grown by thousands of peasant farmers in western Uganda forms the backbone of the export economy. Coffee earned Dollars 106m, or two-thirds of Uganda's export revenues last year. Production is responding to firmer international prices and marketing reforms which have generated greater returns for producers. Government officials are cautiously optimistic over the recent surge in international coffee prices, which have more than doubled to almost Dollars 1 a pound in the past 12 months. If prices hold, Uganda's coffee exports could earn Dollars 250m, according to Uganda's Coffee Development Authority. For the first time since the collapse of the International Coffee Organisation cartel in 1989, the price gains would allow Uganda to meet its external debt repayments from its coffee earnings, and even reduce its dependence on foreign aid to cover its Dollars 700m-a-year import bill. The Coffee Development Authority estimates production in the 1993-94 season, which ends in September, at 2.5m 60-kg bags (150,000 tonnes), up from 2.09m bags in 1992/93. Both production and international coffee prices, however, remain below those of the commodity boom of the late 1970s, when coffee earned Uganda more than Dollars 400m a year. In a bid to revive the sector, the government abolished export taxes on coffee in 1992, liberalised producer prices and licensed private traders. The old Coffee Marketing Board, which monopolised coffee exports until 1990, is now a government-owned trading company competing with 36 private exporters. The private sector has scooped up more than 70 per cent of the coffee trade, with fierce competition pushing up the prices paid to farmers. Uganda, however, is still paying the price for the political upheaval and misguided agricultural policies of the past. 'Our coffee plantations are old and in poor shape,' says Dr Peter Ngategize, research and development manager at the Coffee Development Authority. 'We have to invest in research and extension services to improve the quality and productivity of our shambas (farms).' He says Uganda is slowly rehabilitating its coffee nurseries and selecting new Robusta strains to replace old bushes. Great hopes are also being pinned on the revival of the tea sector, which once produced more than 25,000 tonnes a year. Tea production almost ceased when the foreign owners of large estates left Uganda in the 1970s. The return of UK companies such as James Finley, and the rehabilitation of estates, has increased output from 1,200 tonnes in 1982 to 12,320 tonnes last year. Little tea, however, has been planted since 1978, and the production from tough old bushes is not of export quality. Consequently, tea exports earned a meagre Dollars 11m last year. Foreign investors, however, have detected Uganda's potential to become a quality tea exporter. A freshly-painted sign outside the Ankole tea estate near Bushenyi in western Uganda reveals a recent change of ownership. In January, the UK's Commonwealth Development Corporation and James Finley acquired the Ankole estate and five other plantations totalling 3,000 hectares which were being privatised by the government. At the Ankole estate, Eric Mugambage, the factory manager, is proud to have kept the operation running throughout the Amin years and Uganda's civil war, although he regrets that the quality of his tea has declined. 'The bushes are old, the stalks are hard and we haven't been able to afford the application of fertilizer for a long time,' he says. The tea factory, where the leaves are withered, fermented and then dried, is also in need of new equipment. The drying kilns are fuelled with wood: diesel is too expensive and electricity too unreliable. Tom Harrison of CDC says the other estates are also overgrown and in poor shape. 'Our aim is to put quite a lot of money into rehabilitating the factories and fields,' he says. 'We will be exporting the tea to generate foreign exchange for Uganda.' A Dollars 24m investment programme is expected to boost output at CDC's Ugandan tea estates from 1,000 to 9,000 tonnes over the next eight years.</p>

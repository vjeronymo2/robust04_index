			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "NTV" newscast; passages within quotation marks </F> recorded]    [Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro returned to Havana  after completing his activities in Cartagena, Colombia, during  the Fourth Ibero-American Summit. Just hours before his  departure, Fidel commented to journalists who were covering the  summit on his impressions of the event.    [Reporter] "Commander, Cuba has been present at the four  summits. What has Cuba's contribution been in these summits and  how have these summits benefited Cuba?"    [Castro] "Well, I would say that Cuba has made a  contribution  with its very presence. Its presence there is something that is  exceptional, new, and unprecedented. For the first time, there  was no exclusion. Mexico had much to do with that as well as our  other important Latin American friends. Therefore, Cuba's  presence gives the summit more seriousness and dignity because  the cowardly exclusion is no longer committed."    Fidel's last hours in Cartagena were marked by an emotional  encounter with Colombian solidarity groups, which motivated  comments by the Cuban president on continental integration.    [Castro] "I would also say that men and women like you  around  the world are going to destroy the walls of that gigantic  Jericho that tries to defeat and crush Cuba and the Cuban  Revolution, and that tries to crush the brotherhood and union  among all our peoples."</p>

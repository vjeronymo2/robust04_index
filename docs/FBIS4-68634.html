			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by N. Sadraddinbekov: "Civil Aviation Development </F> Program Set"]    [Text] "The Decree `On Development of Azerbaijan's Civil  Aviation,' issued by the republic Cabinet of Ministers,  envisages the appropriation of credit to further improve the  quality of the republic's civil aviation and bring it up to  world standards," Maksud Asadov, director of Baku air  transportation company (BTA) AZAL-AVIA, said in an interview to  EKONOMIKA AZERBAYDZHANA. He said that the development program  covers the period through the year 2005 and includes, in  particular, upgrading AZAL airline flying stock by adding such  new airliners as the Boeing-707, Boeing-757, and Tu-154M. An  agreement has been reached with the American aviation company  ALG (Aviation Leasing Group) to deliver aircraft of the Boeing  family to Baku. Flight crews and technical personnel of the AZAL  company are currently undergoing internship training in Dallas  and Miami (the United States). The training is conducted by  specialists from the Buffalo Airways airline.    M. Asadov also reported that from 5 May to 6 June AZAL is  planning to implement the Hajj-94 program, which envisages  taking pilgrims to the holy places of Jeddah and Mecca. The  expected profit from this is about $1 million.    "The problem of nonpayments between the AZAL airline and  partner enterprises in CIS countries is aggravating the problem  of deliveries of spare parts, components, and systems needed for  aviation equipment to function normally." Maksud Asadov noted an  increased frequency of instances of delays in money transfers.  According to M. Asadov, the airline's existing clearing accounts  in a number of CIS cities also operate unsatisfactorily. In  addition, in airports of some CIS cities where the Azerbaijani  airline's aircraft fly, payment for technical service of the  aircraft is sometimes demanded in cash, which is practically  impossible.    There are also a number of problems with respect to capital  construction. For instance, construction work has been suspended  on a new airport complex and a new take-off and landing strip,  which is being rebuilt by specialists from the German concern  Wirtgen. With respect to the latter project the airline owes the  German company 3 million German marks.</p>

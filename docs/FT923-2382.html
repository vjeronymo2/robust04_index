			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Pressure grows for Germans to hold their own referendum A NARROW Yes vote in France in favour of the Maastricht Treaty on European union on Sunday would strengthen the campaign for a referendum in Germany, according to political analysts. A No vote would bring the entire ratification process in the German parliament to a standstill, while the whole European Community takes stock of the situation. Already the campaign for a referendum, hitherto not a serious possibility, is gathering more substantial supporters. Mr Peter Gauweiler, the Bavarian environment minister, a leading figure in the Christian Social Union (CSU) and the man who coined the phrase 'Esperanto-money' for the future European currency, yesterday issued a public appeal for such a move. He was joined by Mr Manfred Brunner, of the Free Democrats (FDP), the chef de cabinet of Mr Manfred Bangemann, the senior German commissioner in Brussels. Mr Brunner, whose anti-Maastricht views have been long known, was immediately sacked from his post in the Commission. There is also growing support for a referendum among the opposition Social Democrats, who are already campaigning for such popular votes to be included in the rewritten German constitution. On the other hand, a clear majority of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the CSU remain opposed to any such vote, not least because they fear the issue is too complicated, and it would become confused with domestic politics - as in France. If the French decision is No, then the Social Democrats believe that the entire ratification process - due to begin with a first reading in the Bundestag on October 7 - should be abandoned. The CDU is more cautious, suggesting that it should merely be put on ice until the future is clear. SPD strategists also believe the contents of Maastricht should simply be set aside, and European integration pursued through 'functional integration' issue by issue, rather than through attempts at 'institutional integration' as in the Maastricht Treaty. They admit that such an attitude might put them close to the position of Britain's Mr John Major, but believe it would be the only realistic way to continue the integration process.</p>

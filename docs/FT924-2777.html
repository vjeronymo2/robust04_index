			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1992 (23): Risks are quickly assessed - Mortgage applications THE PROCESS of getting a mortgage was at one time helped enormously by the rapport the borrower established with the lender. This would dictate how much effort went into following up references and credit enquiries. Nowadays, in the computer, the lender has a powerful ally in the battle against fraudulent applications, taking over much of the work that used to require human involvement. It can trigger automatic searches of remote databases over the telephone lines without user intervention. Underwriters can now assess risk, knowing that the computer has armed them with every piece of information which they need. One company which makes very sophisticated use of computing and communications technology is the Household Mortgage Corporation. Using the entries in the mortgage application form, its Assist Computer system can immediately trigger enquiries into the personal circumstances of the applicant. By connecting to the Infolink Consumer Database, it can find out whether the employer is doing well, whether the individual has a history of bad debt, or whether they have a county court judgment against them. HMC's own Unisys computer system holds information about how successful loans have been to different types of borrower in the past. The company plans to re-assess this information periodically, to ensure that emerging behaviour patterns are being trapped. This knowledge is matched against the searched information, the personal details (age, sex, present accommodation) of the applicant and details of the loan, in order to assess the risk. When all the information has been gathered and weighed by the computer, its conclusions and supporting information are presented to the underwriter for further interpretation. Richard Anderson, head of underwriting at HMC, started thinking about the possibilities of a new computer system in 1989 - 'we had a high standard of underwriting, and we wanted to maintain this when the volume of business rose again,' he says. 'Our industry has a history of great peaks and great troughs, but we cannot staff for the peaks. We have to be consistently prudent, whatever the business pattern. We want to check every mortgage application without increasing the number of staff. Therefore, mechanical assistance was needed.' IN his search for a computer system which would meet the unusual needs of his organisation, he found many packages which did part of the job but nothing which matched exactly. In the end, he chose Infolink Decision Services because it was prepared to build something specially for the company. Infolink had built intelligent systems for other companies so it understood HMC's requirements. The on-line costs are minimal, compared with the amounts of money involved in a loan, and although the company makes heavy use of Infolink, it still pays on a search by search basis, the cost per search falling as the volume rises. The system has brought all the benefits expected, including an ability to turn a loan application round in 24 hours. Mr Anderson considers all new sources of electronic data as they become available. For example, a historical voter's roll has now been developed, so it is easy to check on how long applicants have lived at their current address. Land registry records will prove invaluable once they become computerised. He advises potential users of similar systems to be absolutely clear about what they want to achieve before approaching the application developers and data providers. 'There are no magic answers,' he says. With this kind of sophisticated system, no-one is going to deliver it off-the-shelf.</p>

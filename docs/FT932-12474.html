			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / UK Company News: BAe expects recovery in 1994 BRITISH AEROSPACE, which reported a Pounds 201m pre-tax loss last year before a Pounds 1bn exceptional restructuring charge, would show solid recovery in 1994, Mr John Cahill, chairman, told the annual meeting. He said cash outflows this year associated with the 20 per cent stake in Airbus, regional aircraft rationalisation costs and investment in Tornado fighter aircraft production were expected to be reversed next year. Although the company still had to address the difficulties in its turbopropeller aircraft business, Mr Cahill expressed optimism over the future. This optimism has been reflected in recent weeks by the sharp improvement in the share price, which has recovered from a low of 98p last year to more than 320p. Mr Cahill said there had been an improvement in the medium-term outlook for defence profits following additional Tornado orders from Saudi Arabia and continued demand for Hawk and Harrier aircraft. Although the European Fighter Aircraft programme, now renamed Eurofighter 2000, continued to face pressures and uncertainty, Mr Cahill said he was confident that development would be completed to enable deliveries of the new fighter to start at the end of the century. 'Eurofighter will be vital to our performance into the next century,' he said, emphasising that the programme's long-term importance for the UK aerospace industry could not be overstated. Mr Cahill was also optimistic over the Rover car subsidiary's prospects. Although the UK upturn was partially offset by big falls in car demand in other European markets, Mr Cahill said the combination of favourable exchange rates, cost reductions and development of a strong product range would enable Rover to move through its break-even point this year. He thus confirmed the earlier forecast that Rover would be profitable this year after two years of losses. Mr Cahill said the European Airbus would continue to consume cash this year, largely because of the introduction of the new A330/A340 wide-body airliners. He was confident, however, that Airbus would become a significant cash contributor to BAe in the longer term.</p>

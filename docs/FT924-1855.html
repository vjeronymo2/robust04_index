			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Manufacturing output increases 0.3% in October 0.3 per cent - was fuelled by buoyant growth in chemicals and electrical engineering. The boost to chemicals came mainly from strong export growth, while output was higher across the electrical engineering sector. This was the first rise in manufacturing output since June, although output has maintained roughly the same levels since the beginning of the year. The latest official figures confirm that overall factory production remains flat. In the three months to the end of the October - a period the Central Statistical Office says is a better measure of manufacturing trends - output fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.2 per cent, and was 0.1 per cent lower compared with the corresponding three months a year ago. The biggest falls over the three months to October occurred in the metals sector, where a sharp drop in steel production caused the output of metal goods to fall 0.6 per cent compared with the previous month, and 2.5 per cent compared with a year ago. That was offset by robust car production. The sector enjoyed strong exports in October for the second month running and almost maintained the level of output achieved in September after August's very sharp fall. In the three months to the end of October, output was 2.4 per cent lower compared with the previous three months, but 5.4 per cent higher than the same period a year ago. Food, drink and tobacco production dropped 4.7 per cent over the three months to October compared with the previous three months. That followed exceptionally high output in May and June, when warm weather boosted sales of soft drinks and beer. Output in the remaining manufacturing sectors was flat. Clothing and footwear production was at the same level between August and October. The output of paper, printing and publishing has been unchanged since June. The 1.2 per cent rise in industrial output - which includes the output of energy industries - was due to higher energy production. Oil and gas extraction in the three months to the end of October was 8.6 per cent higher than in the previous three months, mainly reflecting the very cold weather in that month, one of the coldest Octobers on record. Other energy and water supply output rose by 3 per cent over the same period. PM upbeat, Page 10</p>

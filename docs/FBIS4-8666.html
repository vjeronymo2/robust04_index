			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Washington, April 14 (TANJUG) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton has written to leaders of Congress that the United  States is prepared to respond to U.N. and NATO calls for action  against Bosnian Serbs in the future as well.    Reporting on U.S.-spearheaded NATO raids on Bosnian Serb  positions around the eastern Bosnian Moslem enclave of Gorazde  on Sunday and Monday, Clinton said that the operation had been  aimed at protecting international peacekeepers deployed in  Bosnia's "safe areas".    Gorazde, as a U.N.-designated "safe area," should have been  demilitarized last spring, but has instead been used by the  Moslems, who have concentrated 10,000 troops there, to launch a  powerful offensive against the Serbs.    When a Serb counter-offensive threatened to crush the Moslem  onslaught, NATO fighter jets were called in to raid Bosnian Serb  positions, openly taking the side of the Moslems.    "It is not now possible to determine the duration of this  operation," Clinton said, in what U.S. observers regard as being  meant to prepare congress and the public for a wider U.S. action  on the side of the Moslems in Bosnia.    Meanwhile, Bosnian Moslem Vice-President Ejup Ganic has  arrived on a three-day visit to Washington, to put renewed  pressure on the U.S. Administration to supply military equipment  and exempt the Moslems from an arms sales embargo which is in  force against all of former Yugoslavia.    Moslem ambassador to the United Nations Muhamed Sacirbej  said  on Wednesday that the Moslems would not agree to the ceasefire  offered by the Serbs on the weekend unless the Serbs around  Gorazde withdrew to the lines they held on March 30.    Sacirbej refuted the statement by U.N. commander in Bosnia-  Herzegovina General Sir Michael Rose that the Moslems on Tuesday  attacked Bosnian Serb positions at Gorazde unprovoked, although  the statement has been confirmed by ranking U.N. officials.    In a plucky effort at deceit, Sacirbej said that under U.N.  Security Council Resolution 836, Moslems have the right to  defend the "safe areas" at arms.    However, the Moslem action is hardly consistent with the  claim of defence, since they have launched another infantry  attack from Gorazde on Serb positions, supported by the  artillery situated in Gorazde town proper.</p>

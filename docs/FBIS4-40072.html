			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has just  been on a four-day working visit to the Transcaucasus. The  results of his tour are reviewed by correspondent Sergey  Omelchenko:    [Omelchenko] A Russian military presence in the  Transcaucasus, whether in the form of bases, peacekeeping forces  or specialists, is not some whim of generals or politicians. It  is absolutely indispensable to the maintenance of stability,  security and peace in the region. This conclusion can be drawn  from the results of the talks which Russian Defense Minister  Pavel Grachev held during his four-day whistle-stop tour of the  Caucasus.    Agreement was reached with Armenian President Levon Ter-  Petrosyan, one of those in favor of having Russian military  bases in the region, on the status of the base to be manned by a  Russian motor rifle division at Gyumri, formerly Leninakan, and  the stationing of a regiment in Yerevan. In Baku President  Geydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan proposed that a separate agreement  on military- technical cooperation should not be signed.  Instead this should form part of a general treaty on friendship  and cooperation between our states. During the talks in Baku it  transpired that Azerbaijan was not opposed to the idea of joint  Russo-Azerbaijani control over the early warning radar station  at Gabala, one of the biggest in the south. However, this  question will be finally decided after further work has been  done by experts. Incidentally Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia  unanimously called for participation in a common system of CIS  air defense.    As far as a settlement of the Karabakh conflict is  concerned,  Azerbaijan did not in the end sign the protocol on a cease-fire  and disengagement of forces, which Armenia and Russia signed on  17 May. However, Aliyev assured the Russian defense minister  that he would do his utmost to stop the hostilities.    From the results of the talks with the Georgian head of  state  and the Abkhaz leader one can draw the conclusion that the  situation as regards a solution to the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict  is significantly better. Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev  said as much to me in an interview:    [Begin Grachev recording] Both the President of Georgia and  the President of Abkhazia are giving their agreement to peace-  keeping operations. Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin will sign a  decree. This decree will be ratified by the Federal Assembly on  14 June, and we will be able to embark on the peacekeeping  mission within three days -- five at the most -- after orders  have been given for the operation to get underway. All our  forces are ready. All we have left to do is to decide what  combat equipment and how many men can be spared from the 345th  Regiment. Then everything will be ready, I think. I consider  that my mission here is over. I shall report to the president,  and then we shall get down to work. [end recording]</p>

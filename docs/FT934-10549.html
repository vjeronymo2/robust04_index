			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow retreats sharply from record level Wall Street US SHARE prices retreated sharply from their record highs amid heavy program selling yesterday as investors reacted badly to further increases in long-term interest rates, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 35.77 down at 3,661.87, but off its low for the day of 3,644.55. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fell 5.42 to 463.02, while the American SE composite slipped 2.58 to 481.70 and the Nasdaq composite dropped 12.71 to 772.95. NYSE volume was heavy at 342m shares. Although yesterday's economic news was broadly positive - the Federal Reserve's 'beige book' report on the state of the economy said that economic activity continues to grow at a 'slow to moderate pace' virtually free of inflation - it was not positive enough to give a lift to equities. Instead, investors and dealers focused on the bond market, which posted big declines once again yesterday. By late afternoon the benchmark 30-year bond was down three-quarters of a point, and the yield was above 6.1 per cent. Bond prices have fallen sharply over the last few days as fixed-income investors reacted badly to a spate of positive economic news which, they feared, might lead eventually to rising inflation and tighter monetary policy. The weakening bond market upset stock prices because equity investors have become concerned that the long bond market rally may have peaked, and that Treasury yields may be heading upwards after 2 1/2 years of steady declines. Hopes for sustained strength in car sales lifted the big motor manufacturers in early trading. The latest sales data, however, proved disappointing and the big three car stocks lost most of their gains by the close. Ford ended down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 63 1/4 , General Motors was just Dollars  1/4 ahead at Dollars 49 1/4 and Chrysler was left with a fall of Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 56 3/8 , all after active trading. Drug shares bucked the trend, Pfizer moving forward Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 63 5/8 , Bristol Myers Squibb Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 59 3/4 and Merck Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 32 7/8 . Banc One shed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 36 5/8 after announcing the acquisition of Liberty National, a Kentucky based banking group, in a stock deal worth Dollars 784m at current prices. The news lifted Liberty National shares, which are listed on the Nasdaq market, by Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 29 3/8 . Other banks were weaker, upset by rising long-term interest rates. Citicorp dipped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 35 3/8 , Chase Manhattan Dollars 1 to Dollars 32 1/8 and JP Morgan Dollars 1 to Dollars 69 3/4 . Pacific Telesis dropped Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 55 in the wake of a downgrade from securities house Goldman Sachs, which lowered its rating for the telecommunications company's stock from 'trading buy' to 'market performer', citing price reasons. On the Nasdaq market, Snapple Beverage advanced Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 24 5/8 after the soft drinks company reported improved third-quarter profits. Canada TORONTO ended mixed after further heavy trading. The TSE 300 index was off 5.6 at 4,244.7 but rises outpaced declines by 405 to 392. The index had been above its previous record high of 4,255.6 for much of the session, before losing ground in the final hour. Volume reached 84.5m shares. Golds gained 2.66 per cent.</p>

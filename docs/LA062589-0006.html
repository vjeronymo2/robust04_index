			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SELLING MARS  </P> <P> LOUIS Friedman, one-time rocket scientist and now, as head of the  Pasadena-based Planetary Society, one of the nation's most vocal cheerleaders  for planetary exploration, had waited a long time for this moment and wanted to  savor it in solitude. Launches always made him nervous, but this one, on a  morning last April, was special. If it worked, it would mark the end of more  than a decade of waiting for the United States to return to planetary  exploration. If it didn't, it would be just another on a list of  disappointments NASA has handed to Friedman in the past 17 years.  </P> <P> He moved a few feet from his friends among the crowd of spectators at Cape  Canaveral and positioned himself in clear view of the launch pad. Then he  stared into the distance at the space shuttle Atlantis, which was scheduled  momentarily to take the spacecraft Magellan into Earth orbit and then send it  on its way to Venus.  </P> <P> As a 31-year-old engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1972, Friedman's  first supervisory job was study leader and program manager for the then-unnamed  Magellan project. Had anyone told him then that he would be a grandfather by  the time Magellan flew, he wouldn't have believed them. But since the  mid-1970s, he had gradually become disillusioned with the false starts and  delays in the American space program.  </P> <P> This day, he had flown from California to Florida to watch the launch and take  part in a panel discussion, a sort of celebration of America's return to space  exploration. Standing alone at the edge of the crowd as the countdown entered  its last minute, he half expected another delay. An optimist about most things,  he had never had much faith in the wisdom of using the space shuttle instead of  conventional rockets to launch spacecraft.  </P> <P> At T-minus 30 seconds, the countdown stopped. A malfunction had been detected;  the shuttle engines shut down. Friedman was disappointed, and he couldn't help  but immediately see the irony.  </P> <P> "When that thing didn't go, and I was looking out from the causeway, I could  also see a Titan (rocket) the Air Force was getting ready for another launch,"  he recalls a few weeks later. "Boy, did I wish we were using that."  </P> <P> A week later, the shuttle carrying Magellan successfully took off. By then,  Friedman was back in his office watching the event on television with his staff  at the Planetary Society. He is enough of a space groupie, he says, to enjoy  any successful launch -- even one that comes years late.  </P> <P> IN THE PLANETARY SOCIETY'S 16-room headquarters, in a turn-of-the-century  Greene and Greene mansion, Louis Friedman has the smallest office. ("Size is  not power," he says.) He sits at an old oak desk above which hangs a  needlepoint of Saturn stitched by his mother. When he's not on the phone, he's  likely to be bounding downstairs to consult with his secretaries or Tim Lynch,  the society's director of programs and development. He jogs each morning to  work off the calories of an occasional beer, but seeing him scurry around, one  wonders if the jogging isn't overkill.  </P> <P> For nearly a decade, Friedman has spent most of his waking hours as the pivotal  man in an exercise in mass salesmanship: finding ways to persuade Americans --  the public, politicians, bureaucrats and space scientists -- to rally behind  planetary exploration as they did in the 1960s, after the Soviets launched  Sputnik. In the past 25 years, he has evolved from space engineer to salesman  of dreams in an era of diminished dreaming. "What I want to do," Friedman says,  "is make space exploration happen."  </P> <P> Under Friedman's direction, the Planetary Society is to planetary exploration  what Common Cause is to political campaigning or the Sierra Club is to  conservation. But in addition to calling for a general reform of the nation's  space program, it has channeled most of its energies into promoting a single  great notion: that of a joint U.S.-Soviet manned mission to Mars. The group's  leaders believe that the Mars mission -- with its underpinnings of global peace  through technology -- is the only aspiration grand enough to drum up the public  interest needed to fuel real-life star trekking. And, Friedman hopes, that  grass-roots enthusiasm will eventually bubble up to influence the Washington  policy-makers and budget writers who can put the civil space program back on  its old, optimistic track.  </P> <P> As executive director, Friedman is administrator, policy-maker, publicist and  even carnival barker, trying to lure passers-by inside the tent to see the  exotica -- in this case, the planets in Earth's solar system. Despite his  background as a card-carrying scientist, this may be the job he was born to do.  "I live, breathe and eat Mars," he says.  </P> <P> Early one morning, he is in Lynch's office discussing the logistics of  scheduling Carl Sagan to testify before the House of Representatives on the  NASA budget. Moments later, he is in his own office meeting with Angela Brown,  a former Planetary Society staffer turned consultant, reviewing details for a  society-sponsored festival to coincide with Voyager II's encounter with Neptune  in August. By way of JPL, Voyager's live images of Neptune will be transmitted  to the festival.  </P> <P> Friedman squeezes his eyes shut to contain his enthusiasm when Brown tells him  a national auto maker is interested in sending Neptune images from the JPL feed  to all its dealerships through its internal cable system. "Oh, I would love a  downlink (in the dealerships)," he groans. "Anything we can do to get this  stuff into peoples' hands across America."  </P> <P> Later still, he returns calls from the Washington Post and an aerospace trade  magazine. One reporter wants a quick response from Friedman about news that the  Soviets have activated a camera on a spacecraft sent to the Martian moon  Phobos. Friedman raves over this development; the next day, he is the only  American quoted in the story.  </P> <P> His workday often starts early, with phone calls from home to the East Coast or  the Soviet Union, and doesn't end until evening. One night, Friedman, red-eyed  and weary, is the host at a Planetary Society reception. He has just heard a  colleague in the society suggest to a visitor that America's next space goal  should be to send more astronauts to the moon to set up a base. To Friedman,  the suggestion is close to heresy. It makes no sense to send more humans to the  moon because the whole idea bores the public, Friedman says, his voice rising.  Manned lunar missions would only drain America's civil-space budget away from a  more important, profound, exciting goal -- namely, Mars.  </P> <P> Friedman is forceful but good-humored as he argues. He is slightly rumpled, and  his mop of graying black hair hints of Harpo Marx. If he was selling something  simpler, like the women's hats his father once helped produce in New York, his  charm and persistence would probably have made Friedman a rich man. This  evening, though, his colleague can't be swayed. Friedman, undeterred and  indefatigable, wanders over to another knot of guests, prepared to make his  argument for a mission to Mars all over again.  </P> <P> WHO WOULD HAVE predicted in the 1960s that a role like Friedman's would exist,  much less be considered by so many to be necessary? Then, the promotion of  planetary exploration, fueled by Soviet space advances and Cold War  competitiveness, was led by an American President. John F. Kennedy talked about  the dreams and set the goals, rallying Americans to create grand technologies,  explore the universe, land on the moon -- and do it all before the Soviets  could. It was called the Space Race, with all the urgency that implies.  </P> <P> Through the 1970s, NASA launched 69 manned and unmanned missions. It was during  those boom times, in 1970, that Friedman joined JPL, after working on the  technical staff of a Massachusetts aerospace firm and then earning a doctorate  in astronautics and aeronautics at MIT. He immediately went to work on Mariner  10, which was launched just three years later and eventually flew by Venus and  Mercury, taking pictures that gave the earthbound the first detailed knowledge  of the innermost planets. When Friedman recalls the end of those heady days, he  sounds almost wistful. "Then the shuttle came, and it just ruined everything."  </P> <P> After Kennedy's death, White House-level passion for planetary exploration --  the key to funding -- began to dry up. Interest declined with each new  President and each new escalation of the dollar-draining Vietnam War. Then, in  1972, shortly after the last Apollo spacecraft landed a man on the moon,  President Nixon unveiled a plan to build a space shuttle, promoted as a  quicker, cheaper way to fly in space. ("You don't go to space to be cheap,"  Friedman grouses today. "You stay home to be cheap.") Nixon rejected another of  the space program options recommended by a presidential commission -- sending  humans to Mars, an expensive project that would be completed many years after  his White House tenure.  </P> <P> Friedman considers Nixon's shuttle decision a turning point. NASA budgets began  to drop and planetary exploration, which a generation had come to believe would  be a continuing part of American achievement, suffered. In the mid-'60s, NASA's  annual budget climbed to $26 billion (in 1988 dollars). From 1972 through last  year, the agency's total budget averaged less than a third of that, about $8  billion a year (in 1988 dollars). Within that budget, planetary exploration  changed from favorite child to sad stepsister of the space shuttle. According  to one study of NASA budgets, when measured in dollars adjusted for inflation,  planetary funding dropped 75% between 1974 and 1978. The 1989 budget for  planetary exploration (about $417 million) remains lower than it was 15 years  ago, when the figures are adjusted for inflation.  </P> <P> After Pioneer Venus 10 blasted off toward Venus in 1978, exploration launches  stopped. Several unmanned planetary missions in development were relegated to  the back burner, including Magellan, the probe of Jupiter known as Galileo and  a joint European-U.S. mission to study the sun. Out of frustration, Friedman  applied for and won a yearlong fellowship to work on the staff of the Senate  committee that addresses space program goals and funding. It gave him a chance  to reassess his career while allowing him a bird's eye view of space  policy-making in Washington.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, back at JPL, two prominent space scientists also were alarmed at the  stagnation of NASA's planetary program. One was Bruce Murray, then director of  JPL; the other was star-astronomer Carl Sagan, a frequent visitor to the lab.  Both had been gratified to see public interest build as the two Voyager  spacecraft, launched in 1977, approached Jupiter. But they were distressed that  this public interest did not translate into money from Washington. President  Carter told Sagan as much at the White House.  </P> <P> Murray and Sagan, so accustomed to looking beyond the stars, readjusted their  gazes earthward. An organization to rally around planetary exploration would  have to start at the grass roots, they believed. But neither had the time to  start or run such a group. In spring, 1979, when Friedman visited JPL in  anticipation of returning in the fall, Murray asked him to direct the new  organization.  </P> <P> In late 1979, from his dining room table, Friedman launched the Planetary  Society. It had little money, three members and a vague idea about how to  attract more. The three co-founders had only their goals: to educate, to  influence space policy and, perhaps, to provide funding for planetary research.  And they decided they could do it all 3,000 miles from the hub of space  policy-making, in Pasadena, the home not only of JPL but of Friedman and  Murray, too.  </P> <P> By the end of its first year, the society had established the roots of a  sophisticated direct-mail operation and signed up more than 20,000 members.  Today, it has about 125,000 members in 104 countries and 26 part-time and  full-time employees. It is the largest (by about five times) and best-known  space-interest group in the world, and its annual budget exceeds $3.5 million,  supported mostly by membership fees of $20 to $30 and donations.  </P> <P> During its first years, the Planetary Society leaders hewed to a fairly  conservative line, advocating unmanned missions, testifying before committees  and spearheading studies to salvage planetary programs threatened by NASA  budget cuts. In 1981, Friedman organized society members in a letter-writing  campaign entreating NASA to reverse its decision to stay earthbound in 1986  while Halley's comet made one of its rare appearances. The campaign generated  10,000 letters but failed to get the government to plan a Halley's flyby.  </P> <P> Chastened by this defeat, the society took more aggressive action a year later  when the Senate refused to fund a NASA project that would have listened for  signs of intelligent life in outer space. The Planetary Society began financing  a similar project of its own. Film maker Steven Spielberg contributed $100,000  to help a Harvard scientist build and monitor a sophisticated radio system that  still operates today, waiting for a signal that earthlings are not alone.  </P> <P> But the society's leaders had not yet fixed upon the one grand goal that they  believed would get planetary research back on track. Inspiration arrived when,  in January, 1985, the society co-sponsored a symposium in Washington on the  effects of space weapons on civilian use of space.  </P> <P> The Reagan White House was gearing up its Star Wars program. Mikhail S.  Gorbachev had not yet come into power in the Soviet Union. Relations between  the two countries were tense. One afternoon, 600 people crowded into a room to  hear a panel that included Murray, Sagan and Roald Z. Sagdeev, then the leader  of the Soviet space program. In the course of the discussion, Sagdeev suggested  that the United States and the Soviet Union follow up on the cooperation  displayed in the docking of the Soyuz and Apollo spacecraft 10 years earlier.  What Sagan was to say next, Friedman recalls, sent a current of "electricity"  through the audience.  </P> <P> "If you are interested in pumping the economy," Sagan told the audience, "there  are far better ways to do it (than the Strategic Defense Initiative). Think of  the major cooperative programs which are fully within our technological  capability and which could be done at a tiny fraction of the cost of Star Wars  technology. Think about a joint U.S.-Soviet-manned, and womanned, mission to  Mars."  </P> <P> Sagan's words so ignited the Planetary Society board members that they later  adjourned with Sagdeev to a private room to discuss the idea. The Soviet  scientist talked excitedly about a split-mission idea, with each country  performing independent tasks that would add up to a complete manned mission to  Mars. Sagdeev's enthusiasm seemed to open new worlds of possibility. The  Planetary Society had found its goal.  </P> <P> IN 1985, AS THE Planetary Society was becoming euphoric about Mars, NASA was  entering one of its most depressing periods. The agency had spent an  ever-expanding amount of time and money developing a space shuttle that, 13  years after conception, seemed far from keeping its promise to boost space  commercialization by providing an oft-scheduled, reusable craft for launching  satellites and spacecraft.  </P> <P> Its proponents, led by now-retired NASA Administrator James Fletcher, had  promised that the shuttle could be built for billions of dollars less than its  critics claimed. By the mid-'80s, the critics were beginning to look right. The  shuttle was plagued by engineering problems, including faulty tiles and engine  failures, and was still unable to meet its flight schedule. So unreliable was  it that the Air Force and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  made plans to launch their satellites from conventional rockets.  </P> <P> To NASA, the Planetary Society was a sometimes useful civilian adjunct, an  effective promoter of planetary science, but little more. The society's dreams  of a return to the glory days of space exploration were just that to the agency  -- dreams easily dismissed, economically unrealistic, not on the agenda. Some  of the society's goals were shared by NASA, says NASA spokesman Charles  Redmond, but the two organizations disagreed on "the timing of goals and  funding." Friedman and the Planetary Society acknowledge that their efforts in  the mid-'80s had little policy effect on NASA. Relations between Fletcher and  the society were tense at best.  </P> <P> Then came the Challenger shuttle disaster of January, 1986, and massive  soul-searching at NASA. In 1987, as the agency looked for redirection, Fletcher  commissioned former astronaut Sally K. Ride to recommend how the agency could  regain its leadership in space. Ride sounded some of the Planetary Society's  goals when she called for NASA to expand exploration by returning to the moon  with one eventual mission of landing humans on Mars. She advised moving slowly:  "America should not rush headlong toward Mars; we should adopt a strategy to  continue an orderly expansion outward from Earth."  </P> <P> Ride's report, coupled with growing publicity for the Mars initiative, moved  Mars from the back burner to the national agenda. Friedman points out that  these days, when NASA talks about going to the moon, the goal is framed as a  precursor to an eventual Mars trip. He believes this would not have happened  without the constant prodding of the Planetary Society.  </P> <P> Any space project comes about as a budgetary interaction between NASA and  Congress, and on Capitol Hill, the society has had more success. For instance,  it claims some credit for blocking the Reagan Administration's plans to abandon  planetary exploration in 1981. It is generally credited with pushing through  legislation assuring that a conventional rocket will launch the Mars Observer,  an unmanned spacecraft designed to orbit and photograph the planet, when it  goes up in 1992. And now, occasionally, a resolution to support a joint  U.S.-Soviet Mars venture will be introduced and voted on -- so far to defeat --  in Congress.  </P> <P> For Friedman, small victories aren't enough. If all goes according to plan, the  Planetary Society will get to Mars before NASA does. In mid-February, the  society took its boldest step so far to stimulate public interest in the Mars  goal. It signed an agreement that, Friedman says, will make it the first  private group to participate with the Soviet Union in a space experiment.  </P> <P> That is why, on a recent afternoon, eight space engineers are seated around two  tables pushed together in the main room of the Pasadena headquarters. They make  up the team brought together by the society to develop one part of an  experimental balloon that is to be built by France's space agency. The balloon,  which will float just above the surface of Mars, will be released from an  unmanned Soviet spacecraft expected to be launched in 1994. For the Planetary  Society, this project is more than a simple engineering challenge. It is a  chance to prove that space cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United  States is possible. It is a symbolic way to move ahead with the Mars goal  without waiting for NASA and the White House to catch up.  </P> <P> The engineers at the table have volunteered or been hired by the society to  design a prototype of what is officially named the Surface Navigation Kontact  Experiment. The SNAKE, as it has been dubbed, will be a 30-foot-long titanium  guide rope that will dangle 100 feet from the balloon as it skims the surface  of Mars. The SNAKE will gather dirt and pebbles from the red planet for  analysis by the small instruments it will carry, which will also study the  balloon's speed and the Martian atmosphere.  </P> <P> The society has agreed to finance production of the SNAKE through its first  prototype; Friedman figures that the first two years of development will cost  $450,000, one-third to one-fifth of what it would cost if a government agency  was conducting the project. The society has already garnered $75,000 in  donations from one mailing to its members. A private foundation has donated  $30,000.  </P> <P> The meeting goes slowly. By the time it ends, after 8 p.m., the youngest  engineer, Jim Cantrell, a graduate student at Utah State University, has  volunteered to make the first prototype in his garage. He builds race cars on  weekends, he says, so he has the necessary tools. They agree to meet in August  in the Mojave Desert to test Cantrell's creation before they deliver it to  France in September.  </P> <P> A 1988 TIME MAGAZINE poll reported that 72% of Americans believe that a joint  U.S.-Soviet Mars mission is a good idea; newspapers editorialize in support of  it; the Planetary Society even got 250 celebrities, from former U.N. Ambassador  Jeane J. Kirkpatrick to Nobel laureate Linus Pauling, to sign its "Mars  Declaration," an 800-word statement published last year calling for human  exploration of Mars. Even Redmond, at NASA, admits its appeal: Everyone at the  space agency, he says, thinks it would "be a great thing to do." Then come the  caveats. Is basing a mission on cooperation between the United States and the  Soviet Union ridiculously optimistic? "Making Mars (exploration) dependent on  peace on earth undermines the chance of going to Mars," says John Logsdon, a  Planetary Society advisory board member who directs the Space Policy Institute  at George Washington University. And Redmond says that NASA is concerned that  it does not have the technological know-how to send people to Mars.  </P> <P> Most naysayers, though, talk money. By Friedman's estimate, the joint mission  would cost $60 billion. Redmond says $100 billion is a conservative estimate.  To get to Mars, he says, and complete other existing projects, NASA would have  to squeeze at least $20 billion a year from Congress over 10 years. Today, the  agency is barely able to get $12 billion annually. Considering competing budget  demands and the U.S. deficit, he says, the needed level of funding is unlikely.  </P> <P> Scientists have another question about the economics. "There's sort of a  knee-jerk enthusiasm for a grand mission, and I join in that to some degree,"  says physicist James Van Allen, a member of the Planetary Society's advisory  board and discoverer of the Van Allen radiation belt that surrounds Earth.  However, he sees the Mars mission as a "vastly expensive undertaking" that  would "seriously handicap" valuable unmanned projects.  </P> <P> The criticisms cause Friedman to launch into his best salesman persona,  slightly irritated because the naysayers just don't understand. It's a  chicken-and-egg proposition, he says. Just as the moon goal of the 1960s helped  generate financing for other planetary projects, he says, so, too, would the  Mars goal enhance all planetary exploration. We set the moon as a goal, he  argues, before the technology existed to take men there. As for the wisdom of  linking an exploration goal to unstable earthly relations, Friedman is  pragmatic and optimistic there, too. A human mission to Mars, with its huge  price tag and risks, can only be justified if it serves a strong national  purpose, he says.  </P> <P> And when it comes to the price, the society has a strategy that actually  matches NASA's. Redmond says that the only way to obtain the funding is with  presidential backing. Friedman is asking that all 130,000 signers of the Mars  Declaration write to President Bush before July 20, the 20th anniversary of the  first moon landing, urging him to support the Mars goal. However, Friedman  concedes that if even this anniversary cannot inspire Bush to acknowledge the  Mars initiative, "the whole momentum will be lost" for at least the next four  years. But patience and persistence are part of Friedman's strategy, too. The  challenge for the Planetary Society in a changing world is to keep the verve in  the Mars initiative. And if Friedman fails? What if, in the end, he cannot sell  the Mars vision to the White House or Congress or NASA? Will it all have been a  waste?  </P> <P> Friedman is sitting over a lunch of beer and bratwurst at a Pasadena restaurant  as he considers this. He pauses for a moment and then begins talking about John  Gardner, the founder of Common Cause who, early on, provided Friedman with key  advice on how to set up a public-interest group. "Reform is never completed.  You never succeed," Friedman says, paraphrasing Gardner. "It's a process. It  goes on and on and on and on. We always look at our goal as long range. We  always keep hope alive."  </P></p>

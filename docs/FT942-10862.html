			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / International Press Review: Dutch press cool on poll glitz In the eyes of the Dutch press, the staid, stodgy world of Dutch politics has been engulfed by a tide of 'Americanisation'. The proof, this theory goes, is the campaign waged in last week's general election. The evidence is largely circumstantial but undeniable. Compared with the studiously low-key campaigns of previous elections, the 1994 poll was a veritable razzmatazz of sound bites, photo opportunities and competing personalities. The glitziest campaign - by Dutch standards - was waged by the Christian Democrats, who also happened to suffer the greatest defeat. Mr Elco Brinkman, trying to step into the shoes of Mr Ruud Lubbers, the outgoing prime minister, used tactics which his advisers had borrowed partly from the US and Britain. Mr Brinkman's whirlwind tour of the country was made in a campaign bus bristling with the latest in mobile communications and fax machines. Rather than standing stiffly by lecterns during speeches, he was hooked up to a mobile microphone which allowed him to roam the stage in what became known as the 'Brinkman shuffle'. And, like Mr Bill Clinton appearing on 'Larry King Live' programme during the US campaign, Mr Brinkman chose to play the 'soft' media, giving interviews to women's magazines and undergoing questioning from a popular comedian. His rival in the Labour party, Mr Wim Kok, also waged a highly personalised campaign. His face stared out from election posters stating 'Choose Kok', with little or no mention made of the unpopular party he represents. This style of campaigning came in for criticism in the earnest Dutch press, which produces newspapers of various political persuasions, but not a single tabloid or sensationalist title. But the morning after the election, Dutch politics was back to normal with a vengeance, with attention firmly turned back to excruciatingly intricate speculation about the composition of the next coalition. Elections in the Netherlands do not produce winners and losers even at the best of the times. But this year's result was spectacularly inconclusive, with the two biggest parties losing ground to two smaller 'swing' parties, the right-wing Liberals (VVD) and the left-of-centre D66. The erstwhile coalition partners, Mr Brinkman's Christian Democrats (CDA) and Mr Kok's Labour party (PvdA), lost their majority. This means that a coalition of three parties will have to be formed from the four main parties. And this has led in the press to the 'alphabet soup' speculation so beloved of political columnists and leader writers. Will the next government be a CDA-PvdA-D66 cabinet; a coalition of strange bedfellows like PvdA-VVD-D66; or would Labour be forced into opposition by a CDA-D66-VVD grouping? What about the option of taking on board the two new pensioners' parties that had come from nowhere to capture seven seats? Summing up the situation, the financial daily Het Financieele Dagblad concluded that 'a long and bloody' period of coalition negotiations lay ahead. Other newspapers agreed that no firm conclusions could be drawn on who would be the next prime minister, or even who would be included in the next cabinet. At the daily De Telegraaf in Amsterdam, columnist Kees Lunshof reminded readers that Labour could make no automatic claims to anything, even though it had narrowly emerged from the fragmented balloting as the largest party. 'There is no written rule that the PvdA must take part in government because it is the biggest,' he wrote. In Rotterdam, the NRC Handelsblad cautioned in a leader that it was too early to write off the Christian Democrats as coalition members, despite their record losses at the polls. 'It would not be the first time in Dutch political history that the loser of an election walks away victoriously from the cabinet formation,' it said. In the absence of any real progress in forming the next coalition, speculation like this fills column after column in the newspapers. Perhaps it is a good idea for newspaper readers, as well as newspaper writers, to start getting used to these minute examinations of coalition tactics: after the 1977 election, for instance, it took no less than 208 days for the Netherlands to come up with a government coalition.</p>

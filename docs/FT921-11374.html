			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Armitage Brothers advances 23% Armitage Brothers, the pet food and accessories group, lifted pre-tax profits by 23 per cent to Pounds 712,000 in the 28 weeks to December 14. The company attributed this improvement to cost control, a better mix of sales and reduced interest charges. Turnover was only just ahead to Pounds 13.1m (Pounds 12.7m) and sales continued to be affected by the recession, they said. However, profits were still running ahead of last year. Earnings per share advanced to 13.4p (9.1p) and the interim dividend is lifted to 2.6p (2.5p).</p>

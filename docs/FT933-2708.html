			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Lib Dems take control of Dorset council THE LIBERAL Democrats last night won control of Dorset County Council in a by-election victory which will cause further alarm for the Conservatives in southern England. County councils now controlled by the Liberal Democrats are Dorset, Cornwall, Somerset and the Isle of Wight. Since the local elections in May, the Conservatives have been left in control of only one county, Buckinghamshire. In Dorset, the Tories lost control in May when the Liberal Democrats gained 17 seats to leave them just one short of an overall majority. In yesterday's by-election their candidate Mr Peter Gainsford took the Lytchett seat on an 11.5 per cent swing from the Tories. Mr Gainsford gained 3,047 votes against 1,879 for his Tory rival. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said the win was 'tremendous news', and added: 'In a fourth county we can face the challenge of government and the chance it provides to show people what we stand for.' The by-election had been ordered after the result in the May elections was declared void by the High Court. The same three candidates had stood in May when Commander 'Chipps' Selby Bennett, the Tory candidate, won by a single vote. But one ballot paper, cast in favour of the Liberal Democrat, was not accepted because it had not been officially stamped. Had it been, the result would have been a tie.</p>

			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFING: EVENTS IN THE NEWS THIS WEEK.  </P> <P> Also on Wednesday, the Orange County Sheriff's Advisory Council and Hutton  Development Co. will give local business and community leaders a presentation  on DNA identification, an increasingly popular new field of forensic research.  The Sheriff's Department hopes to raise about $200,000 to establish a DNA  identification laboratory in the county.  </P> <P> The technique allows detectives to identify criminals from minute pieces of  physical evidence gathered at the crime scene, including skin, hair or body  fluids. By comparing these samples with the DNA makeup of samples taken from  crime suspects, authorities can make a positive identification accepted by the  court.  </P></p>

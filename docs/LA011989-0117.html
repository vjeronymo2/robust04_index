			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GAME PROMOTES SOBER PROM/GRADUATION 1989  </P> <P> Alcohol- and other drug-related crashes are the leading cause of death for  young people between the ages of 16 and 24. Graduation is just around the  corner, and this time of celebration can quickly turn to tragedy. In fact, 13  young people died in such crashes in Ventura County last year.  </P> <P> Local initiatives such as Operation Graduation are making a difference in  eliminating this tragedy.  </P> <P> We can use your help to make prom/graduation 1989 a great success.  </P> <P> Attending a basketball game between the "Court Jesters" -- the Ventura County  district attorney's office -- and the "Donut Dunkers" -- the California Highway  Patrol -- at the Buena High School gym at 6 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 21, is one way  you can help and have some family fun at the same time. All proceeds will be  designated to Sober Prom/Graduation 1989. Tickets are $2.50 and are available  at the door.  </P> <P> KAY HINE  </P> <P> Mothers Against Drunk Driving  </P> <P> Ventura  </P> <P> The Ventura Edition welcomes letters.

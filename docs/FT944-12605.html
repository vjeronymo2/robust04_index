			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / People: Pru picks Sir Martin from its board The Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest life insurer and biggest investment institution, is expected to announce shortly that Sir Martin Jacomb, one of the City's best-connected merchant bankers, will take over as its non-executive chairman following next May's annual general meeting. The expected choice of Sir Martin, chairman of Postel Investment Management and a director of the Bank of England, means that the Prudential is reverting to its traditional habit of picking a chairman from its outside non-executive directors. Sir Brian Corby, 65, the current chairman, is unusual in that he joined the Pru in 1952 and worked his way up to be group chief executive, before becoming chairman in 1990. Sir Brian's two predecessors were Lord Hunt of Tamworth, a former Cabinet Office secretary, and Lord Carr, who had been Sir Edward Heath's Home Secretary in the early 1970s. Although Sir Martin, who turns 65 next week, is a more traditional type of insurance company chairman, he differs from his predecessors at the Pru in having strong ties with the City. He worked as a barrister before joining Kleinwort Benson in 1968 where he rose to be vice-chairman and was often regarded as a contender for the chairman's post. In 1985 he quit the family-dominated merchant bank and was appointed a deputy chairman of Barclays Bank. He was the first chairman of Barclays de Zoete Wedd and is credited with making BZW one of the more successful merchant banking operations of the big clearing banks. When he took on the chairmanship of the British Council in 1992 there was speculation that Sir Martin was preparing to bow out of City life slowly. He stepped down as deputy chairman of both Barclays Bank and Commercial Union at the end of last year and his term as a Bank of England director expires at the end of next February. However, he joined the board of the Pru last March and retains a clutch of non-executive directorships which include Marks and Spencer, RTZ, and The Telegraph. He also took on the chairmanship of Delta last year and was last week appointed to the Nolan committee set up to examine standards of conduct in public life. (See Observer)</p>

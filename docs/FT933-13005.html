			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / International Company News: Signs of recovery in US banking US BANK shares rose in early trading yesterday on earnings reports that pointed to a marked recovery in the quality of real estate and commercial loan assets, although profit-taking later left some shares down on the day. Wells Fargo, the California-based bank hit by troubled property lending, said net income for the second quarter rose to Dollars 149m, or Dollars 2.46 a share, compared with Dollars 82m, or Dollars 1.33, a year ago. Although income fell and costs rose, the figures were boosted by a sharp fall in loan-loss provisions to Dollars 140m, down from Dollars 300m last time. However, the company said it was still concerned about the Californian economy. Net loan write-offs were Dollars 138m, against Dollars 184m a year ago. Net interest income fell to Dollars 658m from Dollars 671m as loan volume declined slightly and interest margins remained steady. Other income rose to Dollars 275m from Dollars 271m. Operating expenses advanced by 5 per cent, or Dollars 25m, to Dollars 531m. Due to lower provisions, return on equity for the period rose to 16.73 per cent, from 12.1 per cent in the first quarter and 9.55 per cent a year ago. Net income for the first half was Dollars 257m, or Dollars 4.18, compared with Dollars 201m, or Dollars 3.42, last time. Declining provisions also helped fuel a 22 per cent advance in net income for the quarter at NationsBank, the North Carolina-based 'super-regional' bank which has grown by acquisition into the nation's fifth largest. The charge for credit losses fell to Dollars 110m from Dollars 150m a year ago as net income jumped to Dollars 306m, or Dollars 1.19, from Dollars 251m, or 98 cents fully-diluted. The advance came in spite of 'a still less-than-robust economic recovery,' said Mr Hugh McColl, chairman. First-half net income reached Dollars 787m, or Dollars 2.28, from Dollars 561m, or Dollars 2.22, in the first half of 1992. Loan growth was 'exceptionally strong' during the period, the company said, with total outstanding loans rising by Dollars 2.8bn, or 16 per cent, from the previous quarter. Return on equity was 14.65 per cent, against 14.21 per cent. Banc One, the Ohio-based super-regional bank which also counts itself among the 10 largest in the US, reported net income of Dollars 282m, or Dollars 1.01, up from Dollars 243m, or 87 cents a year earlier. First-half after-tax profits were Dollars 569m, up from 1992's restated Dollars 425m. Second-quarter results were lifted by a rise in the net interest margin to 6.3 per cent from 5.96 per cent. The takeover in May of The Boston Company, a trust and investment management company, led Mellon Bank to report second-quarter net income of Dollars 99m, or Dollars 1.32, compared with Dollars 90m, or Dollars 1.41, after the effect of a favourable tax position a year before (Dollars 64m, or Dollars 0.95 a share, excluding the one-off tax treatment). Net interest revenue was Dollars 314m, up from Dollars 281m a year before, while fee income climbed to Dollars 281m from Dollars 203m. Leaving aside the effects of the Boston acquisition, the income figures would have been Dollars 300m and Dollars 243m respectively. Provisions for credit losses fell to Dollars 35m, from Dollars 50m, while return on equity rose to 13.69 per cent from 11.37 per cent (before the one-off tax benefit). First-half net income was Dollars 133m, or Dollars 1.63, down from Dollars 176m, or Dollars 2.77, last year.</p>

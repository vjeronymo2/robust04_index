			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RANGERS EYE COMEBACK FROM NBC SERIES DEBUT  </P> <P> Making their first appearance in the National Baseball Congress World Series,  the Valley Rangers played Monday night on artificial turf for the first time.  The result was yet another first -- a 12-2, five-inning shellacking at the  hands of the Hays (Kan.)  </P> <P> Larks before 1,000 fans, with the Rangers spared further embarrassment because  of the 10-run rule.  </P> <P> The Rangers, who had not lost by the 10-run rule all season, will try to avoid  an early exit from the double-elimination tourney today, when they return to  Lawrence Dumont Stadium in Wichita, Kan. The Rangers will play at 8 a.m. PDT  against the Palm Beach (Fla.) Bulldogs, who lost Tuesday night to the San Diego  Stars, 10-6.  </P> <P> "The story for us is that we have been loose all year and we were real tight  (Monday)," Ranger Coach Frank Des Enfants said. "We made mental and physical  mistakes. I don't think the kids will be tight (today).  </P> <P> "We'll either win or lose. No excuses."  </P> <P> The Rangers are the first Valley team since the 1987 Valley Dodgers to have  earned an NBC World Series berth.  </P> <P> Four Ranger errors contributed to 10 unearned Lark runs, including six in the  fifth inning. That made the score 12-2, and when Valley was unable to score in  the bottom of the inning, the game was over.  </P> <P> Des Enfants used four pitchers in the fateful fifth, and they combined to walk  five batters. The walks and two doubles, a single and an error turned the game  into a rout.  </P> <P> Steve Trainor ended the outburst when he came on to strike out No. 3 hitter  Todd Jerrich with the bases loaded.  </P> <P> Ranger designated-hitter Eric Vargas had two doubles, the first of which  started a two-run rally in the third inning that made the score 3-2.

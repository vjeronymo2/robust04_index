			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Retailers report January sales rush Retailers yesterday reported intense activity by shoppers at the opening of the January sales, as the wet weather encouraged more bargain-hunters than usual into stores. But retailers were doubtful that the surge in buying signalled a lasting upturn in consumer confidence. Preliminary indications were that business in the week before Christmas and yesterday was stronger than in the same period last year. However, retailers in the West End of London said numbers were swollen by foreign customers, particularly from continental Europe and the Far East, who had been attracted by the weakness of sterling. Mr Tony Salem, retail managing director of Liberty, whose flagship store is in Regent Street, said: 'There are a lot of foreigners in for the sales and spending their cheap pounds. In the West End tourism has been very strong, and that is what has kept our figures increasing at above the level of inflation.' He added: 'It's no thanks to the suburban spender. We've found it very difficult outside London.' He said UK consumers still seemed to be afflicted by a 'feel-anxiety' factor, resulting partly from speculation that mortgage rates would rise. Mr Tim Daniels, managing director of Selfridges, said volumes in Oxford Street were 'at least in line with last year'. Regional shopping centres reported sharp increases in business. Mr Ron Woodman, marketing manager at Gateshead's MetroCentre, Europe's largest out-of-town retail and leisure complex, said: 'It's been absolutely brilliant. It looks as though people have kept some of their budget back for the sales. There seems to be more money than last year. They seem to be buying more.' About 200,000 people visited Manchester's Arndale Centre, approximately 15 per cent up on the same day last year. In the pre-Christmas period total visitors were up 8 per cent, and turnover was 5 per cent ahead of the equivalent period in 1993. Two centres that have opened in the past five years, Sheffield's Meadowhall and the Lakeside centre in Thurrock, Essex, both estimated that they had had their busiest day yet. Mr Woodman said the north seemed to have fared better than the south in retailing during the Christmas season. But he added a note of caution: 'There is this famous feelgood factor today but will it be there in a week or fortnight's time?' Throughout the country there were heavy sales of warm clothing, after bad weather during the Christmas season. Sales had been poor during the autumn, which was milder than usual, and so shops had surpluses on offer at large discounts. Furniture sales also appeared to be healthier than usual, with Maples claiming sales about 45 per cent higher than at the same point last year. The company said its fortunes were improving in spite of the lack of recovery in the housing market, because 'people are realising that they cannot afford to move, and they are spending to upgrade the look of the home they have'.</p>

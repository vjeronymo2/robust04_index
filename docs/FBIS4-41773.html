			<p>BFN     [Text] A new political party, All-Belarusian Unity and  Accord, with numerous businessmen and industrialists among its  leaders, was set up as runoff presidential elections are a near  certainty.    The party intends to hold urgent talk with Aleksandr  Lukashenko who gained far more votes than his rivals in the  first round of voting.    A party spokesman said that if their goals in carrying out  economic reforms coincide, the party would support Lukashenko in  the runoff elections which are expected to be held in the first  half of July.</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: Digital recovery slower than expected DIGITAL Equipment reported increased earnings for its fourth quarter as the US computer manufacturer recovered from last year's heavy losses. Digital's directors warned, however, that because of the uncertain economic outlook 'we remain very cautious about our ability to maintain profitability for the seasonally soft first quarter'. In contrast to its rival, IBM, Digital's operating performance has improved, but it has failed to meet Wall Street expectations. Analysts' projections were set at around Dollars 1.06 per share. Net earnings for the fourth quarter came out at Dollars 113.2m, or 85 cents per share. This compares with a net loss of Dollars 1.86bn, or Dollars 14.76, last year when Digital took a Dollars 1.5bn restructuring charge. Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 3.91bn, up slightly from last year's Dollars 3.90bn. For the year, the company recorded a net loss of Dollars 251.3m, or Dollars 1.93 a share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 2.8bn, or Dollars 22.39, in fiscal 1992. Revenues advanced to Dollars 14.4bn from Dollars 13.9bn. The 1992 losses included a one-time charge of Dollars 485.5m for accounting changes, plus the Dollars 1.5bn restructuring charge. Mr Robert Palmer, president and chief executive, pointed to 'a continued, significant improvement in our overall operating results both for the quarter and the full year'. 'While I am not satisfied with any loss, my confidence in Digital's future is fuelled by the improvements we have been able to achieve over the past three quarters,' he said. Since Mr Palmer joined Digital, last year, the company has posted a cumulative net profit of Dollars 9m, he noted. 'With our new customer-focused business unit structure now in place, we are poised to grow revenues and increase our market share, while continuing to work diligently to reduce our costs,' he added. Notwithstanding the seasonally soft September quarter, Mr Palmer was confident that Digital was poised for resurgence. Digital said it achieved some 'slight' revenue growth in the US with stronger growth throughout Asia, during the fourth quarter. However, it added that its European business was weak.</p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Shephard 'anxious' about disease in single market Importers of live animals to the UK must be aware of their responsibilities in keeping out infectious diseases as the free movement of farm animals across borders increases in the European Union's single market, Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, stressed yesterday. The government will be holding a seminar in November to offer advice to importers on animal health problems. Mrs Shephard told the House of Commons Agriculture select committee of MPs that it was up to individual operators to 'blow the whistle,' on those that were acting irresponsibly. Mrs Shephard said she was not entirely happy with the way the single market worked in all member countries and that there were 'waves of anxiety', in the Ministry of Agriculture over the outbreak of disease. But the increase in UK veterinary checks on imported animals since November had revealed few major problems. All cattle from France had been checked following an outbreak of warble fly infestation, and 12 consignments this year had been returned to France. In addition, the government had launched a series of 24-hour periods of blanket surveillance of imports and exports that have so far covered 500 consignments. Some form of irregularity had been found in one in seven of the shipments, but these mostly involved faulty paperwork, she said. Only about 1 per cent of cases concerned more serious health certification irregularities. In 2 to 3 per cent of shipments there were welfare problems.</p>

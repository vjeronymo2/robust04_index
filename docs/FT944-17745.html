			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: Sleeping French market receives a wake-up call - The government is hoping that a third force will trigger stronger competition Bouygues, the French construction group best known for public works and motorways, is taking a gamble on mobile telephones. The French government, in turn, is taking a gamble on Bouygues. After two unsuccessful attempts to enter the French market, the company was on Tuesday declared the victor in a fierce contest for the third mobile telecoms licence. The strength of the competition - which pitted Bouygues against two other French industrial giants, Alcatel Alsthom and Lyonnaise des Eaux - reflected the importance of the stakes. All three rivals saw the potential for a new lucrative market, while Bouygues regarded the licence as a central plank in its strategy of diversifying away from cyclical construction and property markets into media and telecommunications. At the Ministry of Industry, Post and Telecommunications, the stakes are equally high. The new licence is regarded as a vital stimulus for France's lagging mobile telephones services and a means of narrowing the gap with its European neighbours. 'It is a wake-up call for the sector,' says one telecoms analyst in Paris. For the objectives of Bouygues and the government to be satisfied, they must catchup. At the end of last month, France counted 730,000 subscribers to mobile phone networks, less than half of the number in Italy and less than one-third of the 2.7m in the UK. But the French market has been showing a rapid growth rate. France Telecom which, along with Generale des Eaux, operates the existing mobile networks, says it is winning between 1,500 and 1,800 subscribers a day, partly because of a cut in tariffs in June. The monthly subscription rate, for example, was reduced sharply, from FFr250 to FFr190. In spite of this growth the penetration of mobile services remains well below the European average and is particularly low among the general public. 'So far it has been the business community which have accounted for virtually all of the demand,' says a ministry official. Part of the explanation lies in the lack of competition. Mr Didier Pouillot, an analyst at Idate, the communications research institute, said the French market had, until recently, resembled a duopoly. Another analyst adds: 'There was little competition on prices, and SFR (the telecoms subsidiary of Generale des Eaux) has been slow to develop its infrastructure.' By introducing a third force, the government hopes to trigger stronger competition. Moreover, by selecting the DCS 1800 standard for the network, officials believe the new operator will be well positioned to lure the wider market. DCS 1800 is a digital standard which is a variant of the GSM system used by the existing French operators and by most international groups. Industry observers and French officials claim DCS 1800 is well suited to consumers and urban areas because the terminals are lighter than other systems and it can operate from a network of small cellular stations. Like other standards, however, the new network does not come cheap. According to its offer submission, Bouygues plans to invest about FFr11.7bn (Dollars 2.2bn) over the next 10 years, although the burden will be shared with its consortium partners. These comprise Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK, US West, JC Decaux, the French property group, Banque Nationale de Paris and Paribas. Most observers believe the high development costs should be more than matched by the potential returns. 'Naturally the start-up costs will be high, and competition is likely to have become more intense by the time services are launched in 1996 or 1997,' says one telecoms industry analyst. 'But this is a strong growth market.' Just how strong is hard to predict. In its bid, Bouygues forecasts the number of mobile subscribers in France will rise to 1.5m at the end of next year and to 6.6m in the year 2000. By then it expects to hold 18.6 per cent of the market and receive annual revenues of FFr4.72bn. Mr Philippe Montagner, chairman of Bouygues Telecom, said yesterday the project should break even at an operating level in about three years. The group's capital will be reinforced by a FFr1bn rights issue, which was announced yesterday. The projections are supported by several considerations. In particular, the licence grants exclusive rights for the standard to the five biggest cities for the next four years and a 15-year national mandate. 'I can't see that it will be too hard to make a reasonable return,' says one analyst, as investors pushed Bouygues shares up by FFr9 to FFr587. For Bouygues, the longer-term returns should help offset the cyclical nature of its traditional construction activities. Last year, losses in its property activities prompted a fall in net profits, to FFr469m from FFr685m  -justifying, says the group, its search for more stable, higher margin businesses. The move into mobile telecommunications is not the first step. The company has a controlling 34 per cent stake in TF1, the national television network, finances films and operates a radio messaging network. But the award of the licence marks a watershed. 'Bouygues is now firmly in the ranks of a diversified conglomerate, for better or for worse,' says one construction industry analyst. Most believe it is for the better. Although the cost of the project is expected to depress earnings growth from 1995, Bouygues should benefit from the non-cyclical nature of the business and its relatively high margins.  ------------------------------------------------------               SUBSCRIBERS (August 1994)  ------------------------------------------------------              Analog      Digital          Total  ------------------------------------------------------ France      438,000      286,930        724,930 Germany     749,247    1,452,452*     2,201,699 UK        2,527,687      193,000*     2,720,687 Italy     1,751,913       30,000      1,781,913  ------------------------------------------------------ *incl.

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Accounts disclose directors' payments COMPANIES are beginning to disclose more information on directors' responsibilities and rewards, according to the latest issue of Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based monitoring service of annual accounts. Reports from Smithkline Beecham, the pharmaceuticals group; Tesco, the supermarket group; Guinness, and Pearson, which owns the Financial Times, have published information on directors' remuneration including performance-related incentive payments, it notes. Other groups, including Grand Metropolitan, Imperial Chemical Industries, Sedgwick, BICC, First Leisure and Lonrho have already produced statements on corporate governance and directors' responsibilities, but provide little information on how directors are paid. The details come at a time when the Cadbury Committee on financial aspects of corporate governance recommended full disclosure of the calculation of performance-related pay. Company Reporting also notes that companies are beginning to introduce cashflow information in their accounts in advance of the Financial Reporting Standard on cashflow statements, which came into effect in March this year. It concludes from a sample of 400 companies' annual reports produced since the standard was issued last September, that more than 29 per cent have adopted the new standard.

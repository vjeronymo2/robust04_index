			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STUDENTS, DEPUTIES CLASH OVER DRESS CODE  </P> <P> Antelope Valley high school students protesting the first day of an anti-gang  dress code clashed with school officials and sheriff's deputies Thursday,  boycotting classes and attacking a patrol car, deputies said. Two students were  arrested, and two others were being sought.  </P> <P> The students were angered by a ban on all but official school baseball caps and  wide-ranging authorization for school officials to prohibit any clothing  regarded as gang-oriented.  </P> <P> Class boycotts at Palmdale High School and Antelope Valley High School in  Lancaster drew about 200 students each.  </P> <P> At Antelope Valley High, the demonstration led to an assault on  </P> <P> the patrol car of a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy, deputies said.  </P> <P> About 200 students rushed a sheriff's sergeant who had detained four men off  campus about 11:20 a.m., pelting his car with rocks and debris and chanting  "Let them go," deputies said.  </P> <P> The sergeant was questioning four adult gang members who had nothing to do with  the demonstration, Sgt. Ron Shreves said, but the demonstrators may have  believed those being detained were fellow students.  </P> <P> A 16-year-old boy described as a leader of the group was arrested and detained  at Juvenile Hall in Sylmar, said Shreves. He and two other students will be  charged with assault, Shreves said.  </P> <P> School Principal Yvonne Healey said she could not confirm the Sheriff's  Department's version of the incident.  </P> <P> At Palmdale High School, about 200 students staged a peaceful but noisy walkout  for three hours. Most returned to classes about 10:30 a.m. after deputies  warned the protesters they could be arrested. No arrests were made.  </P> <P> But at Quartz Hill High School, a 16-year-old boy was arrested for threatening  a teacher when school administrators began seizing banned baseball caps from  students during a morning sweep of the campus, said Deputy Gil Arce.  </P> <P> The protests reflected widespread student discontent with the controversial  dress code adopted last month by the Board of Trustees of the Antelope Valley  Union High School District. School officials began enforcing the code  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Students at the three main campuses, arguing that the policy unfairly infringes  on their rights and will do little to halt gang violence, said they plan to  protest again at Wednesday night's school board meeting.  </P> <P> School officials said they did not expect further student class boycotts today.  </P> <P> "People should be able to dress the way they want at a public high school,"  said Scott Welcome, a 16-year-old Palmdale High School junior and one of the  protesters.  </P> <P> "They're just trying to turn this school into a prison. Why should we suffer  for what the gang-bangers do?" asked Jason Oster, a 15-year-old sophomore.  </P> <P> Despite the arrests and protests, officials in the 10,000-student district said  they remained content with the new policy and have no immediate plans to change  it. "All I've said is it's going to take some time for the kids to understand  what the policy is," said Dist. Supt. Kenneth Brummel.  </P> <P> The new policy outlaws any attire that school officials consider gang-related,  including all non-high school baseball caps, the policy's only blanket  prohibition.  </P> <P> Students who violate the policy first get a warning, then a suspension for a  second offense, and possible expulsion beyond that.  </P> <P> However, the district's decision to not provide a specific list of what it  considers gang-related clothing and apparel has led to widespread  misunderstandings of the policy among students. School officials said they  believe that is partly responsible for the protests.  </P> <P> Students repeatedly ticked off long lists of brands, types or colors of  clothing Thursday that they said have been banned by the district, including  British Knight tennis shoes -- called "Blood Killers" in gang parlance,  referring to one of two main gang groupings -- -- professional sports team  jackets and even any clothes in solid blue or red.  </P> <P> But school officials insisted that such clothing has not been banned, if it is  not part of a broader dressing pattern that indicates gang membership. "It has  to do with the manner, the situation, the combinations of clothing that might  be observed," said Palmdale Principal Linda Janzen.  </P> <P> No dress-code-related protests or problems were reported at the district's  three smaller high schools: Desert Winds, the continuation school, and Highland  and Littlerock schools, two temporary sites with only ninth-grade students in  attendance.  </P></p>

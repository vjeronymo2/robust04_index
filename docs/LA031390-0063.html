			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> A SOLICITOUS PAULEY 'CHANGES' IN PRIME TIME  </P> <P> As we have read again and again and again, Jane Pauley is going through these  changes. After being wrenched from "Today" after 13 years, she's being  reconstituted for NBC prime-time exposure, including an hour special at 10  tonight broadly called . . . "Changes: Conversations With Jane Pauley."  </P> <P> She did four segments with people going through changes, including  be-bop-saxophonist-and-now-recovering-heroin-junkie-convict Frank Morgan, now  56. "At 19, Frank had a record album but was working on a criminal record too,"  she intones from the most awful script since "Supertrain." "Forgery was his  ticket to San Quentin."  </P> <P> Another: Becky did some drugs, skipped some school and fled home a few times as  a teen-age brat. That was eight years ago, when Pauley first met her and her  folks. Now they all claim to have changed. The parents profess to understand  but they still look to be in pain; the daughter, now 23, is married with a baby  and, despite fawning by the host, is unrepentant and still a snot.  </P> <P> Another: Comic-in-the-round Louie Anderson talks earnestly about boyhood abuse  by his now-deceased alcoholic father (Pauley asks how he was abused; Anderson  says he was belittled). Now he's selling his million-dollar house in our town  and going off to seclusion to walk a lot and lose weight and find himself.  </P> <P> There are some insightful moments in all this, but the assembly of interview  bites is all muddle and mush and the script should be beaten with a stick.  Pauley is incredibly solicitous to the point of pain. Her career has been  playing wide-eyed, which might have worked in the early morning hours but drags  as the day dwindles on. Can a person be too nice?  </P> <P> At least this is the first story you've read about Jane Pauley in the last six  months that hasn't mentioned Deborah Norville. . . .  </P> <P> Oh, darn. . . .  </P></p>

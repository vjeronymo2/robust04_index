			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Arts: The director who is always in the firing line - 'You're never safe in a movie. That's its great power' Brian DePalma tells Nigel Andrews This man has faced more cultural firing squads than any other living Western film-maker. Back in the 1970s Brian DePalma was stood against a wall for using excessive violence in films like Carrie and The Fury. In the 1980s he was fired on by feminists for abusing/mutilating women (Dressed To Kill, Body Double). And throughout his career he has been accused of plagiarising directors from Hitchcock (Obsession) to Eisenstein (The Untouchables). Even when DePalma reached the seeming haven of a big-budget film of a bestselling modern classic, The Bonfire Of The Vanities, things went wrong. Former fans turned sudden foes, aghast to see their favourite kinetic thriller director, the man who brought the avant-garde to Hollywood, floundering through a mainstream movie miscast and misconceived. DePalma retired in dismay. But here he is again, unbowed and not visibly bloody. His new thriller, Raising Cain, is the DePalma mixture of old: which means no one else in the world could have made it. The camera performs trompe l'oeil gymnastics; dream sequences are seamlessly sewn into waking ones; and DePalma himself wrote the tale of a child psychologist (John Lithgow) trying to induce as well as study formative traumas. 'I had the idea from a psychologist who's married to a friend of mine. They had a daughter and when she was born he quit his practice and stayed home to observe her and write a book. I'm fascinated by these shrinks who sit around while people tell them what happened to them as kids. So my hero thinks, Gee wouldn't it be great if I could go back in time and drop that scalding pan of water on that child to see if it did turn him into the neurotic he thinks he is.' There are no scalding pans in Raising Cain, but little else is left out. Drownings, stabbings, smotherings . . . But DePalma insists that violence is part of the form. 'Ninety-nine per cent of film doesn't deal with cinema as form at all, it just photographs people talking to each other. Or driving up to buildings or walking down a street. So when you do explore the tricks and techniques, it so stirs people's eyes that they think it's a distraction. They think it's getting in the way of the characters and story. But to my way of thinking, it is the characters and story. 'I deal with movement inside a frame and violence is a very exciting aspect of that. It's like a crescendo in music, it disturbs people and make them jump. Do composers get these questions about excessive violence?' No; but blood on the ceiling, I suggest, is different from semi-breves on a music sheet. Are not audiences legitimately shocked by the sight of, say, a girl having her head incised by a driller killer (Body Double) or a woman being bloodily stabbed to death in a lift (Dressed To Kill)? 'We could have long discussions about political art,' says DePalma, sensing the agenda moving towards feminism. Still bruised by the critics who KO'd Body Double because of one arguably misogynistic scene of violence, he insists they were blinkered by dogma: something an artist should never be. 'As soon as a film-maker feels under an obligation to some 'ism', he's surrendered his freedom. No art has a shorter life than political art.' But I point out that what dismayed many of the director's fans about his most vilified film - The Bonfire Of The Vanities - was that it did exactly what he condemns. In strewing Tom Wolfe's story with ethnic fairmindedness and (relative) political correctness - like changing the cranky Jewish judge to the saintly black judge (Morgan Freeman) - he kowtowed to the liberal lobby and emasculated the book's ferocity. 'I wouldn't say we kowtowed. I originally wanted Alan Arkin or Walter Matthau as the judge. But there were so many negative Jewish stereotypes in Wolfe's story already. When the budget of a movie is Dollars 40-50m you start to worry you're going to antagonise everyone and no one's going to come and see it.' But no one came anyway. 'Exactly. So I should have gritted my teeth and made it the way I wanted: which was vicious and ferocious and funny, like one of my own favourite films The Sweet Smell Of Success. But the studio would never have agreed to do that.' The trouble with interviewing directors used to dawn executions is that one ends up behaving like a firing squad oneself. Yet DePalma's career as a whole requires no apology. In turning the movie thriller into an authentic branch of abstract expressionism DePalma goes further than any other commercial director in treating a movie as a thing to be shaped as lovingly as a painting. For Raising Cain he used an architectural computer programme to map the mise-en-scene inside buildings. And almost uniquely - Hitchcock is the only other notable example - he storyboards whole films. 'The whole problem with most movies is, they don't fit together as an aesthetic whole. You can't work out a film on paper in verbal description, you have to work it out visually. There's a big white canvas up there. Unfortunately today it's all done ass-backwards. People write scripts to sell to studios, then they think they've solved all their aesthetic problems. 'Television has become a major influence in this. We have a generation brought up on TV who perceive everything through the ear. TV is basically just radio with pictures. It's programmed so you can stand in another room making tea and still follow the show.' Standing in another room making tea may seem to some the best way to view DePalma's films. If so, they miss out on modern cinema's most gleefully heretical body of work: one that turns seeming vices to gleaming virtues and that has a ready answer even to that most dog-eared charge, Hitchcockophilia. 'I've taken very specific story ideas from Hitchcock. Usually from Vertigo and Psycho, which touch me directly because they're about the things I'm interested in: doubles, split personalities, romantic obsessions. But I don't just quote. In Raising Cain I make one direct allusion to the scene of the car sinking into the pond in Psycho. But that's because I'm pulling a trick. The car with the drowning woman inside doesn't do what you've been set up to expect. The basic tool of movies is deception and deception is the stuff of dream. Dreams are at home in the cinema because it's the only art that makes them seem real. Literature can't, painting can't. But in a movie when you dream you think it's real. And when you wake up and think it's over maybe it's still a dream or a nightmare. You're never safe in a movie. That's its great beauty and power.'</p>

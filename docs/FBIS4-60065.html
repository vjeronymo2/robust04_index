			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 15 May (INA)--The newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH  has wondered: If the entry of the Yemeni forces into Aden is  viewed as occupation, how will we view the bringing of U.S.  forces to Arab land to strike at the pulsating heart of Arabism?    In an article today, the newspaper says: We are with Yemen's  unity. We reject secession, which means separation of part of  the nation, which badly needs that part in the current  atmosphere of conspiracy, defeatism, and subservience to  foreigners.    The newspaper criticizes statements by Husni Mubarak,  president of the Egyptian regime, who is fishing in murky water  and trying to escalate Arab crises and undermine Yemeni unity by  spreading despairing ideas, feeding differences, and widening  the gap among the Arabs.    AL-JUMHURIYAH points out that one of the aims of the  president of the Egyptian regime is to peddle the U.S.-Saudi  plan to partition Yemen in order to win U.S. and Saudi goodwill.    He also tries to portray the situation in the Arab homeland  as unstable and fragile in order to cover up his internal crisis  and the growing national opposition against his regime, which is  founded on precarious balance.    The newspaper explains that by this position, Husni Mubarak  is taking revenge against Yemen for its national and pan-Arab  stand during the immortal Mother of Battles, for its rejection  of the foreign occupation of the Gulf region and the Arabian  Peninsula, for its support for Iraq's principled position, and  for its adherence to a solution within the Arab home. All this,  the paper says, conflicts with Husni Mubarak's position.    Concluding, the newspaper says: These goals remind us of  Husni Mubarak's attempts during the 30-state aggression against  Iraq, when he hastened to hold an Arab summit conference in  Cairo to abort the Arab solution and give legitimacy to bringing  the invasion forces to the region to strike lofty Iraq and its  people.</p>

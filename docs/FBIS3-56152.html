He evaluated positively the fact that Ukraine is  losing the artificially created image of a nuclear monster and  its international isolation, which had begun to form. He  expressed satisfaction that Ukraine will get the opportunity for  wide economic cooperation and will get compensation for  dismantling its nuclear weapons.    Volodymyr Chernyak stressed that the future agreement  between  Ukraine, Russia, and the United States is not an agreement on  nuclear disarmament in general, but solely on the disarmament of  Ukraine. In his opinion, there is not a single norm whereby  Russia can have weapons but Ukraine cannot. This is not a  normal situation, all the more so when such an odious figures as  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy can come to power in Russia. "The  `partnership for peace' formula," said Volodymyar Chernyak, "was  adopted by the United States under pressure from Russia so as  not to accept countries of Central and Eastern Europe into NATO.  There is nothing realistic in this formula. It does not  guarantee security, not even for Ukraine."</p>

For three  days, from 13 to 15 February, Haitians attempted to forget their  worries by delivering themselves, body and soul, to the  delirious atmosphere of Carnival.    During the three days, the capital throbbed to the rhythm of  meringues composed for the occasion. There were no colors or  traditional floats in the 1994 version of Haitian Carnival.  However, Champs-de-Mars and other main streets of Port-au-Prince  welcomed thousands of people who celebrated this huge popular  festival to their heart's content. No official theme was  designated for 1994 but there was music, which served as a  bridge among the various social classes hugging each other in  the streets, forgetting the embargo and the political crisis.    Although the major topics of the news were not totally  absent  from the songs, a political truce was observed during the three  carnival days. No major incidents were reported but tens of  persons were stabbed and there were arrests by the  Port-au-Prince police, who were out in force on the Carnival  streets.</p>

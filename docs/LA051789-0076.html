			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUSPECT IN SLAYING OF WIFE RETURNED TO COUNTY  </P> <P> On a daylong airplane flight from the Montana wilderness where he was captured,  David Lee Schoenecker returned to Orange County late Tuesday to answer charges  that he fatally shot his wife and plotted against more than 50 other people.  </P> <P> The 48-year-old Anaheim Hills chemical engineer, who waived extradition Tuesday  morning before a judge in Missoula, Mont., was booked in Orange County Jail  under $500,000 bail on charges that he murdered his wife, Gail Schoenecker, 40,  at the couple's home on May 5.  </P> <P> Schoenecker, who also threatened in a letter to "punish" 54 acquaintances and  relatives, authorities say, was captured last week by an Old West-style posse  while trekking through deep snow in mountains along the Montana-Idaho border.  Schoenecker initially refused to waive extradition but after consulting with an  attorney Monday agreed to return to California voluntarily.  </P> <P> Schoenecker, wearing an orange jumpsuit, signed extradition papers Tuesday  morning during a brief appearance before Montana State District Judge John  Henson. He was subsequently placed in the custody of two Anaheim police  detectives, who took him aboard an early afternoon flight from Missoula --  where Schoenecker had been detained since the weekend -- to Orange County's  John Wayne Airport.  </P> <P> For the flight, Anaheim detectives Dave Tuttle and Joe Reiss allowed the  fugitive to wear civilian clothes, although they kept his hands cuffed in front  of him as they led him through passenger terminals in airports in Missoula and  Salt Lake City, where they had to change planes.  </P> <P> Through it all, Schoenecker -- wearing a blue-plaid shirt, gray dress slacks  and loafers -- appeared calm and unemotional.  </P> <P> On the flight between Salt Lake City and Orange County, the suspect immersed  himself in a newspaper, leafing through page after page. Detective Reiss, who  sat next to Schoenecker on the last leg of the flight, uncuffed the suspect's  hands so he could eat a snack. Schoenecker said little during the flight,  exchanging some small talk with the detectives.  </P> <P> Fellow passengers were apparently unaware that a fugitive was in their midst,  as the detectives arranged to take Schoenecker aboard before others took their  seats. And the detectives took great care to seat him away from other people  while awaiting flight departures in the airports. Reiss and Tuttle had asked a  Times' reporter and photographer aboard the flight not to approach them on the  jet.  </P> <P> "This is an extradition, and we don't want to upset the other passengers,"  Tuttle had said in Missoula.  </P> <P> The anonymity faded, however, as soon as the Skywest jet touched down at John  Wayne Airport about 7:15 p.m. Awaiting Schoenecker's arrival were a throng of  news reporters and photographers. He repeatedly ducked and turned his head to  avoid having his picture taken.  </P> <P> Detectives Reiss and Tuttle, joined by a third Anaheim police officer waiting  at the airport, hustled Schoenecker off to a waiting car and drove him to  Orange County Jail, where he now awaits an as-yet unscheduled arraignment.  </P></p>

			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Maastricht minimalism When the British government first announced that there would be a 'paving debate' on the Maastricht treaty, we were told that this was an essential way of regaining momentum, and rebuilding government authority. A case, you might say, of reculer pour mieux sauter. Now that the debate has taken place, all those original doubts have been reinforced. Once more the target date for final ratification has been postponed; by now it is clear that all target dates are largely fictitious; once more the government is using the Danes as an excuse for running away from the treaty. A case, you might say, of reculer pour mieux reculer. Retreat need not in itself mean defeat; for there is a large potential majority in the House of Commons in favour of Maastricht. Yet after the latest cave-in to the anti-European rebels, can John Major really be expected to get to the end of the ratification process without sounding more convinced of the intrinsic merits of the treaty? Mr Major has repeatedly said that he wants Britain to be 'at the heart of Europe'. But as time passes, it seems clear that his only real reason for wanting to be inside the Community, is that he does not want to be outside. His public utterances do not suggest any single positive reason for wanting the treaty to come into force. Some will discount the government's apologetic defence of Maastricht as a cynical device to avoid provoking the Euro-sceptics. The sad fact is that the British government did not want this treaty when it was first mooted four years ago, and it does not want it now. The consistency of the government's Maastricht minimalism is confirmed in a recent article by Philippe de Schoutheete, Belgian ambassador to the Community and one of the central negotiators of the treaty. Different member states, he points out, had different objectives: France and Germany were keen on foreign policy, Denmark on the environment, Italy and Belgium on majority voting, and so on. 'But a very important fact must not be overlooked: one major player was keen on nothing] Britain had gone along reluctantly with the preliminary studies on economic and monetary union, and its reluctance had increased with time . . . The outcome of the negotiation cannot be understood if one forgets that one of the main partners did not, in fact, desire any specific result either on the economic and monetary side or on the political.' No doubt Mr Major is not as hostile to the treaty as Mrs Margaret Thatcher would have been. But there is no trace in his public discourse since becoming prime minister of any positive endorsement of any aspect of the treaty. The first problem with this minimalist stance is that it leads inevitably to crude misrepresentation. The government periodically claims that the Maastricht treaty will make the Community less federal or less supra-national than it would otherwise be. Yet everyone knows that the new objectives laid down by the treaty include a single currency, stronger collective discipline on economic and monetary policies, closer co-operation on immigration and law and order, and the development of a common foreign and security policy, leading perhaps in time to a common defence policy. It is surely odd to deny what anyone can easily find in the treaty. Success in politics may not depend on telling the truth; but it must be reckless to engage in self-evident mendacity. The second problem, potentially more serious, is that minimalism may become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Last December Mr Major demanded and got an opt-out from the single currency, as well as an opt-out from the social chapter. In fact, if a single currency were to be created without British participation, he would regard it as a national disaster; but if he is not careful he may yet succeed in manoeuvring Britain into a generalised opt-out from the mainstream of the Community. The Danish government has put forward a list of special exemptions to enable it to hold a second popular referendum on the Maastricht treaty; these include opt-outs on monetary union, European defence, immigration and national security. If these concessions could be discreetly handed over in a brown paper bag on some dark Tuesday night, no doubt the others would not mind too much, because Denmark is a peripheral country; but there are just three difficulties. First, the Danish demands add up cumulatively to a comprehensive rejection of all the main objectives of the treaty. Second, this Danish rejection is virtually identical in spirit to Mr Major's minimalism. Third, if France and Germany and Italy and the Benelux believe that the treaty is being voided of all operational significance, it is a racing certainty that they will move ahead to form a two-tier Europe, leaving Britain and Denmark where they really would be more comfortable - in a minimal world outside. Britain's dilemma is that it must be 'at the heart of Europe', because it has nowhere else to go; but the dilemma of the British is that they do not like the Community which has been formed by others; they do not sympathise with its objectives; and apparently they still do not understand that they cannot change these objectives.</p>

			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN COURT: A SUMMARY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-RELATED BUSINESS LITIGATION  DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE PAST WEEK.  </P> <P> Suits Against Japanese Firm Allege Poisoning: Dual lawsuits were filed in state  and federal court against Showa Denko K.K. of Japan on behalf of roughly 120  people who allege that they or members of their family were poisoned by  L-tryptophan, an amino acid that was banned in the United States last April.  The multimillion-dollar lawsuits assert that Showa Denko manufactured  L-tryptophan and put the amino acid through a purification process "without  testing, research or knowledge as to what the effect would be in the human  body." The suits assert that Showa Denko "knew the product was the cause of  various medical conditions" resulting in injury. (Case Nos. 004685 and 90-6018,  Filed Nov. 8, 1990)  </P></p>

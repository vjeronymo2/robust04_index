The Azerbaijani side is not abandoning its  attempts to break through the Karabakh's defensive line at the  southeastern sector of the conflict zone.    The enemy tried to launch an infantry attack against the  Karabakh positions east of Martuninskiy Rayon on the evening of  9 March. Having countered a retaliation and suffered losses, the  Azerbaijanis retreated to their initial positions. This was  reported by the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense Army Press  Service.    The same source also reported that intensive shelling of the  Karabakh positions in Martuninskiy and Fizulinskiy rayons  resumed this morning. The Armenian side resorted to counter  operations. There are also reports of Azerbaijani military  losses in these sectors of the front.</p>

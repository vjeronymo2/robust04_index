			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD PROFILE: TUSTIN HISTORICAL DISTRICT: FOCUS;  </P> <P> HISTORICAL DISTRICT KEEPS PAST ALIVE  </P> <P> No one would exactly call him the Donald Trump of the 19th Century -- much to  his dismay. But Columbus Tustin did all right in the end, though he didn't  think so.  </P> <P> With dreams of grandeur, Tustin and business partner Nelson O. Stafford left  the San Francisco Bay area in 1868 and headed south to speculate on real  estate. For what would be considered a paltry down payment on a home in Orange  County today (roughly $20,000), Tustin and Stafford bought 1,359 acres of land  from the old Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana estate.  </P> <P> The following year, the two partners split. Stafford took the western 520 acres  and Tustin was deeded sole ownership of the eastern 839 acres. The Northern  California transplant was finally able to put all his energy, hopes and desire  into building his dream -- Tustin City. He envisioned it as a bustling  metropolis that would be the hub of an embryonic Orange County.  </P> <P> Tustin mapped out his city-to-be with the precision of a mathematician tackling  a complex algebra problem. He cut his fledgling metropolis into blocks of 300  square feet. The major thoroughfare was Main Street, and the north-south roads  were letters of the alphabet, while the east-west roads were numbered.  </P> <P> Once the blueprint was made, the next step was to draw people to populate the  city. With the promotional savvy of a P.T. Barnum, Tustin sweetened the deal  with an enticement of free lots to any adventurous settlers who would build on  the subdivided 50-by-150-foot parcels; he generously offered an entire block  for a family with four or more children. Anyone who would start a church would  receive $100.  </P> <P> By 1872, Tustin's dream was starting to take shape. There were enough people to  start a school and to establish a commercial district; Dr. William Burgess Wall  initiated the citrus industry when he planted his orchards in 1875. During the  next few years the community grew, until eventually Tustin felt poised to kick  his little town into a big city. The key, he thought, was the Southern Pacific  Railroad. But his dream was not to be.  </P> <P> When the dust settled in 1878 after a fierce winner-take-all battle between  Tustin and Santa Ana for a train station, Santa Ana emerged victorious when  Tustin couldn't match the subsidy the railroad demanded. Santa Ana became the  bustling metropolis, Tustin City was the bridesmaid, and Columbus died a  frustrated, bitter man four years later.  </P> <P> Tustin never knew that while he had reached for the moon, he had still managed  to land in the stars. In the decade following his death, the little town he  founded prospered. By the turn of the century it boasted the L. Utt Pioneer  Store, the Bank of Tustin, a doctor's office, a horse-drawn streetcar, a  burgeoning citrus industry and the Tustin Water Works. In 1888, the Southern  Pacific Railroad did indeed establish a terminal there.  </P> <P> It may not have been the evolution Tustin had hoped for, but his little village  had assumed its own identity -- as a simple, honest, agricultural community. It  was that identity -- along with the natural artesian wells, a mild climate,  scenic mountains and the rich soil -- that attracted a lot of folks from  Northern California and the Midwest who just wanted to be good farmers and good  neighbors. The city attracted a lot of migrant workers from Mexico for the same  reason.  </P> <P> In fact, to underscore just how progressive Tustin was, migrant farm workers  studied in school alongside the offspring of the landowners, as evidenced by a  class picture of 1905 displayed in the Tustin Area Museum, a centerpiece of the  Tustin Historical District.  </P> <P> "There were a number of Mexican children who attended Tustin School," says  Carol Jordan, a historian and curator of the museum. "The schools were well  integrated from the beginning. And when the children couldn't come to school,  the teachers would conduct class in the walnut and apricot orchards."  </P> <P> Today the Historical District neighborhood still maintains that ethnic balance  and harmony. It has also managed to retain a small-town atmosphere, despite the  post-war land boom. It is the third-oldest city in the county, and the  neighborhood reflects a certain pride in its heritage. Most of the original  trees and foliage remain, along with a lot of the original homes.  </P> <P> Some of those original homes include those of heavyweight financier David Hewes  (formerly of San Francisco). His house still stands today at 350 South B St.  Hewes' best friends were railroad tycoons Leland Stanford and Henry Huntington,  so it is no wonder he was able to donate the golden spike that marked the  joining of the transcontinental railroad. He and his wife were instrumental in  building the Tustin Presbyterian Church, which still holds services.  </P> <P> Sherman Stevens, with partners James Irvine and Ed Utt, owner of the Utt Juice  Co., developed 1,000 acres on the Irvine Ranch. Stevens' ornate Victorian-style  home at 228 W. Main St. has been designated a historical landmark, and is the  star of an office complex that strives to preserve the architectural integrity  of the neighborhood's earlier days.  </P> <P> In fact, "Olde Tustin," as the neighborhood is also called, is an area with  abundant historical residences and commercial buildings of all kinds. An  afternoon stroll through the shaded streets provides a glimpse into the past  and the well-preserved dreams of the neighborhood's forefathers.  </P> <P> Population  </P> <P> Total: (1989 est.) 3,134  </P> <P> 1980-89 change: +17.6%  </P> <P> Median Age: 33  </P> <P> Racial/ethnic mix:  </P> <P> White (non-Latino): 73%  </P> <P> Latino: 22%  </P> <P> Black: 1%  </P> <P> Other: 4%  </P> <P> By sex and age:  </P> <P> MALES  </P> <P> Median age: 30.7 years  </P> <P> FEMALES  </P> <P> Median age: 35.4 years  </P> <P> Income  </P> <P> Per capita: $14,493  </P> <P> Median household: $21,875  </P> <P> Average household: $25,113  </P> <P> Income Distribution:  </P> <P> Less than $25,000: 57%  </P> <P> $25,000-49,999: 33%  </P> <P> $50,000-74,999: 9%  </P> <P> $75,000-$99,999: 1%DALLAS M.

			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TURNING YOUR YARDS INTO WILDLIFE WELCOME MATS  </P> <P> Photographer Jim Gallagher does not have to leave his Huntington Beach back  yard to snap pictures of his favorite subjects.  </P> <P> From their living room, he and his wife, Sylvia, can see a rich variety of  avian life attracted to the birdbath, feeders and fruit trees in their small  suburban garden. Common local birds are joined by migrating species that find  the tiny back-yard oasis too enticing to pass up.  </P> <P> In all, Gallagher has photographed 43 bird species in his garden; another 15 to  20 species got away before he could get his camera. Many of his back-yard  slides end up in the huge library of the local Sea and Sage Audubon Society  (5,000-plus images and counting, more than half taken by Gallagher).  </P> <P> Sylvia Gallagher, meanwhile, leads the group's workshops on birding skills,  often illustrating the lessons with slides taken in her back yard.  </P> <P> This had been a particularly good spring for the Gallaghers: "Jim's taken  wonderful pictures of lots of new birds," his wife said. "It's been just  great."  </P> <P> Attracting wildlife can bring a new dimension to the enjoyment of suburban  yards, with birds and butterflies the most popular focus of gardeners'  attentions. Approaches vary from simple touches, such as a solitary hummingbird  feeder, to an integrated landscaping approach that attempts to duplicate a  small slice of nature.  </P> <P> Books on gardening for wildlife have become a common item on bookstore shelves  in recent years. The National Wildlife Federation has been promoting the  concept since 1976 and has certified more than 8,000 "back-yard habitats"  across the country.  </P> <P> But several experts say the wildlife gardening concept has been more popular in  the East than locally.  </P> <P> "Southern California, unfortunately, seems to be moving at a slower pace," said  Mike Evans, owner of Tree of Life Nursery in San Juan Capistrano. "Interesting  forms of gardening don't seem to appeal to people that much. I don't know what  it is."  </P> <P> Tree of Life, a wholesale-only nursery on 15 acres of Rancho Mission Viejo near  Caspers Wilderness Park, is the state's largest nursery dealing entirely in  native plants. The 10-year-old nursery grows more than 300 local plant species,  many of which had never before been commercially propagated.  </P> <P> Evans, active in the California Native Plant Society, has taught classes  through UC Irvine Extension on gardening for wildlife. Planting with  drought-tolerant native species -- rather than thirsty suburban lawns -- has  been touted in recent years as a way to save precious water, but the practice  can also help give a home to critters that are being displaced at an increasing  rate by development.  </P> <P> Gardening for wildlife could help make up for some of the lost habitat if it  caught on among homeowners and especially developers, who often plant common  slope areas in a single exotic plant. "Plants on those slopes are useless to  wildlife," Evans said.  </P> <P> Likewise, the traditional home landscape of a neatly manicured suburban lawn  bordered with exotic plant species may look lush and green, but to wildlife it  can be a virtual desert.  </P> <P> While there are many approaches to making yards more hospitable to wildlife,  Evans espouses a comprehensive ideal that stresses "local wildlife in its own  season."  </P> <P> The idea of wildlife gardening, he said, "is a whole concept of duplicating  nature."  </P> <P> Evans' approach is based on four basic principles:  </P> <P> Use native species. Local wildlife evolved with local vegetation and often can  make no use of the exotic plants so popular among gardeners.  </P> <P> Use a variety of plants that provide animals with three basic requirements:  food, cover and nesting materials.  </P> <P> Use a layered scheme that duplicates the native coastal sage scrub plant  community that predominates in the local hills. The layers graduate from  grasses to soft-branched shrubs (two to three feet high), to taller shrubs such  as toyon and lemonade berry (six to eight feet high), to native trees,  especially oak and sycamore. There should be an edge separating the various  layers, Evans said, rather than a mixture of plant sizes.  </P> <P> Do not disturb. As they grow and mature, native plants require little pruning  or other maintenance. Raking should also be kept to a minimum because fallen  leaves provide a rich environment for insects that attract birds and lizards.  Dead wood in trees, if left intact, can provide a home for cavity-nesting  birds.  </P> <P> "What you're ending up with is a very natural-looking garden," Evans said.  </P> <P> Contrary to popular misconception, that is not the same thing as a weed lot.  Native plants, in addition to requiring little water or maintenance, are green  all year and often very attractive, Evans said. Aesthetically, they are  especially appropriate in foothills, where development is escalating and where  exotic plants can look out of place alongside the planned natural areas.  </P> <P> "They look like they belong," Evans said of indigenous plants. "These aren't  inferior landscape plants. They look quite good on their own."  </P> <P> While most nurseries carry but a few natives, the Fullerton Arboretum sells  varied native plants and can special-order particular species not on hand.  (Tree of Life is not open to the public.)  </P> <P> In addition to such common back-yard birds as house finches and house sparrows,  a native garden can attract such woodland natives as phoebes, towhees, acorn  woodpeckers and flycatchers. Large trees can provide homeowners with a glimpse  of red-shouldered hawks, barn owls and great horned owls. Non-pest insects,  especially butterflies, are another bonus.  </P> <P> Among landlocked animals, "we are blessed with a couple of good lizard  species," Evans said. Small mammals might include the deer mouse and the meadow  mouse (not associated with the house mice or roof rats).  </P> <P> There is no guarantee, however, that following Evans' recipe will lead to an  abundance of wildlife. The degree of success is difficult to foresee and  depends on such factors as proximity to large, undeveloped open areas. A couple  of neighborhood cats can raise havoc, Evans said.  </P> <P> Still, Evans argued, a native plant garden is a pleasure in its own right: "If  I'm reminded of neat natural areas when I go out and look at my garden, that's  wildlife too."  </P> <P> For gardeners unable or unwilling to tackle Evans' comprehensive approach,  there are other, less involved ways to make gardens attractive to wildlife.  Most of these focus on a particular kind of creature: The Gallaghers, for  instance, try to attract birds that pass through the county along the Pacific  flyway, a major north-south migration route.  </P> <P> A birdbath is the essential element in the Gallaghers' back-yard sanctuary. The  fairly simple arrangement includes water that drips slowly from a hose and  splashes into the bath; some birds, such as warblers, prefer moving water to a  still pool.  </P> <P> The bath is placed near a bush. "Birds like to be able to escape into a bush or  a very low tree," Gallagher said. "It's important to have shrubs."  </P> <P> A bucket collects the run-over and is used to water the garden when full.  </P> <P> Seed is placed in a high feeder and spread on the patio (some birds prefer to  feed on the ground). Of course, not all birds are seed-eaters. The Gallaghers  have a fruit tree that not only provides a meal to fruit-eating birds but also  attracts bugs that bring in the insect-eating birds.  </P> <P> Sylvia Gallagher also recommends some kind of berry plant, with the native  toyon a good candidate.  </P> <P> The arrangement not only attracts migrating birds, but is also popular among  such common year-round birds as house sparrows and house finches. In addition,  seeing these birds feeding below helps to clue transient species that a meal  and bath are available below.  </P> <P> Butterflies are another popular creature that can thrive in the suburban  environment. While adult butterflies can often feed on a variety of  nectar-producing flowers, the caterpillars are usually much more picky, perhaps  feeding on just one species of plant.  </P> <P> To ensure a local butterfly population, food for both the adult and larvae  should be available (for a listing of common local butterflies and their food  plants, see Clipboard on Page 2).  </P> <P> Some local butterflies depend on exotic plants; the gulf fritillary, for  instance, is particular to passion vine because the butterfly itself is not  native and became established locally when the passion vine became a popular  plant. However, many popular ornamentals planted in the county are of no value  to butterflies.  </P> <P> Attracting butterflies is more than a way to bring life and color to a garden;  entomologist Larry Orsak said new habitat may be crucial to the survival of  local butterfly populations.  </P> <P> "Urbanization has greatly reduced the county's lowland butterfly fauna," Orsak  wrote in a guide to county butterfly gardening while he was a student at UC  Irvine. "Butterfly gardening can partly remedy this situation."  </P></p>

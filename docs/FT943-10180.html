			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Coffee selling put on ice London coffee futures were yesterday able to hold on to most of this week's gains mainly because of the reluctance of sellers, rather than the enthusiasm of buyers. The November at the London Commodity Exchange closed at Dollars 3,550 a tonne, down Dollars 66 on the day but still Dollars 197 up on the week, as the possibility of further frost damage to the Brazilian crop caused most speculators to put selling plans on ice, until next week at least. The return of cold weather to Brazilian coffee areas pushed prices up sharply early in the week and news of another frost took the November price up to Dollars 3,675 on Thursday morning. It quickly became apparent, however, that the frost was only a light one and that it had touched only a limited coffee-growing area. Nevertheless, with the cold weather persisting speculators were not about to leave themselves short over the weekend. In its latest Monthly Bulletin London trade house ED &amp; F. Man said that coffee roasters were 'extremely suspicious of a market that has been fuelled so much by expectations of continuing supply problems'. The big test would come in October, it said, when producing countries started marketing the 1994-95 winter crops and buying began for the peak roasting season. With the sizes of crops and the extent of Brazilian frost damage being clearer by then roasters would have to decide whether their 'hand to mouth' buying strategy was still appropriate or whether they should extend physical cover. LCE cocoa prices were under pressure for most of the week from technical factors. The December futures position closed yesterday at Pounds 1,066 a tonne, down Pounds 69 overall. At the London bullion market gold yesterday ended a six-day sequence of falls that had tested support at the bottom of its recent trading range. The price closed at Dollars 378.50 a troy ounce, up 30 cents on the day but Dollars 5.40 down on the week. The fall was probably a reflection of the normal northern hemisphere summer lull in demand, suggested Mr George Milling-Stanley, analyst at Lehman Brothers in New York. Platinum meanwhile continued its retreat from recent long-time highs, 'fixing' yesterday afternoon at Dollars 409.85, up Dollars 5.60 on the day but Dollars 9.65 down on the week. Silver was also weak, ending 12.25 cents down at Dollars 5.16 1/4 a tonne. It was a similar story at the London Metal Exchange, where copper led a general price decline. Three months metal closed yesterday at Dollars 2,403.50 a tonne, down Dollars 39 overall, having dipped to Dollars 2,362 on Tuesday. The price had tested the area below Dollars 2,400 again yesterday morning, on news of another rise in LME warehouse stocks. Traders told the Reuters news agency that copper continued to be influenced by speculative interest at both ends of the market, amid a lack of consumer demand during the summer slowdown in industrial activity. For aluminium the continuing drawdown from LME stocks could not prevent an extension of the retreat from last week's 3 1/2 -year highs. But an early fall yesterday below Dollars 1,440 a tonne for three months delivery attracted buyers and the price closed at Dollars 1,448.75, down Dollars 29.75 on the week. Although its fundamental outlook remained positive the LME three months lead price this week abandoned its struggle to stay above Dollars 600 a tonne, ending at Dollars 596.50 a tonne.  ----------------------------------------------              LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  ---------------------------------------------- (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ---------------------------------------------- Aluminium           -8,17  to  2,512,100 Aluminium alloy      -220  to     26,640 Copper             +1,650  to    340,550 Lead               +4,350  to    360,775 Nickel               +390  to    134,142 Zinc               +1,800  to  1,215,700 Tin                  +315  to     31,010  ----------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           WEEKLY PRICE CHANGES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Latest   Change     Year            1994                           prices  on week      ago      High      Low                          Dollars            Dollars   Dollars   Dollars  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Gold per troy oz.        383.50    -0.40    376.50    396.50    369.50 Silver per troy oz       336.70p   -5.80    305.50p   384.50p   335.30p Aluminium 99.7% (cash)  1421.50    -28.5    1200.5   1529.50   1107.50 Copper Grade A (cash)   2400.50      -38    1968.5   2521.00   1731.50 Lead (cash)              579.50     -4.5     397.0     592.0     426.0 Nickel (cash)           6075.00     -137      4860      6490    5210.0 Zinc SHG (cash)          937.50       -5     881.5      1014     900.5 Tin (cash)               5032.5   -172.5    4863.5    5650.0    4730.0                           Pounds            Pounds    Pounds    Pounds Cocoa Futures Dec          1055      -79       735      1124       859 Coffee Futures Dec         3550     +197      1128      3828      1175 Sugar (LDP Raw)           306.7     +5.7     261.2     309.4     252.9 Barley Futures Nov       105.00    +0.50     101.5    105.50     92.65 Wheat Futures Nov        106.50    +1.20    105.75    117.50     97.80 Cotton Outlook A Index    77.95c    -5.4     55.60c    87.10c    62.45c Wool (64s Super)            440p     351p                440p      342p Oil (Brent Blend)         17.79x   -0.72     16.46     18.61     13.16  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Per tonne unless otherwise stated. p Pence/kg. c Cents lb. x Sep  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

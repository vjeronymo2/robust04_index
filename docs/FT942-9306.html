			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Unexpected strength in April retail sales Retail sales were stronger than anticipated last month, according to the Confederation of British Industry's latest distributive trades survey. Britain's shopkeepers, however, could not completely shrug off the April tax increases - sales fell below normal expectations for the time of year for the fourth month in succession. Half the 313 retailers polled between April 18 and May 4 said that volume sales were higher in April than in April 1993, while 28 per cent said that they were lower. The resulting balance of plus 22 per cent was the highest since December and well above the 14 per cent positive balance of retailers who expected a year-on-year increase in sales in April when polled before the tax increases. However, only 16 per cent of those polled said that sales were good for the time of year: just over half reported average sales and 31 per cent said sales were poor. The resulting negative balance of 15 per cent was in line with the survey's findings for the first three months of this year and was consistent with an 'unspectacular economic recovery', according to Ms Kate Barker, the CBI's chief economic adviser. There were marked differences between retail sectors last month. Strong sales growth among footwear and leather shops, clothing retailers and confectioners contrasted with a marked downturn in chemists' sales for the second month in succession. Within retailing, mail-order companies, with a positive balance of 93 per cent, reported a sharp increase in sales volumes. Otherwise, only large multiple stores reported higher sales in April. Wholesalers' reported a positive balance of sales in the year to April of 14 per cent. This was the smallest such balance since August last year, indicating a slow rate of growth. Wholesalers, however, said that sales for the time of year were higher than normal. A relatively strong positive balance (31 per cent) of the 128 companies polled said that they expected increased sales this month. Among motor traders, a positive balance of 24 per cent of the 62 companies surveyed pointed to an increase in sales in the year to April. Yet sales were reported to be below average following 'roughly average' sales in March and higher than average sales in January and February. The CBI said that the annual rate of sales growth was expected to improve for all three distributive trades in May while sales volumes were expected to be slightly greater than average. A record number of direct mail items were posted in the first quarter of this year, according to the Direct Mail Information Service, an independent monitoring group, Diane Summers writes. The figure of 705m items, up almost 9 per cent over the first quarter of 1993, overtakes the previous record of 648m for the first quarter of pre-recession 1990. January to March is traditionally the busiest time for direct mailing activity. The totals exclude overseas mail, for which no figures are available. CBI Distributive Trades Survey, End April 1994.

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News: Manila to reduce PAL stake THE Philippine government plans to auction part of its stake in Philippine Airlines (PAL) to try to resolve an ownership battle and raise money for economic programmes, Reuter reports from Manila. Philippine National Bank (PNB) has been directed to sell a 20 per cent stake held by state institutions in PR Holdings, a consortium that owns the majority of PAL. The move is seen as helping to resolve the stalemate between PAL chairman Mr Antonio Cojuangco and his allies, and Mr Lucio Tan, who heads a beer and tobacco empire. Each side owns about 40 per cent of PR Holdings, with government institutions holding the balance. Together with PNB, the Development Bank of the Philippines and a military pension fund own 20 per cent of the consortium that bought 67 per cent of PAL when it was privatised last year. The remaining 33 per cent is held by the government.</p>

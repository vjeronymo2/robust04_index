			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: Interest boosts Christiania Bank CHRISTIANIA Bank, Norway's second-biggest bank, has cut losses significantly during 1992 due to a huge increase in net interest income, a sharp reduction in operating expenses and a substantial cut in credit losses. Net losses at the state-owned bank fell to NKr1.3bn (Dollars 187m) from NKr9.2bn as net interest income rose by NKr357m to NKr3.1bn, despite a NKr300m reduction in loan volume. Mr Borger Lenth, chief executive, hopes to reach breakeven this year, but said there was still uncertainty over corporate customers' ability to service debt. Non-interest income surged by 52 per cent, by NKr576m to NKr1.67bn, due to higher foreign exchange income and significantly lower losses on securities. Foreign exchange income nearly doubled to NKr605m from NKr392m as securities losses were cut to NKr94m from NKr359m. Operating expenses were slashed by 19 per cent, or by NKr653m to NKr2.86bn, allowing the bank to fulfil authorities' demands by a good margin to reduce costs by 15 per cent in 1992. Christiania cut 665 jobs last year to 4,236, and 1,100 jobs over the past two years. Mr Lenth said the level of loan losses was still unacceptably high, especially among large corporate customers, but noted there had been a substantial improvement at the operating level. 'This is a direct result of measures taken last year to return the bank to profit. Our retail division . . . is in the black,' Mr Lenth said. Losses on loans and guarantees fell to NKr2.8bn from NKr7.2bn in 1991. Gross non-performing loans fell by NKr1.7bn to NKr12.1bn during the course of last year. Provisions for loan losses include NKr1.8bn related to large corporate customers. Four commitments accounted for NKr1bn of the provision. Losses by retail customers plunged by 60 per cent to NKr300m from NKr800m. Losses by small to medium-sized corporate customers accounted for NKr500m of provisions while the international subsidiary and branches accounted for NKr200m. IBCA, the UK credit rating agency, has placed three Finnish banks on RatingWatch for possible upgrade, after the Finnish parliament strengthened its commitment to resolving the country's banking crisis earlier this week, writes Christopher Brown-Humes. The agency says the move affects the long and short-term ratings of Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Union Bank of Finland and Postipankki.</p>

			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Observer: Happy ending It all began when the parrot fell off its perch. Mrs X of Wales was very upset when her pet parakeet passed away shortly after she bought a new gas fire. Could it have been the fumes from the faulty equipment? The Gas Consumers Council swung into action and Mrs X soon had a new gas fire. But the drama did not stop there. British Gas 'asked her to dig up the body, wrap it in a carrier bag and put it in the freezer until a post-mortem could be carried out'. Mrs X refused and told British Gas that if they wanted the body they should come and 'dig it up themselves'. Although the cause of death of the bird was never established, the annual report of the GCC proudly reports that Mrs X accepted a cash settlement for the 'inconvenience caused'.</p>

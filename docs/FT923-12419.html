			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Think first, speak later WINKING in China is rude. Backslapping in Britain, bad form. If they feel unhappy, the Japanese may laugh. South Americans take offence at a drooping posture. Narcissism is globally repellent. The weather is always a good ice breaker. When dealing with a traffic policeman, it is generally wise to refrain from hitting him. You have trouble remembering names? Try this simple mnemonic device: if a man's name is Fred, and he is a bore, then commit him to memory as Dead Fred. These nuggets come from a new book called Confident Conversation, by Lillian Glass. Dr Glass is a speech therapist practising in Beverly Hills, California. Some beneficiaries of her advice are celebrated: Sean Connery, Dustin Hoffmann, Dolly Parton. However, her book is aimed more at business executives than Hollywood entertainers. Even the boldest executives, apparently, are prone to 'turn pale at the thought of attending a dinner, speaking at a board meeting or just meeting new people.' Perhaps they have had nasty experiences on the communication front: been caught drooping in Rio, or signed a deal in Tokyo to roars of laughter. Or worse, they may simply have been using an outdated handbook. Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People is half a century old and, as Glass points out, the world has moved on. The tenets of effective communication enshrined in Carnegie no longer hold for the Nineties. The Nineties are a new ballpark. 'Be upbeat,' urges Dr Glass, 'Oxygenate yourself.' The rest of the world may be nodding when it means dissent, or beating about the bush in all sorts of foxy ways, but in the US, overt friendliness is the rule. Go in there with bags of eye contact. Crack a few jokes. Be a big greeter. Kiss or hug if it feels good. But above all, be yourself. Be straight. So Carnegie is revised. 'Never tell a man he is wrong,' recommended Carnegie. Not in the Nineties. Confront that man. Put him in the picture about his mistakes. Tell him that you hear what he is saying, but tell him he is wrong all the same. 'Let the other fellow feel the idea is his,' maintained Carnegie. No way. It is your initiative. Label it with rightful pride. 'Go for immediate assent,' advised Carnegie. Why the hurry? Sow some ideas. Bring them on gently. Give your targets the space to come round. Carnegie again: 'Make your praise lavish and your approbation hearty.' Whoa. Here we are talking phoney praise, and phoney praise is worse than no praise. Do not patronise. Think of it this way: a pat on the back is only a few vertebrae removed from a kick in the pants. How many copies of Carnegie are still around is anyone's guess, but if the book is still in use, I like to think of executives handing out hearty approbation for the blunders of their employees and wondering when this technique will bring happy results. The direct, upbeat and oxygenated style of the Nineties sounds frightfully healthy: it smacks of improvement. But if Carnegie is finally due to be laid on the shelves of our charity shops, some brief sentiment of farewell must be recorded. Civilised life largely rests upon a skein of white lies, pleasantries and the tolerance of fools. Every day, we shoulder the trials of insincerity: the onus of finding, as Philip Larkin put it, 'words at once true and kind, or not untrue and not unkind.' Carnegie based his counsel on the will to be liked, a will always more palpable in the US than anywhere else. It can be nauseating - 'Missing you already]' - but the alternatives are pretty horrific. One recent bestselling book in Britain was entitled How to be a Complete Bastard. Traffic policemen in the UK are, I believe, becoming almost inured to daily assaults upon their persons. Take off the veneer of niceness and circumlocution from everyday association and you are left, in most cases, with something not far short of barbarism. If we were to jettison completely the Carnegie technique, the result is not hard to imagine. We would all start to sound like the protagonists of television's Eastenders: speaking our minds for the most part in a tedious flow of verbal exchanges which are nasty, brutish and short.</p>

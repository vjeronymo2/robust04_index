			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The final day of a two-day strike by UC Berkeley graduate students who work as  teaching assistants, research assistants and tutors forced the cancellation of  75% of classes, the strikers claimed. "We were absolutely successful," said  Colette Patt, a leader of the graduate students' association which is seeking  UC recognition as a union. Tom Debley, a campus spokesman, said he could not  confirm the percentage of cancellations but he said that most of the missed  classes will be rescheduled before final exams later this month. Debley said UC  administrators will meet soon with the teaching assistants.  </P></p>

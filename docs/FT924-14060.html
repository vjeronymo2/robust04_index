			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Kuwait 'chooses US' to supply main battle tank KUWAIT has chosen the US Abrams M1-A2 tank, similar to those which helped the allies win the Gulf war against Iraq, as the main battle tank for its army, the official Kuwait News Agency (Kuna) quoted Sheikh Ali Sabah al-Salem al-Sabah, defence minister, as saying yesterday, Reuter reports from Kuwait City. A committee of military experts had chosen the tank as 'the most responsive to Kuwaiti army requirements', the report went on. But last night, Vickers of the UK, which had been competing for the contract, said it had no knowledge of any decision and was surprised by the report. According to Kuna, Sheikh Ali said contacts were under way with the US government to facilitate the purchase of the tanks made by General Dynamics. Kuna did not say how many tanks Kuwait would buy or give the expected value of the deal. British Challenger tanks competed with US tanks in desert trials this summer for a contract expected to involve about 230 tanks and spare parts in a deal worth Dollars 1.5bn-Dollars 2bn.</p>

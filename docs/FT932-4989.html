			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Prominent companies admit bribes and kickbacks SAIPEM and Nuovo Pignone, two leading Italian engineering companies, have admitted to paying more than Dollars 160m (Pounds 104m) in kickbacks and bribes to win new business in the past six years. The revelations, contained in their 1992 reports and accounts, indicate the scale of payments the companies made to obtain big domestic and foreign contracts and to satisfy Italian political party demands. The revelations could begin a trend in corporate accounting, as companies implicated in political corruption reveal to shareholders the scale and nature of previously secret payments, formerly kept off published balance sheets and paid via foreign subsidiaries. Saipem, an engineering group specialising in the energy sector, and Nuovo Pignone, which makes gas turbines and compressors, are parts of the state-owned Eni energy and chemicals concern. Eni, whose former chairman, Mr Gabriele Cagliari, is in prison on corruption allegations, has been deeply implicated in the scandal. Saipem's accounts show it paid almost Dollars 121.6m (Pounds 79m) in kickbacks and 'commissions' to win business between 1987 and 1992, while the smaller Nuovo Pignone says it paid L25bn (Pounds 11m). The payments cover both kickbacks to political parties on domestic orders from public sector companies, such as Enel, and payments to unspecified foreign intermediaries to win foreign projects. The accounts of Saipem, whose chairman, Mr Gianni Dell'Orto, was arrested earlier this year, show Dollars 91.4m was paid between 1987 and 1992 to companies controlled by Mr Pier Francesco Pacini Battaglia, a Geneva-based Italian banker who has emerged as a key figure in undeclared payments by the Eni group. Mr Dell'Orto is today expected to be replaced as chairman at Saipem's annual meeting. Almost Dollars 71m of the total is believed to have gone to foreign intermediaries to help win contracts, while the balance of about Dollars 20.6m was presumably paid to Italian political parties. Saipem says a further Dollars 50.8m was paid directly by a Zurich subsidiary to unnamed foreigners. The group says it won about L12,000bn of contracts during the period. Although Saipem and Nuovo Pignone are breaking ground in Italian corporate reporting, the sheer numbers of other leading groups already implicated suggests it may not be long before others follow.</p>

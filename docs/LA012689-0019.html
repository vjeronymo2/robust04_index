			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUR FAILURE TO VALUE EDUCATION  </P> <P> Thompson's column paints a vivid picture of what he thinks American society is  like in respect to "intellectual pursuits." Unfortunately, his views are quite  valid. Having been born and raised in this society and having recently  graduated from high school, I can reflect upon the times I had a tendency to  settle for something average when I could have striven for more. This is the  attitude that limits many people's potential for higher achievement and is, as  Thompson states, a contributing factor to the "educational depression" in the  United States. I am in complete accordance with his view that these present  attitudes of settling for less than what can actually be achieved will  ultimately affect the United States' position in the world.  </P> <P> Schools today are emphasizing students' grades and SAT scores too much rather  than students' actual knowledge in particular areas. One place to start in  solving this problem is in college admissions criteria. Colleges should not  accept students solely based on grade-point averages, but by their attempts at  more challenging courses and extracurricular activities. High schools can  contribute to this solution by giving extra grade points to students who take  the more rigorous courses. However, it ultimately depends on the student.  </P> <P> Stanley Thompson Jr. -- I hear your plea to defeat ignorance! It is one that I  have also made. I'll spread the word.  </P> <P> MICHAEL ZEE  </P> <P> La Jolla  </P></p>

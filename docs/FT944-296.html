			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Russian call for state takeovers: Plan for control of key enterprises jolts reform drive The new head of Russia's State Property Committee, the main agency for privatisation, said yesterday he was preparing a law to renationalise enterprises in the central sectors of the Russian economy - oil and gas, aluminium and the military-industrial complex. Mr Vladimir Polevanov, appointed last month as head of the committee in succession to Mr Anatoly Chubais, now a first deputy prime minister in charge of the economy, told a group of Russian journalists it was essential to 'change the economic course of the government' and impose 'strict state management of enterprises'. He claimed he had the support of President Boris Yeltsin and 'a part' of the government. This is Mr Polevanov's most open statement of his aims since his appointment  -though a series of muffled conflicts have been obvious between him and Mr Chubais, the government's leading reformist, over the course of privatisation. However, in claiming the president's support, Mr Polevanov is also claiming that his line is winning out in the struggle over reform. The threat to enterprises in sectors most attractive to foreign investors - which include such companies as Lukoil and Gasprom, now actively seeking foreign investment - is a move of the kind most feared by investors considering putting money into a country still seen as politically volatile. However, Mr Polevanov is being strongly opposed behind the scenes by Mr Chubais, who is fighting to keep reform and privatisation alive by working with Mr Polevanov's reform-minded deputies. Mr Polevanov said he was 'very concerned' that in auctions of enterprises in the fuel, energy and aluminium sectors, foreign investors had secured packets of shares of up to 15 per cent of a company's stock and thus the right to seats on the board. 'This directly threatens the security of Russia,' he said. He claimed that a senior official on Mr Yeltsin's staff had produced a report on the threat to national security of privatisation and foreign investment and that his actions were conforming to the lines of the report. The privatisation committee, he said, was now drafting a law in co-operation with the heads of the Duma's privatisation and budget committees, to bring back the strategically important companies within state control. He said any loss of foreign investment as a result of such a law would be compensated by imposition of higher import tariffs. Earlier this week, Mr Maxim Boiko, head of the Privatisation Centre - an independent institute close to the government - acknowledged that Mr Polevanov's ideas were in contradiction to the reform course but said he was 'new in the job'.</p>

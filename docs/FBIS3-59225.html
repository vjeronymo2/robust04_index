			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Nicolas Redondo, secretary general of </F> the General Workers' Union, UGT, and Antonio Gutierrez,  secretary general of the Workers' Commissions, by unidentified  announcer -- live]    [Excerpts] [Announcer] Good evening Mr. Nicolas Redondo,  secretary general of the UGT.    [Redondo] Good evening.    [Announcer] Good evening Mr. Antonio Gutierrez, top leader  of  the Workers' Commissions.    [Gutierrez] Good evening.    [Announcer] To use in an orderly manner the time and your  live contribution here on Radio Nacional, for which we thank  you, I would like to ask you for a brief assessment of what has  happened today in Spain. Mr. Redondo?.    [Redondo] Well, I believe that the figures speak for  themselves, don't they? And what's more, this strike has been  visually apparent. We have seen empty roads, we have seen the  situation in a perceptible form. The foreign media -- CNN and  other media such as those in Britain, Italy, or France --  acknowledge the success of the strike. All the same, it's  rather odd how this country has to be different, because [words  indistinct] to realize the truth than the foreigners. But  having said that, no one doubts the success of the strike --  huge support from [words indistinct] and very considerable  support from society. Therefore we are highly satisfied.  Millions of people have taken part in this strike and the  appropriate conclusions must be drawn from that.    [Announcer] Mr. Antonio Gutierrez, is the success of the  strike first and foremost?    [Gutierrez] That's right, I believe that it is an  unquestionable fact. That the immense majority of working men  and women and of those who may be workers in the future -- young  people, students, or otherwise -- have supported this strike on  such a large scale, convinced that it was just, that it was  necessary, and also quite determined that this strike should be  very beneficial for the country and for the workers. [passage  omitted]    [Announcer] Mr. Gutierrez, what are the terms of the letter  you have sent to [Prime Minister] Felipe Gonzalez asking him for  negotiations?    [Gutierrez] Well, the truth is that out of basic  responsibility and courtesy, we do not wish the exact contents  of the letter to be known to the media before he receives it.  But, summing it up briefly, what we convey to him is that  following the success of this strike, which gives a lesson in  democracy and civic conduct and shows up those who have spread  alarm about possible violence and all that, we ask him for a  meeting so that the government can respond as soon as possible  to this demand to change -- by means of negotiations -- labor  reforms. Because the stubborn ones are those who, in spite of  the proof of this widespread rejection, in spite of the proof of  the failure of their economic and social policy, stick to the  same line. As Nicolas says we are in no way stubborn. What we  do is reflect, reflect positively, on what is happening and  offer negotiations. We are not saying that the revealed truth  of the trade unions must be accepted here 100 percent. It seems  that it is the government that has maintained such a position  until now, not us.

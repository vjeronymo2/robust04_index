			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Asia and the global village ON THE streets of Kuala Lumpur, it is impossible to buy newspapers from neighbouring Singapore. In Singapore, a self-styled hub of global communication, there is a parallel ban on selling newspapers from Malaysia. Both countries have shouldered their way to the front among developing nations in terms of growth and rising income levels. But their governments - though they are vying with each other to host regional media centres - continue to take fright at the flow of information which, they fear, could in some way destabilise them. They are jumping at shadows, particularly when they rail - as Malaysia's prime minister did yesterday - against the spread of satellite television. Singapore's government has mostly managed to keep the lid on many kinds of behaviour it regards as anti-social - including satellite television - partly thanks to enviable success in delivering higher standards of living, and partly because of its compactness. In this haven for business, the editor of the country's own leading business newspaper has run foul of the law for publishing a quarterly gross domestic product growth estimate before its official release. The government's action this week to limit the circulation of the Economist, half-owned by the Financial Times, is but the latest in a string of actions against foreign media organisations. Totalitarian governments In the rest of the world, however, government attempts to control information have long been exposed as futile. The lesson of the ex-Soviet countries is that in the end, even totalitarian governments could not curb the use of the samizdat fax machine and the incursions of foreign broadcasters. In Asia, the proliferation of satellite dishes in countries which restrict their sale - Malaysia, Indonesia and China - underlines the growing difficulty of controlling choice when rising living standards feed the appetite for entertainment. Star Television, the Hong Kong broadcaster, has developed a huge viewership among Asian audiences who welcome the variety offered by its five channels. Dr Mahathir Mohamad, prime minister of Malaysia, is alarmed at Mr Rupert Murdoch's purchase of a controlling stake in Star TV. He suggested yesterday that Mr Murdoch's purpose was to 'control the news that we are going to receive,' and launched into a familiar attack on the western press for its portrayal of Asian countries. Indigenous culture Some concerns of Asian governments are understandable. They fear that indigenous culture will be undermined by a seductive diet of MTV and soap operas; they are right to want news that reflects their citizens' priorities. The answer, however, does not lie in attempts at direct control, any more than it lay in UN-sponsored attempts a decade ago to promote a 'new information order' purged of western values. Citizens want choice; technology ensures that they will have it. Governments should focus upon fostering an environment in which choice can flourish. That means restricting concentrations of ownership and nurturing the kinds of media which they feel to be beneficial. For example, Dr Mahathir suggests that Asian countries should start their own network. Many south-east Asian newspapers are already very profitable and could easily invest in development of new pan-Asian media. The experience of Hong Kong and Thailand suggests that the economic miracle is not threatened by press freedom. In controlling their own press and railing at the western media, leaders of some Asian countries betray their pre-occupation with past battles and their failure to come to terms with their own economic success.</p>

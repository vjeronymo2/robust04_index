			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEALTH CARE /GULF FALLOUT;  </P> <P> CHARITY HOSPITAL HAS MONEY CRISISFACILITY SERVES 1.7 MILLION PALESTINIANS.  INVASION CUTS OFF FUNDS FROM KUWAIT.  </P> <P> For two decades, Makassed Hospital atop the Mount of Olives in East Jerusalem  has been the chief medical center for 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied  territories, almost their only succor when seriously ill or injured.  </P> <P> But now, because of a shut-off of funds from Kuwait, the 250-bed charity  hospital is facing financial disaster, and the staff is worried.  </P> <P> Kuwait and other sources in the Persian Gulf region have supplied fully 70% of  the hospital's annual budget of $15 million, and not a dime has arrived from  the region since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. (The other 30% comes  from private donors, mostly Palestinian, and fees for treatment paid by those  who can afford it.)  </P> <P> "These funds are vital to our future," the hospital's director, Dr. Adnan S.  Hamad, said, poring over budget figures in his office. "This means we will  immediately have to cut down on all planned improvements in every department  and outpatient services."  </P> <P> Makassed treats about 60,000 outpatients a year, along with 12,000 hospitalized  patients. About 5,900 surgical operations were performed last year, and about  half the beds were occupied by surgical patients.  </P> <P> For the last three years, the hospital has been running at about 107% of  capacity; occasionally, cots are set up in the corridors.  </P> <P> Dr. Hamad has sent general manager Mahmoud Habbibbeh to seek out potential  donors in the Arab world. But Hamad admits that the task has not been helped by  official Palestinian support for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's actions.  </P> <P> "Raising money is now the most important concern of mine," Hamad said. "We are  appealing to anyone who can help us -- in the Arab world, in Europe, in the  United States. We are calling on all those who believe in medicine for needy  human beings. But we are worried that our call for help is falling on deaf  ears."  </P> <P> Hamad, 34, who received his degree in hospital administration from England's  Manchester University, admits that Makassed has been called the "Intifada  Hospital" after the term in Arabic for the Palestinian uprising against the  Israelis that began in December of 1987. He thinks the appellation is  undeserved.  </P> <P> "We were under occupation," he said, "and many of the intifada victims came  here because they were afraid to go to Israeli hospitals, where they might be  arrested. We have always been a charity hospital, and we take in anyone in  need. About 9,000 intifada victims have been treated, mostly as outpatients.  </P> <P> "There is a psychological trust between Palestinians and Makassed. But we treat  Jews, Christians, Muslims -- anyone who comes to our doors. Many can't afford  an Israeli hospital, or don't have the necessary medical insurance. In a way,  we are the national health service for Palestinians."  </P> <P> Hamad and his assistant, Dr. Amin Thalji, 41, who is chief of pediatrics and  was at Chicago's Cook County Hospital, point out that Makassed offers the only  advanced medical treatment in all of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> West Bank towns like Hebron and Nablus have small infirmaries and maternity  clinics, Thalji said, but only Makassed offers advanced treatment in such  specialties as orthopedics, radiology, neurology, urology, postnatal care,  open-heart surgery and other vascular techniques. About 15% of the beds are  occupied by intensive-care patients.  </P> <P> The hospital has a staff of 760, including 100 physicians and 300 nurses. It is  the only teaching hospital in the occupied territories.  </P> <P> "We have done our best to serve an area with more than a million and a half  people," Thalji said. "We know that the gulf crisis has caused a lot of  economic hardship in the West Bank . . . . But we must differentiate between  shutting down a shoe factory and a hospital."  </P> <P> Hamad added: "We are trying to meet the medical needs of the Palestinian  people. We'd hate to see the quality of medicine here suffer because of the  crisis. But we have to make up those funds somehow. We need all the help we can  get."  </P></p>

They added that Interior Minister Brigadier General Yahya  al-Mutawakkil was instructed to inform Yahya al-Shami and Fish  Resources Minister Fadl Muhsin 'Abdallah, both of whom are  members of the YSP's Political Bureau, and Dr. 'Abd-al-Quddus  al-Midwahi, who is one of the leaders of the Nasirite Unionist  Organization, to leave Sanaa. They are all members of the  Political Forces Dialogue Committee.    A YSP spokesman said that this "meant that people were being  expelled from their own homeland and that the way was being  paved for further developments later on." Sources in Sanaa  stressed that dismissal of Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas's  cabinet and formation of a new cabinet under the chairmanship of  another YSP leader was being seriously considered because of the  continuing political battle and exchange of accusations between  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Engineer al-'Attas.

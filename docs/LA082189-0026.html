			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Two U.S. congressmen have said a health warning on the dangers of smoking in  the latest James Bond movie, "Licence to Kill" should appear at the beginning  of the film, rather than during the final credits, and have said they will ask  the Federal Trade Commission whether it has the authority to issue rules on  tobacco advertising in movies. "Many viewers of the film will leave before they  see a warning in the movie's credits," said Rep. Tom Luken (D-Ohio) and Bob  Whittaker (R-Kan.) in a letter to Janet D. Steiger, FTC chairwoman. Philip  Morris had paid $350,000 to the film maker, United Artists, to have a Lark  cigarette appear in the film, according to congressional testimony. In response  to concerns from the American Lung Assn., American Heart Assn. and American  Cancer Society, the Surgeon General's warning about the effect of smoking  appears during the final credits.

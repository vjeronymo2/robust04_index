			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / UN to step up protection for peacekeepers THE United Nations last night signalled a tougher line to safeguard the lives of peacekeeping troops in Bosnia-Hercegovina, amid growing outrage at the killing of two French officers in a relief convoy ambush at Sarajevo on Tuesday. Responding to calls for troops to return fire if attacked, the Security Council said there was urgent need for 'reinforcing the security and protection' of UN personnel in Bosnia. Members nations were ready 'to adopt without delay measures to this end.' The Council condemned the relief convoy attack, which the UN peacekeeping force blamed squarely on the largely Moslem forces of the Bosnian government. The UN force also accused Moslem fighters of carrying out three other recent attacks on peacekeepers. Reflecting growing frustration and anger in the UN force, its commander called on Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic to dispense 'immediate and salutary justice' to those responsible for the killing of the French officers. The UN also confirmed that an Italian relief plane that crashed near Sarajevo last week was shot down. The aircraft, whose crew of four died, was flying over an area controlled by Croats, but the UN did not say who was to blame. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, Britain's defence secretary, said UK troops about to go to Bosnia-Hercegovina should be allowed to return fire. He condemned as 'repulsive' Tuesday's machine gun and mortar attack on the UN relief convoy near Sarajevo airport. Although two French peacekeepers were killed and three wounded, the UN troops did not fire back at the forces ambushing it. Mr Rifkind said, however, it was a 'crucial requirement' for any soldier to be able to defend himself. Mr Rifkind's remarks reflect growing calls from the countries contributing to the 16,000-strong Yugoslav peacekeeping force for their lightly armed troops to use force if attacked. The French government earlier yesterday implicitly accused Bosnian Moslem forces of being responsible for the death of the soldiers. Until now, the UN and members of the peacekeeping force have been reluctant to single out Serbs, Moslems or Croats for blame in Bosnia. Condemning the attack, Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, said it underlined the urgent need to find an answer to the UN peacekeepers' security problems. Philip Stephens adds: The UK cabinet is today expected to give the formal go-ahead for despatch of up to 1,800 British troops to Bosnia. Whitehall officials said the troops, on stand-by in Germany, could be sent as early as next week. Commons defence group recalled, Page 8</p>

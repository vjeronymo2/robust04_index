"We are not in a situation to do so," the top government  spokesman said at a news conference.    Touching on the stalled talks between North Korea and the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) over Pyongyang's  suspected nuclear arms development program, Takemura said Tokyo  will continue its diplomatic efforts to help the negotiations go  smoothly.    Takemura's remarks came in response to a report in the major  daily YOMIURI SHIMBUN that Japan, the United States and South  Korea have agreed that United Nations economic sanctions will be  inevitable if Pyongyang continues to block international  inspections of its nuclear facilities.    The YOMIURI reported that the three countries reached the  accord in early February at a trilateral working-level meeting  in New York.    It also said Tokyo will start preparing for sanctions, such  as limiting trade with Pyongyang and halting currency  remittances there by North Korean residents of Japan.    Talks between North Korea and the IAEA, the Vienna-based  international nuclear watchdog, have been stalemated over  Pyongyang's rejection of the ieae special inspections.    The IAEA is expected to refer the matter to the U.N.  Security  Council later this month.    Japan's exports to North Korea amounted to some 28.2 billion  yen in 1992 and imports from that country totaled 32.6 billion  yen, according to Japanese Government figures.</p>

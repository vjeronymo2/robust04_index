			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Letter: An argument for the environmental balance favouring diesel Sir, I refer to David Parker's letter ('Diesel not least polluting', January 28) and to John Griffiths's article ('Technology: diesel cleans up its act', January 21). Sadly, the use of hydrocarbons fuels results in unwanted exhaust and evaporative VOC (hydrocarbon Volatile Organic Compound) emissions. Some emissions are more harmful than others, particularly benzene, a human carcinogen, present in some HC emissions. Actions to reduce one type of emission sometimes result in increasing others. The design of a 'clean' engine is therefore a process of optimisation. Engine environmental performance depends on the way we define 'the environment'. The current definition consisting of HC, CO, NOx and PM (particulate matter) is being enlarged to include CO and evaporative VOCs. So the optimisation point is shifting. With the notable exception of PM, the environmental performance of unregulated diesels is far better than that of unregulated petrol engines. Current 3-way catalysts, which do not work with diesel engines, reduce petrol engine NOx emissions significantly below those of diesels, but their HC, CO, CO and evaporative VOC emissions still remain considerably higher than those of diesel engines. Diesel engine performance will be further improved with the use of oxidation catalysts and improved fuel injection systems. As far as CO emissions are concerned the effect of the slightly higher carbon content of diesel fuel, less than 2 per cent, is more than offset by the diesel's better fuel economy, conservatively 10-15 per cent or more. In the absence of a totally clean engine, the environmental balance favours the diesel.

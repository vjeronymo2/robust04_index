			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Devenish deal Drinks group Boddington finally exited from JA Devenish yesterday as it off-loaded the near 20 per cent holding it had been sitting on since its failed attempt to land its rival two years ago. Boddington's stake had been overhanging Devenish since and prompted continued speculation that the northern brewer would return to the fray - a threat dispelled last month by the bid for Devenish by Greenalls. The Boddington disposal now clears the way for the smooth takeover by Greenalls, whose Pounds 214m bid has since been recommended by the Devenish board. Boddington was said to have sold its holding at an average of 360p a share - a healthy premium to the average 211p a share it paid in July 1991 when it was building up its predatory stake. The sale price was also at a premium to the 356.5p cash alternative offered by Greenalls, whose all-paper offer valued Devenish at 390p a share. The main reason for the high bid price had been to prevent Boddington from rebidding. Boddington shares steadied at 277p, Greenalls slipped 2 to 354p and Devenish lost a penny to 363p.</p>

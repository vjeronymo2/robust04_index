He said such tactics might be appropriate elsewhere in  war-torn Bosnia. But he insisted that following the success of  the NATO air-strike threat, the immediate priority was to get  the aid convoys moving again.    Mr Rifkind said the outcome could be regarded as a tentative  success. "It is clear that the vast majority of weapons have  been handed over to the United Nations and the rest appear to  have been moved from the 20 kilometre range." Nine sites still  had to be visited "but there is every reason to believe that  they have been vacated, too", he added.    Asked on BBC Breakfast News if he was suspicious of the  Bosnian Serbs' intentions, Mr Rifkind warned that the threat of  air strikes remained available if there was any attempt to use  artillery against Sarajevo. "This is not a threat that has  disappeared," he said. "This is a very tremendous step forward,  but only a step forward. We are now preventing the use of  artillery shells against Sarajevo. It is only one more small  step towards ending the war in Bosnia."    Asked why the air strike threat could not have been  introduced months ago, Mr Rifkind said: "You can only achieve  things when circumstances permit it." The Serbs had realised  that they could never take Sarajevo and therefore a withdrawal  was not such a humiliation.    The United Nations and NATO had to avoid taking sides in  someone else's civil war, but still had to exercise maximum  influence, diplomatic and humanitarian, to reduce the horrors of  the war.    Mr Rifkind said it might be appropriate to adopt the formula  elsewhere. "But the immediate priority is to get aid moving  again. The possibility of air strikes meant that UN convoys had  to take shelter.    "In the middle of winter people will starve if the aid does  not get through," Mr Rifkind added.</p>

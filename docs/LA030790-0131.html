			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWEST CHEAP 'SEATS' BELONG TO THE NYSE  </P> <P> In the mid-1970s, owning a yellow cab in the world's financial capital cost  more than a seat on the New York Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> Things aren't that grim today, but with the stock market falling and the  securities industry in a recession, the price of membership on the nation's  oldest and largest exchange has sunk to its lowest level in almost five years.  </P> <P> A "seat" -- which entitles members to trade directly on the stock exchange  floor -- sold for $365,000 Thursday, down from the all-time high of $1.15  million in September, 1987, a month before the stock market crashed. It was the  lowest price since May, 1985.  </P> <P> "In the last year or so there has been a significant retrenching in the  industry, and that's what we're seeing here," said James J. Maguire, chairman  of Henderson Brothers Inc., an NYSE member firm.  </P> <P> On the floor of the Big Board -- so named because stock symbols were listed on  one before the electronic age -- the bid for a seat price Friday was $355,000,  with an asking price of $400,000.  </P> <P> The price of an NYSE membership has fallen steadily since the 1987 market crash  after a steady rise that took seats from a low of $35,000 in 1977 to $105,000  in 1978, $425,000 in 1983 and $600,000 in 1986.  </P> <P> At the 1977 nadir, it cost $55,000 for a New York City Taxi and Limousine  Commission medallion, compared with $135,000 today.  </P> <P> Seats are held by brokerage firms, specialists and individual brokers who trade  for themselves but seats are registered in one person's name. Non-members must  pay members to execute trades.  </P></p>

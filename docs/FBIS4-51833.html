			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 4 KYODO -- Rice transactions by  agricultural cooperatives across the nation in the rice year  ended last June dropped to a 13-year low due to the worst  harvest in the postwar period, the National Federation of  Agricultural Cooperative Associations (Zenno) reported Wednesday  [4 May].    The federation said the value of its rice trading stood at  1.69 trillion yen, down 441.5 billion yen from the preceding  year. It was the first time in 13 years that rice trading fell  below 2 trillion yen, it said.    Zenno handles 95 percent of the nation's rice harvest  annually. The federation earlier estimated the value of its rice  trading in the 1993 rice year at 2,284.6 billion yen, up 153.1  billion yen over the year before. The previous low of 1.9  trillion yen was recorded in the 1980 rice year. The federation  forecast rice trading will recover the 2 trillion yen level in  the current year and total 2,220.6 billion yen.</p>

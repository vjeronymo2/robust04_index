			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FROZEN ASSET;  </P> <P> REDKEN SUBSIDIARY OFFERS HAIR PRODUCTS WITH GLACIER WATER  </P> <P> There seems to be something about the grandeur of glaciers that makes  entrepreneurs think big.  </P> <P> In the late 1970s, a Saudi Arabian prince proposed hauling glaciers and  icebergs to drought-ravaged countries in the Middle East. Nothing happened with  that idea. More recently a couple of companies have begun bottling and selling  melted glacier water, touting the freshness and purity of the water to the  Perrier generation. Another firm ships plastic bags of glacier ice cubes to  Japan and makes vodka using glacier water.  </P> <P> And now Redken Laboratories, the big Canoga Park hair care products company, is  bankrolling a fledgling company called Alaska Glacier Products that sells a  line of shampoos and hair conditioners containing none other than Alaskan  glacier water.  </P> <P> Alaska Glacier vice president Neil Wallach said, "Glacial water is the freshest  water on the planet," and so is ideal for shampoos and the like since it  doesn't junk up the hair with chemicals and minerals found in other water.  </P> <P> Skeptics could say the only thing fresh about glacier water in shampoos is the  gimmick. But then John Sebastian, president of the Woodland Hills-based hair  care company Sebastian International, says gimmicks are what make or break hair  care companies. "Everyone is going to have what is called in the industry a  'hook' or a 'handle' -- something that's going to make their products much more  appealing than other products."  </P> <P> In the fiercely competitive $4.5-billion a year hair care products industry,  shampoo peddlers use anything they can to to distinguish themselves, as  companies vie for customers who are as loyal to shampoos as they are to this  year's fashions.  </P> <P> Alaska Glacier's new line of products, called Glacial Fresh, has been available  in beauty supply shops since June and Wallach expects the company to break even  or turn a small profit in the fiscal year that ends July 31, on sales of about  $1.5 million.  </P> <P> But is being different enough to make it in the hair care business?  </P> <P> At Art Spector Beauty and Barber Supply in Sepulveda, there are dozens of  exotic products available. "Everyone has a gimmick," said co-owner Marilyn  Spector, who isn't carrying the Glacial Fresh line. "One has papaya from New  Zealand. One has molecular or nucleic protein. There's lots of new ones that  come out and very few of them make it."  </P> <P> Wendy Abramovitz, manager of Sunshine Beauty Supply in Canoga Park, is carrying  Glacial Fresh, but says the new line hasn't sold well yet. She keeps a close  eye on this sort of thing and if a product doesn't sell, she puts something  else on the shelf. "I rotate, rotate, rotate," she said. Some shampoos she  sells contain concoctions such as "golden seal root," "a botanically fortified  polymeric acid balanced pH3 keratin enhancer" and a "Belgian formula."  </P> <P> Sunshine was among the first of the 800 beauty supply stores that handle  Glacial Fresh, but Abramovitz believes a new series of advertisements in People  magazine will help boost sales. "Advertising is the key," she said.  </P> <P> Alaska Glacier's ad budget isn't setting Madison Avenue on fire. So far it has  spent about $50,000 on trade ads and $100,000 on consumer ads, Wallach said.  That's not much compared to the multimillion-dollar ad budgets of the large  hair care companies.  </P> <P> But then Alaska Glacier is something of a marketing departure for Redken  Laboratories, which has more than $120 million in annual sales, and is the  largest manufacturer and distributor of hair care products sold in beauty  salons.  </P> <P> Thus far, Redken has zealously cultivated its status as a supplier of upscale  products sold only in hair salons. But Alaska Glacier will be sold only through  beauty supply stores -- another fast-growing segment of the hair care market  that sells to the public and to professional hair stylists.  </P> <P> Marilyn Geller, a consultant specializing in cosmetics and toiletries at the  market research firm Kline &amp; Co. in Fairfield, N.J., says this could be a  risky move for Redken. "If they're not careful about merchandising the two  lines separately, they run the danger of denigrating their history with the  salon." Redken's name, though, doesn't appear on the boxes of Glacier Fresh,  and Alaska Glacier stresses that Redken's other products are still marketed  solely to salons.  </P> <P> There are now about 7,000 beauty supply shops in the United States and they  sell anything from the cheap drugstore brands to the pricey salon products. At  $4.99 for each nine-ounce bottle, the Glacial Fresh line is far from the most  expensive of hair care products on the market, but it's not bargain-basement  either.  </P> <P> "In the overall scheme of things, it's a relatively expensive product line,"  Wallach said. But he hopes to cash in on the increasing focus on the  environment, and maintained that the products will have strong appeal to  consumers who eschew man-made chemicals.  </P> <P> Redken, which was taken private last year in a leveraged buyout by founder  Paula Kent Meehan and her husband John E. Meehan, won't divulge the size of its  investment in Alaska Glacier. But the new company's offices are located at  Redken's Canoga Park headquarters and its products are formulated and  manufactured by Redken. And there's more than just glacier water; the shampoo  also contains juniper, heather, mistletoe and flaxseed to underscore the  natural theme.  </P> <P> Alaska Glacier is the brainchild of Rick Thornton, an Anchorage hair care  products distributor and glacier buff. About two years ago, Thornton, who  describes himself as "a country boy from Alaska," heard about Wetco, an  Anchorage company that was selling two-pound bags of glacier ice cubes in Japan  for $7. "That struck a chord in me," he said.  </P> <P> Alaska's glaciers are scattered over thousands of miles of pristine wilderness,  and Thornton thought that if he could combine his hair care business with the  appeal of the glaciers he'd have a unique product. "I wanted to have a story  that no one else has," he said.  </P> <P> After some research, Thornton, who is Alaska Glacier's president, approached  Redken with the idea. Wallach, a 28-year industry veteran of such firms as  Clairol and Windmere, joined Alaska Glacier in August. The company's only other  full-time employee is business manager Jeanette Corum, who used to work for  Redken.  </P> <P> Alaska Glacier's water is harvested by Wetco, which sends workers out on boats  to lasso huge hunks of ice that have broken off from the Eklutna Glacier, 30  miles north of Anchorage. The ice is melted and put in tanks, which are loaded  onto a barge and shipped to Seattle, where the tanks are transferred to trucks  for the long ride to Canoga Park.  </P> <P> If nothing else, Alaska Glacier is different. "This is the first time I've ever  heard of a company with Alaska glacier water," said Geller.  </P> <P> Although Wallach talks of his company's sales growing to $5 million or more  within five years, he still has a long way to travel till he gets to that  plateau. Still, he's convinced that glacier water will become a magic marketing  ingredient.  </P> <P> "There's absolutely no doubt in my mind you'll see another product come out  with glacier water," he said. "If you look at the leaders in the market today,  they've all been copycatted. I think there's a certain wonderful posturing in  being first."  </P></p>

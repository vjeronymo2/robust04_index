[Scharping] This vote [in Lower Saxony] has given us a  chance. Now the SPD [Social Democratic Party] will have the  opportunity to build a distinctive and solid leadership for  Germany. It is a wonderful way to begin the electoral year, an  excellent result. But we should not rest on our laurels.    [Tarquini] [CDU (Christian Democratic Union) leader] Kohl  might still win, then....    [Scharping] This will be, in any case, the chancellor's last  electoral campaign, but this does not mean we can take victory  for granted. We still have a long way to go and must continue  to work hard; in the next seven months, maintaining the party's  unity will be a priority task. I repeat, we now have a fair  chance of becoming the most powerful party in the Bundestag,  after the general elections on 16 October. It is up to us not  to miss this chance.    [Tarquini] Last Sunday's [13 March] success is not enough,  then, to bring about a decisive turn?    [Scharping] The significance of the vote goes beyond the  possible fate of my own party. [Lower Saxony SPD leader]  Schroeder's victory, which is first and foremost his own  victory, shows that a new opportunity is opening up for Germany;  namely, that of combating people's weariness vis-a-vis politics.  If we focus on real problems, on people's needs, then protest  groups, and above all right-wing extremists, can be stopped.  This has also been one of the positive results of the tough,  albeit honest, contest between us and the CDU.    [Tarquini] A signal to your opponents?    [Scharping] No, but I welcome the fact that, even within the  CDU, this aspect of their defeat is regarded as a positive  development in the long run. A figure of 3.7 percent is still  too high a percentage of the vote for the Republikaner, but for  the first time their march on a regional parliament has been  stopped. Against the background of a high turnout, the two major  parties together have won 80 percent of the vote. The Liberals,  on the other hand, have fallen victim to their superficial brand  of liberalism. This is an encouraging result which is worth  reflecting on.    [Tarquini] If you win in October, how will you govern the  country?    [Scharping] We will prioritize the fight against  unemployment, and developing a strategy for economic growth.    [Tarquini] Everybody says this. What concrete solutions do  you have in mind?    [Scharping] Reorganizing work in a more intelligent way,  with  shorter and more flexible working hours, for example. We will  also help carry out the structural reform of our industry,  particularly those businesses that are more in need of staying  competitive, and the sectors that are going through difficult  transitional stages. I am not promising to reduce unemployment  by half, but reducing it is an imperative task, among other  reasons, because unemployment benefits are weighing down heavily  on all taxpayers.    [Tarquini] If you become chancellor, will Germany avoid the  risk of further taxation?    [Scharping] We must ease the fiscal burden on investment. In  this respect we agree with the employers' leaders. This,  however, has nothing to do with taxing higher-income brackets  more heavily, which is rendered necessary by fiscal justice.  Those who can afford to pay 2,000 marks a month in taxes can  also afford to pay 2,200. Economic recovery is everyone's duty.    [Tarquini] What would a left-wing Germany mean for Europe?    [Scharping] A more committed European policy, more  cooperation in the fight against mass unemployment, and a  greater common commitment to economic growth and the  strengthening of the European institutions. The foundations of  foreign policy will not change. There will remain the commitment  to the integration of East Europe, which is a strategic  priority, as well as friendship with the United States. It is  well-known that today Kohl is more isolated than it may seem at  first glance as far as his Europeanism is concerned. Too many  within his camp are sounding the nationalist chord without  realizing just how much they are damaging German, and European,  interests.</p>

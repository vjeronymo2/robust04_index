			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Longer life 'need not increase human suffering' MEDICAL science will be able to extend the average human lifespan by several years and may be able to lengthen the maximum lifetime of the species - which is now about 115 years - the meeting was told. Professor Grimley Evans, head of the geriatric medicine division at Oxford University, attacked politicians 'who assume that any means of extending lifespan must be expensive' because very old people need more health care. He said that there were 'no grounds for assuming that prolonging healthy life will ultimately increase human suffering and its costs.' For example, if someone has a stroke in their 80s, then the period of suffering afterwards is much less than that following a stroke suffered in the 60s. Extending average lifespan is a matter of improving medical care, continuing economic development and persuading people to following sensible lifestyles  -above all, by not smoking. 'We know how to lengthen average lifespan but can we lengthen maximum lifespan?' Prof Evans asked. He suggested three possible approaches: The eugenic approach would be to breed selectively from deep-frozen sperm of men who ultimately achieve great age. It may be possible to identify specific human genes that are associated with longevity, and modify them in some way. Such genes have been found in nematode worms but not yet in higher animals. A third approach would be to reduce the damage that is done to cells by bio-chemical processes in the body, such as free radical oxidation. 'The crucial issue,' Prof Evans said, 'will be what manipulations to increase longevity do to the pattern of disease and disability preceding death. An intervention that postponed death without postponing Alzheimer's disease might not be a good investment for individuals or for society.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "phe": "Economies in Space Research Planned"] </F>   [Text] Duesseldorf -- If it forms the government after the  Bundestag elections, the SPD [Social Democratic Party of  Germany] will want to focus state research policy on aiding more  environmentally conscious, less hazardous, and cheaper forms of  energy, the development of a modern transportation system, and a  "first-rate telecommunications structure." The "research  department" should make economies in defense technology, space  projects, and nuclear research.    That is what emerges from the draft "1994 Government  Program"  in the fields of education, research, and culture, for which  Peter Glotz, the education and research policy spokesman of the  SPD, is responsible as the member of the SPD commission for  these fields.    According to the document, the SPD wants to make education,  research, and culture policy a "big issue" in the election  campaign debate. In order to make education and research policy  more effective, the SPD -- like the CDU -- is proposing the  establishment of an "innovation and technology council." The  appointment of a "education council as a forum for exchanging  ideas" is also being considered.    The document calls for a "generation contract for education  and youth" in order to "realize the right to the best possible  education for the new generation." However, how that is to be  understood remains unclear. The SPD flatly rejects a reduction  in training subsidies. Ultimately, the SPD wants to make the  transition from vocational training to a college education  easier, the Law on Training Subsidies an effective instrument  for an active labor market policy, and overcome resistance to  "the good idea of training during vacations."    The SPD is a firm advocate of "effective reforms" of the  college sector, such as increasing the room for maneuver of  individual colleges by, for example, introducing overall  budgets. The program states literally that "private colleges  could complement our college system in a positive way."    The document states that "we must differentiate between what  is first-rate, average, and bad in our society and in education  and science all the more so." Glotz says: "Even the most  stringent economies cannot lead to the neglect of what is first  rate." The details of the draft state:     -  The SPD believes  that more consideration must be given to education in the  distribution of public funds than has been the case hitherto.  There should be a "reasonable" increase in expenditure on  education and science as a share of the gross national  expenditure.    -  The SPD is in favor of companies and administrative  agencies developing professional career structures that also  afford opportunities for specialists without a college education  to advance their careers.    -  Priority should be given to the  expansion of technical colleges. There should be better career  opportunities in public service for graduates.    -  In the opinion of  the SPD, there should be an "above average" increase in funds  for research as of 1995.    -  The SPD documents state explicitly that  technological progress in information technology, the  development of new materials, genetic engineering, and the whole  range of chemical, biological, and physics-based technologies is  the basis for prosperity and economic competitiveness. Research  policy should not be "too narrow"; it should identify new  technologies that have a "marked structural effect" early in  conjunction with the scientific and business communities and  accord special priority to such projects. The SPD describes the  "marketplace" as providing an "important impetus" for  technological progress.</p>

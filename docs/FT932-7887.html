			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour backs SIB on bank regulation RESPONSIBILITY FOR bank regulation should be taken away from the Bank of England and could eventually be given to the Securities and Investments Board, Labour said yesterday. Mr Alistair Darling, the party's spokesman on City affairs, said the SIB should have overall responsibility for financial services regulation and should be given powers of enforcement. 'In time it might be appropriate to fuse the banking supervisory body with the SIB,' he said. But he maintained he was not advocating the 'importation' of a US-style Securities and Exchange Commission. 'We need a solution designed for the UK.' Mr Darling used an Edinburgh speech to the Scottish region of the London Stock Exchange to outline Labour's stance on a range of financial service issues and to call for an overhaul of the 1986 Financial Services Act. He said Labour would support the establishment of the proposed Personal Investment Authority provided it met certain basic standards - 'not least a majority on a supervisory body should come from outside the industry'. He called for the new law on insider dealing to be tightly defined and for offenders to be prosecuted with 'as much speed as the due process of law will allow.' If the new law was satisfactory, Labour would favour dealing with misdemeanours which fell short of criminal conduct through the regulatory system. But he said current government proposals lacked 'clarity and precision.' The committee of MPs scrutinising the proposed new insider dealing legislation will begin their deliberations shortly.</p>

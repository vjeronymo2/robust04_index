The report, which was presented and prepared by the  Permanent  Finance Commission, was submitted to the lawmakers in the lower  chamber for analysis. It received the support of all parties  forming the commission, but in the chamber vote the Radical  Cause Party legislative wing voted against it.    In their speeches, representatives of the different  legislative factions explained that it was meaningless to  approve the Emergency Banking Law without approving the Public  Credit Draft Bill, which will permit Fogade [Deposit Guarantee  Fund] to disburse the necessary resources to aid all financial  institutions in need of assistance. This assistance will be  given by issuing public debt bonds totalling 400 billion  bolivares.    Deputy Jose Miguel Uzcategui said the Permanent Finance  Commission discussed various financing options for the law, such  as tax reforms, issuing currency, and adopting budget measures.  He added that the most expeditious, convenient, and orthodox  way of generating resources is by going into debt, a debt that  will not have an impact on the market and will not produce  inflationary effects unless Fogade's authorized capital is  increased. Uzcategui said that the issue will be discussed  today by the commission, who will review the observations made  at the Chamber. He added that during the afternoon session the  bill will be approved in the second debate.    Gustavo Tarre Briceno, chairman of the Permanent Finance  Commission, said that the Executive Branch is issuing public  debt bonds and placing the money at Fogade. Tarre Briceno said  it is not a matter of spending 400 billion bolivares but of  seeking the mechanisms to create greater confidence among savers  and depositors throughout the country, offering 400 billion  bolivares to support their savings as well as generating  confidence again in the Venezuelan financial system.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities in Chile monitored through 17  March.    According to the Central Bank's preliminary reports, the  Chilean trade balance registered a $33.1 million deficit in  January, with exports at $765 million and imports at $798.1  million. This means the negative balance has been maintained for  the ninth consecutive month. The country's purchase rate dropped  4.5 percent and the sales rate increased 14 percent compared  with the same month last year, a fact that Finance Minister  Foxley regards as "good news." (Santiago LA TERCERA DE LA HORA  in Spanish 24 Feb 94 Economic Section p 3)    Evaluating the economic performance in 1989-1993, Finance  Minister Alejandro Foxley reported on 23 February that the  economy grew 6 percent in 1993. He noted the GDP rose from $28.1  billion in 1989 to $43.8 billion in 1993. Investment rose from  $6.5 billion to $11.3 billion. He said government investments  also increased from $760 million to $1.425 billion. He explained  that the government's savings rose from $850 million in 1989 to  $2.2 billion in 1993. This generated a fiscal surplus that  increased from $506 million in 1989 to $890 million last year.  Foxley said these results led the Chilean economy to grow four  times faster than in developed countries and three times more  quickly when compared with Latin American countries.

(Santiago EL  MERCURIO in Spanish 28 Feb 94 pp B1, B2)    The National Statistics Institute, INE, reported that the  unemployment rate was 4.8 percent from November 1993 to January  1994, an increase of 0.3 percent compared with the previous  quarter, and a 0.4 percent increase compared with the November  1992-January 1993 period. The labor force totalled 5,254,200  people, an increase of 4.4 percent compared with the same  quarter last year. The number of employees was 5,580,000, an  increase of 3.9 percent compared with the same quarter in 1993.  This means that 187,290 new jobs were created. (Santiago EL  MERCURIO in Spanish 3 Mar 94 p B10)    The INE reported on 2 March that the February consumer price  index was 0.3 percent, and that the cumulative inflation rate  for the first two months of the year was 1.3 percent, and 13.1  percent for the past 12 months. Housing increased 1.7 percent  and transportation and communications 0.5 percent; food dropped  1.2 percent and clothing 1.7 percent. (Santiago EL MERCURIO in  Spanish 3 Mar 94 pp B1, B10)</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Keidanren [the Federation of Economic  Organizations of Japan] plans to seek cooperation from economic  organizations in the United States and European nations in  issuing a joint statement calling on industrialized nations to  implement their respective trade policies in line with accords  that were concluded among negotiating nations at the end of the  multilateral trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round of GATT).  There have been reports that protectionism has been emerging in  the United States where the U.S. Government and some members of  Congress have been exploring ways to revive the Super 301  provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act. In reaction, the  Keidanren has concluded that as a Japanese economic  organization, it needs to work to block those U.S. moves toward  protectionism and to call for the promotion of free trade. The  Keidanren intends to set up a task force comprised of officials  from major industries and enter specific consultations with  economic organizations in the United States and European nations.    A plan under study by the Keidanren is that the Keidanren,  the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) in the United  States, and the Union des Industries de la Communaute Europeenne  (UNICE) [Industrial Union of the European Community] will issue  a joint statement this spring at the earliest. With the Uruguay  Round accords set to go into effect in mid-1995, there is a fear  that European nations and the United Stats would take measures  to slap sanctions against their trade partners based on  bilateralism in the intervening time. The Keidanren, therefore,  intends to call on the U.S. and European governments to rule out  protectionism and adhere to the spirit of the accords.</p>

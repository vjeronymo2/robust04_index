			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by 'Atif 'Umar: "Egypt Is an Important Center </F> in the Arab-Israeli Peace Process"]    [Excerpts] In their summit meeting in Cairo over the past  two days, Presidents Husni Mubarak and Hafiz al-Asad discussed  several important issues, including the Middle East, Arab  coordination, and efforts to contain differences and clear the  air in the Arab capitals. The meeting highlighted that Cairo  will remain a center, a forum, for all Arab leaders to discuss  their issues and coordinate and plan for the region's peoples  and their ambitions to solve their problems fairly and honorably.    The summit followed a new development in the Arab region due  to the latest Hebron massacre and its new threats to the peace  process, which was about to make some progress on the road to  Arab-Israeli reconciliation. The massacre came to undermine the  peace process and had it not been for the self-restraint  demonstrated by the Arab region, most notably the PLO, the whole  region would have seen a retreat on the course of peace through  negotiations. [passage omitted]    The summit talks in Cairo showed that Syria is eager for a  comprehensive peace in the region based on Security Council  resolutions and international legitimacy, which rejects  aggression and does not allow the occupation of others'  territory by force. In a statement after seeing off Syrian  President Hafiz al-Asad, President Mubarak said he hoped Syria  and Israel would reach an agreement. The statement emphasized  the Syrian leadership's earnest desire to end the Arab-Israeli  conflict and create stability and peace for the region on fair  bases.    As President Mubarak explained in his answer to a question  from an Israeli correspondent, peace requires sacrifices by both  sides, particularly the party that occupies the land. This  party has major capabilities that give it the chance to make  peace with the other parties and to achieve historic  reconciliation that would reflect positively on all the region's  peoples. The sides are fed up with conflicts and their dangers  for both sides. History proves that things cannot remain as  they are and that no one entity can remain stronger than the  others forever, whatever his capabilities.    President Mubarak's continuing call on the need for the  parties to be flexible about peace demonstrates that the  Egyptian leadership is eager to maintain the momentum of the  peace process and spare the Middle East the scourge of bloody  conflicts. No one can deny the threat of these conflicts to all  the peoples of the region.</p>

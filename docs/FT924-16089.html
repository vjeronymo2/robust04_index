			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / ITN shares 'could be worth nothing' THE VALUE of Independent Television News shares could be nil, the chief executive of the ITV Association said yesterday. Mr Andrew Quinn's comment comes as the news organisation faces a growing financial crisis because of a failure to let accommodation at its new central London headquarters. The deficit on the property lease on the ITN build-ing in Gray's Inn Road is expected to reach Pounds 25m over the next five years. Under the 1990 Broadcasting Act, ITN has to dispose of a majority of its shares to companies that are not ITV broadcasters by the end of 1994. 'I would venture to suggest that those shares are not disposable,' Mr Quinn said, speaking after a briefing on ITV's future strategy. He did not know anywhere in the world where news supply was a profit-making business, as ITN is supposed to become. 'The legislation is just misconceived,' Mr Quinn said. The government was warned of the difficulties of turning ITN into a profit centre but it went ahead with the stipulation that a majority of the shares had to be sold. It is not clear who will now pay for the deficit on ITN's headquarters. On Tuesday, ITN announced 112 redundancies as part of 'a reorganisation of the company structure to equip it to become an independent, profit-making business'.</p>

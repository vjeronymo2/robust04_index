			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> TEXAS;  </P> <P> DEADLINES SET FOR RUBY GUN CLAIMS  </P> <P> A Dallas probate judge gave the Internal Revenue Service until Jan. 15 to prove  its claim to proceeds from the sale of the gun Jack Ruby used to kill Lee  Harvey Oswald after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Ruby's brother,  Earl, has until Dec. 22 to prove his and other heirs' contention that they have  a better claim to profits from the estate, the judge said. Jack Ruby owed the  IRS $17,000 in taxes when he died in 1967, and the IRS says penalties and  interest have pushed the amount to $86,010. Earl Ruby long has contested  executor Jules Mayer's right to the gun, which Mayer says might bring $250,000.  </P></p>

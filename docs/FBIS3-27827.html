			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lao </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A high-level parliamentary delegation from the  Kingdom of Thailand led by Professor Marut Bunnak, president of  the House of Representatives and of the Parliament of the  Kingdom of Thailand, arrived in Vientiane this morning on an  official friendship visit to Laos. The visit is being made at  the invitation of Saman Vi-gnaket, chairman of the Lao People's  Democratic Republic [LPDR] National Assembly. The delegation  consists of 10 members of parliament from six different  political parties, representatives of the Thai mass media, and  other personnel.    An official ceremony to welcome the high-level Thai  parliamentary delegation was held at the National Assembly Hall.  On hand to welcome Prof. Marut Bunnak, his wife, and the  visiting Thai delegation were National Assembly Chairman Saman  Vi-gnaket and his wife; Chaleun Yiapaoheu, member of the  National Assembly from Oudomsai Province and chief of the  National Assembly Secretariat Commission; Dr. Khamliang  Phonsena, member of the National Assembly from Champassak  Province and chief of the National Assembly Commission for  Foreign Relations; and other prominent figures.    The Thai parliamentary delegation's visit to the LPDR is the  first of its kind in the 18 years since the establishment of the  LPDR. The visit, therefore, is an auspicious sign for the  further development and strengthening of the longstanding  relations between the two countries of Laos and Thailand,  especially between their legislative branches. The Thai  delegation's visit to the LPDR will last three days. While they  are in Laos, the parliamentary delegations from the two  countries will meet to discuss issues of mutual concern. After  that, the Thai delegation will pay courtesy calls on Lao party  and state leaders and visit three economic and cultural  establishments in Vientiane.</p>

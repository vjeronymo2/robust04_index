			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GLENDALE PREPARES FOR FIRST WOMEN FIREFIGHTERS;  </P> <P> EMPLOYMENT: TESTING WAS EXPANDED TO FIND MORE MINORITIES AND FEMALES.  </P> <P> The Glendale City Council on Tuesday approved spending $15,000 to remodel six  of the city's fire stations to accommodate its first women firefighters.  </P> <P> The Fire Department will get its first two women firefighters early next year,  part of a class now in training that includes the largest group of minorities  ever to join the department.  </P> <P> Out of the 21 recruits, 13 are members of minority groups or women, Chief John  M. Montenero said.  </P> <P> As part of its effort to hire more minorities, the department tested everyone  who applied, instead of the first 300 as was done in the past. Chosen from  among 2,500 people tested, the recruits include eight white men, one white  woman, four black men, two Asian men, five Latino men and one Latino woman.  </P> <P> Previously, the department has consisted mostly of white males with some Latino  males, said Sandra Houlemard, a personnel analyst, who was hired by Glendale in  April to work on affirmative action.  </P> <P> The recruits started their training a week ago and will join Glendale's 163  firefighters on Feb. 15, 1990.  </P> <P> The money approved by the council will provide separate sleeping quarters and  bathrooms for female firefighters at six stations, Montenero said. The  department's other three stations already have separate facilities for women.  </P> <P> The 21 recruits had to pass written, oral and physical agility tests, as well  as a physical examination and a check on their personal background, a spokesman  from the department said.  </P> <P> The Fire Department's training center is located at the Chevy Chase Public  Works Yard at 541 W. Chevy Chase.  </P></p>

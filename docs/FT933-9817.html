			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Letter: Government must grasp opportunity for trade mark legislation Sir, I note that the government has indicated that it intends to find time to implement the new trade mark legislation. It has done so before. Let us hope that it does not let the opportunity slip this time. the proposals have wide support and are not contentious; they would be likely to help both British industry and foreign investment; the government had an obligation to implement the EC trade mark directive at the beginning of this year. In the spirit of prompt ratification of the Maastricht treaty it should not delay further. Alasdair Poore, Solicitor, chartered patent agent, 48 Ellerby Street, London SW6</p>

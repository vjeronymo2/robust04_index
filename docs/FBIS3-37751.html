The contracting parties will not impose customs duties  and taxes and charges that apply equally to the import and  export of goods that proceed from the customs territory of one  of the contracting parties and that are earmarked for delivery  onto the customs territory of the other contracting party. The  specific features pertaining to the application of trading  conditions between both countries on an agreed range of goods  will be drawn up in annual protocols that form an integral part  of this agreement.    2. For the purposes of this agreement and for the period of  its validity, goods proceeding from the territory of the  contracting parties are understood as follows:    a) Goods that have been produced in their entirety on the  territories of the contracting parties;    b) Goods that have been produced on the territories of the  contracting parties, using raw and other materials and assembly  components originating from third countries, with a change, in  this case, in their classification, in accordance with the  Classification of Goods of Foreign Economic Activity (CG FEA)  based on the EC Coordinated System of Describing and Coding  Goods and the Combined Tariff and Statistical Register; the  first four characters must be used in the listing;    c) Goods that have been produced with the use of raw  materials, materials, and assembly components mentioned in Point  b on condition that their aggregate value does not exceed the  fixed share of the export price of the saleable goods.    Detailed rules on the origins of goods will be drawn up by  the contracting parties in a separate document that will form an  integral part of this agreement.    Article 2    The contracting parties will not:    Impose direct or indirect internal taxes or charges on goods  covered by this agreement that exceed the corresponding taxes or  charges that are imposed on similar home-produced goods or goods  originating from third countries;    Introduce, in respect of the import and/or export of goods  covered by this agreement, any special restrictions and demands  that, in a similar situation, are not being applied to similar  home-produced goods or goods originating from third countries;    Apply rules, in respect of the warehousing, transshipment,  storage, and carriage of goods originating from the other  contracting party and also payments and the transfer of  payments, other than those that are being applied in similar  instances regarding one's own goods or goods originating from  third countries.    Article 3    1. The contracting parties will refrain from imposing  quantitative restrictions or equivalent measures on the export  and/or import of goods within the framework of this agreement.    2. The quantitative restrictions mentioned in Point 1 of  this article may be established by one side within reasonable  limits and for a strictly defined period of time only:    When there is an acute shortage of the given goods on the  internal market -- until the situation on the market is  stabilized;    When there is an acute deficit in the balance of payments --  until the situation with the balance of payments is stabilized;    If any types of goods are imported onto the territory of one  of the contracting parties in such increased quantities or under  such conditions that harm or threaten to harm home producers of  similar or directly competing goods;    In order to implement the measures stipulated in Article 4  of  this agreement.    3. The quantitative restrictions mentioned in Point 1 of  this article may also be established on the mutual agreement of  the sides and be included in the annual protocols mentioned in  Article 1 of this agreement.    4. The contracting side applying the quantitative  restrictions in accordance with Point 2 of this article, at the  request of the other contracting side, will supply the necessary  information on the reasons for introducing the restrictions  mentioned, their forms, and possible periods of duration.    5. The contracting sides will aim to resolve by means of  consultations all questions arising in connection with the  application of the quantitative restrictions mentioned in Point  2 of this article.    Article 4    Each of the contracting parties will not permit the reexport  of goods on whose export the other contracting party from whose  territory these goods originate is applying measures of tariff  and/or non-tariff regulation.    The parties will exchange lists of goods on which measures  of  tariff and/or non-tariff regulation are being applied.    Such goods can be reexported to third countries only on  written consent and under conditions defined by the authorized  state body that is the country of origin of these goods. In the  event that this clause is not implemented, the contracting party  whose interests have been violated has the right to introduce  measures against the other side to regulate the export of goods  onto the territory of the contracting party that has permitted  the unsanctioned reexport. At the same time, the currency  earnings from such reexport are to be returned to the country  from where the corresponding goods originated.    Each year, the contracting parties will additionally agree  upon the conditions, range, and volume of goods permitted for  reexport.    For the purposes of this article, reexport means the removal  of goods originating from the customs territory of one of the  contracting parties by the other contracting party beyond the  limits of the latter's customs territory with the aim of  exporting them to a third country.    Article 5    The contracting parties will exchange information on a  regular basis on customs questions, including customs  statistics. Bodies authorized by the contracting parties will  draw up the procedure for the exchange of such information in a  corresponding document.    Article 6    The contracting parties will undertake measures aimed at  drawing together the levels of customs duty rates that are being  applied in trade with third countries and, to this end, will  hold regular consultations.    The contracting parties will inform one another about all  exceptions regarding customs tariffs in force in their states.    Article 7    The contracting parties, in accordance with current  legislation on their territories, will promote the expansion and  deepening of equal and mutually advantageous economic and  scientific and technological cooperation between economic  subjects at all levels and forms of ownership and the creation  of joint enterprises and international companies, involving also  the participation of third countries, with the aim of utilizing  their potentials in order to form an effective common economic  space.    Article 8    The contracting parties recognize as incompatible with the  aims of this agreement unfair business practice expressed, in  particular, in the following:    In the conclusion of contracts between enterprises whose aim  is to hinder or restrict competition or violate the conditions  for it on the territories of the contracting parties;    In the carrying out of actions with whose help one or  several  enterprises use their position of dominance, restricting  competition on all or a significant part of the territories of  the contracting parties.    Article 9    The contracting parties will not use state aid in the form  of  subsidies to enterprises or in any other form if such state aid  should result in the violation of normal economic conditions on  the territory of the other contracting party.    Article 10    During the implementation of measures aimed at the tariff  and  non-tariff regulation of bilateral economic relations, in order  to exchange statistical information and conduct customs  procedures, the contracting parties have agreed to use the  single nine-character Classification of Goods of Foreign  Economic Activity (CG FEA) based on the Coordinated System of  Describing and Coding Goods. At the same time, for the own  needs of their states, the contracting parties, when necessary,  will develop the classification of goods beyond nine characters.    The Russian Federation will introduce a standard copy of the  classification of goods through its representations in the  corresponding international organizations till such time as the  Republic of Georgia announces that it is independently  introducing such a copy.    Article 11    The contracting parties agree that the observance of the  principle of free transit is a most important condition for  achieving the aims of this agreement and an essential element in  the process of their inclusion in the system of the  international division of labor and collaboration.    In this respect, each of the contracting parties guarantees  the unhindered transit through its territory of goods that  originate from the customs territory of the other contracting  party and/or third countries and that are earmarked for the  customs territory of the other contracting party or any third  country; they will offer exporters and importers all the  available means and services necessary for ensuring transit  under conditions that are no worse than those under which the  same means and services are offered to their own exporters and  importers or to exporters and importers from a third state.    The contracting parties will not demand payment for services  connected with the warehousing, transshipment, storage, and  carriage of goods in the currency of any third state.    Article 12    Nothing in this agreement should hinder any of the  contracting parties from adopting measures that they consider  necessary for the protection of their vital interests or that  are absolutely necessary for the implementation of international  treaties to which they are signatories, if these measures  concern:     -  Information that touches upon the interests of national  defense;    -  Trade in weapons, ammunition, and military hardware;    -  Research or production connected with defense needs;    -  The delivery of materials and equipment used in the nuclear  industry;    -  The protection of common morals and public order;    -  The protection of industrial or intellectual property;    -  Gold, silver, or other precious metals and stones;    -  The protection of the health of people, animals, and  plants.       Article 13    In order to develop trade between the two countries, the  contracting parties will promote participation in trade fairs  and exhibitions held in either of the two countries.    Article 14    This agreement does not affect the validity of other  agreements concluded earlier between the contracting parties and  third countries.    Article 15    Nothing in this agreement hinders the contracting parties  from conducting relations with third countries and also their  associations and international organizations provided these  relations do not contradict the aims and conditions of this  agreement. However, the contracting parties will hold  consultations in those instances when these relations could  affect the interests of one of the contracting parties,  proceeding from this agreement.    Article 16    Disputes between the contracting parties concerning the  interpretation or application of the terms of this agreement  will be settled by means of negotiations.    Article 17    In order to implement this agreement and elaborate  recommendations aimed at improving commercial and economic  cooperation between the two countries, the contracting parties  have agreed to form a joint Russian-Georgian commission.    Article 18    The contracting parties have agreed that the Republic of  Georgia can set up its trade representation in the Russian  Federation and the Russian Federation can set up its trade  representation in the Republic of Georgia. The legal status of  these trade representations and their location and function will  be determined by a separate agreement.    Article 19    Any state may become a party to this agreement, provided the  contracting parties approve this, under conditions that will be  agreed upon between the acceding state and the contracting  parties.    Article 20    The Protocol on Exemptions from the Free Trade Regulations,  which the sides undertake to sign by 15 March 1994, is an  integral part of this agreement.    Article 21    Changes or additions can be made to this agreement on the  mutual agreement of the contracting parties. These changes and  additions should be made in written form.    Article 22    This agreement comes into force on the date when  notifications are exchanged on the completion by the contracting  parties of internal state procedures that are necessary for it  to come into force and it will remain in force for 12 months  following the date on which one of the contracting parties sends  the other contracting party written notification of its  intention to annul it.    Concluded in Tbilisi on 3 February 1994 in two copies, each  one in Georgian and Russian, and each having equal force.

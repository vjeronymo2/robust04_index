			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A SYMBOLIC THUNDERHEAD  </P> <P> Was there something prophetic, perhaps, about the giant thunderhead that camped  over the Los Angeles Aqueduct late last week dumping rain that swept tons of  mud, rock and other debris into the canal that is the water lifeline for 3  million Angelenos? As it happened, nature shut off the water just as the people  of the Owens Valley were deciding whether to approve a second attempt to reach  a long-term agreement with the City of Los Angeles over how much water the city  Department of Water and Power could extract from the valley and send south.  </P> <P> And, as it happened, the tropical clouds wrought their wrath on the aqueduct  just as negotiators in Sacramento reached tentative agreement on limiting the  city' diversion of water from the Mono Lake basin just north of the Owens  Valley, and providing a means for the city to buy replacement water elsewhere.  </P> <P> Just coincidence, of course. But, in fact, the storm may symbolize the unspoken  undercurrent of hostility in the sparsely populated eastern Sierra region  against the City of Los Angeles more emphatically than the public comments  about the two related water issues. The opposition that erupted this spring  against the first Los Angeles-Inyo County draft agreement on the city's pumping  of water from the Owens Valley was surprisingly intense. That sent county and  city negotiators back to the bargaining table. The new plan that emerged this  past week was considerably improved from the standpoint of the 20,000 or so  residents of sprawling Inyo County. Barring surprises, it will win approval  from the Inyo County Board of Supervisors at a meeting Tuesday and then go  before the Department of Water and Power's governing board and the Los Angeles  City Council for ratification. The new plan gives Inyo County considerably more  authority to curtail or halt the city's pumping from Owens Valley aquifers if  there is direct evidence that the water table is being depleted to the extent  that the valley's sparse vegetation is drying up. A primary goal of the pact is  to prevent further damage than has been caused in 75 years of Los Angeles water  withdrawals from the Owens Valley. That is a major victory when viewed in the  perspective of recent years. And much will be heard from the city in the future  about the sacrifices it must make in both water and money to satisfy Inyo  County's demands.  </P> <P> In historic perspective, the city's concessions are minimal. Both the law and  the public mood have shifted dramatically in recent years away from the concept  of absolute water rights and toward environmental protection. In this sense,  the tentative agreement to protect Mono Lake from past levels of water  diversions by the city is a landmark. It establishes the concept that all the  citizens of California should help pay to maintain a remarkable state  environmental asset. This would be achieved by giving the city money to buy  water from other sources to replace that portion of its Mono basin supply  needed to maintain a healthy lake level.  </P> <P> It would be easy for the city to claim that the tail is wagging the dog -- that  it is unfair for the tiny citizenry of two far-away California counties to  restrict the vital water supply of the emerging economic capital of the Pacific  Rim for selfish and narrow environmental reasons. There is, in fact,  considerable fear in the Owens Valley that some day some judge will decide just  that, and the proposed 51-page agreement worked out over the past five years  will be just meaningless words on paper. That should never have to happen,  however, if California's ample water resources are managed with imagination and  care.  </P> <P> The reality of today is that no single entity can expect to exercise absolute  demand on another region's water. Both the Owens Valley and Mono Lake  agreements will bring a measure of fairness and balance to a complex water  equation. The City of Los Angeles should approve and honor them with pride, and  not just the grudging acceptance that has been exhibited to date.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRADLEY PUTS LID ON WATER USE AT HOME  </P> <P> In announcing his call for mandatory water rationing, Mayor Tom Bradley said  "it's easy" to cut usage by 10%.  </P> <P> And apparently, the mayor spoke from experience.  </P> <P> Since 1986, the Bradley household has cut its water use by 29.2%, according to  Department of Water and Power records obtained by The Times.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the mayor said Bradley and his wife have installed low-flow  shower heads, put bricks in toilet tanks and began using a "deep soak"  landscape irrigation system to reduce their water use.  </P> <P> The mayor also saves a little water by having his car washed at the City Hall  garage.  </P> <P> But otherwise, Bradley said he has taken no extraordinary steps to cut usage.  </P> <P> Getty House, the mayor's city-owned residence, is a 12-room, four-bedroom,  three-bath home in the Hancock Park area of Los Angeles. The mayor often  entertains visiting dignitaries and maintains extensive gardens.  </P> <P> As a result, his total water usage is about three times that of the average Los  Angeles household.  </P> <P> During 1989, the Bradley household used about 1,300 gallons of water a day,  compared to 300 to 500 gallons a day in the average household.  </P> <P> But the mayor has vowed to cut his use further.  </P> <P> "I don't care how much you have saved, you can always save more," a spokesman  quoted Bradley as saying.  </P> <P> Bradley urged city residents in March to voluntarily cut usage by 10%. "I told  my gardener that morning I wanted him to cut watering at Getty House by  one-third," the mayor said, according to a spokesman. FREDERICK M. MUIR  </P></p>

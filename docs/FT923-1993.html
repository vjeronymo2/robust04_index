			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / International Company News: Siemens plans to cut 1,800 jobs SIEMENS, the Munich-based electronics and electricals company, is planning to cut up to 1,800 jobs worldwide in its medical technology division in 1992-93. The move comes a month after Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme (SNI), Siemens's loss-making computer subsidiary, announced plans to cut its workforce by 6,000 by September 1995. It blamed a slowdown in market growth in Germany, and difficult conditions in overseas markets, especially the US and the former Soviet Union. The division's turnover was DM7.4bn (Dollars 4.93bn) last year and there are 31,000 employees worldwide, 13,000 in Germany.</p>

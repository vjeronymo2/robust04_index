			<p>BFN     [Text] Friday morning the Federation Council of the Russian  parliament failed to accept in principle a draft resolution on  President Yeltsin's decree "On Emergency Moves to Protect the  Population Against Banditry and Organized Crime as a Whole".    The committee on constitutional law-making and courtroom and  legal issues won the heaviest support in a straw vote on four  alternative drafts. When, however, it was put to roll-call  vote, the committee's draft garnered less than one half of the  overall ballot.    The returns highlighted the differences voiced in the  discussion of the anti-crime decree. Yuri Chernichenko, who  represents Moscow in the Federation Council, said the underworld  used the national constitution as an umbrella and called on the  fellow-legislators to defend the man-in-the-street who lived in  constant fear for his life and property by supporting the  anti-crime decree.    In the meantime, fellow-legislator Valeriy Rastorguyev of  Tver felt the decree deprived the citizens of their  constitutional rights and its enforcement translated into the  introduction of a state of emergency. He called for the  creation of expert emergency commissions instead of instructions  which "empowered every other law and order officer to fight  crime".    The Federation Council may be expected to resume discussion  of the anti-crime legislation, if it has time for it, on Friday.</p>

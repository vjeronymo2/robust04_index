			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Japan's Economic Boost: Legacy of war overshadows Major's visit - British prime minister adopts a softly-softly approach in quest for increased business opportunites in Japan MR JOHN Major, the British prime minister, departs for a six-day trip to Japan, Malaysia and Monaco today, hoping that the long shadow of the Second World War will not sour his hopes for a foreign policy triumph. Much against Mr Major's wishes, the issue of compensation for servicemen mistreated by the imperial Japanese military threatens to cloud his first meeting with Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, his Japanese counterpart. Mr Major is being pressed hard by leaders of British POW organisations, and will be unable to avoid raising the issue with Mr Hosokawa. But Mr Major's advisers were keen to damp expectations of a quick breakthrough yester-day, warning that Tokyo was unlikely to move beyond Mr Hosokawa's recent declaration of apology for wartime excesses. Senior British officials also stressed that the tone of the trip will be very different from the last visit to Tokyo by Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the then prime minister, four years ago. Mrs Thatcher bluntly warned against protectionism, pushed hard on a number of bilateral trade issues and left her hosts with their ears ringing. Mr Major will take a softer approach, partly because many of the problems which exercised Mrs Thatcher have been resolved. For example, Tokyo has opened its stock exchange and its telecommunications market to foreign companies. The Hosokawa government has also embarked on a deregulation drive that has strong parallels with the rhetoric emerging from London. But there has also been a change in UK government approach. Unlike the US, London believes that, exerting pressure on an increasingly confident Japan is the last way to strike a deal. Instead, Mr Major hopes to build on the warm relationship between London and Tokyo which has flowed from Japanese investment in Britain. Japan, which directs 40 per cent of its European investment to Britain, increasingly sees London as a reliable spokesman in a shifting an uncertain European Community. Mr Major, the latest in a queue of UK ministers to visit Tokyo this year, will be seeking business opportunities for British companies, greater science and technology links. He will also bring support for Japan's growing role in world diplomacy. He will be accompanied by a business delegation of senior executives from 11 companies, plus Mr Howard Davies, director general of the Confederation of British Industry and Mr Richard Needham, the trade minister. That looks hefty, but it is deliberately lightweight by comparison with the delegation that accompanied then US President George Bush to Tokyo last year, which was widely criticised as clumsy. The companies will have their own shopping list. They include Rolls-Royce, Unilever, Guinness, ICI, British Telecom, British Gas, General Electric, Cable and Wireless, and Amec. Rolls Royce, for example, is keen to sell jet engines to Japan Air Lines, which is expected to pick a supplier to refit much of its fleet in November. ICI is hoping to expand a joint venture with Teijin, a Japanese gases group, for making alternatives to chlorofluorocarbons, while GEC is looking for opportunities in government procurement. Officials emphasise that Mr Major is not just on a selling mission. Like the US, Britain remains concerned over its growing bilateral trade deficit with Japan, which amounted to Pounds 5.2bn last year. But unlike the US, Britain will not push for a numerically targeted cut in the deficit. Instead, Mr Major is expected to press for a multilateral freeing up of Japanese trade, notably by insisting that any concessions granted to the US should also apply to other trade partners. The UK is also worried that Japan is under such pressure to make concessions to Washington that British companies might lose contracts to US competitors for purely political reasons. Specific items on the agenda include sales taxes on imported whisky, which is many times higher than on domestic drinks, and continuing barriers to foreign lawyers. None of this is likely to cause serious problems. But there may be some sharp exchanges about Japanese reluctance to open the rice market to foreign suppliers. Mr Major, who is said by officials to be 'obsessed' by the stalled Uruguay Round of the Gatt, will press hard for movement on an issue he believes may prove crucial to the objective of achieving a more open world trading system. Mr Major will spend two days in Kuala Lumpur on the way home, mainly in the hope of strengthening relations with Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the sometimes prickly prime minister, and boosting opportunities for British companies in the dynamic Malaysian economy. The British premier is bracing himself for a lecture from Dr Mohamad on the European Community's reluctance to intervene militarily in Bosnia in support of the Moslem population.</p>

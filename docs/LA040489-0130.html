			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> IMELDA TO EMBALM, DISPLAY MARCOS  </P> <P> Ousted former Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos will be embalmed and  preserved for display in Hawaii if he dies in exile, his wife, Imelda, said in  an interview published today.  </P> <P> She told the Manila daily Business World she would make a deliberate spectacle  of her husband if the government of President Corazon Aquino refuses to allow a  Philippine burial.  </P> <P> "I'll keep Marcos here (in Hawaii) until 1992. Then I'll bring him home. My  mother-in-law is also waiting to be buried," she said. Marcos's mother died  last May and was embalmed so that her son could attend her burial.  </P> <P> "Ferdinand does not wish to be buried (in the United States)," Imelda Marcos  said. "If he is to be cremated after 1992, then his wish is for his ashes to be  scattered across the Philippines to fertilize his country."  </P></p>

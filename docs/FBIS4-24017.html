			<p>BFN     [Text] National Party [NP] leader F.W. de Klerk says the  constitution should be amended to make provision for the  establishment of a new party without members of parliament being  forced to resign from their posts.    Speaking in a news conference in Cape Town, Mr. de Klerk  said  that according to the present constitution a large group within  a political party was not permitted to break away and form a new  party. Mr. de Klerk added that although he was in favor of  proportional representation being retained in the new  constitution, geographical representation should be incorporated  as well. He also announced that the NP, until now made up of  four provincial parties, would become one federal party.</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool In the last week of the Australian selling season, wool prices have been better than expected, and a steadier note has replaced last week's downward drift. Japan has been competing strongly, with good support from Europe. The AWC market indicator yesterday was 445 cents a kg., compared with 450 cents a week before.

Meanwhile, the South Korean puppet army on the same days  fired more than 50 shells with tank guns at the area near the  demilitarized zone from Paju county, and on the 22d fired some  2,000 bullets with large-calibre machine-guns and automation  rifles, advancing towards the Military Demarcation Line from  Paju County and Yonchon County.    They launched exercises for surprise strike at the targets  and disturbance in the rear, repeatedly dropping "commandoes" in  Paju county on March 21 and 22.    The tension on the Korean peninsula is being screwed up by  the war provocative moves of the U.S. imperialists and the South  Korean puppets at a time when the schemes for "sanctions"  against the DPRK are being hatched up in the arena of the United  Nations and the U.S. aggression forces are moving towards the  Korean peninsula from the U.S. mainland and U.S. military bases  in the Pacific region.</p>

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Probe of secure hospitals launched THE GOVERNMENT yesterday announced an examination of high-security psychiatric care in the wake of evidence of bullying and physical and sexual assault at Ashworth Hospital, Merseyside. Seven members of the hospital's staff have been suspended. They face charges of gross misconduct and three are accused of assault. The health department said that Dr Joseph Sylvester, Ashworth's medical director, was relinquishing his post and Mr Brian Johnson, general manager, was moving to other duties. The inquiry, led by Sir Louis Blom-Cooper, chairman of the Mental Health Act Commission, found that managers at Ashworth had little power. As a result, it said, the vacuum was filled by members of the Prison Officers' Association whose main priority was security. The association said allegations of brutality by Ashworth staff were not supported by firm evidence.</p>

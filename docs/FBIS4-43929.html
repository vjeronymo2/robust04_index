			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, June 22 (AFP) -- Planned French military  intervention in Rwanda would last for at most two months, French  government spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy said Wednesday [22 June]  after President Francois Mitterrand held talks with top  ministers.    The UN Security Council was preparing meanwhile to vote on a  controversial French proposal to deploy up to 2,000 troops and  lead an operation to protect civilians from the ethnic bloodbath  in the central African country.    Sarkozy said the operation would have "a maximum duration of  two months" and would entail "comings and goings from the place  where our soldiers will be posted."    A small contingent of French elite troops has gone to Goma  in  Zaire close to Rwanda's northeastern border on an evaluation  mission and military sources said that Bangui, capital of the  Central African Republic, would be the "operational base."    Sarkozy said the views expressed in Wednesday's meeting  formed a "broad general consensus and consisted in explaining  the essentially humanitarian reasons for intervention in Rwanda."    Mitterrand met with Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe, Defense Minister Francois Leotard and  Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin, the chief of general staff  Admiral Jacques Lanxade and the president's personal military  aide, General Jean Quesnot.    Sarkozy denied speculation that there has been disagreement  among top French leaders on the planned intervention, which has  brought warnings that it would be considered an invasion by  Rwanda's mainly Tutsi rebels and only lukewarm support from the  international community.    "I deny that totally," he said. "An operation of this kind  can only be carried out amid total understanding."    In another development, a foreign ministry spokesman said  representatives of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) on  Wednesday had "contacts" here with the French government, which  they accuse of backing the Hutu majority regime in Rwanda and  being indirectly responsible for the massacre of hundreds of  thousands of Tutsis.    "Contacts are continuing in Paris with RPF representatives,"  the spokesman Richard Duque said, but he gave no details.    On Tuesday, a top RPF official, Jacques Bihozagara, called  off a planned visit from Brussels to Paris, saying that he  wanted to meet a "competent political decision-maker with regard  to military intervention."    Sarkozy said the government believed the RPF "cannot  reproach  us for saving members of a community they themselves belong to,  or they will have to explain that to the international  community."    Balladur plans to address the French national assembly on  Rwanda later Wednesday during the regular session of questions  to the government.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 16: Walt Disney World (WDW) Company, by letter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dated October 18, 1994, submitted comments on the Reissuance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the NPDES General Permit for the State of Florida. WDW  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made general comments concerning the proposed effluent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limitations for (1) Total Organic Carbon and (2) pH, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharge of uncontaminated produced groundwater. WDW  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mentioned most of the uncontaminated groundwater below their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> property exceeds EPA's proposed total organic carbon (TOC)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limitation solely because of its naturally ocurring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properties. WDW indicated that only lakes on the property  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fall below the 10 mg/l requirement and four isolated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wetlands had TOC values averaging better than 90 mg/l or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> better, with all other TOC values ranging between 10 and 65  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mg/l. WDW mentioned that these organic compounds are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> naturally occurring and large; greater than 500 molecular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weight, most of which consist of humic acids which generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> come from the decomposition of organic matter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response: EPA concurs that some elevated TOC levels are the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result of naturally occurring conditions. Therefore, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will revise the language in Part A.3 to read as follows: If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any of the analytical test results, (except TOC, benzene or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> naphthalene), exceed the above screening values the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharge is not authorized by this general permit. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excessive benzene or naphthalene concentrations, see Part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A.3(a) below. For initial excessive TOC values that may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> caused by naturally-occurring, high molecular weight organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds, the permittee may submit additional information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which describes the method used to prove that these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds are naturally occurring compounds. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional information shall be submitted to EPA during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> filing of the NOI request for coverage under the general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit. EPA will review this data and determine if coverage under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the general permit is appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment 17: Walt Disney World (WDW) made comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning the pH limitation as proposed in the NPDES  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general permit. WDW mentioned that the pH of the waters on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the WDW property range between 3.7 and 7.7 standard units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> WDW mentioned that the general permit should allow discharge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of uncontaminated produced groundwaters into any receiving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waters so long as the produced groundwater pH falls within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the lower and upper background pH limits of the receiving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waters as determined from sampling data submitted by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicant in the Notice of Intent (NOI) request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response: Since the pH requirements as proposed are based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on Florida Administrative Code (FAC) Section 17&hyph;302.530(52)(c), EPA will retain the language in the final NPDES general permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment 18: The Florida Chemical Industry Council (FCIC),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by letter dated October 21, 1994, mentioned that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed permit requires all produced groundwater discharges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to submit analytical results to EPA, regardless of project  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> size or duration even if contamination is undetected. FCIC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mentioned the permit should allow a de minimis limit, so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that very small construction projects will not be required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to report and would eliminate small projects that do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involve cleanup at uncontaminated sites.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response: The Clean Water Act (CWA) does not allow for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclusion based on the volume of the discharge. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> having all potential permittees perform the analytical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> screen for any produced groundwater discharge to surface  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waters of the U.S., places the burden on the potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharger to verify that the groundwater is uncontaminated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to discharge regardless of the length of discharge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CWA requires that all point source discharges of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pollutants to waters of the U.S. be authorized by NPDES  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment 19: The United States, Fish and Wildlife Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (FWS) submitted general comments on the NPDES general permit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. FLG830000. The FWS recommended that the permit be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> denied unless it includes discharge limitations and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate permit conditions that will assure the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance of natural pre-project habitat quality,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including: (a) Water quality, (b) sediment quality and, (c)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vegetative species diversity and abundance, plus the best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available technology and scientific data be utilized to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> avoid any adverse effects on fish and wildlife, their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> behavior, and the reproduction of any species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response: Since some technology based limits in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general permit are more stringent than Florida's water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality standards, and the Water Quality-based limits are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on Florida's water quality standards, EPA believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the maintenance of pre-project water quality will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintained. Additionally, the requirement to perform acute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxicity testing on more sensitive organisms assures that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate monitoring is in place to avoid potential adverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts on fish and wildlife.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Other Changes to Final NPDES General Permit at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Issuance:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The word ``Dewatering'' was added to the title of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final issued permit to indicate that the permit covers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general dewatering.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

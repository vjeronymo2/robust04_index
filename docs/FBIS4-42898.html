			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "SN": "Zernatto's Election: Problems to the </F> Last"]    [Text] Klagenfurt -- On Tuesday [7 June] Carinthian  Austrian People's Party [OeVP] Chairman Christof Zernatto was  elected Carinthian governor with the votes of the OeVP and the  Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe]. Shortly before the  elections, the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] presented its own  candidate: SPOe caucus leader Peter Ambrozy. The SPOe,  fulfilling the condition imposed earlier by FPOe Chairman Joerg  Haider [that the SPOe, as the party with the highest number of  votes, must present the proposal to elect Zernatto], presented  Zernatto as its candidate for governor.    The FPOe supports the principle that the party with the most  votes should provide the head of government, FPOe caucus leader  Martin Strutz said, justifying the FPOe's election proposal.  After an interruption in the meeting, Ambrozy himself made it  clear that he is not available as a candidate. He called  himself one of the builders of the SPOe-OeVP coalition;  therefore, he will abide by this agreement and exercise his  personal right to renounce running for governor.    Christof Zernatto was elected provincial governor with 20 of  the 36 votes cast. On 13 ballots -- as many as the FPOe has  seats in the Landtag -- the name "Ambrozy" was written; three  votes were invalid.    Michael Ausserwinkler, Dietfried Haller (both SPOe), and  Robert Lutschounig (OeVP) were sworn in as new government  members. Karin Achatz (SPOe), Joerg Freunschlag, and Mathias  Reichold (both FPOe) were already members of the Carinthian land  government during the previous legislative period.    In his government statement, Zernatto noted that all three  political parties have made mistakes over the past three weeks,  and this has confirmed one argument: Carinthia needs political  unity more than ever before. Therefore, confidence-building  measures should be implemented step by step.</p>

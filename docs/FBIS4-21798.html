			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 30 TASS--An explosion which occurred in  the Osenny Boulevard in the vicinity of a new residence of the  Russian president ``does not have a political colouring,''  ITAR-TASS was told at the Russian president's press service.  ``This is an ordinary crime,'' the press service said, relying  on a conclusion made by competent interior officials.    At 12:30 p.m. Wednesday, an explosive device went off in a  Zhiguli car parked in the yard of a house located in the Osenny  Boulevard, 12, block 2. The explosion killed a driver of the  ``Oton'' trade company who lived there, and ``a criminal boss''  was injured. The criminal was hospitalized. Two more girls,  aged 8 and 10, were injured. The explosion was presumably  targeted at the ``criminal element'' interior officials said.    The incident occurred at a distance of one kilometer from a  new city residence of the Russian president. Neither Boris  Yeltsin, nor his family are living in the new house yet.</p>

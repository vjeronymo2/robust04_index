			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Melnikov, head of the Central Bank of </F> Russia's Main Administration for Currency Regulation, by  Vladimir Kucherenko; date, place not given: "`Fantastic'  Deposits in the Land of Fools. What Is Behind Promises of  Fantastic Interest Rates"]    [Text] We are literally hypnotized by the advertising of  various banks and firms. They attract our money by promising  staggering interest rates of 40, 50, and 60 percent in hard  currency -- no Western banker can promise that! We spoke about  this to Viktor Melnikov, head of the Central Bank of Russia's  [CBR] Main Administration for Currency Regulation.    [Melnikov] I think that you can obtain megahigh profit  ratios in Russia by using money in deals that go beyond the  confines of banking legislation. In particular, this may  involve trading operations via dummy firms. This is an  extremely risky business: You can either become fabulously rich  or lose everything. Reputable banks that top the ratings do not  do this, nor do they promise investors crazy profits.    [Kucherenko] However, everyone is now complaining that it is  not profitable to export from the country: Prices in Russia are  close to world levels. What is the reason for these interest  rates then?    [Melnikov] You cannot even imagine how many organizations  have now won the right not to pay taxes and to export goods  dutyfree. Control over the use of these concessions is,  moreover, extremely lax. It is generally public or charitable  structures that are the fortunate ones. And we do not know  whether this trade benefits the disabled, for instance, or  whether it is an overused cover for commercial enterprises which  can quite easily make high profits if they do not pay duty and  tax. [Melnikov ends]    ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA File: The presidential administration's  Control Administration noted 20 January that the government does  not have information about how export quotas and concessions  granted to organizations and enterprises are used. A curious  example was cited. The Moscow Branch of the Children's  Foundation gave its concessions to the "Silk Route" firm to  conclude a purchase deal -- in return for 1 percent commission.    [Kucherenko] There is the opinion that it was not the banks  but structures involved in financial operations without banking  licenses that started the race to see "who could provide the  higher interest rate." GMM and Tibet, for instance. In the  opinion of CBR Deputy Chairman D. Tulin, these structures  operate on the principle of the "pyramid game": They pay  stupendous interest rates on hard-currency deposits by  attracting more and more money from the gullible.    [Melnikov] There is regrettably a naive belief in miracles  in our society, the belief that you can bury five gold coins in  a field and get 100 times that amount in the morning. As long  as there is a social breeding ground for all manner of "miracle  workers," there will always be a handful of smart operators  ready to offer the means to fabulous wealth. But all these  "miracle workers" mainly operate with the far from rich ordinary  population. The banks on the other hand prefer their clients to  be a little more sound. Everything will evidently change when  the inflated structures burst and a load of people lose their  money irretrievably.    [Kucherenko] But people should not be educated at such a  terrible price! There is the Law "On Currency Regulation,"  which prohibits involvement in currency operations without  licenses.    [Melnikov] The point is that our laws are still extremely  lax and imperfect. Britain's banking legislation for instance  fills over 70 volumes and regulates literally every move that  bankers make. Everything has been done to protect the client  against fraud. If you try that here you immediately get a  reputation for opposing the free market economy and supporting  administrative-edict methods.    You say that licenses are needed. The Law on Currency  Regulation mainly acts as a framework, countless instructions  are needed for it. We have managed to write a whole series of  them, each one taking five to six months.    [Kucherenko] But can charges not be filed against a  particular company for its advertising? Is it not a fact that  the procedure for conducting currency operations is being  breached?    [Melnikov] We have no legal documents pertaining to  advertising, and whole pages of newspapers are crammed full of  illegal announcements. For instance: "I am opening offshore  companies on the Cayman Islands without a CBR license." That is  a typical breach of procedure, commonplace smuggling of capital  offshore in order to evade taxation. But we only have to resort  to the courts and they will demand that an operational  investigation be conducted: Do prove to us, with documents and  other material evidence, that this firm has opened offshore  offices for this or that client. We do not have the resources  for that.    Take GMM, which moves depositors' money without a license,  i.e. is engaged in illegal actions. In this situation I think  that law-enforcement bodies, primarily the prosecutor's office,  should put a halt to the activity of a transgressor regardless  of the latter's jurisdiction. GMM is a Dutch firm, but it is  operating on our market and violating our laws.    [Kucherenko] What about Tibet, is it a foreign resident?    [Melnikov] We cannot do the work of the tax police! God  willing, by the end of the year we will somehow have to write  instructions regarding the Law on Currency Regulation. A  tremendous amount of work is needed to give Russia a statutory  banking base. Today a situation reigns in financial affairs  that makes foreigners despair. Unlike our country, in the  United States you cannot put more than $10,000 in an account  without providing documentary confirmation that this money has  been earned legally.    Actual financial control in the Russian Federation is  divided  between the Finance Ministry's Auditing Administration,  ourselves, the tax police, the Federal Service for  Currency-Export Controls, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  It is hard to coordinate the work. Many structures are still  only just being formed and, organizationally, are extremely  weak. Yet banking, tax, and currency legislation are  simultaneously being violated at every turn. It would be  sensible to look at the experience of the Italians, who,  afflicted as they are by the mafia and corruption, have combined  all control and financial organs in the Guardia di Finanza.  Were we to set up something of the sort based on the tax  police, for instance, many establishments would inevitably fall  within this structure's purview.    But we are doing something even now. We recently checked the  work of currency exchange points in Moscow. Abuses were  discovered at one bank ("Stayl" -- author's note). And the CBR  suspended its license for hard currency transactions.</p>

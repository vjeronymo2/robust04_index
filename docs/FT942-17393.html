			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Currencies It has become fashionable to knock sterling. Since its peak of DM2.62 in mid-January, it has fallen 5 per cent against the D-mark. Mr John Major's position has become more precarious, creating uncertainty about policy. The current account deficit is growing, while this month's tax increases may slow the recovery, adding to pressure for an interest rate cut. On that basis, there is no particular reason why sterling's fall should stop here. Look at its relationship with the dollar, though, and the picture appears different. Sterling is still well inside the range of Dollars 1.46 to Dollars 1.51 in which it has traded since last October. Moreover, it has fallen only 3 per cent on a trade-weighted basis since the start of the year, although its decline did accelerate over the past week. While some of the fall against the D-mark is clearly due to Britain's eye-catching political troubles, some has other causes. As so often in the past, sterling has been caught up in tension surrounding the dollar, which has weakened partly in the wake of US-Japanese trade tensions and partly out of disappointment with the slow pace of German interest rate cuts. With next month's local and European elections looming, sterling will remain vulnerable. If the economy continues to recover despite the tax increases, though, there is a chance that, having moved down with the dollar, it might share in any recovery of the US currency. Gilts would then look doubly attractive at a yield premium of over 130 basis points to German bunds.</p>

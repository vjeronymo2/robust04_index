			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRETZKY'S THIRD POINT HELPS KINGS TO 6-5 WIN  </P> <P> Wayne Gretzky's third point -- an assist -- was a big one Friday night.  </P> <P> He passed to Steve Kasper, who scored a last-second goal that gave the Kings a  6-5 victory over the Vancouver Canucks in front of 16,123 at the Pacific  Coliseum.  </P> <P> As seconds ticked away, the winning goal was set up when Gretzky carried the  puck into the Canucks' zone -- acting as a magnet to two defenders who couldn't  help but give chase.  </P> <P> Kasper, who used to lead the Boston Bruins' checking line, liked what he saw.  </P> <P> "I could see both Vancouver guys going at Wayne, and I started yelling for the  puck," he said. "I probably didn't need to be yelling, because he sees  everything. He doesn't miss anything.  </P> <P> "When I looked for the shot, which I think went between (Kirk McLean's) pads, I  knew time was running short. But I didn't know it was just one second."  </P> <P> Kasper gave the Kings their third victory in five games and helped Gretzky  close the gap on the National Hockey League points record.  </P> <P> "I knew from my years in Boston what was going to happen," Kasper said. "That's  why we used to designate one guy to go with him and say, hey, that's his  responsibility, let's not get caught trying to do everybody else's job. Because  when he draws two men, somebody's open."  </P> <P> Gretzky has made a career of setting up the open man.  </P> <P> All three points Friday night were assists.  </P> <P> Gretzky needs two to break the points record of 1,850 that Gordie Howe set over  the course of a 26-year National Hockey League career.  </P> <P> Howe and several league officials were on hand in case Gretzky set the record,  but it really was not expected to happen Friday night. Not even Howe thought  so. He quipped before the game: "If I thought he was going to get it, I'd have  worn my suit."  </P> <P> Gretzky's parents didn't even make the game. They were figuring they could show  up at Sunday's game in Edmonton without missing the milestone.  </P> <P> They were right about that.  </P> <P> Gretzky has said he would like to break the record at the Forum and, failing  that, his second choice would be to break in Edmonton. But Gretzky did not hold  back against the Canucks.  </P> <P> The Canucks held him back, perhaps, limiting him to one shot on goal. But he  didn't duck ice time.  </P> <P> Gretzky skated with his own line of John Tonelli and Bob Kudelski and took  turns with Bernie Nicholls centering a line with Hubie McDonough and Jim Fox.  </P> <P> And Gretzky did his share of penalty killing and skating on the power play.  </P> <P> But the Canucks know how to play him. Vancouver Coach Bob McCammon, who was an  assistant coach at Edmonton during Gretzky's reign there, said before Friday's  game that he knew what it took to slow -- if not stop -- Gretzky, including  using two lines to check him. Gretzky's stamina is such that he can wear down  one line.  </P> <P> Traditionally, the Canucks defend against Gretzky pretty well. He was shut out  here in one game last season.  </P> <P> In the first period, the Canuck defense stopped all the Kings, holding them to  three shots on goal -- none for Gretzky -- to 14 for the Canucks.  </P> <P> Vancouver took a 1-0 lead in the first period, on a play initiated when Trevor  Linden, one of the league's best rookies last season, blew past King defenseman  Petr Prajsler coming up the right side. That drew goalie Kelly Hrudey out and  he then passed through the crease to center Greg Adams, who scored in the open  net behind Hrudey.  </P> <P> Adams scored another power-play goal to put the Canucks ahead, 2-0, early in  the second period. But the Kings took control in the period, outscoring the  Canucks by three goals to take a 5-3 lead.  </P> <P> The Kings started to rally with a power-play goal by Kudelski from defenseman  Steve Duchesne and Gretzky. Less than a minute later, Craig Duncanson's goal  tied it.  </P> <P> The Canucks' Soviet tandem stepped forward, with Igor Larionov scoring off a  pass from Vladimir Krutov on the power play for a brief lead before the Kings  scored the last three goals of the period.  </P> <P> Dave Taylor scored twice in that run, beating McLean to tie it at 14:36 and  again to make it 5-3 on the second goal of a four-minute power play that  resulted from a fight between Canuck defenseman Larry Melnyk and King  defenseman Keith Crowder.  </P> <P> They both received five minutes for fighting, but Melnyk also got two minutes  for charging and two minutes for instigating.  </P> <P> Kudelski scored first for the Kings on that power play off a centering pass  from Gretzky.  </P> <P> Petri Skriko and Larionov scored early in the third period to tie the score  again, and the game remained a standoff until Kasper and Gretzky won it with  one second left.  </P> <P> King Notes  </P> <P> Mikael Lindholm, the young Swedish player who has been on Wayne Gretzky's line  since the first day of training camp, was scratched Friday night. John Tonelli  was moved into his spot to play opposite Bob Kudelski, who now leads the Kings  with four goals. . . . Left winger Jay Miller was scratched to let a bruised  lower leg heal. . . . Since joining the Kings, goalie Kelly Hrudey is 3-0  against the Canucks. . . . The Canucks outshot the Kings in six of eight games  last season, and did it again Friday night.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] President Yoweri Museveni, who is now on an  official visit to Austria, was yesterday received by the  president of the Federal Republic of Austria, Dr. Thomas  Klestil, at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna. The two leaders held  talks centerd on bilateral relations between Uganda and Austria.  Speaking to the press after the talks, President Klestil said  that, although Austrian foreign policy is centered on Europe,  President Museveni's official visit to his country is a proof  that Uganda took a central place in Austrian relations with  Africa. President Museveni on his part said he is pleased that  Austria is assisting Uganda in the rehabilitation of the water  system in Kampala and hospitals around the country. He  emphasized that trade and investment, rather than aid for  Uganda, are more durable and sustainable forms of cooperation  between the two countries, and in this regard looks forward to  increased Austrian collaboration, which he said will be centerd  on business as well as other investment, to top up the abundant  potential the country has.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Clinton's Folly"] </F>   [Text] The Clinton administration's response to the  collapse of the weekend trade talks between the United States  and Japan is disturbing news. Threatening trade sanctions  against Japan for a transgression of dubious validity, namely,  failing to ensure that a U.S. company, Motorola, won a certain  quantitative share of the Tokyo cellular phone market is bad  enough. To also say, as Mr. Clinton did, that yes, sanctions  could trigger a trade war but the United States is "willing to  take that risk" borders on recklessness and irresponsibility.  Already, stock and currency markets in Asia are reeling. They  have nothing whatsoever to do with the U.S.-Japan trade spat.  And there are consumers and producers, buyers and sellers, and  traders and investors all over our economically interdependent  world who would be hit. It is tragic and hugely unfair that  their fortunes should be buffeted by willful economic  saber-rattling.    The operative word here is willful. According to a NEW YORK  TIMES report, the administration's strategy is to create  uncertainty and anxiety in Japan so as to drive up the value of  the yen and thus pressure the Japanese to return to the  bargaining table on American terms. If true, this suggests a  cynicism that is misguided and dangerous. It is misguided  because, first, a sudden and unexpected appreciation of the yen  without consultation with Japan would undermine the effects of  the economic stimulus package which the United States Government  lobbied for and the Japanese Government worked so hard to  deliver. A prolonged Japanese recession is the last thing U.S.  producers need if they want to sell more to Japanese consumers.  Second, a yen appreciation would indeed raise Japan's export  prices and blunt it competitiveness. But there is a downside:  Japanese-made parts and components which account for a large  proportion of Japan's exports to the United States would also be  more expensive. This would undermine the competitiveness of  many U.S. industries. Third, even if a stronger yen were a  great idea, there is not much sense talking the currency up  without any mechanism to keep it there. The administration's  strategy is therefore at best, a short-term gamble. And like  many gambles,it could be dangerous. Far from forcing the  Japanese to dance to an American tune, it could inflame  nationalistic sentiment in Japan and stiffen resolve to resist  U.S. pressure. If the conflict then escalates, the Japanese  could even be tempted into retaliatory action -- and they are  not short of options.    For now, good sense seems to have prevailed in Tokyo. Japan  has shown no signs of upping the ante. On the contrary, it has  said it will take unilateral steps to open its markets -- which  it must do, because there is truth in much of what the United  States is complaining about. But Japan has done the responsible  thing by saying it will take its case to the General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade. This is, after all, the rightful place to  settle disputes of this sort -- disputes that may be bilateral  in origin but are in today's world, multilateral in their  effects. It is to the Clinton administration's discredit that  despite having just recently signed the Uruguay Round, it has  chosen to disregard it totally.</p>

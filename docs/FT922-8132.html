			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Big rise reported in formation of company audit committees MANY British companies have created audit committees voluntarily in the past few years, but few disclose much about them in their accounts, according to a report commissioned by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. A sample of 300 organisations was polled and replies were received from 202 industrial concerns, including listed companies, and 44 financial institutions. Two thirds of the industrial concerns and 88 per cent of the institutions had audit committees, compared with 17 per cent of large UK companies in a 1985 study Mr Paul Collier, a lecturer in accounting at Exeter University who carried out the research for the institute early last year, said greater levels of control and the requirement for compliance committees explained the higher incidence among financial institutions. The typical audit committee has one executive director and three or four non-executive directors, appointed for an indefinite period. It meets three times a year and reviews company accounting principles and practice. Half of the committees in the survey review auditors' fees. But the annual reports of 45 per cent of the industrial concerns and 21 per cent of the institutions did not disclose even the presence of an audit committee. Among industrial concerns, many public-sector organisations and listed companies had audit committees, while other businesses and the subsidiaries of foreign-owned companies had very few. More than half of the committees had been created within the previous five years. The most frequently cited reasons for their creation were good corporate practice and strengthening the effectiveness of non-executive directors. Many companies without audit committees dismissed them as an additional layer of bureaucracy, and said that their costs would outweigh their benefits. Audit Committees in Large UK Companies.

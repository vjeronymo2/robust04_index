			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WEEKENDER  </P> <P> Portuguese Bend affair is not joust another horse show.  </P> <P> Elegant English-style horseback riders wearing breeches and shiny boots will  rub shoulders with jousting medieval knights in Rolling Hills Estates on  Saturday.  </P> <P> It's not quite what one expects at a classic horse show, but it's all a part of  the weekend's entertainment as the 33rd annual Portuguese Bend National Horse  Show unfolds at the Empty Saddle Club today through Sunday. The event is the  Palos Verdes Peninsula's major fund-raiser for Childrens Hospital of Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> In competition that carries a top rating from the American Horse Show Assn.,  riders from preteen to adults will vie for honors in horsemanship ranging from  jumping for speed and height to striving for perfect form as they take their  horses over fences or guide them through the walk, trot and canter.  </P> <P> Leading a lineup of weekend entertainment, knights from Medieval Times in Buena  Park, wearing full armor and bright colors, will joust early Saturday  afternoon. Among Sunday's attractions will be precision riding by the 50-member  Long Beach Mounted Police unit on palominos and gymnastics performed on moving  horses by youngsters from the Rainbow Vaulters.  </P> <P> Show organizers say this mixture of keenly competitive horsemanship and  colorful equestrian entertainment is designed to please both horse experts and  casual spectators.  </P> <P> "We're bringing very fine quality horses and fine quality riders," show  chairman Jody Murdock said. "Everyone, whether they're knowledgeable about  horses or not, will have entertaining events they can enjoy seeing."  </P> <P> Murdock said some of the most exciting riding of the weekend will be provided  by youngsters competing in the Horsemanship Medal Finals of the Pacific Coast  Horse Shows Assn. Focused on riding skills in the walk, trot and canter as well  as jumping, the event is open to children 14 and younger who have won blue  ribbons at other horse shows in the state.  </P> <P> "The top young riders in the state are coming from Sacramento to San Diego,"  said Carole Diestel, president of the peninsula support committee for Childrens  Hospital. She said 55 youngsters have qualified for the event.  </P> <P> Devotees of fast riding over jumps will be able to get their thrills in  Gambler's Choice, in which horses and riders must clear up to 12 fences in a  specified period of time. Points are based on the difficulty of the jump.  </P> <P> And at the opposite end of the equestrian spectrum, an event called Leadline  will spotlight children under the age of 8. "We dress them up, put them on the  back of a horse and lead them in. It's their introduction to the horse, and  many parents regret that later on," said Murdock in a joking reference to the  time and expense a horse can entail.  </P> <P> A special demonstration of horsemanship will be given by youngsters from the  Pony Club of Portuguese Bend, where South Bay children care for horses and take  riding lessons.  </P> <P> And in one of the more unusual events at the show, people will be able to see  Peruvian Pasos in action. These small horses have been bred for centuries to  carry their heads high and move rapidly, without bouncing, in a kind of  scurrying motion.  </P> <P> If youngsters feel a need for a little distraction from horses during the show,  they may visit the Kids Korral, where the attractions will include the Jim  Gamble Marionettes and Willie the Clown, along with pony rides, face painting,  crafts, games and contests.  </P> <P> The horse show -- which takes its name from its one-time home at the historic  Vanderlip stables in Portuguese Bend -- has grown over the years. A decade ago,  about 2,000 people attended the show, but this weekend, the number is expected  to range between 3,000 and 5,000.  </P> <P> Church and school parking lots in the Empty Saddle area will be used to  accommodate cars, with shuttle buses going to and from the riding club between  9 a.m. and 5 p.m.  </P> <P> Diestel said several donors cover the show's costs, permitting low food and  admission prices and larger proceeds for the hospital. Last year, a total of  $156,000 was raised.  </P> <P> About 100 volunteers are the backbone of the show, including the 40 active  members of the hospital support committee and their families. Volunteers put up  the blue and white striped tents that serve as booths. They spread and rake the  sawdust for the show rings. During the show, they will cook and sell hamburgers  and hot dogs, along with cold drinks, coffee, salad and fruit.  </P> <P> Two weekends ago, volunteer workers descended on the Empty Saddle Club, where  they made repairs and painted fences white and trash cans green.  </P> <P> "We need it to look real great for our show," said Ann Boyt, a show co-chair,  adding that the show is a "tremendous effort" on the part of everyone who  pitches in.  </P> <P> What: Portuguese Bend National Horse Show.  </P> <P> Where: Empty Saddle Club, 39 Empty Saddle Road, Rolling Hills Estates.  </P> <P> When: Today, 8 a.m.; Saturday, 7:30 a.m.; Sunday, 8 a.m. (Events determine  conclusion.)  </P> <P> Admission: Adults, $2 today; $3 Saturday; $5 Sunday. Children 4 to 6, $2.  </P> <P> Information: 375-1861; 833-5201. GERALD FARIS  </P></p>

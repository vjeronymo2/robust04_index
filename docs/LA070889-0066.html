			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> INCONCLUSIVE SURVEY STALLS PLAN FOR MINE  </P> <P> Federal officials say a controversial plan to operate an open pit mine in  exclusive Sand Canyon has been left in limbo because land surveys could not  determine whether Eureka Consolidated Development has a right to mine the site.  </P> <P> Federal surveyors failed to establish whether a proposed iron silicate ore mine  is within an area of Angeles National Forest where mining is allowed, said  Richard Borden, a special projects coordinator for the U.S. Forest Service.  </P> <P> Eureka Consolidated staked its claim to the proposed Black Diamond Mine under  an 1872 federal mining law that allows prospecting on some public lands. But  the area's rugged terrain -- plus confusing maps from the 1890s -- have made it  impossible to determine whether the proposed Black Diamond Mine lies within  legal mining territory.  </P> <P> The questions raised by the surveys prompted the Forest Service to halt work on  an environmental impact report, Borden said. Resolving the questions would  require a $200,000 land survey, but "we don't have the money to do that work,"  he said.  </P> <P> The Forest Service spent $15,000 for a survey in December and January, but that  effort only raised the questions that now perplex the agency, Borden said.  Although the 1872 law allows mining in national forests, Congress declared  portions of Angeles National Forest off limits to miners in 1928, he said.  </P> <P> The problem, Borden said, is tracking down the boundary line drawn by Congress.  "Nobody knows where that line is," he said. The proposed mine is about four  miles south and one-quarter of a mile east of the Antelope Valley Freeway.  </P> <P> The discrepancies in the boundary lines were discovered more than a year ago  when four Sand Canyon homeowners near the proposed mine became embroiled in a  property dispute. The dispute came to the attention of Minebusters, a  homeowners' group, which raised the issue last July when it submitted 55 points  challenging a draft of the environmental impact report prepared by the Forest  Service.  </P> <P> Minebusters has not declared victory in its fight, but group leader Mike  Levison said the inconsistent surveys "pretty much eliminate the prospect of a  mine there in the immediate future."  </P> <P> But in a June 22 letter, Eureka Consolidated asked the federal Bureau of Land  Management to survey the proposed mine site. Barbara Maxfield, a bureau  spokes-woman, said the agency had not yet reviewed the request. A final  decision will be made by the bureau's state director, Ed Hastey, she said.  </P> <P> Levison said the bureau should not use public funds to promote a private  venture. "There must be something more important on their agenda than to  justify a questionable mining claim," he said. If Eureka is serious about  mining in Sand Canyon, he said, the company should offer to pay for the survey.  </P> <P> George Warsaw, company president, said that Eureka is still committed to the  Black Diamond Mine and that the survey problem could be resolved soon. "I don't  imagine it'll take too long," Warsaw said. He refused to comment further.  </P> <P> Minebusters, which has fought the mine for six years, claims that crushers used  to grind ore into small chunks would disrupt the quiet of the secluded canyon.  Sand Canyon is considered Santa Clarita's most exclusive area, dotted with  Tudor-style estates and Arabian horse ranches.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National News" newscast] </F>   [Text] In view of the arrest or possible surrender of Cali  cartel members, Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff has  insisted in his well-known policy of the carrot and the stick.    [Begin recording] [Unidentifed reporter] Were you aware that  Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela and Hector Fabio Urdinola would  surrender first?    [De Greiff] Yes, these are the two people who have appointed  lawyers with whom we are advancing the process. You can be sure  that I am confident, and the lawyers have said as much, that the  process will not be limited to these two people but involve many  others who unfortunately have engaged in drug trafficking.    [Reporter] Will they be the first ones?    [De Greiff] That is correct.    [Second unidentified reporter] Are we going to be having  announcements as happened in the past with Pablo Escobar?    [De Greiff] Pardon me?    [Second reporter] Will we be having announcements of  surrenders, as happened with Pablo Escobar in the past?    [De Greiff] I hope not, because they know and must keep in  mind that as long as they do not surrender, we are going to  continue pursuing them. Ultimately, they will meet with either  Escobar's fate or the fate of those who have surrendered to  justice. [end recording]</p>

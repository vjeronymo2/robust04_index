			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / World declaration to fight malnutrition A WORLD declaration expressing determination to eliminate hunger and reduce all forms of malnutrition was adopted in Rome yesterday by 1,400 delegates from 160 countries at the close of the first International Conference on Nutrition, writes Robert Graham in Rome. The ministerial conference, organised by United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Health Organisation, made no direct reference to the situation in Somalia. But the declaration condemned wars and civil strife as being major causes of both hunger and malnutrition, and pleaded for safe passage of humanitarian aid. In his opening remarks, Pope John Paul II had condoned the use of military force to back up humanitarian aid in Somalia. The conference concluded that although the relative proportion of people suffering from inadequate food supplies had declined over the past 20 years, it was still unacceptable that 780m in developing countries, equivalent to 20 per cent of their population, lived under such conditions. The problem was no longer insufficient foods supplies but distribution and poverty.</p>

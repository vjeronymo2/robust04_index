			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Status quo locks in effect of D-Mark instability ONE WORD appeared repeatedly on the lips of both German and French politicians and central bankers last week: stability. After last Tuesday's Franco-German summit meeting in Paris, French Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery reaffirmed his government's commitment 'to a monetary policy that emphasises price stability and the stability of the external value of our currency'. Mr Alphandery's words will have been music to German ears. For stability has also been on the mind of German Finance Minister Theo Waigel. 'I assume,' he told a news conference the morning after the late-night decision of Europe's finance ministers to widen ERM bands, 'that in a relatively short time exchange rates will stabilise not very far from where they were in the existing bands'. The reason for this German desire for currency stability was outlined over the weekend by Bundesbank President Helmut Schlesinger in an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. In comments directed at hard-pressed German industry, he said he did not expect a clear revaluation of the D-Mark against other currencies in the ERM, adding that other ERM members were currently more interested in stabilising their currencies than in cutting their interest rates sharply and triggering devaluations. For the French government, a period of calm, after weeks of foreign currency storms, also has its attractions. Keeping the French franc close to its old ERM bands against the D-Mark is the best way for Prime Minister Edouard Balladur to fight off the charge that he has sanctioned an implicit franc devaluation. But for the French economy, preserving the current D-Mark-franc link no longer seems consistent with either domestic or external stability. The franc fort policy of fixing the franc to the D-Mark, far from preserving 'the stability of the external value' of the franc, has bequeathed an effective 6 per cent appreciation against a trade-weighted basket of European currencies, as the left-hand chart shows. The reason is that the French franc has been pegged to an appreciating currency. Until last September's crisis, the ERM successfully suppressed the D-Mark appreciation which German unification demanded. Instead, the real appreciation of the German currency, necessary to reorientate west German production from exports to east Germany and allow the government to finance its budget deficit, occurred through a rise in German inflation relative to its European partners. The result was a steady decline in the European price competitiveness of German industry since 1991, as the right-hand chart shows. France, by contrast, continued to amass competitiveness gains because of its relatively low producer price inflation rate. Since September the departure of sterling and the Italian lira from the system and the devaluations of the punt, peseta and escudo have further undermined German competitiveness, this time through a nominal D-Mark appreciation. But France, by sticking to its old ERM parity, has been forced to accept both this nominal exchange rate appreciation and the Bundesbank's high interest rates. The result is a deepening and unnecessary French recession. Maintaining the franc fort policy, far from preserving domestic stability, has thus progressively deepened France's domestic deflation. The longer the government refuses to cut its short-term interest rates in an attempt to preserve this franc appreciation, the deeper the damage to industry and the greater the risk of an unnecessarily large franc depreciation and inflationary backlash when the policy collapses. For France, a sizeable cut in interest rates, accompanied by some form of franc depreciation, seems the only route back to stability. German industrialists have good reason to hope that such a franc depreciation does not occur over the coming months. But if the franc does fall, they should address their complaints to Bonn and Frankfurt, not Paris.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------       INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: PRICES AND COMPETITIVENESS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Yearly figures are shown in index form with the common base year of 1985.

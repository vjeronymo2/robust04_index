			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Stainless steel newcomer enters UK market AVESTA SHEFFIELD, the Stockholm-based company formed in November from the merger of Sweden's Avesta and the stainless steel interests of British Steel, unveiled its new UK distribution company in Birmingham yesterday. The launch of Avesta Sheffield Distribution was described by Mr Cliff Shore, its managing director, as the most important event in the UK stainless industry for decades. The company will have about 35 per cent of the UK stainless steel distribution market, and be responsible for distributing stainless steel both from former British Steel plants in the UK and Avesta plants in Sweden. The launch comes as European producers of both carbon and stainless steel are implementing price increases. Along with carbon steel prices, stainless prices in Europe have fallen by 30 per cent over the past two years. Mr Shore said the company was raising prices for cold-rolled stainless by 10 per cent, spread through the first quarter of the year, and a similar amount on hot-rolled. There would be a knock-on effect for tubular prices. Mr Shore said he viewed the price increases with optimism. In contrast to the carbon steel market, stainless steel sales had risen in volume terms - annual volume growth in Europe was about 4 per cent and could reach 5 per cent in the UK which has Europe's lowest per capita consumption of stainless. Yesterday's launch was aimed at informing some 200 customers about the distribution company's business objectives and, said Mr Shore, to show them who they would be talking to. Employment at the distribution company has been reduced from about 600 at British Steel and Avesta before the merger to 400 and distribution reorganised and centralised. Avesta Sheffield Distribution will have annual turnover of Pounds 120m, but total UK turnover for Avesta Sheffield itself will be Pounds 240m, including mill sales direct to customers and to independent distributors.</p>

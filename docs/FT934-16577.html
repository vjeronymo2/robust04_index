			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / New UN mandate angers Serbs FIGHTING spread across former Yugoslavia yesterday, as Serb leaders accused the new six-month United Nations mandate for its forces in Bosnia, Croatia and Macedonia of destroying any chance of peace. Mr Vladislav Jovanovic, the Yugoslav foreign minister, said the mandate gave the go-ahead to Zagreb to clamp down on Serb communities in Croatia. 'Singling out Yugoslavia is a roundabout way to enable Croatia to continue undermining the plan and its aggressive behaviour towards the UN protected areas,' he told Tanjug, the Belgrade-based news agency. In contrast, Croatia praised the Security Council decision. In vaguely worded terms, it threatens to link the lifting of sanctions on Serbia with ending the Serbo-Croat conflict in Croatia. Mr Mate Granic, Croatian foreign minister, said: 'The republic of Croatia has all reasons to be satisfied with Resolution 871, its general tone and individual provisions.' However, the resolution fell short of Zagreb's demands to give more muscle to the 15,000 peacekeepers posted in Croatia. Mr Franjo Tudjman, the president of Croatia, is frustrated with the UN's failure to force Serb rebels to renounce their self-styled state, which covers about one-third of Croatian territory. Mr Jovanovic later tried to downplay the blow dealt by the terms of the UN mandate as containing 'only general references to the normalisation of the situation'. The UN 17 months ago imposed sanctions on the rump Yugoslav state for the violent carve-up of neighbouring Bosnia. International mediators have used the lure of easing sanctions to tempt Serb officials into handing over land seized during the war in Bosnia.</p>

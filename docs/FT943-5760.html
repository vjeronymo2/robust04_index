			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / BT seeks to make the most of its lower prices: A look at the tactics of telecoms companies as competition becomes keener It is not just British Telecommunications hype. The telephone really is becoming steadily cheaper to use, particularly for business callers who clock up long-distance and international minutes. And prices are set to fall further as regulation and competition continue to bite. This week's price cuts from BT mean that UK long-distance calls are barely a third of the cost a decade ago, allowing for inflation. From the end of this month a three-minute weekday morning call from London to Hereford will cost 30p. In January this year it was 50p. Not all prices have come down. Line rental charges have risen 10 per cent in real terms in the past decade, and will continue rising. Oftel, the telecoms regulator, supports BT's efforts to reduce its deficit on maintaining basic line connections. But it has forced the company to bring its call charges down sharply, reflecting the falling cost of delivering calls as new technology slashes overheads. Oftel's price cap obliges BT to reduce its total charges by 7.5 per cent a year, once an increase for inflation has been allowed for. In round figures that equals price cuts worth Pounds 500m, with Pounds 100m recouped from a 2 per cent real-terms increase in line rental charges. BT is free to target the cuts as it chooses. Mr Michael Hepher, BT's managing director, says three factors determine its price-cutting strategy. Ideally, cuts will stimulate usage. They ought to give BT 'the most favourable stance against the competition' and they should 'do something to sparkle the imagination'. The abolition of the morning peak rate earlier this year met the last two criteria. This week's abolition of the higher long-distance rate, at a cost of Pounds 244m over a full year, was firmly directed at the first and second  -particularly at competition in the business market. Mercury, BT's main competitor, has a quarter of the large business market and about two-thirds of the City of London's outgoing traffic. But it is increasingly hampered by BT's falling prices on one hand and by new entrants pursuing its bigger customers on the other. The price gap between BT and Mercury is steadily narrowing in the business market (see graph). For many big businesses the saving is down to 6 per cent or less for UK traffic. Mr Terry Rhodes, Mercury's competition director, said his company had to break out of the 'BT-but-cheaper' syndrome. He believes the message still has strong appeal to small and medium-sized businesses - those with annual telecoms bills of less than Pounds 150,000. But Mercury's efforts are shifting to building 'brand loyalty' through added-value business services such as network management and improved data telecoms links. A host of new operators has moved into the City, the UK's telecoms honeypot, and targetting Mercury first and foremost. The most successful to date appears to be Worldcom, a US group which set up in London in 1991. Worldcom re-sells international lines to big business at a discount. It boasts 250 business customers and claims to have cornered nearly 3 per cent of the UK's outgoing international telecoms traffic. Mr David Hardwick, managing director, said: 'Our marketing is based on 10 per cent to 15 per cent off Mercury's best business price.' Worldcom is also about to enter the small and medium-size business market, and plans to offer a long-distance UK service in addition to its international service, inter-connecting to existing long-distance networks. MFS, another US group, is already active in the UK long-distance business. Launched in March this year, MFS offers free line rental to customers with usage bills of Pounds 600 or more per line per year. Its fibre network covers most of the City and Docklands and is being built out to Southwark and Westminster. The company is considering a plan to extend the network to the Thames Valley, putting MFS within reach of 35 per cent of the UK's big telecoms users. Long-distance telecoms capacity is abundant, giving plenty of scope for re-sellers to expand. In addition to BT and Mercury, Energis, a subsidiary of the National Grid which has erected a long-distance network on electricity pylons, is opening for business. The regional electricity companies covering Yorkshire and Manchester are building their own networks, and targeting business users.</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Restructure weighs on Staveley Staveley Industries, the measurement, mechanical engineering and minerals company, yesterday announced a decline in half-year profits as it continued to restructure its weighing division. The company, which also owns British Salt, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.1m (Pounds 7.5m) on turnover of Pounds 166.3m (Pounds 164.6m) for the half year to October 1. The shares dropped 12p to 194p. Net interest charges jumped 57 per cent to Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 700,000). Gearing rose from 29 per cent to 41 per cent as capital expenditure increased to Pounds 6.1m (3.7m), mainly on new manufacturing capacity in the US. This is part of a Pounds 10m reorganisation package which will transfer weighing production from California to Minnesota, and end the production of bagging systems in Germany. Mr Roy Hitchens, chief executive, said: 'The reorganisation is on plan in every respect: in terms of time scale, cost reduction, and the construction of the new facility.' Turnover from the measuring division fell to Pounds 72.9m (Pounds 77.7m) but operating profit improved to Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 1.2m). Reorganisation of the Weigh-Tronix weighing division is expected to finish by the end of the financial year. Chronos Richardson, the bagging and batch-blending systems business, is planned to be fully reorganised in 12 months. The mechanical and electrical services side lifted turnover to Pounds 75m (Pounds 68.7m) as the maintenance business expanded catering equipment services. However, pressure on margins in contracting left operating profit at Pounds 100,000 (Pounds 500,000). The minerals operations, which supply more than half of the UK salt market, raised turnover slightly to Pounds 17.3m (Pounds 17.1m), after improved sales of compacted products. Operating profit dipped to Pounds 6.2m (Pounds 6.4m). Earnings per share fell 6 per cent to 4.6p (4.9p) but the interim dividend is maintained at 2.3p.</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Renault may be partially sold off by end of year The French government is considering a partial privatisation of Renault, the state-owned automobile group, by the end of this year, according to Mr Philippe Auberger, a senior member of the National Assembly's finance committee. Mr Auberger's comments yesterday follow speculation in business circles that the government will seek to implement a progressive or partial privatisation of the automobile company, following the collapse of merger plans with Volvo of Sweden at the end of last year. During the negotiations with Volvo, the French government had said it aimed to sell its controlling stake in Renault this year. But the merger's failure, the political sensitivity involved in privatising one of the flagship companies of the French public sector and the possibility of trade union opposition prompted a delay in the timetable. Officials have since indicated that a sale of the government's 80 per cent stake in the automobile group is unlikely before next spring's presidential elections. According to Mr Auberger, the idea of a partial privatisation is being studied by the office of Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, and by Mr Gerard Longuet, the industry minister, who has pushed for the company's privatisation. Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault's chairman, is also eager for the company to be transferred to the private sector. Mr Auberger said that no decision had been taken and the operation, if implemented, would be unlikely before October or November. He hinted that it could take the form of a sale of shares to industrial or financial partners rather than through a public offer for sale. Government officials declined to discuss the mechanisms of a partial privatisation. But industry observers in Paris suggested that it could involve the sale of between 15 and 25 per cent of Renault's shares and the formation of a so-called 'noyau dur' - a core of long-term shareholders. This could include Lagardere Group, which co-operates with Renault on the design and production of its Espace vehicles, and Elf-Aquitaine, the oil group. A partial privatisation would confirm the government's commitment to privatise the automobile group, and could facilitate the reduction of Volvo's 20 per cent holding in the company.</p>

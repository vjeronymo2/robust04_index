			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Wellman falls Pounds 1.07m into red Severely reduced margins in a depressed market coupled with reorganisation costs resulted in Wellman, the specialist engineer, reporting pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.07m for the year to March 31, against profits of Pounds 681,000. Mr Geoffrey Iley, chairman, said that a slow improvement in trading had come too late to affect the result, but a marked upturn in order intake should have a significant impact on trading in the present year. Reflecting this, the final dividend is held at 0.6p for an unchanged total of 0.9p. Losses per share were 3.6p (earnings 1p). Turnover was Pounds 22.3m (Pounds 23.7m). There was a trading loss of Pounds 483,000, against profits of Pounds 1.15m, and reorganisation costs of Pounds 445,000 (Pounds 351,000).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [New year address by Finland's President Mauno Koivisto in </F> Helsinki on 1 January -- recorded]    [Excerpts] Citizens, [Swedish Professor] Gunnar Myrdal said  in his time that it is like winning the lottery to be born in  the Nordic countries. We are also proud to be counted among  this enviable group of countries. Since then, the Nordic  welfare state model has faced difficulties and many have felt  tempted to ridicule Myrdal's words. I think that Myrdal is right.    The international status of Finland has during the last  decades become very stable and positive. In this sense there  has been no change and there is no change in view. The Russian  elections less than a month ago caused debate in Finland.  Russia is still traversing a critical period, but there is no  cause to draw hasty conclusions. The national referendum in  Russia approved the new Constitution. That is an important step  in creating a new political system in Russia. International  observers did not have much to say about how the elections were  run. The result of the elections reflects the uncertainty and  the discontent experienced by Russians. However, no alternative  has been shown in the direction of the reforms, although the  speed of the reforms might change. The foreign and security  policy in Russia is led by the president with the help of a  democratically elected parliament. Our starting point is that  there are good preconditions for established cooperation between  Finland and Russia.    Finland's negotiations in the European Union are at their  final stage. Most issues in the negotiations have already been  concluded. In a ministerial meeting just before Christmas,  decisions which largely correspond with our aims were made in  many important questions, like the new members taking part in  foreign and security policy cooperation. In the next few weeks  there will be a compact and demanding stage of negotiations on  the questions which remain open, mainly in agriculture. It  would be desirable that satisfactory solutions could be found  quickly. According to my view, our preconditions to reach a  good negotiations result will not improve if the solutions were  to be delayed until after the elections of the European  Parliament, until the end of the year or even further. It is  important to reach such a result which, according to the  promises of the government, can be submitted to a national  referendum. In all situations we must ourselves take care of  matters and advantages concerning us, our economy, and our  security. It is not certain that anybody else will do that for  us. [as heard]    The debate on our future economic views has increased. In  the last decade we have become used to thinking that progress is  sure and justified, setbacks are considered to be temporary and  unnecessary. Lately there have been comments which take a  serious view on the alternative that we could not or we should  not continuously aim to increase our consumption level. We are  increasingly taking part in international cooperation and we are  greatly dependent on what happens in the world. Matters which  can be reliably predicted take place and unpredictable matters  take place. The growth in the world's population continues in a  speedy way, birth control is ineffective, and all countries that  are able to aim to increase the standard of living of their  population, improving the peoples' state of health, and  increasing the average age. The increase in the number of human  beings and their increasing needs to consume create pressure for  natural resources and threaten the balance of nature. [passage  omitted]    Poverty is absolute but it is also relative. There is an  increasing gulf between consumption in the industrial countries  and in the developing countries. A few recently industrialized  countries here and there have managed to jump over this gulf,  mainly in Southeast Asia. The example and the actions of the  industrialized countries are putting the balance of nature to a  severe test, mainly in those developing countries where there  are unused natural resources.    Finland is one of those countries which have restricted  natural resources and where the increase in the level of  consumption because of that is based on exploiting resources  from elsewhere. This phenomenon has been especially strong in  the last few years when we have taken increasing debts from  abroad at a speed not seen before. This sort of indebtedness has  been possible only because we have been able to assure the rest  of the world of our willingness and ability to fairly quickly  stop our increasing indebtedness and start repaying our debts.  Taking care of the debts and taking part in supporting nations  which are in a much worse position than us will lead to the  situation whereby there will not be any room to increase the  level of consumption for a long time. In my view, in order to  pay the bill we need more production, not less. However, less  of that produced can be used by ourselves, not more.    The external value of the Finnish mark has now been under  the  influence of market forces and they have kept it incredibly low.  The low external value of the Finnish mark, according to my  calculations, has at least so far led to increased unemployment,  not decreased. Our export industry now has an exceptionally  good ability to compete with prices. If our export sector were  more extensive and if our exports were more largely based on a  selection of products where, from an international point of  view, we are not a considerable producer, we would have  extensive markets to utilize without any danger of large  conflicts, because we have access to markets which some  countries do not have. We have no reason to sneer at anybody on  the basis of our exceptionally good price competitiveness. We  should be able to increase our exports but without big  investments. What ability we have to invest should not in any  case be used in areas which produce little, like the  infrastructure projects which are currently unnecessary.    A better balance between the services we sell abroad and  those we buy abroad is created mainly because our ability to buy  services has weakened faster than our ability to sell them. A  lot has been invested lately in Finland in services, both in the  material sense and in the mental sense. The supply and demand  of services are endless, the question increasingly is who is  prepared to pay for them and how they can be financed.    We have become used to talk about a structural change, which  sometimes has been considered necessary; sometimes there has  been a willingness to restrain it. What is meant within the  structural change has not been defined. According to my view,  what is meant with regard to structural change is that an ever  decreasing part of the workforce should be in primary production  and that the workforce should not increase, even in goods  manufacturing, but that at an increasing level people should  carry serve one another and receive compensation which  corresponds to their education. It would have been good if the  permanent preconditions for structural changes in society had  been better assessed -- apparently the time has arrived for  assessment. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Wang Yong: "China Sets a Date To End </F> Quotas on Imports"]    [Text] China plans to phase out quota restrictions on  imports by 1997, a senior government official announced in  Beijing yesterday.    The plan is the latest in a series to bring China's foreign  trade regime in line with the standards of the General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), said the trade official who spoke  on the condition of anonymity.    About 50 import items are currently subject to quotas or  require licences, he said at the China Business Summit. Most of  them are capital goods including 18 electronic and machinery  products.    China had formerly promised it would cut the number of  products needing import licences by at least two-thirds to pave  the way for its reentry into GATT.    The pledge yesterday was another signal that the country is  intensifying its efforts to resume its contracting party status  in GATT.    China hopes to rejoin within the next two years and become a  founding member of the World Trade Body (WTO), the international  free trade organization that will replace GATT when the final  package from the Uruguay Round trade talks takes effect.    Gu Yongjiang, Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation and China's chief GATT negotiator, is to lead a  high- level government delegation to Morocco next month to sign  the Uruguay Round package.    As a full-time participant in the Uruguay talks, which  started in 1986, China has made concessions in agriculture,  services, and other sectors.    GATT demands that member nations reduce nontariff measures,  like import licences or quotas, to the lowest possible level.    The government has agreed to slowly reduce its import  restrictions during its transition from a planned to a market  economy.    If China rejoins GATT it will be allowed a transition period  to meet all the requirements.    In a related move, the trade official said the number of  export items under quota control has been reduced.    China now requires licences for 114 export products,  compared  with 235 in 1992. In other words, only 30 percent of China's  export products need licences.    And about 38 export items such as oil and cotton cloth face  quota restrictions.    The amount of these products companies could export was  decided by administrative orders until this year when an open  bidding system started.    The first bidding for 13 export items was held on March 18.    And the trade official said the government plans to allow  more companies to bid for exports.    But he said the move would "take time," noting that certain  export products like grain and oil are still under tight control.    Chinese economists have said reduction of quotas and  re-entry  into GATT will cause Chinese imports to rise.    On the one hand this will stimulate the country's foreign  trade. But on the other it will increase the pressure on Chinese  enterprises as the market will be flooded with foreign-made  goods.    Imports last year rose 29 percent to $103.9 billion. And it  is estimated that they will increase to $402 billion by 2004.    China has also promised to cut its tariffs by 40 percent in  the near future.    The country has already reduced tariffs by 19 percent since  1986 when it first applied to rejoin GATT.    The China Business Summit was organized by the Institute of  International Trade Research under the Ministry of Foreign Trade  and Singapore's Institute for International Research.</p>

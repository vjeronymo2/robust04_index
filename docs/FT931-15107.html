			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: PolyGram to expand in Japan POLYGRAM, the London-based music and entertainment company 79 per cent owned by Philips of the Netherlands, has increased its stakes in two majority-owned Japanese record companies. The move is to help it expand in Japan, the world's second-biggest music market after the US. PolyGram has acquired the remaining 35 per cent stake in Nippon Phonogram from JVC and Matsushita, taking its holding to 100 per cent. It has also increased its stake in Polydor KK to 89.6 per cent from 74.6 per cent following a purchase of shares from JVC. The remaining shares are owned by corporate shareholders, each holding a relatively small stake. The two transactions have a combined value of Fl 45m (Dollars 23m) and will take effect retroactively from October 1992. The aim is to enable PolyGram to consolidate its Japanese businesses into one new operating company, PolyGram KK. The two music companies will retain separate creative and marketing activities, but finance and administration will be done by the new Japanese operating group. Nippon Phonogram and Polydor are active in international pop and classical music, as well as in local Japanese music, an area in which PolyGram aims to expand. In 1991, PolyGram generated Fl 1.1bn in sales in Japan and south-east Asia, representing 17 per cent of group net sales.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Joerg Haider, chairman of the Freedom Party </F> of Austria; place and date not given: "The FDP Will Become  Insignificant"]    [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] West Europe's popular conservative  parties are in danger of falling apart. Is this the hour that  you have been waiting for?    [Haider] Citizens are now rejecting the forms of government  that they previously accepted as the lesser evil in view of the  communist threat. These parties are too large and too  inflexible to respond to serious change. It is no longer  possible to turn a 1950's Borgward into a racing vehicle.    [DER SPIEGEL] You are proposing a pan-European "liberation  course." What does that mean?    [Haider] In Italy, Austria, and Germany, new political  parties are being formed outside the framework of the old  parties. Our common concern is autonomy, an end to corruption,  and the strengthening of the plebiscite elements of the  rule-of-law state.    [DER SPIEGEL] A truly mixed movement extending from Le Pen  to Haider?    [Haider] Not at all.    [DER SPIEGEL] But it does include Gerhard Frey and his  German People's Union?    [Haider] What makes you think that? Mr. Frey only  acknowledges himself and would rather come to nothing than  become part of a movement.    [DER SPIEGEL] So, your man is Schoenhuber?    [Haider] People who hold extremist, reactionary ideas do not  belong in a democratic renewal movement. The Republikaner have  not gotten beyond the stage of being a protest party of the  right.    [DER SPIEGEL] This curt distinction that you have made does  not sound convincing.    [Haider] There are many Republikaner who would feel better  in another movement. There are cultured people such the  Baden-Wuerttemberg group leader Rolf Schlier, who I find to be  an interesting conversation partner. However, he will not get  any further under Schoenhuber.    [DER SPIEGEL] Where are your allies in Europe?    [Haider] I consider liberal parties to include the group  around Giscard d'Estaing in France, the Liga Norda, the  Suedtirol Liberal Party in Italy, the Radical Democratic Party  in Switzerland, and the Association of Free Citizens in Germany,  which was founded by former Bavarian FDP [Free Democratic Party]  land chairman Manfred Brunner. There are contacts with all  those groups, and cross-border activities will probably be  launched shortly.    [DER SPIEGEL] Will you support Manfred Brunner in the  European elections?    [Haider] From time to time, I feel the need to correct all  the untruths that are being spread about me in Germany. That  accords well with Manfred Brunner's initiative, and he is an  interesting fellow. In any event, this year I will be  addressing FDP local associations at their invitation.    [DER SPIEGEL] There is an FDP presidium resolution that  rules out cooperation with you. Who has invited you?    [Haider] Several courageous local associations in southern  and central Germany.    [DER SPIEGEL] How do you rate the prospects for a right-wing  populist party in Germany?    [Haider] There will probably be a grand coalition in Germany  in the short term, and only then will a new force be able to  establish itself, a liberal party that will address practical  problems, will be able to succeed without the Republikaners'  customary excessive stress on nationalist matters, and could  obtain between 15 and 20 percent of the vote.    [DER SPIEGEL] So, what room is left for the FDP?    [Haider] I expect the party to become insignificant. If it  continues to defend the system and only tries to gain as much as  possible from what exists at present, it will shortly be  superfluous.</p>

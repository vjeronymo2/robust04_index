			<p>BFN     [Text] The government, which illegally took over in Kigali  on 8 April, is said to have started deserting the capital.  Panicked by the fact that the Rwandan Patriotic Army is getting  closer to the capital, the government members reportedly headed  in unknown directions. According to reports broadcast by Radio  France International, the government clique headed for the south  of the country.    The government army's side is in flight. Some senior  officers of the death squads have already cleared off,  abandoning their men on the ground. They are Lieutenant Colonel  Bahofitse of Byumba military region, and Major (Jombye),  commander of (Ngawiro) camp in Mutara, known for having given  military training to Republican National Movement for Democracy  and Development (?armed) militias to commit the atrocities which  have just hit the country, especially in Kigali, the capital.  The fact that commanders have deserted gives a clear idea of  the nature of the fighting.</p>

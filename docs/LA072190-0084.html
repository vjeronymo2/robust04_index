			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> CITIZENS MAY DECIDE ON USE OF PARKLAND  </P> <P> The City Council will hold a special meeting Monday night to consider putting  an advisory measure about Central Park on the Nov. 6 ballot.  </P> <P> Councilman John Erskine said the council will discuss a proposal that would ask  voters how unimproved land in Central Park should be used.  </P> <P> "We'll probably have six or seven land-use choices to present to the voters,"  said Erskine, who is on a subcommittee assigned to study the parks matter.  </P> <P> Earlier this summer, Erskine proposed putting a bond issue on the Nov. 6  ballot. He said the bonds could be used to finance several major projects  needed to improve Central Park. But after discussing the subject with the six  other council members, Erskine agreed that the city first needed to get the  voters' sentiments about various park projects.  </P> <P> The proposed choices range from "grass, trees and picnic areas" to "building an  18-hole golf course," Erskine said.  </P> <P> One portion of unimproved Central Park land has already been designated by the  City Council as the site for a "youth sports complex." The council on July 2  voted to dedicate acreage at the intersection of Golden West and Talbert  streets for youth baseball and soccer fields and for a gymnasium. BILL BILLITER  </P></p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / UK backs off veto to block Dehaene from top EU job The government is refusing to threaten its national veto against the candidacy of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene for the European Commission presidency amid acknowledgment in Whitehall that it may eventually have to accept the appointment of the Belgian prime minister. But the risk of a political backlash on the Conservative back-benches could force Mr John Major to ensure that a decision on the succession to Mr Jacques Delors is postponed beyond this month's European Union summit in Corfu. Ministers insist the competition for the post is still wide open despite the endorsement of Mr Dehaene by both Germany and France. They also point out that the Belgian prime minister, an avowed supporter of a federal Europe, has not formally announced he will run. But Mr Major yesterday publicly acknowledged the risks of seeking to use Britain's national veto to block Mr Dehaene. Speaking on BBC television he recalled that the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher had vetoed the candidacy of Mr Claude Cheysson, the former French foreign minister, in 1984. The result had been the appointment of Mr Delors. Sir Leon Brittan, Mr Major's preferred candidate, and Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, have both indicated their determination to stay in the race. Among EU governments to declare their positions along with France and Germany, Spain has so far supported Mr Lubbers and Greece Sir Leon. But Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, is expected to face pressure from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to switch his backing to Mr Dehaene. British ministers believe Mr Dehaene's reputation as an advocate of a centralised European superstate has been greatly exaggerated. The Belgian prime minister is seen in Whitehall as a 'political fixer' rather than a 'European visionary' in the mould of Mr Delors. There is also a view that Mr Lubbers' well known 'Atlanticist' instincts have obscured the fact that he might prove a more powerful advocate of further European integration. But Mr Major knows that to accept the candidacy of Mr Dehaene immediately after an expected heavy Tory defeat in this week's European elections could provoke a serious rebellion on the Conservative back-benches. After his retreat earlier this year on the issue of majority voting in the Council of Ministers, some rightwing Tory MPs see the Commission presidency as a litmus test of Mr Major's credibility in Europe. So while studiously avoiding any threat of a veto, the prime minister will hope that deadlock at the Corfu summit could halt the Dehaene bandwagon and rekindle the chances of Sir Leon's eventual appointment.</p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / An instinct for the centre: Tony Blair has ensured that John Major cannot win the next general election by default You could sense from as far away as Blackpool the ministerial hand-wringing in Whitehall. Mr Tony Blair achieved something rare this week. For the first time since 1979, a Labour leader set the terms for the Tory conference. As Mr John Major contemplates his week in Bournemouth, he knows his performance will be judged against the powerful debut of his Labour opponent. Mr Blair reached out beyond his party's activists to the disaffected Tory voters who will decide the next general election. Mr Major must begin to explain why they should return to the Conservative fold. This should not be a crisis conference for the prime minister. Unusually since the sterling debacle on Black Wednesday, there is no immediate threat to his leadership. The economic recovery is real and well-balanced. For the moment, he has papered over the cracks in his party over Europe. So, fingers crossed, next week will be, as was always planned, a sedate affair: a mid-term stock-taking exercise with no grand pronouncements, no great visions. Facing an audience still badly bruised by recession and angered by rising crime rates, the message has gone out to ministers to avoid any hint of triumphalism. After his performance in Blackpool, there will be no real attempt to demolish Mr Blair. The voters are fed up with the politics of knocking; more seriously, ministers have yet to discover a credible line of attack on the Labour leader. The message Mr Major wants to repaint on his government's peeling shop front is one of quiet, gritty competence. Don't worry, it says to those disillusioned Conservatives, we will arrive before the election. The prime minister's image-makers are taking a similar tack in rebuilding his reputation with the voters. No, he is not a towering political figure in the mould of his predecessor. But look at how he gets things done. He has taken hard decisions on the economy; and they are paying off with low inflation and steady growth. He has taken risks in Northern Ireland; and there is the best hope of peace for 25 years. He has stood up for Britain against the hated bureaucrats of Brussels; and he will do again at the 1996 intergovernmental conference. The safety-first approach is understandable. Conservative Central Office has spent the past month quizzing disaffected supporters. The voters are unconvinced by the reality of economic recovery. This is an upturn in which their disposable income is falling, not rising. So are house prices. And there are more tax increases to come. The electorate shares traditional Tory values on law and order and education. But it judges the government is not delivering safety on the streets or high standards and discipline in the classroom. Nor are the voters keen on the idea that the new breed of highly-paid bureaucrats in the national health service spend more time furnishing their executive suites than improving patient care. It is no accident that Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, and Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, are among the nation's least popular politicians. All of this is perfectly clear to anyone who strays occasionally into the world of real people. But politicians only believe the obvious after they have paid huge sums to discover it from the opinion pollsters. Mr Major's theme - assuming that he has not ripped up his speech entirely in the wake of Mr Blair's appearance in Blackpool - will be security. The voters of middle England are troubled by a changing, harsh and competitive world. The middle-class life plan, the bedrock of Tory support in southern England, is threatened by the pace of technological change, by a cash-strapped welfare state and, above all, by an insecure employment market. The government's answer is the promise of a steady, sustainable recovery instead of a return to boom and bust; a deregulated economy that allows Britain to keep up with world competition; and, when Mr Kenneth Clarke judges they can be afforded, all-important tax cuts. It is an approach that most in the cabinet have signed up for. Mr Clarke still hankers for another burst of radicalism, but the consolidators have the ear of No 10 Downing Street. The one controversial announcement scheduled for next week - privatisation of the Royal Mail - has now been delayed until the Tory faithful return home. There is nothing much now that the Conservatives can do to rewrite the script for Bournemouth, though plenty of ministers will spend the weekend sharpening up their speeches to dispel any hint of complacency. But a strategy tailored to the pressures of the party conference will not be enough to counter the threat from Mr Blair. The opposition now has a leader with the authority and the intellect to take on the Con-servatives in the battle of ideas. Sure, his party still has the capacity to shoot itself in the foot (though in the 1980s it tended to aim the gun at its head). Conference defeats this week on Clause IV public ownership and defence will give ministers much-needed ammunition in Bournemouth. But Mr Blair knows where he is going: into the political centre ground. Labour is to represent the aspirant classes. For all the talk of modernism, what he is doing is reconnecting it to its traditional roots as the party of opportunity. The voters who elected Mr Clement Attlee in 1945 and Mr Harold Wilson in 1964 were won over not by dewy-eyed socialism but by the promise of a brighter future. The prime minister's view that the anxieties of middle England will be the most potent force at the next general election is shared by the Labour leader. The difference is that Mr Blair judges that the electorate's instincts have shifted back towards the centre. The individualism of the 1980s has become the insecurity of the 1990s. It was no accident that in Tuesday's speech Mr Major was not mentioned by name; nor for that matter were Mr Clarke or Mr Douglas Hurd. Mr Blair's targets were the embattled Mr Howard and Mr Michael Portillo, the standard-bearer of the Tory right. Forget Labour's leftwing past, the Tories are the extremists now, he was saying. There are flaws. It was easy to detect in the speech the tensions between his embrace for the market and the romanticism of Old Labour; easier still in the speeches of shadow cabinet colleagues. He will face serious internal battles over tax before the next general election. To watch Mr Blair up close is to understand how determined he is that New Labour will win. He has already in his back pocket a draft of the new statement of aims and values that will replace Clause IV. He is thinking ahead in a way that Mr Neil Kinnock was never allowed to and Mr John Smith never felt inclined to. Mr Major is not lost. The government might yet recreate itself as the guardian of security in a changing world. Put another dash for integration by Britain's European partners alongside Labour's plans for devolution in Scotland and Wales and you can see the possibility of a campaign built around defence of the (British) Union. But one thing is clear: 1992 was the last election the Conservatives will win by default.</p>

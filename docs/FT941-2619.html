			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Springtime stirs few signs of life in Paris - Prospects remain positive Paris in the springtime, at least as far as the bourse is concerned, is showing few signs of life. The chill of February's sharp falls lingers, and the principal indices remain below their start of year levels, in spite of occasional spurts of activity over the past few weeks. After Friday's 1 per cent fall, brought on mainly by worries of a further tightening of US monetary policy, the CAC-40 index of leading shares closed at 2,221.34, some 2 per cent below its level at the beginning of January, and well adrift of the year's high of 2,355.93 set at the start of February. The SBF120 index, a broader indicator launched last December and which incorporates the CAC-40, has followed a similar trail. For investors and the government, which is in the midst of an ambitious privatisation programme, such uncertain progress presents a series of questions. In particular, can the market regain last year's energy - in which the CAC-40 gained 22 per cent - or does it face a protracted period of fragility? Most market analysts say prospects remain positive, although little progress is expected in the short term. 'The market will probably move sideways for some months and we may not have tested the lows,' says Mr Didier Cherpitel, managing director of J. P. Morgan in Paris. But he believes the CAC-40 will revive and attain a level of about 2,600 by the year end. The current drift is the result of several factors. As elsewhere the bourse is suffering from the rise in yields in international bond markets and dampened hopes about the pace of interest rate cuts. In France, such sentiments have been compounded by the cautious stance of the newly independent Bank of France which, anxious to establish its anti-inflationary credentials, has moved gingerly in cutting borrowing costs. The intervention rate, the floor for money market rates, stands at 6.1 per cent, just 0.1 percentage points below its level at the beginning of the year. 'Six months ago we were forecasting short-term rates of 4 per cent by the end of the year, but that seems rather optimistic now,' said one merchant banker. A second, equally important factor is to be found in the burden of demands on the bourse. Issues of shares and convertible bonds have totalled FFr23.7bn so far this year, as a procession of companies from Paribas to Peugeot have tapped the market. The figure, which compares with FFr50.2bn for the whole of last year, is more than doubled if one includes the privatisation of Elf Aquitaine, the country's largest industrial company. 'We expected a large number of share issues this year,' says Mr David Harrington, French market analyst at James Capel in Paris, 'but the volume in the first few months has been surprising.' The privatisation programme and private capital raising is set to continue. Unions des Assurances de Paris and AGF, a rival insurance group, are next to step up to the privatisation auction block within the next few months. But with the sale of Elf out of the way, the biggest single share issue ever launched on the market, the flood of equity is likely to ease. 'We are not going to see the level of issues sustained through the rest of the year,' says one analyst. 'The government is well on its way to its target of privatisation receipts and is likely to call a halt after UAP and AGF.' If that provides one reason to predict the emergence of a more buoyant market, a second is given by the revival of the economy and a shift of investor's focus to earnings performance. 'We are in a transition period at the moment,' says Mr Harrington. 'The markets have been driven essentially by interest rates over the past 18 months, but now attention is shifting to growth and earnings.' With respect to growth, most forecasts are heading upwards. Insee, the national statistics office, last week raised its forecast for first half GDP growth from 0.5 per cent to 0.7 per cent. Many private sector economists have upgraded annual growth forecasts from below 1 per cent to nearer the government's estimate of 1.4 per cent. Although most economists believe the official target is optimistic, they point to encouraging signs in economic activity, particularly in the consumer sector. The brighter macroeconomic picture is dispersing some of the shadows at the corporate level. A string of companies, ranging from Lafarge Coppee, the building materials group, to LVMH, the luxury goods company and Carrefour, the food retailer, have announced improved profits and prospects over the past few weeks. Those companies with strong overseas sales or exposure to the consumer sector are painting the most optimistic scenarios. Mr Bernard Arnault, LVMH chairman, last week forecast profits growth in excess of 20 per cent this year. The shares jumped correspondingly, gaining just under 5 per cent. In many cases, however, there remains a strong sense of caution. 'Our optimism is very relative,' says Mr Rene-Yves Nanot, chairman of Ciments Francais, announcing halved losses for 1993 of FFr685m last week. 'Things are clearly better,' says the finance director of one manufacturing group, 'but I do not think we will see a powerful rebound just yet.' Neither it seems, will the Paris bourse.</p>

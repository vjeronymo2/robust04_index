			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Friction with UN fails to deter French: Despite the 'waltz of the generals' Paris is determined to keep troops in Bosnia France still considers that pulling its blue helmet troops out of Bosnia would be 'catastrophic' because the war might spread, but it regards the prospect of retreat as no longer unthinkable, a senior official said yesterday. The deepening gloom in Paris, which led Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign minister, yesterday to call urgent consultations between the European Union, the US and Russia, is the result of the failure of the Geneva negotiations to produce any diplomatic breakthrough, of intensification of the war with the beleaguered Moslems now fighting back and causing French casualties in the process, and of command difficulties with the United Nations. President Francois Mitterrand is shortly expected to propose to Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, UN secretary general, that General Bertrand de Lapresle, commander of France's rapid reaction force, should succeed General Jean Cot as the head of the United Nations Protection Force in the former Yugoslavia. Gen Cot ran foul of Mr Boutros-Ghali for publicly criticising the UN chief for hamstringing his operation, and his departure by March 31 is being reluctantly accepted by Paris. Apart from General Cot's somewhat choleric reputation even inside the French military - which contrasted with the more imperturbable temperament of his predecessor, General Philippe Morillon - French officials see more general reasons for the chronic friction between commanders on the spot and UN headquarters in New York. The military commanders 'not only have no real political power behind them, but also do not have the proper means to carry out a mission which the politicians keep increasing'. Last summer, the UN gave them the task of creating 'safe havens' for Moslem refugees, last autumn the European Union came up with the idea of creating a 'humanitarian corridor' into Bosnia from the sea. France's chief military frustration with the UN has been over the procedure for authorising possible air strikes to enforce UN resolutions. At the outset it was agreed that initial authorisation had to come from the UN secretary general, while authority for subsequent air strikes could come from the Unprofor commander. But the air threat has been regarded as bluff by the warring parties, who know well Mr Boutros-Ghali's reluctance to order bombing raids. In two separate ways, French commanders have tried - and failed - to make the threat more credible. General Cot asked the UN to delegate to him the power to generally initiate air strikes on forces directly attacking the UN military troops, buildings or convoys. Mr Boutros-Ghali refused, but the French government did not make a fuss, choosing to treat it as an issue between the UN chief and his local commander. After this month's Nato summit threat to use possible air power to force the opening of the Tuzla airfield in northern Bosnia, France made a proposal which it thought would salve the UN secretary general's worry about giving carte blanche to a general. It suggested that, in the precise case of Tuzla, Mr Boutros-Ghali should delegate to his Japanese deputy in Bosnia, Mr Yasushi Akashi, the right to order an air strike. Again, Mr Boutros-Ghali refused. His failure to trust even his own deputy has angered Paris. The growing French view is that the UN in New York is not up to its job. 'Not only do they have too many UN troops to worry about - 24,000 around the world - but they have a culture which is capable of managing static situations like Cyprus, but not fast-moving conflicts like Bosnia or Somalia,' an official said yesterday. Friction with the UN is, however, something which France appears willing to live with, even if it causes what is being dubbed in Paris 'the waltz of the generals' in and out of Bosnia. In the end, it will be the warring parties' behaviour in Geneva and on the battlefield that will determine whether the French stay. Among their partners in ex-Yugoslavia, Paris is aware of the growing inclination of Britain and Spain to pull their men out. 'Any departure will have to be co-ordinated,' said an official yesterday, adding: 'We don't want another Dunkirk.'</p>

The retail price of  bread has been fixed at 1.50 dram, or 300 rubles, per kilo;  flour at 1.21 dram, or 250 rubles, per kilo. The rate for  electricity has been fixed at .20 dram, or 40 rubles per  kilowatt-hour. Inter-city passenger transportation on buses,  trolleys, and trams has been fixed at .50 dram, or 100 rubles,  per person.    The cost of basic services--such as rent, water, garbage  collection, and telephone service--have also been increased by  an average of two-and-a-half times more than their previous cost.    Detailed information will be published in the press.</p>

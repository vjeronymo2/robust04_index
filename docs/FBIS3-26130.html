Public attitudes ranging from commodity prices and the image  of public servants to environmental pollution and housing reform  are what a small research agency in south China's boomtown of  Guangzhou has been finding out since 1990.    Once or twice every month, local media devote time and space  to publish the findings on matters of social focus.    The feedback prompts the municipal government to adopt  measures to solve the problems that affect the life of local  residents.    Last year a survey found that 70 percent of Guangzhou people  are dissatisfied with the jammed traffic conditions. The  relevant departments took immediate action to ban bicycle  traffic on 11 major roads.    A follow-up telephone survey, however, revealed that 55  percent of the people were against the new policy. Then the  city solicited ideas from the public and came up with a plan  that worked.    Xu Yucong, an employee at the Guangzhou public opinion  research center, which conducted these surveys, said that the  center aims to reflect the concerns of people and serves to jog  the minds of policy makers. "In this way, we can draw more  attention from the leaders whose policies can help harmonize the  multi-faceted relationships in society."    To date, the center has conducted over 60 surveys, involving  more than 1.4 million residents.    Xu said some of the findings touched on sensitive issues.  But the municipal government backed their endeavors and  considered the practice a main channel of communication of the  Communist Party and government organizations with the general  public.    Xu said the center is able to keep itself objective and  unbiased by maintaining total financial independence.    Although the Gallup methods have not spread to other parts  of  the country in finding out public opinion, major cities such as  Shanghai, Tianjin and the capital Beijing do have "mayor's hot  lines" that citizens can dial at any time to voice their  grievances and proposals.</p>

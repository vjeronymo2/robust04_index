			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Third world development 'at risk' CIVIL WAR and the spread of Aids in many third world countries must be reduced if improvements in economic development are not to be reversed, according to a western government study published yesterday. 'We are very concerned that unless conflicts like that in Somalia are put to rest, (western) governments will have to devote a larger proportion of their official development assistance to emergency needs,' Mr Alexander Love, chairman of the 20-country Development Assistance Committee (DAC), said. He welcomed current discussions in the United Nations about the possibility of using military means to get food and medicine into Somalia. Following the annual meeting in Paris of the 20 donor members of the DAC, Mr Love also expressed worries that recent real increases in western official aid, running at an average 1.7 per cent over the past five years, would tail off under the pressure of domestic budgetary constraints and new needs in eastern Europe. Aid from Arab countries had declined since the Gulf war, while the ex-Soviet Union had turned from a net aid donor to recipient. Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan have become recipients.</p>

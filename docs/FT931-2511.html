			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Jobless fall baffles Whitehall: Drop in unemployment may signal recovery ECONOMISTS and statis-ticians struggled yesterday to explain last month's sharp drop in unemployment. One baffled official confessed the figures were checked twice, such was the surprise at the Department of Employment. Most analysts said it was too early to judge whether the seasonally adjusted fall of 22,000 represented a turnaround or whether it was a statistical quirk. However, the official figures highlighted encouraging trends. The Department of Employment said the February fall was driven by a drop in the number of people registering for unemployment benefit. About 370,000 people joined the claimant count last month, 19,500 fewer than in the same month last year. Outflows from the count were 391,200, over 33,000 more than in February last year. Some of the outflows would have left the count to join government employment schemes. The number of people involved in Employment Training, for example, rose 5,000 in February compared with January. There was no regional explanation for the reduction in unemployment. The good news was spread fairly evenly across the country with the jobless total falling in all regions except Greater London, northern England and Northern Ireland. Unemployment in the south-east, one of the regions worst hit by the recession, fell by a seasonally-adjusted 5,700 in February compared with January. But in Greater London it rose 800 on the month. In the north the number of people out of work and claiming benefit rose by 600 and in Northern Ireland by 200. Some regions experienced their first drop in unemployment for three years, noticeably East Anglia where it fell by 1,200 and the west Midlands where it dropped 2,400. East Anglia and the south-west had the biggest percentage falls in unemployment. February's sharp overall drop has left in question the trend growth rate in unemployment. February's fall cut sharply the underlying rate of increase as measured by the three-month on three-month comparison. In the three months to the end of February the jobless total rose by 19,500 compared with 41,800 in the three months to the end of January. February's fall was consistent with a sharp pick-up in vacancies at Jobcentres, about a third of all vacancies in the economy. These rose by a seasonally adjusted 17,600 in February after falling by 4,400 in January, although the department warned that the figures were subject to revision because of software problems. Economists also pointed to a slowdown in the rate at which the level of overall employment is falling. The workforce in employment dropped 85,000 in the fourth quarter to 24.9bn, the smallest fall since the first quarter of last year. In manufacturing the number of people employed was estimated to have fallen by 13,000 in January to 4.2bn. This was the smallest fall since May last year. In the service industries the number of individuals in employment rose by 51,000 in the fourth quarter after falling 254,000 in the third quarter. The number of hours worked over time also pointed towards a pick-up in activity. In January there were 9.45m overtime hours worked compared with 8.31m in December. The Department of Employment issued the results of its quarterly labour force survey yesterday. This measures unemployment through a household survey rather than by simply adding up the number of people claiming unemployment benefit. It showed that in the three months to the end of November, unemployment was 2.8m. This was 66,000 more than the average monthly number of unemployed recorded by the claimant count.</p>

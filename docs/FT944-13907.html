			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Life groups may face Pounds 2bn bill on pensions Life insurers must review hundreds of thousands of personal pensions sold since 1988 and compensate those investors who were wrongly advised to buy them, the Securities and Investments Board said yesterday. Estimates of the potential bill for compensation are now put at up to Pounds 2bn by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountants. The SIB announcement came after a detailed study of the scale of poor advice in selling personal pensions. It concluded that this was far greater than had been thought. 'It is now clear that too many personal pensions were improperly sold in the past,' said Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman. The SIB, the City's chief regulator, has told life companies and independent advisers to review the cases of at least 350,000 customers - those most likely to have been damaged by bad advice - before the end of 1996. Most life companies, including Prudential, the largest, reserved judgment on the report. Some welcomed it, including Pearl Assurance and Bradford and Bingley Building Society, the largest organisation to offer independent advice. Legal &amp; General, one of the UK's largest life insurers, voiced dissent. Mr David Prosser, chief executive, said the SIB had put too great a burden on the life industry. The Consumers' Association condemned the SIB report as 'wholly unacceptable' because many people who did not join occupational schemes would not have their cases reviewed. Since 1988, some 600,000 personal pensions have been sold to people transferring lump sums from occupational schemes. Separately, a survey for the SIB by actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow has also estimated that in some 850,000 cases, people were advised to opt out of employers' schemes or not to join. Mr Large said the SIB's programme was intended to minimise the need for investors to go to court to get compensation. It was keen to ensure that the greatest number of cases where people had suffered were remedied in the shortest time possible.

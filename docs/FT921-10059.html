			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Letter: Muddled thinking that hits N Ireland economy Sir, The media inevitably focuses on the cycle of terrorism in Northern Ireland and this obscures the province's long-term economic predicament. Chronic large-scale unemployment cannot but aggravate the troubles. In this context the question as to who will became the next chief executive of the Industrial Development Board (IDB) in Northern Ireland is of particular importance. This appointment is especially significant since the current rethink of government economic policy is heavily reliant on the operational competence of the agency. Independent academic research has demonstrated the IDB's undistinguished record in the past and failure to address the roots of Northern Ireland's lack of competitiveness. For example, job creation has substantially lagged behind that in other UK regions (the troubles cannot be used to excuse all of this difference) and the Irish Republic. Unemployment is forecast to remain at about 15 per cent well into the next century. Inward investment projects have experienced relatively high rates of closure (despite assistance traceable, in some cases, to the year of closure). The productivity of the manufacturing sector remains low. Northern Ireland's economic weaknesses derive in part from too much reliance on people whose training and experience is too narrow. This is reflected in the muddled way in which the IDB, and parts of the Northern Ireland civil service, are attempting to put their strategy into operation. The root weakness is longstanding poor productivity and very likely what is required is a shock which will project manufacturing on to a higher growth path. Not only is this unlikely to be delivered by those who have presided over failed policies, it is also doubtful if the required knowledge and ability exists in the province. Above all, new ideas are needed and a very generous remuneration should be offered in order to attract a widely experienced industrialist to the IDB post. Mr Peter Brooke, the Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Richard Needham, Northern Ireland Office minister, should therefore cast their net very widely.

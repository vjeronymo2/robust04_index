			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Water price warning over 'green' costs WATER bills could double in real terms by the year 2005 because of the cost of meeting environmental regulations, Ofwat, the water industry watchdog, warned yesterday. Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat's director-general, said: 'Improvements in the quality of water are beneficial but they cost money - which some customers can ill-afford.' He drew a sharp response from water companies by pointing out that customers would be shielded from some of the costs if the companies and shareholders assumed part of the burden. In an assessment of the water industry, Ofwat estimates that water companies will have to spend from Pounds 28bn to Pounds 43bn between 1995 and 2005 to improve drinking water and clean up beaches and sewage discharges. Mr Byatt wants the report to start a debate between water companies, customers and regulators about the desired level of water quality. He was 'delighted' that questions were being asked about whether some standards were unnecessarily high. The average water and sewerage bill is Pounds 170 a year, according to Ofwat's report. By the end of the century the average bill could be between Pounds 215 and Pounds 255, without taking account of inflation, and higher still by 2005. Mr Byatt said that if the companies became more efficient and accepted a lower return on capital than at present, that could cut between Pounds 20 and Pounds 30 a year off bills. The Water Services Association, representing the public companies, said that the companies needed the present rate of return on capital to finance investment. The range of projections by Ofwat shows the difference between the minimum spending needed to meet regulations, and the level demanded by a tighter 'pure and green' interpretation of the rules. Estimates of spending are much higher than those made three years ago, when the 10 large companies were privatised, because of subsequent EC environmental rules. The main increase is caused by the EC's urban waste water treatment directive, where estimated costs have risen from Pounds 2bn in 1990 to around Pounds 10bn. Mr Byatt emphasised that the government still had considerable scope for interpreting the rules. Mr Mike Carney, secretary of the Water Services Association, said: 'Mr Byatt's estimates are in the same ball park as ours, but his figures for installing meters look low, and there may be further costs from meeting national statutory regulations'.

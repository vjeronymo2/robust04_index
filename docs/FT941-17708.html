			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Modest growth in accounting is forecast British accountancy firms can expect their performance to increase only very modestly over the coming year, according to a briefing paper from the economics department of Barclays Bank released yesterday. Growing competition and a stagnant market make the prospects 'unpromising' for both larger and smaller firms, the briefing warns. It estimates that the work performed by accountants declined in 1992 and 1993 back to the level of 1990. It forecasts the profession will only see growth of 2 per cent in 1994. It highlights the fact that just four of the top 20 firms increased fee income in 1992-93, with audit, tax and consultancy work suffering most. Fee income and profit margins declined as a result of excess capacity and the growing trend of clients to put work out to tender. Small and medium-sized firms suffered disproportionately because they are more dependent on audit and tax work and do not have much income from insolvency. They have also lost market share during the recession to the larger firms. The briefing argues that most smaller firms have also been unable to adjust their costs in line with declining fees because any fall in staffing would damage quality. It warns that prospects of growth are low because clients' expectations are now firmly geared to competitively-priced audit services for the first time. In addition, it says that the larger firms are intent on undercutting their rivals in an attempt to gain a footing to supply other high margin services. Insolvency work is likely to tail off in line with the recent decline in the number of receiverships, and there is the prospect for only a modest revival in consultancy work during the year.

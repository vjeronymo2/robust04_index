			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Australia counts rain cost The Australian wheat industry held an emergency conference yesterday as its farmers waited to see how badly rain had damaged their crop, originally valued at ADollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.13bn), Reuter reports from Canberra. Industry officials said they would now have to find a way to dispose of at least 3m tonnes of weather-damaged wheat. The wheat's value may have been cut by a third, erasing farmers' profit margins.</p>

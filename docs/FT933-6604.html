			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US sugar cut to cost Caribbeans Dollars 19m CARIBBEAN SUGAR exporters to the US will earn about USDollars 19m less from deliveries made in the 1993-1994 period, following a reduction in import quotas by the US government. Industry officials in the region say its cumulative quota for the delivery period, staring in October, is 16 per cent less, in line with an overall reduction in imports by the US government. The region's quota will be 225,508 tonnes, with the Dominican Republic, the region's largest quota holder, supplying about three quarters. The country will earn about Dollars 14.5m less because of the quota reduction, the officials say. Other suppliers in the region are Barbados, Belize, Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago. The US pays quota holders about 20 cents a lb, and the quotas are periodically reviewed by the US Department of Agriculture to determine what quantity of imports are needed to supplement domestic production. US import quotas have been progressively reduced over the past decade, cutting the earnings of regional producers. The Caribbean industry relies on preferential markets such as those in the US and Europe, because world market prices are lower than the cost of production in the region's inefficient sugar sector. In its latest annual report, the Caribbean Development Bank, based in Barbados, said that quota reductions by the US meant that the region was selling increased quantities of sugar on the world market 'at prices which are substantially below the preferential prices for sales to Europe and the United States'.</p>

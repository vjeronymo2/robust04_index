			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Brazil-Bolivia pipeline block - A look at stalled negotiations for a Dollars 1.8bn natural gas project To the president of Bolivia, Mr Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, it seems simple. His country has a huge surplus of natural gas, while its neighbour, Brazil, has an impending energy shortage. Pumping cheap gas to Brazil's industrial south should therefore make everybody happy. But, as Mr Sanchez de Lozada has discovered during negotiations in Brazil this week, contracts involving natural resources and sovereignty over infrastructure are rarely straightforward. Although both sides agree that the Dollars 1.8bn pipeline will eventually go ahead, arguments about shareholdings in the project and the volumes to be pumped threaten to delay the venture further. 'The project is of the highest importance to Bolivia but no bank is going to finance it unless they can see the pricing and volumes are right. This is not a question of brinksmanship or who wins,' he says. Brazil and Bolivia have long talked of building a gas pipeline but negotiations only began in earnest in 1991, when a Brazilian study concluded that gas was more efficient and environmentally sound than other energy sources, and could reduce oil imports by at least 100,000 barrels a day. As such, it seemed to offer a solution to Brazil's looming energy shortage. About 95 per cent of the country's electricity comes from hydroelectric power stations. But these take up to 10 years to build and the government's economic problems have halted construction at many stations. 'If the country grows at 4 per cent a year - not fast for Brazil - in three years we will reach capacity. Gas would be an alternative for this 'black hole' between the finishing of the halted plants and opening of new ones,' says Mr Eugenio Mancini Scheleder at Brazil's mines and energy ministry. The two countries agreed in February last year to build a 3,400km pipeline between Santa Cruz in Bolivia and Brazil's industrial capital Sao Paulo. Brazil was to begin by buying 8m cu m of gas daily, rising to 16m cu m within seven years. Then the problems started, first over pricing. Brazil said the cost to its consumers of imported gas had to compete with subsidised electricity prices, thereby undermining Bolivia's profit margin. Petrobras, Brazil's oil and gas monopoly, took a particularly aggressive stance in the negotiations, arguing that Bolivia, one of Latin America's poorest countries, badly needed the project to earn foreign exchange and that Brazil was Bolivia's only potential customer on the continent. The biggest row, which President Sanchez de Lozada and Brazil's President Itamar Franco have been trying to defuse this week, is over shareholdings. Brazil's constitution assures Petrobras a monopoly over the production and import of oil and natural gas in Brazil. Petrobras believes this means it should hold 51 per cent of the shares in the Brazilian portion of the pipeline, easily the largest section. Meanwhile, both sides have agreed that they will take small, symbolic stakes in each other's pipeline. In what might have been a bid to head off further debate over shareholdings, Petrobras announced at the weekend that it would work with BTB, a joint venture between BHP, Tenneco and British Gas, on the project, with BTB holding a significant but as yet undefined shareholding. However, President Sanchez de Lozada this week arrived in Brazil saying Bolivia wanted a 49 per cent stake in the pipeline, instead of the 4 per cent Petrobras allegedly offered. 'We have the gas, they have the market. It should be parity,' he says. Bolivia seems to have raised its shareholding demand as a negotiating tactic to persuade Brazil to increase the volumes of gas it will buy. Bolivia needs the extra money to develop its gas fields and reserves. Negotiations about the shareholdings were continuing yesterday, the closing date for the original contract, at presidential level. A compromise is likely, even if the sides only agree at this stage to delay a decision but extend the contract. 'The pipeline is too good for too many people for either side to walk away,' according to a member of BTB. But the arguments have highlighted how much work still needs to be done before construction can begin. Under the original contract, financing was meant to be in place by now. But discussions with banks and international agencies has so far been preliminary because of delays and confusion over the project's structure. Detailed feasibility studies and market testing have not yet started, even though Brazil wants to begin construction in the third quarter of next year. To do so, financing needs to be in place by the middle of next year: a target which is described as 'aggressive if not impossible' by another BTB member. Brazil says the main part of the project needs investment of Dollars 1.4bn, of which Dollars 600m will be in equity and Dollars 800m in debt finance. Raising that much money should not be difficult, given the project's environmental advantages and importance to Bolivia. But the wrangling is unhelpful, particularly after the World Bank hinted it was unhappy lending to a project where the state-owned - and autocratic - Petrobras was a majority shareholder.</p>

			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> HOUSE OVERRIDES VETO OF BILL LIFTING HATCH ACT POLITICS BAN  </P> <P> House voted today to override President Bush's veto of a bill that would lift a  50-year-old ban on partisan political activity by federal employees.  </P> <P> The House re-passed the bill on a 327-93 vote and sent it to the Senate where  supporters also were trying to muster the two-thirds vote necessary to override  the President's veto.  </P> <P> The Senate, which originally passed the bill on a 67-30 vote, was scheduled to  take up the veto Thursday.  </P> <P> The bill would allow 3 million federal workers to take part in nearly all  political activities, except running for public office on a partisan ticket.  </P> <P> Bush's disapproval of the Hatch Act bill was his 12th veto and Congress so far  has been unable to override any of them. A 13th veto is expected shortly when  he sends back the recently passed family medical leave bill.  </P></p>

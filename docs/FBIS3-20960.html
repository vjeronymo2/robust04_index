The group's agents and  distributors have posted sales totaling 50 million francs for  1993. Euclid, the CAD/CAM [computer-aided design and  manufacturing] software, is already being used by over 200  customers, including CAST (an aerospace firm in the PRC), Ssang  Yong Motors (an automotive firm in Korea), Siam Cement (the  largest industrial group in Thailand), the HCG (ceramics in  Taiwan), Ching Sum (a mold manufacturer in Hong Kong), First  Automobile Works (an automotive firm in the PRC), and, more  recently, Singapore Polytechnics. The company's success is due  to proximity, local support, appropriate training, and personal  attention. A training center for training and support was opened  in Beijing in 1992, an office will open there before the end of  the year, and Euclid has been translated into Chinese and Korean.</p>

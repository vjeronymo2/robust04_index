			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: What to look for in an insurer A number of factors are taken into account in the calculation of car insurance premiums, including the type of business the underwriting company wants to attract. But while motorists cannot change their age, place of residence or occupation, or even build a garage, simply to satisfy an insurance company, there are ways to cut insurance costs. Restrict the cover to named drivers, particularly if only you and your spouse drive the car - this can cut costs by more than a third. Fit a security system. But make sure the system you pick is approved by insurers before it is installed. Agree to a larger voluntary excess. Paying the first Pounds 100, Pounds 500 or more of every claim could reduce premiums considerably. Settle for third party, fire and theft rather than a comprehensive policy if you have a low-value car. If you are a member of a union, or other professional or voluntary organisation, or work for a large company, ask whether it has a group discount scheme with a particular insurer. Special deals can be found for many categories of driver. Different insurers offer lower rates or tailor-made policies for women, the over 50s, public sector employees, or drivers with a low annual mileage. Cars more than 10 years old could be insured under a 'classic car' policy, which is often cheaper but usually involves mileage limits. If you have more than one car, some insurers will offer discounts when you insure them all together, on the basis that you can only drive one car at a time. Motor insurance is sold in so many ways that drivers can find it difficult to know where to look. Should they start by telephoning a direct insurer or a centralised broker, or make their first port of call the traditional high-street broker? Wood says: 'Direct insurers pile it high and sell it cheap. But consumers should look at the excesses; look at what is covered and not covered; and ask a serious number of questions. Of course you should get a quotation from a direct writer, but you should also ring an insurance broker.' Price is not the only consideration, says Wood. 'If you have a claim, you have an advocate with the insurance company if you have a broker. If you are with a direct insurer you have to negotiate with the company by yourself.'</p>

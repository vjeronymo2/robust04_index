			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Amoco begins drilling for Silesian coal bed methane Amoco, the US oil and gas company, has begun exploratory drilling for coal bed methane gas in Poland's Silesian region, where reserves are estimated at between 400bn and 600bn cubic metres. Success would enable Poland to cut its dependence on Russian natural gas imports and boost the share of gas in overall energy consumption from a present low of 8 per cent. Amoco won its concession on a 500 sq km plot in the summer of last year but delayed drilling until Poland agreed in August to extend tax breaks allowing the company to recoup initial costs with future profits. The company says it will invest between Dollars 150m and Dollars 200m on developing the gas if the exploration is successful. Mr Michal Wilczynski, a deputy minister responsible for energy resources, is confident that the present exploration effort will produce 5bn cu m of coal bed methane a year by the turn of the century. Poland at present consumes about 12bn cu m of natural gas a year, of which half is imported from Russia. Metanel, a Polish company controlled by Elektrim, a listed energy and telecommunications equipment company, began exploration work in the same region last summer in a programme covering seven wells at a cost of 120bn zlotys (USDollars 5m). Amoco has promised to drill 15 wells at a cost of Dollars 10m over three years. Ten per cent of the cost of the programme is being financed by the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private sector affiliate.</p>

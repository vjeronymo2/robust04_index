			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kazimierz Groblewski: "How Many Candidates for </F> President?"]    [Excerpts] There will be many candidates in the 1995  presidential election campaign. Today, it seems, there are slim  chances for the parties or political groups to agree on and  support joint candidates. RZECZPOSPOLITA reporters have asked  politicians from the PSL [Polish Peasant Party], UD [Democratic  Union], the PC [Center Accord], and UP [Union of Labor] whether,  in their opinion, it would be possible for the parties to change  their minds in that regard, and if the possibility exists, as  the election draws closer, for eventually having two major  candidates, one from the right and one from the left.    Some of the political parties are faced with a difficult  decision. For UD, it is whether to put forward Tadeusz  Mazowiecki, Jacek Kuron, or Hanna Suchocka as its candidate. The  PSL has to make a choice between Waldemar Pawlak and Jozef Zych.  The ZChN/PC/PL [Christian-National Union/Center Accord/Peasant  Accord] coalition is considering nominating Wieslaw Chrzanowski  [ZChN chairman] or Adam Strzembosz [president of the Supreme  Court]. These dilemmas may become more obvious closer to the  election.    The SLD [Democratic Left Alliance] candidate will be  Aleksander Kwasniewski. UP is looking for a person not  affiliated with any party and also prefers a woman; perhaps it  will be Ewa Letowska [a former ombudsman]. Other political  parties also have their candidates. It is not yet known whether  President Walesa will seek reelection, although many observers  of the political scene maintain "he has made up his mind to  run." [passage omitted]    Would it be possible, despite everything, to have in the  presidential election two serious candidates--a candidate of the  right and a candidate of the left? [The following are responses  to this question.]  <H5>  Janusz Piechocinski (PSL) </H5>   I do not see this as a possible outcome. The presidential  election plays a significant role in building and popularizing  the political parties. [passage omitted] I think that there will  be many candidates in the first round of the election. Every  important party will see a chance for itself to have its own  presidential candidate. At this point, the interests of the  right or the left blocs differ from those of the political  parties. The access to the media, the possibility to introduce  the party's program--these are opportunities that are too  attractive not to take advantage of. I think no division into  Solidarity and non-Solidarity candidates will be taking place.  It is rather unthinkable for UD to have a candidate together  with the right.  <H5>  Andrzej Celinski (UD) </H5>   A lot depends on the constitutional provisions in this area.  If the president is going to be elected by the parliament,  neither Walesa nor Kwasniewski will run, in my opinion. If the  president is to be elected in a popular election, two strong  candidates are a likely possibility. In my view, there is a  strong possibility that post-Solidarity parties will back the  same candidate. Then it would be Walesa. I cannot exclude the  possibility of a third candidate--not a party candidate but,  rather, a person of great authority in society. Here we can  learn something from the number of votes Professor Religa gained  in the Senate election [a famous cardiologist who received  503,304 votes]. Obviously, at this point in the discussion,  every party talks about its own candidate.  <H5>  Jaroslaw Kaczynski (PC) </H5>   I think this is rather difficult but not impossible. This is  the only way if we want to win and not allow the left to win. It  would have to be a person who is able to gain the support of the  strongly anticommunist electorate as well as that part of the  electorate that holds moderate views. In the second round of the  election, this person will have to be able to get a substantial  number of votes from the rural electorate. I do not see such a  person in the political parties. I do not think Walesa could be  such a person. From the PC's point of view, this is out of the  question. I am convinced that he [Walesa] would be defeated.  [passage omitted]  <H5>  Ryszard Bugaj (UP) </H5>   I do not see this as a possibility. I think there will be  many candidates. The choice in the election between two  candidates--as I understand it, they would be Walesa and  Kwasniewski--would be destructive, and I am convinced that, in  spite of everything, this will not happen. Our [UP] candidate  will be a nonparty individual, possibly put forward together  with other parties.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by "Noyan Tapan": "Authorities Say No"] </F>   [Text] Executive authorities of the city of Baku have  rejected a request by the parties Yurddash, Boz Gurd, and  Movement for the Liberation of Karabakh to sanction the conduct  of a demonstration 26 March in Azadlyg Square.    "I feel that the organizers of the demonstration want to  stir  up a great hullabaloo around our ban. But you must not forget  that the situation in the capital is uneasy. People are  disturbed by a multitude of problems and are on their guard.  Conducting this demonstration right now could destabilize the  situation still more"--the city head of executive authority  stated.</p>

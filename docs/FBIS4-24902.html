			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Reference News" by Chien Yen (4675 0088): "CPC Develops </F> Laser and Neutron Weapons"]    [Text] Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of the CPC Central  Military Commission, and Li Jijun of the General Office of the  Central Military Commission inspected a project testing and  producing laser and neutron weapons in Sichuan's Yaan area.  While meeting military and research personnel at the testing  ground, Li Jijun said that we were now in a leading position in  the world in the development of laser and neutron weapons, and  such weapons would produce powerful effects in wars against  hegemonist aggression and Taiwan independence. Once used in  military operations, the effects would match the electronic  warfare in the Gulf several years ago. Reportedly, some laser  weapons have been installed in combat aircraft and missile  gunboats.</p>

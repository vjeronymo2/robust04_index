			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xiao Wang: "Forums Set To Drum Up Investment"] </F>   [Text] In the next few months China is to launch a series  of high-profile trade forums overseas to attract investment  worldwide.    These forums, mostly organized by the Ministry of Foreign  Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec), are the Chinese  Government's latest response to foreign investors gripped by  "China mania." Late this month, Moftec will orchestrate a  massive trade delegation that will visit Hong Kong to promote  investment.    The promotional trip will be the first to Hong Kong  organized  by Moftec.    But officials declined to give details about the Hong Kong  forum.    Local analysts said the trade forum takes on added  significance as it follows the issuance of HK$3 billion (US$380  million) in Hong Kong bank notes by the Bank of China.    From June 1 to 9, Moftec Vice-Minister Gu Yongjiang will  head  another big delegation to Australia to promote trade and  investment. The delegation, of around 200 people from 20  provinces and cities, will leave on May 30 and return on June 11.    "More than 500 Chinese projects (seeking Australian  investment) will be announced in Melbourne from June 1-3 and  Sidney from June 7- 9," said an official with the foreign  investment administration of Moftec.    Of the projects, 53 involve infrastructure; 428 are in  manufacturing; 18 in agriculture, forestry and husbandry; 17 in  services; three in science; and one in research.    Australia hopes to be further integrated into the  Asia-Pacific region.    Through last year, Australia had pledged some $1.3 billion  to  1,310 projects in China. The actual input was $338 million.    This makes Australia one of the top 10 overseas investors in  China. During the Australian visit, the China National  Technical Import and Export Corp and the China National  Machinery Import and Export Corp will seek to facilitate imports  and exports, Moftec officials said.    From late May to early June, Moftec Minister Wu Yi will lead  a delegation to Japan to discuss bilateral trade and investment  opportunities.    Besides attending a meeting with the Japanese Ministry of  International Trade and Industry, Wu will attend a conference in  the capacity of Chairperson of the China-Japan Investment  Promotion Committee.    Wu's visit comes at a time when more Japanese companies,  such  as NEC, Mitsubishi and C. Itoh, are seeking more business with  China.    Last year alone China approved 3,488 projects involving  $2.96  billion worth of pledged Japanese investment. The actual input  was $1.32 billion.    By 1993 Japan's total promised investment in China was $8.86  billion in 7,182 projects. The actual input was $5.17 billion.    Moftec will also organize a large trade and investment  delegation to Italy and France late next month, officials  revealed.    Altogether 100 people from 14 provinces and cities will  offer  330 projects for investment. The projects mainly cover  chemicals, foodstuffs, machinery, leather, light industry,  textiles, building materials and medicine.</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: Cost-cutting target raised at Union Carbide UNION Carbide, the US chemicals group, yesterday said it would step up its cost-cutting measures by increasing its annual cost reduction target to Dollars 575m, measured in 1990 dollars, from Dollars 400m. Earlier this year, Carbide said it was a year ahead of schedule in its efforts to reduce annual costs by Dollars 400m. Mr Robert Kennedy, chairman, said the company could save money by looking closely at inventory control, production, distribution and maintenance. Carbide is still feeling the pressure from tight margins in the polyethylene and ethylene glycol markets. For the second quarter, Carbide posted net income of Dollars 41m, or 24 cents a fully-diluted share, compared with Dollars 79m, or 48 cents, a year earlier. Sales slipped to Dollars 1.24bn from Dollars 1.26bn. Carbide's income from continuing operations was Dollars 41m in the quarter, compared with Dollars 36m. For the first half, the group had net income of Dollars 83m, compared with a net deficit of Dollars 216m including one-time items. Income from continuing operations rose to Dollars 83m, against Dollars 78m. Sales were flat at Dollars 2.44bn. Carbide said that its 1993 earnings would be reduced by about Dollars 80m to Dollars 100m, reflecting additional severance costs related to the extended cost-reduction programme and charges for the adoption of accounting standards for post-employment benefits.</p>

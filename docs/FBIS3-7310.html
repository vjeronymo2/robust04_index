			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 27 KYODO -- Prosecutors plan to wind  up their investigation of a series of bribery scandals involving  major contractors with an indictment of former Construction  Minister Kishiro Nakmura, prosecution sources said Sunday [27  March]. Top prosecution officials will hold a meeting Monday to  approve the plan, the sources said.    The Tokyo District Prosecutors Office will then indict  Nakamura on Tuesday on charges he received a 10 million yen  bribe from giant contractor Kajima Corp. in January 1992, the  sources said.    The former construction minister has reportedly remained  silent during questioning by prosecutors since he was arrested  March 11. The money Nakamura allegedly accepted was apparently  intended as a reward for using his influence as a Diet member to  help stop the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) from filing an  accusation against a cartel of 66 contractors, including Kajima,  over bid-rigging in Saitama Prefecture.    At the time, Nakamura was the deputy chief of the special  committee on Antimonopoly Laws of then governing Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP). He left the party after his arrest.    Since last June, two prefectural governors, two mayors and  more than 20 executives of eight leading contractors and a paper  manufacturer have been indicted in connection with the  influence-peddling scandals on public works projects.    The contractor scandals came to the surface after the  arrest of retired LDP powerbroker Shin Kanemaru in March 1993.  Kanemaru is standing trial on charges of evading roughly 1  billion yen in tax on some 1.8 billion yen in undeclared income,  chiefly provided by contractors.    Prosecutors have apparently given up filing a criminal  charge  against scandals involving Seiroku Kajiyama, a powerful LDP Diet  member, and former Posts Minister Hideo Watanabe for want of  evidence.    A suspicion had emerged that Mitsui Construction Co. gave 10  million yen to the Kajiyama camp in 1991 to gain his influence  in winning a public works project contract. However, a Mitsui  executive, who should have delivered the money, has testified he  pocketed it himself, the sources said.    Kajiyama, former justice minister and former LDP secretary  general, denied the allegation and sued the ASAHI SHIMBUN, which  reported he received the money.    Prosecutors have confirmed Watanabe received 40 million yen  from Kajima from 1988 to 1991 in connection with a hotel  development project in central Tokyo, the sources said. But  they failed to discover any specific request Kajima made to  Watanabe, they said.</p>

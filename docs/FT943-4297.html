			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Losses on bonds fail to check Glaxo Glaxo, Europe's largest pharmaceuticals group, yesterday reported a 10 per cent rise in profits despite making sizeable losses on investments in the year to June 30. Although pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 1.66bn to Pounds 1.84bn, the shares fell 7p to 609p after the group said it lost Pounds 115m on its bond portfolio and would incur a further Pounds 16m loss this year. It has since liquidated the Pounds 1.7bn portfolio managed by its Bermuda-based investment group and reinvested the funds in bank deposits and gilts. Increased trading profits and advantageous exchange rates, however, persuaded the board to announce an 18p dividend, raising the final by 23 per cent to 27p (22p). Sharply increased US sales - dominated by Zantac, its world-leading anti-ulcer drug - helped lift trading profits by 19 per cent to Pounds 1.81bn (Pounds 1.53bn), and underpinned a 15 per cent increase in sales from Pounds 4.93bn to Pounds 5.65bn. The figures were on the low side of analysts' expectations, which had ranged from Pounds 1.88bn to Pounds 1.94bn at the pre-tax level. Sir Richard Sykes, chief executive, admitted that the group had encountered difficulties in a number of European countries, where sales had been hit by government health reforms, but said that overall it was a 'tremendous' performance. The group enjoyed sharpest growth in the US where sales grew 15 per cent to Pounds 2.46bn at constant exchange rates. Sir Richard said those sales could be enhanced further if the group wins approval for over-the-counter sales on Zantac, which it plans to seek next month. He also said the group had improved cost efficiency by shedding jobs in Germany, Italy and Canada and had slowed the rate of growth on research and development and capital expenditure. Those measures helped increase net liquid funds from Pounds 1.82bn to Pounds 2.22bn. 'It's important for Glaxo to have a cash pile,' said Sir Richard. 'I did say we would make a move in the US by year-end, but having evaluated the situation, we did not think it was in the interests of the company or the shareholders.' Earnings per share rose 8 per cent from 39.9p to 42.9p, while earnings per American Depository Receipt were unchanged at Dollars 1.29. Lex, Page 18; Background, Page 21</p>

			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JAIL MAY HAVE MORE CRITICS THAN INMATES;  </P> <P> DESIGN: THE MAN WHO RUNS THE EL CAJON FACILITY SAYS IT'S THE WORST HE KNOWS,  AND COUNTY SUPERVISOR GEORGE BAILEY WANTS A FULL REVIEW OF THE BUILDING THAT  PRISONERS CAN LITERALLY KICK THEIR WAY OUT OF.  </P> <P> Ben McLaughlin, the captain in charge of the County Jail in El Cajon, peered  out a window into Module 7-C, from which 10 inmates have escaped since the jail  began housing them in 1983.  </P> <P> On a recent morning, most of the men were locked in their cells (six on two  triple bunks in each) during yet another "lockdown." In addition to escapes,  the jail has a history of riots and in-house disruptions.  </P> <P> "Boss, we're having a security problem right now," the guard said, referring to  the threat of a fight breaking out.  </P> <P> McLaughlin shook his head. Three out of seven prisoners remain at large after  the most recent escape last month, he said, the third in six years. During the  first escape in 1984, one prisoner fell to his death while shinnying down a  makeshift rope of sheets.  </P> <P> The captain, who has worked at the jail for almost two years, blames its  architectural design and what he called its shoddy construction for the  frequent escapes and for most of the other problems that haunt the most  problematic jail in the history of San Diego County.  </P> <P> "No unity, no continuity, no working floor plan," he said with a scowl. "It's  spasmodic, it's hit and miss. . . . It's a mess."  </P> <P> McLaughlin calls it the most poorly designed and worst-constructed jail that he  knows anything about, and, at 48, he has spent his entire adult life in law  enforcement. He says it may be everything a jail should not be, the antithesis  of the new County Jail in Vista, which he calls "state-of-the-art, designed to  do just what it's supposed to do, house inmates in a safe, efficient manner."  </P> <P> County Supervisor George Bailey, whose district includes El Cajon, agrees that  the jail is a mess, a multimillion-dollar turkey or lemon, depending on your  choice of metaphor. Bailey has called for a full review of the jail -- its  design and construction, as well as who ought to manage it -- and plans to  announce his recommendations at a Board of Supervisors meeting early next year.  </P> <P> This week, he hopes to receive a report from the county's Department of General  Services, which plans to advise that the walls of the jail -- which are made of  plastic foam -- be reinforced with galvanized sheet metal. The cost of the  renovation, which Bailey calls "a Band-Aid" that won't solve the problem, is an  estimated $800,000, which is what the county saved in resorting to cost-cutting  measures in the first place.  </P> <P> "Something needs to be done, and soon," Bailey said, "although I'm adamantly  opposed to almost $1 million for a temporary measure."  </P> <P> In the most recent escape, Nov. 5, seven prisoners used their fists and feet to  punch through the wall in 7-C and descended to the ground, climbing down a rope  made of bedsheets.  </P> <P> As another temporary measure, McLaughlin has won approval to have all bedsheets  taken away. Each prisoner will soon be issued two wool blankets -- one for  lying on, the other for cover -- in the hope that wool makes a lousier rope  than sheets do.  </P> <P> Bailey was livid after last month's escape.  </P> <P> "You have foam stuck on top of a dry wall," he said. "You can pick through it  in a matter of minutes. I'm no expert on construction, but I do know enough  about jails to know you'd never put that kind of a wall on a jail. It doesn't  make sense."  </P> <P> Jane Huston, director of the Department of General Services, said she was asked  by Sheriff John Duffy, who oversees the jails, to outfit a sample cell in the  El Cajon facility with what some people are calling "the sheet-metal solution."  She expects to have it approved at a Board of Supervisors meeting in January.  </P> <P> But Bailey may argue for a long-term solution -- such as a whole new jail.  McLaughlin, who has to deal with the place on a day-to-day basis, also favors a  new facility, with the current one being converted to badly needed courtrooms.  </P> <P> "If that facility is as godawful inefficient as the sheriff says it is, then we  ought to look toward building a new jail," Bailey said, "and get on with it."  </P> <P> McLaughlin, Bailey, Huston, Duffy -- just about everyone connected with the  jail -- say it is the victim of the era of retrenchment that began in earnest  in California in the early part of the decade, after the passage of the  property tax-cutting initiative, Proposition 13, in 1978.  </P> <P> The choice of building materials, such as plastic foam on the walls, came  about, Huston said, because money was scarce. She said the composition of the  wall is "plastic and wire mesh and a Styrofoam filling with a textured outer  cover," which, from East Main Street outside, makes it look like any other  sleek, modern building, elegant and firm.  </P> <P> "In retrospect, was it a bad decision?" Huston asked. "Well, at the time,  everyone did the best they could. Hindsight is always much easier. But, because  of Prop. 13, everyone was scared. People tried to cut corners every way they  could."  </P> <P> A report prepared by Bailey notes that problems beset the structure almost from  the day the architectural contract was awarded in 1976. That went to local  architects Richard George Wheeler and Frank L. Hope, neither of whom returned  phone calls from The Times. Proposition 13 contributed first to delays; then,  after dissension over the size of the building, the plans were redrawn.  Construction began in the summer of 1980.  </P> <P> When bids were awarded, they went not to one general contractor but to a series  of subcontractors. Inflation rates at the time hovered in the serious double  digits. It was decided that the walls would consist of a new material called  Drivit -- the trade name for the mixture of drywall with plastic foam and  textured coating. The estimated savings: $700,000 to $800,000.  </P> <P> In short, Bailey said, the project was screwed up "from stem to stern."  </P> <P> In constructing the walls, mistakes were made that weakened them further.  McLaughlin said a type of "hog wire, sprayed with blow-on cement, a light  mixture of concrete and fiber," is meant to secure the plastic foam all along  the wall, but, for some reason, it has been omitted from key sections.  Authorities discovered that when one of the seven inmates put his foot through  the wall in trying to escape Nov. 5. He was aiming for a window and missed,  McLaughlin said, only to discover that the wall "did the trick for him."  </P> <P> Despite the brouhaha over construction, virtually everyone connected with the  Sheriff's Department cites overcrowding as the worst problem facing the El  Cajon jail or any other in the county. Seven inmates recently escaped from the  South Bay Detention Facility in Chula Vista by greasing themselves with butter  and body lotion and crawling through a narrow window -- the same type of window  used in El Cajon. (McLaughlin said the walls of the South Bay jail, however,  are stronger.)  </P> <P> At the moment, McLaughlin said, the El Cajon jail is well over capacity -- it  has 442 inmates in a facility built for 120. It saw its highest population in  early 1987 -- some 830 inmates.  </P> <P> "Too many rats in the cage," as Bailey put it, leads to problems other than  escape. Because of the vertical design of the building -- a concept that  McLaughlin, for one, abhors -- inmates on the seventh floor routinely plug up  the toilets, flooding the floors below. That means the probation staffers on  the fifth floor never really know when it's going to rain, but they are aware  of the threat, any moment of the day or night.  </P> <P> "It's horrible," McLaughlin said. "They treat the toilet like a garbage  disposal, and, for the most part, they do it deliberately. The poor people in  probation are working in an untenable environment. Every night before they  leave, they cover their desks with plastic. If they don't, first thing in the  morning their desks are sopping wet."  </P> <P> The threat of escape, the toilets, the fights that break out on the jailhouse  floor -- a Latino-black melee last year involved more than 100 prisoners,  resulting in 19 injuries -- and a staff of 9 deputies trying to police 50 times  that number, none of it bothers McLaughlin as much as the building's central  flaws. He says no jail should have a vertical construction and that if it does,  it should have a central command post, which this one doesn't. (In the 9-story  building, inmates are kept on the 6th, 7th and 8th floors.)  </P> <P> "Everything in the jail has to go through two elevators," McLaughlin said.  "We're talking staff, clothing, bedding, nurses, food, inmates -- everything.  It's horribly inefficient."  </P> <P> As it stands, McLaughlin routinely has to cancel meetings -- Narcotics  Anonymous and the like -- as well as church services because there are too few  guards to chaperon too many inmates, and too few rooms with too few chairs to  seat inmates who wish to attend.  </P> <P> "When that starts to happen," he said, "you've defeated the entire purpose of  rehabilitation."  </P> <P> As the controversy swells, the recent problems of Sheriff Duffy -- ranging from  allegations of unreported outside income to absenteeism to being unresponsive  to charges of jail beatings by guards -- now include the questions about the El  Cajon complex. Bailey isn't sure the sheriff is the best person to manage the  jails, that maybe the problem starts at the top.  </P> <P> Susan Golding, chairwoman of the Board of Supervisors, recently suggested that  the board should run the jails.  </P> <P> "I'm not happy with the Sheriff's Department," Bailey said. "Nobody in their  right mind would want to run the (El Cajon) jail. But can it get any worse out  there? I ask you, can it?"  </P></p>

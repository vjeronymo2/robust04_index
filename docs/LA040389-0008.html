			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> 3 NEW SITES FOR SUPERFUND LIST  </P> <P> Three San Joaquin Valley sites have been added to the Environmental Protection  Agency's Superfund list of the nation's most polluted areas. The expanded list  was released in Washington and among 101 new entries were an old Southern  California Edison pole dipping yard in Visalia and areas in Modesto and Turlock  where soil and ground water are contaminated. Superfund status potentially  makes available special funding to clean up the polluted sites which are  considered the greatest long-term threat to humans and the environment.  </P></p>

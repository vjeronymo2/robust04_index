			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Nordic bank doubles profits Higher interest income and an absence of credit losses enabled Nordic Investment Bank, jointly owned by the five Nordic countries, to double profits in the first eight months to Ecu66m (Dollars 81.84m) from Ecu32m, writes Christopher Brown-Humes. The Helsinki-based bank said the outlook remained positive, and it expected full-year profits to be about 50 per cent higher than last year's Ecu64m. The bank said it did not suffer any loan losses during the period.</p>

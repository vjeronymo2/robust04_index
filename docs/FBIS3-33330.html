Rexrodt said  that "over the past few years, Mexico has prepared for the leap  into an industrial society."    In his opening speech, Rexrodt recalled the tradition of  German industrial exhibitions in Mexico. The first large-scale  industrial fair was staged in Mexico City exactly 40 years ago,  in 1954. The choice of Mexico for Technogerma 1994 is a signal:  As the fair only takes place every three to four years in an  important partner country "with which economic and technological  cooperation should be particularly enhanced," this now "opens a  new chapter in German- Mexican economic relations."    The German economy can build on a solid base in Mexico: For  some years now, the country has been the biggest purchaser of  German goods in Latin America. In 1992, the volume of bilateral  trade reached 5.25 billion German marks [DM]. The Federal  Republic's trade surplus amounted to DM2.5 billion. However, in  1993, the exports to Mexico and imports of Mexican goods into  Germany both declined: "All possible efforts must be made to  reduce the growing bilateral trade deficit (Mexico) with  Germany."    Rexrodt urged the Mexican export industry to use the  opportunities presented by the German market with its 80 million  consumers. "Display presence instead of abstinence." Germany  is the second largest investor in Mexico after the United  States. That stems not only from the German investment capital  flowing into Mexico, but also from the fact that a high share of  the profits earned in Mexico are reinvested.    "NAFTA, which was formed recently," said Rexrodt, referring  to the North American Free Trade Zone, which was established on  1 January 1994, "will encourage the development of much closer  ties between the two North American states and Mexico, and that  will result in an increase in investment." The Federal Republic  hopes that a German-Mexican treaty on the protection and  promotion of investment will have a positive effect. Bonn is  exchanging ideas about such a treaty with the Mexican  Government. The "Report of the Year 2000 Commission," which was  presented in Mexico City also describes new areas for  cooperation between Germany and Mexico.    In his opening speech, Rexrodt also stated that there was  "enormous potential for economic growth" in environmental  protection. In Germany alone, the market for goods that are not  harmful to the environment amounts DM40 billion a year. The  market is growing at a rate of between 6 and 8 percent. NAFTA  will present Mexico new challenges in this very area of  environmental protection.    Rexrodt praised the policies aimed at promoting stability  being pursued by President Salinas de Gortari and his  government: "The Mexican economy has come out of the painful  and difficult adjustment process stronger." This path is "an  essential condition for overcoming structural difficulties,  achieving further economic growth, and thus, above all, for the  political stability that is so important."    This year's Technogerma has far more to offer than its  predecessors, stressed Rexrodt. There will be a symposium  covering such topics as the transfer of knowhow, background  information on "Germany as a center of industry," and a series  of side events to promote cultural exchange. "Technogerma,"  said the economics minister, "will enhance Mexican-German  relations in the political and cultural field too."</p>

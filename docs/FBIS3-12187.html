			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ambassador to the United States Itamar </F> Rabinovich by correspondent Arye Golan in Washington on 25  February -- recorded]    [Text] [Golan] Ambassador Rabinovich, what effect will  the massacre have on the peace talks?    [Rabinovich] We do not know yet. We are not dealing here  with speculations or expectations. There is ongoing activity in  Israel, the United States, and in other capitals to contain the  damage and try to prevent negative effects on the peace process.  We are maintaining ongoing contacts with the peace team in the  U.S. Administration. We expect there will be high-level  contacts between the Israeli Government and the U.S.  Administration later today. I think President Clinton will  address the issue later today. All this is intended to prevent,  or at least minimize, the damages to the peace process.    [Golan] Did you speak with our Arab interlocutors to the  peace talks?    [Rabinovich] Not yet, but such contacts will take place  later today.    [Golan] Have you heard what they are saying to the Americans  now?    [Rabinovich] No, I do not think there is any explicit  message from them yet. I think the Arab side, like us, is still  unclear about the events, some of which are unfortunately still  going on.    [Golan] They did not say they are halting the talks and  returning home, did they?    [Rabinovich] No, there was no such announcement.    [Golan] What do the Americans intend to do in order to calm  tempers down?    (Rabinovich] I think right now the Americans are holding  internal consultations, with us and with the Arab and  Palestinian side. I think they have still not consolidated any  concrete policy. This will probably take place in the next few  hours.    [Golan] How do the Americans regard the Palestinian demand  to disarm the settlers?    [Rabinovich] I do not think the Americans believe the time  has come to address such concrete issues. This is not the key  issue when we are trying to figure out how to save the peace  process from severe harm. I assume that if such a request was  submitted to the Americans they would have known how to rank it  on the list of priorities.    [Golan] How will the Security Council deal with this issue  when it is submitted to it?    [Rabinovich] It is too early to assess what will happen in  the Security Council, because the format for dealing with this  issue has still not been determined. We must remember that the  Security Council can meet on various levels and forms, and so  far this issue has not been determined.</p>

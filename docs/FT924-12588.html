			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / International Company News: Nigerian bank is declared insolvent NATIONAL Bank of Nigeria (NBN), the country's oldest indigenous bank, is insolvent and needs about N2bn (Dollars 102m) to stay alive, Reuter reports from Lagos. The Nigerian Deposit Insurance Corporation, an independent guarantee fund covering bank failures, said yesterday: 'It is completely insolvent. We have given the owners a task force report.' Banking sources do not expect the cash to be found and believe NBN, owned by four southern states, will close.</p>

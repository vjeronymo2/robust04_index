			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (13): New code agreed - Performance measurement PENSION FUND performance measurement has moved into a new era this year, with the publication of a code which has the backing of many pension industry interests. But, ironically, the whole idea of league tables and performance comparisons could be undermined by a slowly emerging trend towards individual fund benchmarks. Performance measurement is now a highly developed service, which has become concentrated into two main specialist operations. One is the World Markets company, which started as a soft commissions venture of a stockbroking firm but is now owned by Bankers Trust, the US commercial banking group. The other is Combined Actuarial Performance Services (Caps) which, as its name suggests, is the result of merging the separate measurement service of various actuarial firms such as R Watson, Bacon &amp; Woodrow, Mercer Fraser and Noble Lowndes. WM is the market leader in terms of the size of funds measured. Last year its WM All Funds Universe consisted of over 2,000 UK pension fund portfolios worth Pounds 241bn, said to represent about three-quarters of the industry. Caps measured rather more portfolios, at 2,760, but a rather smaller aggregate of Pounds 156bn. While Caps has a slightly smaller - although clearly overlapping - coverage, in some respects its funds are more typical of the industry. The WM results tend to be affected by the performance of a few huge funds which may have rather different characteristics, such as a significantly higher investment in property. The WM Universe had an 8 per cent property content in its aggregated portfolio last year, against only 2 per cent for Caps. However, the performance of property can be separated out. Moreover, WM now also divides its funds into the WM Very Large Funds Universe, worth over Pounds 1bn each, and the WM Average Funds Universe. A dismal property market meant that the giant funds did worse than average in 1991. The WM Very Large Funds earned an average rate of return of 16.2 per cent (income plus capital growth) compared with 17.8 per cent for the WM Average Funds. Meanwhile, the Caps median fund earned 18.3 per cent including property, and 18.6 per cent excluding it. Despite an element of harmonisation within the past year or two, the WM and Caps services retain slight technical differences. WM tends to talk about averages, and Caps about medians, for instance. But these are of little consequence, and there will be no repetition of the minor embarrassment two years ago, when the rate of return on the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index for was measured as 36.1 per cent by WM and 35.5 per cent by Caps. The discrepancy related to the timing of dividend receipts. For 1991, however, both services measure the All-Share return as 20.7 per cent. Possibly the methodology still needs to be refined in specialist areas such as index-tracking funds. Last year, for instance, the presence of a significant element of recently-privatised stocks within the All-Share tended to flatter the index funds, because they held these shares in partly-paid form, and outperformed because prices rose. However, such details may be a matter for interpretation rather than changes in technique. At any rate, a code of practice for both methodology and the presentation of historical performance records has now been agreed. The code was developed because of complaints that performance measurement figures have been misused by fund managers, particularly when soliciting for new business. There has been a tendency to choose funds selectively for inclusion in the records, and to pick particular periods, indices or measurers. Fund managers have developed a kind of Orwellian tendency to rewrite history, notably by dropping poorly-performing funds from their records, on various pretexts. Accordingly, a National Association of Pension Funds inquiry in 1990 recommended the establishment of a voluntary code; and the simple outline of the code has now been published by a working party, which included the representatives of various industry bodies. A further working group has been set up to monitor compliance with the code, and consider how it might be further developed in the future. Already many investment management houses have begun issuing figures which they certify to be in accordance with the code. This means, inter alia, that the standard performance presentation should cover five calendar years, should include all discretionary balanced funds under management, and must state the name of the measurer. At the very least, the industry is therefore now developing a standard format for performance data. But there remain some grey areas, particularly in the selection of funds and the definition of 'discretion' as applied to management mandates. From next year, however, the performance league tables which have been appearing in various journals and consulting actuaries' circulars will have a little more credibility, although gaps may remain. The biggest pension fund manager, Mercury Asset Management, has refused to publish any aggregate figures, probably because it fears that clients underperforming the published house median would complain. Moreover, the whole idea of developing comparable performance statistics may be torpedoed by a trend towards the setting of individual performance benchmarks by pension funds. In time, the idea of discretionary balanced management may fade away. Already, WM has divided its Universe into two. In future, the measurers may need to set up a series of specialist universes (global equities, say, and international bonds, or UK index trackers). Beyond that, increasing numbers of funds may give their managers individual briefs in terms of investment risk and return in relation to specific scheme liabilities. It could be that the industry league table could will begin to lose its relevance almost as soon as it has emerged into statistical daylight.</p>

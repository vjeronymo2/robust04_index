			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VOTE BY LIBERAL BATES AIDS BILL TO CURB PORNOGRAPHY  </P> <P> One of the Legislature's most liberal Democrats cast the deciding vote Tuesday  enabling the Assembly Public Safety Committee to pass legislation that would  all but ban the sale of graphic pornography from street-side vending machines.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Tom Bates (D-Oakland), who almost always votes in line with the  American Civil Liberties Union, said he believes it makes sense to keep such  explicit pornography out of the hands of children. Democrat Curtis Tucker Jr.  of Inglewood also voted for the bill, giving the three Republicans on the  committee the five-vote majority needed to send the measure to the Assembly  floor.  </P> <P> The bill, by Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), is aimed at curbing  pornography sales from coin-operated sidewalk vending machines commonly found  along downtown streets and increasingly in suburban areas. The machines and the  magazines and newspapers they display have raised the ire of community and  religious groups throughout the state, mainly because they are easily  accessible to children.  </P> <P> The measure would allow the sale of "harmful matter" from these vending  machines only in areas supervised by an adult, a change that would probably end  their use in public areas. Harmful matter is already defined in current law and  includes photographs of the acts of sodomy, oral copulation, sexual  intercourse, masturbation and bestiality.  </P> <P> The bill is a follow-up to a measure passed and signed by the governor in 1988  that prohibited the sale of pornography from vending machines if children would  be able to view the material.  </P> <P> Ferguson, one of the most conservative members of the Legislature, said he was  surprised but pleased by Bates' support. "We have always been antagonists,"  Ferguson said. "I didn't even ask him for his vote because I didn't think he  would give it to me."  </P> <P> After the hearing, Bates fended off criticism from the ACLU lobbyist and  Assemblyman John Burton (D-San Francisco), the committee's chairman, who voted  against the bill.  </P> <P> "Do you know what this bill does?" Burton asked Bates. "It's garbage."  </P> <P> Margaret Pena, the ACLU representative, asked Bates how he planned to defend  his vote in his liberal district, which includes the Berkeley.  </P> <P> "I don't have to defend it," Bates replied. "I'm concerned about the First  Amendment. But I'm convinced that this is not going to restrict the access (for  adults) to the material. It is simply going to make it more difficult for kids.  I think there's a real problem going on out there with kids. I just don't think  they should be exposed to this material."  </P> <P> During the hearing, Pena told the committee that the material the bill would  regulate is "protected speech" under the U.S. Constitution.  </P> <P> "This bill would make that material inaccessible to adults in coin-operated  machines, since no one is going to hire an adult to supervise the machines,"  she said.  </P> <P> The bill was also opposed by the publisher of Spectator Magazine, which is sold  from vending machines. But the measure had the support of the city and county  of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Ferguson said he believes the bill will fare well on the Assembly floor and in  the Senate because lawmakers are increasingly attuned to a concern among the  electorate about moral values. He cited the results of two recent Los Angeles  Times Polls, one of which found that the public believes most legislators are  corrupt and the other that showed 65% of Americans expressing dissatisfaction  about "moral values these days."  </P> <P> "Most elected officials do not want to be cast as something they are not," he  said. "And most of them are not crooks. The large majority are honest and are  trying to be perceived as attentive to the public's concerns, even if it means  doing something this year that they wouldn't have done last year -- like voting  for an anti-pornography bill."  </P></p>

Paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(3) of 905.667 are revised to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;905.667  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Reserve for emergencies and disasters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Emergencies <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eligibility for assistance.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An IHA (including an IHA that is determined to be high risk under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;905.135) may obtain funds at any time, for any eligible emergency work item as defined in &sect;905.102 (for IHAs participating in CGP) or for any eligible emergency work item (described as emergency modernization in &sect;905.102) (for IHAs participating in CIAP), from the reserve established under &sect;905.601(b). However, emergency reserve funds may not be provided to an IHA participating in CGP that has the necessary funds available from any other source, including its annual formula allocation under &sect;905.601(e) and (f), other unobligated modernization funds, and its replacement reserves under &sect;905.666. An IHA is not required to have an approved comprehensive plan under &sect;905.672 before it can request emergency assistance from this reserve. Emergency reserve funds may not be provided to an IHA participating in CIAP unless it does not have the necessary funds available from any other source, including unobligated CIAP, and no CIAP modernization funding is available from HUD for the remainder of the fiscal year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Repayment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A CGP IHA that receives assistance for its emergency needs from the reserve under &sect;905.601(b) must repay such assistance from its future allocations of assistance, where available. For IHAs participating in the CGP, HUD shall deduct up to 50 percent of an IHA's succeeding year's formula allocation under &sect;905.601 (e) and (f) to repay emergency funds previously provided by HUD to the IHA. The remaining balance, if any, shall be deducted from an IHA's succeeding years' formula allocations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Section 905.669 is amended by adding three sentences to the end of paragraph (a)(1); by revising paragraphs (b) and (c); by adding a new paragraph (d); and by adding the OMB control number to the end of the section, to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;905.669  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Allocation of assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) *&blank;*&blank;* On an annual basis, HUD will transmit to the IHA the formula characteristics report which reflects the data that will be used to determine the IHA's formula share. The IHA will have at least 30 calendar days to review and advise HUD of errors in this HUD report. Necessary adjustments will be made to the IHA's data before the formula is run for the current FFY.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD notification of formula amount; appeal rights.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Formula amounts notification.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After HUD determines an IHA's formula allocation under &sect;905.601 (e) and (f) based upon the IHA, development, and community characteristics, it shall notify the IHA of its formula amount and provide instructions on the Annual Submission in accordance with &sect;&sect;905.672(a) and 905.678;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Appeal based upon unique circumstances.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An IHA may appeal in writing HUD's determination of its formula amount within 60 calendar days of the date of HUD's determination on the basis of ``unique circumstances.'' The IHA must indicate what is unique, and specify the manner in which it is different from all other IHAs participating in the CGP, and provide any necessary supporting documentation. HUD shall render a written decision on an IHA's appeal under this paragraph within 60 calendar days of the date of its receipt of the IHA's request for an appeal. HUD shall publish in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a description of the facts supporting any successful appeals based upon ``unique circumstances.'' Any adjustments resulting from successful appeals in a particular FFY under this paragraph shall be made from the subsequent years' allocation of funds under this part;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Appeal based upon error.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An IHA may appeal in writing HUD's determination of its formula amount within 60 calendar days of the date of HUD's determination on the basis of an error. The IHA may appeal on the basis of error the correctness of data in the formula characteristics report. The IHA must describe the nature of the error, and provide any necessary supporting documentation. HUD shall respond to the IHA's request within 60 calendar days of the date of its receipt of the IHA's request for an appeal. Any adjustment resulting from successful appeals in a particular FFY under this paragraph shall be made from subsequent years' allocation of funds under this part;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> IHAs determined to be high risk.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If an IHA is determined to have serious deficiencies in accordance with &sect;905.135, or if the IHA fails to meet, or to make reasonable progress toward meeting, the goals previously established in its management improvement plan under &sect;905.135, HUD may designate the IHA high risk. If the IHA is designated high risk with respect to modernization, HUD may withhold some or all of the IHA's annual grant; HUD may declare a breach of the grant agreement with respect to all or some of the IHA's functions so that the IHA or a particular function of the IHA may be administered by another entity; or HUD may take other sanctions authorized by law or regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Obligation of formula funding.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All formula funding should be obligated within two years of approval.

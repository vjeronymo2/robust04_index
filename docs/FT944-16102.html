			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Survey of International Standards (4): Developers have to co-operate - Mobile Communications The area of mobile communications is another where development is so fast that developers are having to co-operate to create standards, writes Claire Gooding. Pan-European communications have been difficult to establish in a market complicated by differing infrastructures and implementations, and complex inter-country interconnection agreements. The Mobitex network is acclaimed as a de facto standard for wireless data transmission, with networks established in the UK, France, Sweden, Finland, Norway and the Netherlands, Canada, the US, Australia and Chile - and under development in Belgium, Germany and Singapore. 'With privatisation, and the rapid changes in the telecommunications industry, it's difficult for the European Technical Standards Institute to keep up with the workload,' says Mr John Nicholson, operations director of RAM Mobile Data. 'It makes sense to adopt de facto standards, and Mobitex is a case in point. 'Standards lead to greater awareness in the marketplace, but it is a little early in the market as yet. One advantage is that once a standard exists, such as the GSM (General Special Radio) that is accepted in most European countries, it is a benefit to consumers and brings the price down.' Mr Andrew Robb, who now heads the European operations of Geotek Communications, agrees with the need for standards. 'As a network operator, we want to encourage open standards,' says Mr Robb who was until recently the managing director of Geotek's UK subsidiary National Band 3, the national trunk network providing mobile communications to fleets of commercial vehicles such as couriers. National Band 3 is widely used by brown and white goods services: customers include Radio Rentals and Granada TV. Mr Robb points to standards being developed in the European Community such as the Trans European Truck Radio standard, Tetra, and the technical standard MPT Ministry of Post and Telecommunications. 'For customers, it should be like plugging into electricity,' says Mr Robb. 'They should be able to move between operators. The consequence of having standards is that every element can approach the market with a great deal more confidence, because standards mean that there is a greater chance of achieving volume sales, lower prices and greater choice for the customer.'</p>

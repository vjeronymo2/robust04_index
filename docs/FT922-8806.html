			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (5): Painful path of reform - The economy BURDENED by an Dollars 8bn-Dollars 9bn external debt which even a thriving oil sector cannot service, grappling with the legacy of war, and acutely short of management skills, Angola has embarked on the painful path of reform under the tutelage of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. A budget deficit of more than 25 per cent in 1990 has to be cut, the kwanza remains over-valued despite last month's devaluation, and the balance of payments deficit has risen steeply from Dollars 6m in 1985 to Dollars 1.25bn in 1990 and did not improve last year, according to central bank estimates. 'The government is working closely with the IMF in its efforts to address these issues,' says a senior official in the finance ministry. While stressing the administration's determination to cut spending and pursue a privatisation programme, the official is frank about the difficulties stemming from years of mismanagement as well as the civil war. The recovery effort follows a gruelling era. The collapse of Angola's flourishing, diversified pre-independence economy was dramatic, even by the standards of a continent accustomed to disaster. A GDP growth rate averaging nearly 7 per cent in real terms had been built on exports of oil, coffee, diamonds and iron ore, and a manufacturing and industrial sector rivalled in Africa only by South Africa. The tumult of 1974-75, marked by the exodus of 350,000 Portuguese settlers and a growing civil war, marked the start of a catastrophic decline. Coffee exports have fallen from more than 200,000 tonnes to a few thousand, ore output has ceased, diamond production remains below the pre-independence peak of 2.1m carats, a surplus of basic food has become a deficit and the industrial sector operates at perhaps a quarter of production capacity. Only the oil sector has thrived - up from 170,000 barrels a day (b/d) before independence to more than 500,000 b/d, accounting for over 90 per cent of export earnings, at least half of which have been spent on the war. Whichever political party wins next September's elections, the priority of the incoming government will be to seek an agreement with the IMF, followed by an early meeting with the Paris Club of official creditors. The imprimatur of the Fund is a pre-condition to the urgently-needed rescheduling of Angola's external debt - Dollars 7.7bn at the beginning of 1991; at least Dollars 8bn today. With debt service payments due this year of at least Dollars 1.6bn, and forecast export earnings of about half that, rescheduling is essential to economic recovery. Over the past five years the MPLA government has been dismantling the edifice of state controls, cautiously at first, more vigorously since becoming a member of the Fund in September 1989. Three successive reform plans - in 1987, 1989, and 1990 - tackled the Angolan economic malaise, which the first of the plans so candidly described as: 'The excessive centralisation of socialist planning methods and consequent bureaucratisation of economic direction. . . disorganisation and mismanagement of companies, lack of discipline and rampant corruption'. The 1990 programme marked the shift from promise to practice: spending was cut and revenue boosted in an effort to reduce budget deficits exceeding 25 per cent. Prices were increased and most price controls lifted, and the kwanza was devalued, taking effect in March 1991. A currency changeover designed to mop up excess liquidity was also introduced. Old and new notes were exchanged at par, but only 5 per cent exchanged for new kwanzas, the balance in government bonds. Last year, new legislation on the financial sector was introduced providing for a new commercial bank and a credit institution for agriculture and fisheries. Professor Fatima Roque, 'minister-designate' of finance in the opposition Unita, has committed the party to what amounts to radical structural adjustment programme towards the same destination: a market-driven economy with a competitive exchange rate and the once-dominant state-controlled sector reduced to certain core services. But it is the MPLA who must put principles into practice, imposing the rigours of adjustment on an electorate they are trying to woo. And until adjustment policies have been applied with sufficient rigour to satisfy the Fund, there will be no repeat of the Paris Club's decision in 1989 to make an exception to the rules, when arrears and maturities falling due in the period through September 1990 were rescheduled. But Angola faces such a formidable set of problems, say officials; it deserves a sympathetic and flexible response from the Fund and creditors. As Professor Roque comments in an analysis of Angola's predicament: 'There is no body of experience available - with regard to the application to the theory of timing, scope, speed or the sequences of reforms - to guide Angola in its transition from a centrally-planned to a market economy.' Government officials say they will not be distracted from the reform task by the coming election. But while the commitment may remain, implementation of the transition programme makes their task even more difficult. The election exercise itself will be an expensive exercise, and there is also the cost of funding the demobilisation of the bulk of the two rival armies. Soldiers returning to civilian life receive lump sum payments and government is also pledged to retraining and resettlement assistance. 'The peace dividend will come,' said one official, 'but not as quickly as we had hoped.' Implementing the reform blueprint may have to wait until after the polls.</p>

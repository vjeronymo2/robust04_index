			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Gildemeister in talks with Milacron on sales deal Gildemeister and Cincinnati Milacron, two of the world's largest machine tool companies, are discussing a sales agreement which would strengthen Gildemeister's presence in the US and Milacron's in Europe. Mr Axel Kemna, chairman of Gildemeister, which is based in Bielefeld, Germany, said a deal would enable the company to lift sales in the US, where its market position is weak. In turn, Milacron could use the recently-formed Deckel Maho Gildemeister sales network in Europe. If the two companies reach a deal, it would be one of the most important co-operations between US and European machine tool companies, and strengthen the sales base of both companies as the fiercely-competitive machine tool market emerges from recession. The discussions between the two companies come amid continuing speculation that Milacron might buy a 25 per cent stake in Gildemeister. Mr Kemna, speaking in London, said the rumours were untrue. Gildemeister derives only 5 per cent of its sales from the US market, and is keen to expand its sales outside Europe. A deal would cap an extraordinary period of corporate activity for Gildemeister. In July, it paid DM90m (Dollars 60.18m) for the main assets of Deckel-Maho, the ill-fated merger of two big German milling machine companies completed only in December last year, and called in an administrator five months later. The purchase gave Gildemeister a strong position in milling machines to complement its own range of turning machines. Gildemeister is raising DM70m through a capital increase, of which DM40m will go as share capital for Deckel-Maho. Following the takeover, Gildemeister would make a loss this year, may break even next year, and should make a profit in 1996, said Mr Kemna.</p>

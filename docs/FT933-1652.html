			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Litigation grows over accounting INSURANCE companies paid out Dollars 185m (Pounds 121m) in net payments to settle litigation claims against the six largest US accountancy firms alone last year, according to figures released yesterday. The figures - which were compiled from a confidential survey of the US firms  -increased sharply from net payments by insurers of just Dollars 8m in 1991 and net receipts of Dollars 37m in 1990. They show the 'Big Six' accountants paid out Dollars 598m net in legal costs, settlements and insurance premiums, or nearly 11 per cent of total accounting and auditing revenues of Dollars 5.5bn, up from 9 per cent in 1991 and 8 per cent in 1990. The information is being used as part of a campaign by Cease, the coalition to eliminate abusive securities suits, comprising more than 400 accountants and US businesses lobbying the US government to restructure the legal system. Firms surveyed included KPMG Peat Marwick, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Deloitte &amp; Touche, Arthur Andersen, Ernst &amp; Young and Price Waterhouse. Mr Larry Weinbach, managing partner-chief executive of Arthur Andersen Worldwide Organisation, who has helped co-ordinate the campaign, said yesterday: 'This is one of the most serious issues facing the accounting profession since its inception. 'Its future is in jeopardy unless we come up with some reasonable approach.' He warned that unless there was reform of the existing legal system, accountants would either be forced out of business or restrict their public interest role by refusing to conduct audits of some companies. The rising trend in net insurance payments is echoed by the increasing cost and difficulty of accountants obtaining insurance . Mr Weinbach said his firm had been forced to introduce greater self-insurance because it was unable to obtain commercial cover at affordable rates. It wants plaintiffs who take out legal cases against accountants to be forced to pay the defendants' costs if they lose, as is the case in the UK.</p>

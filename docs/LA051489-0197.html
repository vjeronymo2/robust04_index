			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN THE GARDEN: GARDENING;  </P> <P> SPLASHING SOME COLOR ON THOSE SHADY SPOTS  </P> <P> Southern California gardens are growing up and, as a result, are getting  shadier and shadier as trees (and some houses with their second story  additions) cast longer or deeper shadows. What do you plant in these shady  gardens? You begin with shrubs.  </P> <P> Camellias can be the backbone of any shady garden, excelling on the north side  of the house or under trees that are not too dense.  </P> <P> A shrub called yesterday-today-and-tomorrow, Brunfelsia pauciflora  'Floribunda,' looks somewhat like a camellia and grows to about the same size  but has flowers that turn purple, then fade to lavender and finally white  (hence the common name).  </P> <P> It grows in shade too but does best where it gets some sun. It flowers a little  later in spring than the camellias.  </P> <P> Hydrangeas are another candidate for a shady garden and they are especially  valuable because they flower well after the camellias and azaleas, carrying the  show into summer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Color Depends on Soil  </P> <P> But, if you want a blue hydrangea, you had better buy it in flower. Hydrangeas  must be forced to turn blue in California because the color is dependant on an  acid soil, and ours is at best neutral and at worst alkaline. In New Zealand  and in Seattle, where the soils are quite acid, they naturally turn a bright,  even brilliant blue.  </P> <P> If you scatter aluminum sulfate (sold at nurseries) around the base of a  hydrangea before it makes buds and then once again when the buds are about  half-size, you may turn the flowers blue.  </P> <P> In my experience, not all hydrangeas will turn blue so that is why it is best  to buy one that is blue to begin with. Otherwise, you will have pink hydrangeas  and, unfortunately, it is not a soft baby-pink but a slightly unpleasant shade  of the color. You can also take the safe route and plant a white-flowered  hydrangea. White flowers are particularly visible in the shade.  </P> <P> Camellias, azaleas, brunfelsia and hydrangeas like a rich, porous soil such as  you might find on a forest floor. Before planting, mix in bags of organic soil  amendment such as redwood or ground bark. I usually till in a 6-inch layer of  amendment, that has been spread on top, to a depth of about a foot. This is a  lot of bags-full.  </P> <P> Abutilons are nearly perfect shrubs for a shady situation, and unlike the  hydrangeas, they will also take a direct blast of sun during the day without  wilting. They broaden the palette by blooming primarily in winter and early  spring. No other plant in my garden flowers as long -- 10 months by my count --  and it is one of the few plants that grows quickly to its appointed size and  then seems to stop.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Many Colors Available  </P> <P> Mine grow to about 6 or 8 feet and then stay there, and they get to that size  in about a year, with lots of water and fertilizer. The best have large,  bell-like flowers but smallish leaves.  </P> <P> Others have small flowers and some very large leaves -- they are a varied lot.  They come in many colors, from pink, through red, to yellow and orange. They  are not common at nurseries so you must hunt a little to find a good one.  </P> <P> Another champion shrub for the shade, even deep shade, is the dark,  glossy-green Japanese aucuba. The gold-splattered variegated varieties are the  most popular but I have always found them difficult to grow. Not so the plain  green variety named 'Serratifolia.' Aucubas are as slow as a freight train, so  don't expect a big shrub for many years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tough as Nails  </P> <P> If you need one more big shrub to round out your shade planting, try  Pittosporum tobira 'Variegata,' a two-toned shrub that is tough as nails though  in two years it will grow to 6 feet across and they can grow to 15 feet. They  don't grow too tall, however, and pruning can keep them smaller.  </P> <P> The cream-splashed leaves look like shafts of sunlight in the shade. If you  want something smaller, try 'Turner's Variegated Dwarf' (from Hines wholesale  nursery), a new dwarf variegated pittosporum that should grow to about 4 feet  tall by 6 feet wide. It is a cream-splattered version of 'Wheeler's Dwarf,' a  plain, green-leaved pittosporum that also takes shade and grows to about 6 or 8  feet across, but only 4 or 5 feet tall. It does fine on the north side of the  house and can stand sun, so it is a good bet to plant farther away from the  house where the ground is in shadow all winter, but is sunny in summer as it  climbs higher in the sky.  </P></p>

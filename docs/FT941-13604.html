			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Business and Law: Review of suits against advisers to US fraudsters - Legal Briefs The right of private litigants in the US to bring aiding and abetting actions against accountants, lawyers and other professionals with secondary involvement in securities fraud is under review by the US Supreme Court. Plaintiffs' lawyers and the Securities and Exchange Commission argue that denying private actions could deprive investors of their best shot at recouping losses. Many investors who lost money in the recent savings and loans (building societies) crisis, for example, were only able to recover some losses by successfully suing accountants and law firms which had advised the failed institutions. The case under review, Central Bank of Denver v First Interstate Bank of Denver, involves an Dollars 11m bond issue made in 1988 for which Central Bank of Denver served as the indenture trustee. The bonds were secured by property, and serious questions were raised about the accuracy of the property's appraisal before the bonds were issued. Central Bank ordered a new appraisal but delayed it until six months after the bonds were issued. After the bonds went into default in 1990, First Interstate, which had bought Dollars 2.1m, sued Central alleging it had intentionally or recklessly aided and abetted a fraudulent scheme by delaying the appraisal.</p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Swap those unwanted shares and save money - Too many tiny holdings? - How to shed them Are you the sort of investor with a large, well-balanced portfolio of shares which is reviewed regularly and weeded out? Or do you, like many, have a ragbag collection - a couple of hundred BT here, a hundred Abbey National there, plus a few other bits and pieces which are, generally, too small to bother about? The wave of privatisations since the early 1980s has left many people with tiny holdings in privatised companies. Many share offers were so popular that applications had to be scaled back, so most people received half or one-third the number they applied for. The problem with a portfolio built up in this way is that it is often unbalanced. Rather than a wide, low-risk spread of a good variety of companies in different sectors, your entire holdings could be divided between a handful of utilities which all tend to move in the same direction at the same time. But if you decide to sell a few shares and re-invest the proceeds elsewhere, you will soon learn that dealing on a small scale can be disproportionately expensive. Stockbrokers set a minimum commission for transactions; this starts at around Pounds 20 with the cheapest execution-only services, but can be Pounds 50 or more. If your shares are worth only Pounds 250, selling them takes a big chunk out of your investment. And if you want to re-invest the resulting cash in other shares, yet more commission must be paid. Small shareholders do have an alternative, however. Many unit and investment trust managers operate share exchange schemes designed to appeal to small investors with precisely this problem. They will swap your small shareholdings for shares or units in the trust of your choice. So, with the same amount of money, you get exposure to a far wider range of companies, in the UK and overseas if you wish. The cost of the entire transaction should be less than using a conventional stockbroker: most investment trust share exchange schemes charge a minimum of between Pounds 10 and Pounds 30, while some do not charge at all for sales. Most investment trust share exchange schemes are administered through their savings schemes, and normally you pay the standard charges when buying the investment trust shares: typically, 0.2 per cent to 1 per cent. Dunedin does not charge for purchases. Fleming's standard charge for sales is Pounds 12.50, but every month it has a special offer for a particular sector. During July, it will accept shares in the building and construction sector for Pounds 7.50. There is a 1 per cent charge for purchases. Unit trusts sometimes absorb your holdings into their own portfolios, in which case there may be no additional charge. Otherwise, dealing charges are similar to investment trust schemes. In either case, though, you still pay the standard initial charge on the units, which is typically around 5 per cent. Some charge less, particularly if you buy the units through a personal equity plan where lower initial charges sometimes are counter-balanced by exit charges if you sell up within the first three to five years. M&amp;G sends customers a list of the shares it holds itself and will accept for exchange without charge. There are about 200 companies on this list, which is updated every six months. Other UK shares are accepted as well, but the selling costs are passed on to investors. All the unit and investment trust schemes will accept the top 200 or so UK shares, which includes the privatisations. Some accept any UK-listed share, including those traded on the Unlisted Securities Market, and a few also take gilts or rival companies' unit trusts. Trusts usually set a minimum value for packages of shares they will accept for exchange, generally in the Pounds 250 to Pounds 1,000 range. But if your shareholding is too small even for this, you can often make up the difference in cash. The smallest holding with which anyone can deal is about Pounds 15. Many schemes will treat a family's holdings as one, so it could be worth clubbing together if you all have a few shares in the same company. One drawback with investing via an investment trust savings scheme can be loss of control over timing. The schemes tend to store up all orders received and deal once a week, or even once a month, and there could be a delay of up to three weeks between when shares are sold and the proceeds are re-invested. If this worries you, ask about it: some schemes will speed up your business for an extra charge. Share exchange schemes are much more common with unit trusts than investment trusts. It is only within the past five or 10 years that most investment trusts have built up a direct relationship with their investors by offering savings schemes so that members of the public could, in effect, buy directly from the managers. But unit trusts have been used to dealing direct with customers all along. Investment trust groups offering share exchange schemes include Alliance/Second Alliance, Dunedin, Edinburgh Fund Managers, Fleming, Foreign &amp; Colonial, Framlington, Gartmore, John Govett, Henderson Touche Remnant and Murray Johnstone. There are more than 100 unit trust managers, and around half of them operate share exchange schemes including most of the big names such as Fidelity, Gartmore, Invesco, M&amp;G, Mercury, Perpetual and Save &amp; Prosper. The Unit Trust Directory, published by the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds*, includes details of which unit trust groups have share exchange schemes. But the fact that a good share-swap scheme is available should not be the main factor in picking a trust. There is no point in saving a few pounds on a share transaction, only to lose out in terms of long-term growth. Past performance can help show which trusts are well managed, but it is better to look for consistency over several years rather than outstanding performance over just one. Performance statistics and other investment trust details are included in the monthly information service from the Association of Investment Trust Companies*, which costs Pounds 28 for a year's subscription. Unit trust performance tables can be found in the monthly Money Management magazine. *Association of Investment Trust Companies, 6th Floor, Park House, 16 Finsbury Circus, London EC2M 7JJ (tel: 071-431 5222); Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds, Unit Trust Information Service, 65 Kingsway, London WC2B 6TD (081-207 1361).</p>

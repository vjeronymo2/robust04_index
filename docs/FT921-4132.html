			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market report Gold was again testing the key Dollars 348 support level on the London bullion market and Comex yesterday. 'The market seems to be in a stand-off right now,' a New York analyst said at midday. 'The charts are weak, but until support at Dollars 348 can be broken, gold will not drop sharply.' Lack of investor interest continues to plague the market. Speculators still consider stocks and bonds better investments and fears of inflation have disappeared. On the LME three-month aluminium closed slightly ahead, but the market lacked the momentum to move back over Dollars 1,300 a tonne. Dealers said today's relatively small 2,200-tonne rise in LME stocks was constructive. January producer data, with total IPAI inventories up 40,000 tonnes, did not affect the market as the inclusion of Iranian data for the first time negated month-on-month comparisons. New York arabica coffee futures were firm at midday after recouping earlier losses. The market was awaiting a meeting of Brazilian coffee exporters who were due yesterday afternoon to discuss a possible return to an international pact with export quotas. In Chicago wheat futures plunged more than 7 cents shortly after midday on reports of unrest in the CIS. Compiled from Reuters</p>

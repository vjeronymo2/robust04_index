			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of International Hotels (6): A shortage of customers persists - Hotels across Europe have suffered in the recession When Ciga, the debt-laden Italian luxury hotel chain, went on sale last year, potential buyers were almost crushed in the rush. Forte, the UK hotel group and an early front-runner, admitted defeat when it decided the sums being offered were more than its shareholders would be willing to bear. Mr Stephen Bollenbach, president and chief executive officer of Host Marriott of the US, another unsuccessful bidder, says he was extremely disappointed not to have captured the chain - which lost L195.43bn last year. The winner, ITT Sheraton of the US, paid more than L900bn for Ciga, a sum which left the hotel industry gaping with astonishment. What did all the potential buyers see in a company in such a parlous financial state? Ciga's properties are certainly prestigious; they include the Grand in Rome and the Danieli in Venice. But not only is Ciga a financially troubled group; it also operates in a severely depressed market. Most European hotel markets are suffering from a shortage of customers. Mr Michael Ball, sales and marketing director of Utell International, which handles reservations for hotels around the world, says: 'The economic outlook for Germany, Spain and Italy must remain at best questionable.' Hotels in France have suffered in the recession. Mr Bryan Langton, chairman of Holiday Inn, says that while the volume of business in Germany has not dropped, 'we're seeing dramatic pressure on room rates of the sort we saw in the UK when it went into recession'. The UK, and London in particular, is seen by several hotel groups as the only bright spot in an otherwise gloomy market. But a recent survey by the Horwath hotels and leisure consulting group throws into question how robust the UK recovery really is. Mr Geoff Parkinson, a Horwath director, says the performance of hotels in England last year was 'patchy and inconsistent'. The survey, conducted in association with the English Tourist Board, found that average room occupancy last year was 48 per cent, the same as in 1992 and well below the figure of 57 per cent achieved in 1989 and 1990. In London, which some people in the industry believe is achieving better results than the UK provinces, occupancy actually deteriorated last year. It was down to 56 per cent, compared with 57 per cent in 1992. The capital's luxury hotels - those charging more than Pounds 85.50 a night - achieved annual occupancy of 65 per cent: reasonably healthy but still no higher than 1992. The last quarter of 1993 was particularly disappointing for this category of hotel. The lowest priced hotels in London - those charging less than Pounds 56 a night - suffered a fall in occupancy to 52 per cent from 57 per cent in 1992. The only encouraging sign in the London market was hotels that charge between Pounds 56 and Pounds 85.50 a night. Their occupancy rose to 57 per cent last year from 53 per cent in 1992. But even this compares with a figure of 71 per cent in 1989. Mr Parkinson did see some cheer in the survey results. He says: 'What the figures do show is that the slide in occupancy, which took place in 1991 and 1992, has stopped. First indications are that 1994 will begin to show an improvement.' He warns, however, that low occupancy had led to a decline in achieved room rates. This 'leaves little margin for re-investment - something which, for many hotels, is now becoming urgent.' If this was the trading picture in Europe's healthiest market, why are some investors still so keen on buying hotels? Mr Paul Slattery, a hotels analyst with Kleinwort Benson, believes that one needs to look beyond the current European economic downturn. In the UK, he believes that hotel-using companies are likely to retain the system of strict cost controls they developed during the recession. They will increasingly book rooms through large hotel reservations organisations. Despite the current French recession, Mr Slattery is optimistic about the longer-term outlook for the country's hotels. France's expanding national chains of retailers and financial services companies will generate increased business for hotels around the country, Mr Slattery believes. He adds that France's privatisation programme will increase hotel use too; newly-privatised groups will be hungry for business, sending their employees travelling to win new contracts. Mr Slattery argues that the longer-term outlook for German hotels is also cheerful. The country's economy is heading for a period of restructuring. The manufacturing sector will have to increase productivity and reduce wage costs to compete internationally, but the service sector will grow, generating increased demand for hotel rooms. Mr Roger Garland, executive vice president of Four Seasons Hotels, the Toronto-based luxury hotels groups, argues that too many of Europe's prestigious establishments are unsuited to the needs of the modern business traveller. He says: 'There's a significant opportunity to build modern, highly-efficient hotels in the European market. If you look carefully at any European market, you'll see hotels with a lot of style but which are badly run.'</p>

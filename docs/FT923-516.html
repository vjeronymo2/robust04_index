			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Observer: Talking shop What better occupation for an out of work politician than being a chat show host? Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock is to take over BBC Radio's Jimmy Young show for a week in November, and there are rumours that David Mellor might stand in on the Wogan show. Brian Walden, the former Labour MP, has made a much bigger hit on TV than he ever did in parliament, as has Robert Kilroy-Silk. Charles Kennedy, the Liberal Democrat president and stand-in presenter on radio's 'Start the week', is another MP who sometimes seems to be in the wrong business. Will the prattling party now be joined by Labour's Bryan Gould? If he's preparing to make his political exit, he should have no difficulty finding a TV spot. Besides being an accomplished reporter at Thames TV in the early 1980's, he is said to have once turned down the chance of replacing Walden on Weekend World. Given that Gould's 54th birthday is only a few months away, a final career as a TV personality is a tempting alternative.</p>

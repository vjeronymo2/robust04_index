			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / MPs bow to anger over incomprehensible tax form JUST when the Italian authorities had begun to instil in their fellow countrymen the civic concept of paying taxes, they have scored a spectacular own goal. The tax form drawn up for this year's declarations is so complex that it has provoked a chorus of protest and threats of non-payment. As a result, parliament yesterday approved a slippage in today's deadline for submitting tax returns - the notorious form 740 - and slashed the normally stiff penalties for late submissions and incorrectly compiled declarations. Former premier Giuliano Amato has already issued a public mea culpa for the contorted language and incomprehensible nature of the returns. Even by the standards of Italian bureaucracy, the 1993 '740' is numbingly non-user friendly as it attempts to guide the tax-payer through the assortment of taxes, duties and benefit items. By the calculations of one newspaper, Italians face paying up to 202 different taxes and stamp duties. Of these, 51 are payable to local entities and 21 affect personal wealth and corporate earnings. One television chat show host even brought on a poet this week to analyse the dense language of the 740. But the poet was too beside himself with anger over having to pay taxes to offer any advice on scanning. In one of its rare popular acts of late, parliament this week wrung a statement from Mr Franco Gallo, the finance minister, that in future tax forms would be simplified. Ironically, this was the first attempt by the authorities to clamp down on evasion and convince Italians it was time to pay more taxes. In place is a sophisticated model estimating notional average earnings of different groups, and applying minimal tax demands on these earnings. Many employers were discovered last year to be declaring earnings lower than that of their employees] This was accompanied by an amnesty on unpaid back taxes. The completion date, which has already slipped twice, has been put back to July 15. Instead of paying up to 40 per cent of tax estimates as a penalty for late submission, the fine was fixed yesterday on a sliding scale from 1 to 3 per cent up to July 15.</p>

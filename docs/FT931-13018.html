			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / EC may ban tankers from some coast areas EC TRANSPORT and environ -ment ministers were last night examining the possibility of excluding oil tankers from waters near environmentally sensitive areas, following tanker disasters off the Shetland Islands and north-west Spain, writes David Gardner in Brussels. No decisions were expected from yesterday's unscheduled meeting, which was called, EC diplomats acknowledged, to demonstrate politically that the Community intends to act. Transport ministers are to examine a forthcoming report on maritime safety by the European Commission at their meeting in March, and expect to agree on priority measures in June, according to Mr John MacGregor, the UK transport secretary. One possibility is for the EC to draw up a mandatory new routing system for vessels, to keep them away from vulnerable marine life areas. Shell International Petroleum said yesterday that about 20 per cent of the world's tankers were substandard and should be forced out of business, AP reports from London. The ensuing rise in freight rates would allow shipowners to replace ageing vessels with newer ones.</p>

			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MCDONNELL'S DEBT DOWNGRADED BY MOODY'S AND S&amp;P  </P> <P> In a widely expected move, Wall Street Friday downgraded the ratings of  McDonnell Douglas debt, citing the beleaguered aerospace firm's deteriorating  financial position.  </P> <P> The downgrading, by both Moody's Investors Service and Standard &amp; Poor's  Corp., will affect about $3 billion in long-term debt and increase interest  expenses on an additional $1 billion the company is expected to borrow by the  end of the year.  </P> <P> The lower ratings reflect cost overruns on McDonnell's A-12 and T-45 military  aircraft programs, hefty cash requirements for its MD-11 airliner and an  overall decline in military spending, analysts said.  </P> <P> The downgrading comes despite an announced $700-million cost-cutting program, a  drastic measure to improve profitability of the ailing St. Louis company. The  program will eliminate up to 17,000 jobs this year, including 9,000 in Southern  California.  </P> <P> "We have seen the company's balance sheet weakening and we have seen certain  liquidity pressures," said Tassos Philippakos, aerospace analyst for Moody's.  "It is possible that the company's balance sheet will weaken even further, at  least in the near term."  </P> <P> Moody's lowered McDonnell's senior debt rating to Baa3 from Baa1 and that on  subordinated debt to Ba2 from Baa2. The service also downgraded McDonnell's  commercial paper and shelf registration ratings.  </P> <P> In addition, Moody's lowered the debt ratings of McDonnell Douglas Finance Co.,  a financial subsidiary with $2.5 billion of debt.  </P> <P> S&amp;P announced similar downgradings, decreasing McDonnell's senior debt to  BBB-plus from single-A-minus, its subordinated debt to BBB from BBB-plus and  shelf-registered debt to BBB-plus from A-minus.  </P> <P> S&amp;P did not downgrade McDonnell Douglas Finance Co.'s senior and  subordinated debt, but held them on its watch list.  </P> <P> All of McDonnell's debt is still considered investment grade, although the Baa3  ranking that Moody's gave the corporation's senior debt is just above its  "speculative" grades.  </P> <P> In announcing the downgradings, the ratings services cited potential cost  overruns on McDonnell's A-12 attack jet and T-45 trainer programs. McDonnell  disclosed this month that it would not take a charge against second-quarter  earnings for its highly classified A-12 program for the U.S. Navy.  </P> <P> Instead, McDonnell will ask the Navy to cover cost overruns on the fixed-price  contract.  </P> <P> "We believe there is a good possibility, although management has decided it  would not take writeoffs, eventually, it may have to," Philippakos said.  </P> <P> In addition, McDonnell's Douglas Aircraft unit faces a short-term cash drain in  connection with its MD-11 airliner. Citing inefficiencies, technical problems  and delays, analysts estimate that Douglas will lose $100 million in 1990,  following a $222-million loss in 1989.  </P> <P> Although orders for 157 MD-11's eventually will brighten McDonnell's cash  position, development costs could strain the company until the new aircraft  wins Federal Aviation Administration approval, analysts said.  </P> <P> The company is pushing for an Oct. 31 approval, a goal that could prove  ambitious, said Lawrence M. Harris, a senior analyst for the Los Angeles-based  Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards investment firm."  </P> <P> Harris estimated that McDonnell needs to borrow an additional $1 billion during  the rest of the year to finance inventory growth stemming in part from the  MD-11 program. Friday's downgrading will mean higher interest costs on the  borrowing, he said.  </P> <P> By the end of June, McDonnell's debt, including that of its financial  subsidiary, was $5.2 billion, Harris said.  </P> <P> Analysts and the company predict little impact on the operations.  </P> <P> "It's basically like your kid getting a slightly lower grade in school," said  Wolfgang Demisch, an aerospace analyst with UBS Securities in New York. "But  it's not like he's going to drop out or anything like that."  </P> <P> McDonnell spokesman Barbara Anderson, also predicting no disruption of  operations said: "McDonnell Douglas does not feel its performance, financial  condition or future prospects warrants these measures."  </P> <P> Because McDonnell's debt has been on the ratings services' watch lists since  June, Friday's announcements drew little surprise from Wall Street. McDonnell  stock closed at $42.75 a share Friday, up 12 1/2 cents.  </P></p>

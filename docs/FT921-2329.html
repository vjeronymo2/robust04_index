			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Lautro may force refunds on life policies UP TO 20 life insurance companies could be forced by regulators to make refunds to policyholders on the industry's most successful product last year. Lautro, the life industry's watchdog, has set a deadline of early next month for insurance companies to submit for scrutiny all advertising material involving so-called single-premium with-profits bonds. Advertising deemed to be misleading will have to be changed, and customers who relied on it will be able to claim compensation. It is the first time that Lautro has ordered such a sweeping review of a mainstream life industry product. In particular, Lautro is concerned that investors have been led by sales agents to believe that the policies are simply a higher yielding version of building society deposit accounts and that they may retrieve their funds in full at any time. In fact, investors can face some delay in withdrawing funds, and interest rates are not guaranteed. Insurance companies whose advertising literature is found to be misleading will be asked to write to all policyholders explaining the product more accurately. Those policyholders who then feel they have been misled may be entitled to refunds. The companies said yesterday that they did not believe their own literature ran counter to Lautro rules. Lautro's order follows a review by its monitoring committee, begun in November, which had received complaints from investors. There were also press reports about allegedly misleading advertising. A Lautro official said that, following the complaints, the monitoring committee had reviewed the advertising of six companies and decided an industry review was needed. The adverts did not all make clear that the products were unsuitable as a short-term investment, that the insurance company had a right to adjust the value of the contract or that current bonus rates were not a good guide to future bonus rates. According to the Association of British Insurers, with-profits bonds made up the biggest share of the Pounds 3.06bn in non-linked single premium business sold by insurers last year. Sales in that category topped all others and soared by 76 per cent over 1990. The two largest suppliers of with-profits bonds, Norwich Union and Prudential Holborn, have sold a total of more than Pounds 1.1bn in the past year. Other leading suppliers are Sun Life, Eagle Star, Equitable Life and Friends Provident. Mr Tony Kempster, managing director of Prudential Holborn, which has sold Pounds 450m of with-profits bonds since May, said the company was reviewing its advertising materials for the third time in recent months.</p>

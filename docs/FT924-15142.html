			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Government Bonds: Bunds offer safe haven from European weakness EUROPEAN bond prices were driven primarily by movements in the foreign exchange and stock markets yesterday. Bunds benefited from the strength of the D-Mark, while most of the other European bond markets suffered due to further currency weakness. However, sliding stock market prices throughout Europe encouraged some switching into bonds later in the day. GILT prices fell sharply due to pressure on the pound and the lack of any coherent economic policy following sterling's withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism. Renewed currency weakness intensified fears that further interest rate cuts will not be forthcoming, dealers said. Long-dated gilts received a further battering, ending a point lower as inflationary fears caused a further steepening of the yield curve. 'An inflation risk premium is being built into the long end of the market,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon, economist at Citibank. Short and medium-dated gilts recovered some lost ground, as the slide in UK stock prices prompted switching into bonds. Following the recent slide in the long-end of the market, 25-year gilts are currently yielding more than 9 1/2 per cent. 'The closer long-dated yields are to 10 per cent, the more attractive they will become,' said Mr Simon Briscoe, economist at Midland Montagu. 'The likelihood is that we will cut interest rates before the rest of the (European) bloc.' The policy vacuum following sterling's withdrawal from the ERM continues to sap confidence in the government's ability to tackle the crisis, dealers said. Traders will be watching the Conservative party conference, which starts today, for signs of a fresh economic policy. However, most analysts expect that detailed plans will not be revealed until the autumn statement, although some hints could emerge after Monday's Treasury committee meeting. The long gilt future on Liffe ended at 95.03, down from Friday's close of 95.28. US Treasury prices eased at the long end yesterday after concern about the deficit and the lack of an interest rate cut erased early gains achieved on the back of a weak equity market. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/4 at 98 - half a point below its high for the day - yielding 7.348 per cent. The two-year note was unchanged at 100 19/32 , yielding 3.670 per cent. An early 100-point loss on the Dow Jones Industrial Average prompted some investors to switch out of stocks and into government securities in the first few hours of trading. This was most noticeable at the short end of the market, which provided a boost to everything from two-year to 10-year notes. Although bonds joined in the early gains, they fell back later as equity prices retraced their steps, and on concern that whichever political party wins in November will ultimately do little to reduce the deficit. THE GERMAN bund market benefited from its safe haven status as the D-Mark gained ground against other European currencies. Because of the strength of the currency, the German authorities will be able to ease interest rates at will, while most European governments are constrained by currency considerations. Growing evidence that the German economy is slowing is boosting hopes that an easing of German monetary policy is on the horizon. Traders said the bund market benefited from a repatriation of funds by German investors from other bond markets, as well as switching from the German stock market, which fell 4 per cent yesterday, into bunds. The bund future on Liffe ended at 91.78, up from Friday's close of 91.45. ITALIAN bonds continued their downward spiral yesterday as the lira slid in the foreign exchange market. Dealers said last week's three, five and seven-year government bond auctions and yesterday's 10-year auction helped push prices down. As cash market liquidity dries up, trading is becoming concentrated on the futures market. The Italian BTP contract on Liffe ended at 88.70 yesterday, down from Friday's close of 90.89, in volume of 16,000 contracts. PRESSURE on the franc caused French bonds to fall sharply, but prices benefited from a drop of more than 4 per cent in the French stock market. Although the franc lost a couple of pfennigs, it remained comfortably above its ERM floor. The French OAT future on the Matif exchange in Paris hit a low of 108.72, before recovering to close at 109.14, only 10 basis points below Friday's close. JAPANESE government bond prices ended flat, although the tone remains bullish as the strength of the yen continues to encourage international investors taking funds out of weak European bond markets.</p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Dollar vigil continues The US currency weakened by more than a pfennig yesterday as markets continued their dollar vigil amid a raft of key policy meetings culminating in the weekend G7 summit in Naples, writes Philip Gawith. The growing consensus in the market that no dollar support package is likely to emerge weakened the US currency, which closed in London at DM1.5826 from DM1.5965 and against the yen at Y98.825 from Y98.9. In New York it finished at DM1.5802 and Y98.925. Elsewhere in Europe the high-yielding currencies - particularly the Italian lira, Belgian franc and Swedish krona - were under pressure as markets focused on their large budget deficits. Sterling closed at DM2.438, a nine-month low, as the weak dollar dragged it down against the German currency. The South African financial rand - the foreign investment currency - ended at R4.845 against the dollar from R4.725 after it emerged that Mr Derek Keys, the country's influential finance minister, would be resigning later this year. As the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Fed, started its meeting, markets were increasingly sceptical of the prospect of any supportive rate moves either in the US or Germany. The Bundesbank council meets tomorrow, and dollar bulls were hoping that lower German rates, in tandem with a tightening of US policy, might bolster the currency. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at Bank of America in London, said the market was starting to get short of dollars. He said comments from senior financial officials, downplaying the prospect of concerted intervention, had encouraged the markets to sell dollars. Mr Theo Waigel, for example, the German finance minister, said Germany would not propose the dollar's exchange rate as a subject for discussion at the Naples summit. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, said the market was, if anything, faced with a yen crisis, not a dollar crisis. He noted that the dollar was actually stronger against the currencies of its two main trading partners - Canada and Mexico. The dollar is also in the middle of its recent trading range against the D-Mark, between the all-time low of around DM1.40, and the high this year of DM1.77. Mr MacKinnon said that inasmuch as central banks were concerned with the dollar, it was because of 'perceived adverse affects on global financial markets'. He noted, however, that there are numerous fundamental reasons why, for example, US bond yields should have risen this year. These include fears about future inflation, a global capital shortage and the role of leveraged investors. The Citibank analyst said, therefore, that he was 'not convinced that intervention and higher interest rates will strengthen the dollar - and even if they do, that a stronger dollar will undo the damage that we have seen in the bond markets'. Although the dollar is trending weaker, Mr Hawkins said the market was wary about selling it aggressively short for fear of being caught in a bear trap, where concerted central bank intervention would move the currency sharply higher. The Swedish krona slipped sharply after comments from the finance minister downgrading the GDP forecast, and raising the budget deficit forecast from SKr150bn to SKr160bn. These bad economic numbers come against a complicated political backdrop, with general elections scheduled in September and the country facing a potentially difficult referendum on joining the European Union. The krona closed at SKr4.955 from SKr4.890 against the D-Mark. Mr MacKinnon of Citibank said it was certainly possible that the krona would again slip to the low of SKr5.05 that it touched last year. Two other European countries with large budget deficits, Italy and Belgium, also saw their currencies weaken. The lira fell back to L993.8 per D-Mark from L990.6 while the Belgian franc dipped to BFr20.63 from BFr20.61. Analysts said the move in the Belgian franc was large considering the tight trading range the currency normally occupies. The financial rand ended at R4.845 against the dollar, from R4.725 on Monday, but traders noted that the currency had bounced off a low of R4.95-8, with some investors sensing value at these lower levels. The focus of the market now is on who will succeed Mr Keys. Market speculation favours Mr Conrad Strauss, chairman of the Standard Bank group, whose appointment would probably calm market nerves. Activity in the futures markets remained fairly subdued, with trading ranges narrow at the short end of the market. The December Eurosterling contract finished unchanged at 93.73, while the December Euromark contract closed at 94.95 from 94.97. The Bank of England provided late assistance of Pounds 540m to UK money markets after forecasting a Pounds 900m shortage. Earlier the Bank had provided Pounds 187m liquidity to the market.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subsequent RFP/milestones for these initial PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas that are reclassified as serious will be due every 3 years after the original due date for the moderate area SIP. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 43 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Therefore, the second RFP/milestone for the initial nonattainment areas that are reclassified as serious must be achieved by November 15, 1997. The third RFP/milestone achievement date will be November 15, 2000, etc. These RFP/milestones should be addressed by quantifying and comparing the annual incremental emission reductions which result from implementation of BACM/BACT (required within 4 years after the area is reclassified as serious) and from additional measures included in the final serious area SIP to those reductions which were identified in the SIP as quantitative milestones necessary to achieve the NAAQS by the applicable attainment date. The annual incremental emission reductions must be sufficient to assure attainment as expeditiously as practicable but not later than December 31, 2001. In some cases it may also be appropriate to require that the annual incremental emission reductions maintain at least linear progress toward attainment, as discussed earlier.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 43 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The plain terms of section 189(c) require that milestones be achieved ``every 3 years until the area is redesignated attainment'' and, therefore, do not contemplate any breaks in the milestones due to an area's reclassification. Further, reclassifying an area to serious does not obviate the State from controls and emission reductions required in the moderate area implementation plan (see section 189(b)(1)). A continuous series of control measures must be implemented in PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas beginning with RACM (including RACT) and followed by contingency measures which are to be implemented if the moderate area fails to attain. Next, BACM (including BACT) must be implemented within 4 years after the area is reclassified as serious. Subsequently, it may be necessary to implement additional control measures beyond BACM/BACT to attain the NAAQS. Therefore, the structure of the Act requires a series of measures which can provide for RFP/milestones.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. RFP/Milestone Report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State must demonstrate to EPA, within 90 days after the milestone achievement date, that the SIP measures are being implemented and the RFP/quantitative milestones have been met (see section 189(c)(2)). The RFP/milestone report must be submitted from the Governor or Governor's designee to the Regional Administrator of the respective EPA Regional Office which serves the State where the affected area is located.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The RFP/milestone report must contain technical support sufficient to document completion statistics for appropriate milestones. For example, the demonstration should graphically display RFP over the course of the relevant 3 years and indicate how the emission reductions achieved to date compare to those required or scheduled to meet RFP and the required milestones. The calculations (and any assumptions made) necessary to determine the emission reductions to date should also be submitted. The demonstration should also contain an evaluation of whether the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS will be attained by the projected attainment date in the SIP, i.e., answer the question ``Are the emission reductions to date sufficient to ensure timely attainment?''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Within 90 days of its receipt, EPA must determine whether or not the State's demonstration is adequate and meets all the requirements discussed above. The EPA will notify the State of its determination by sending a letter to the appropriate Governor or Governor's designee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Failure to Submit RFP/Milestone Report or Meet RFP/Milestones  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If a State fails to submit the RFP/milestone report within the required timeframes or if EPA determines that the State has not met any applicable RFP/milestone, EPA shall require the State, within 9 months after such failure or determination, to submit a plan revision that assures that the State will achieve the next milestone (or attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS, if there is no next milestone) by the applicable date (see section 189(c)(3)). For example, with respect to RFP, if the required annual emission reductions are not achieved for the relevant years according to the RFP schedule and the implementing milestone requirement, EPA will require the State to submit a SIP revision so that these deviations can be corrected and attainment assured by the applicable date. This would also necessitate implementation of appropriate contingency measures pursuant to section 172(c)(9).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

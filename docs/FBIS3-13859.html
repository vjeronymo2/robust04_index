Following the first  round of talks this afternoon between'Arafat and Ross, which  lasted for one and a half hours, Dennis Ross said the meeting  was useful. However, he did not elaborate.    We learned that the meeting focused on listening to the  Palestinian viewpoint following the issuance of the Security  Council resolution condemning the Hebron massacre. The  Palestinian side said that what is required from Washington now  -- in its capacity as one of the cosponsors -- is to intervene  effectively to implement the provisions of Resolution 904,  particularly regarding international protection for the  Palestinian people under occupation. It cannot just be  satisfied with listening to the Palestinian and Israeli  viewpoints but must try to bring them closer.    The Palestinian side underscored the need for an  international security force in the occupied territory, not just  observers. The Palestinian side also reiterated the need for  reaching a clear solution to the issue of settlers in Hebron and  for disarming them.    Dennis Ross is expected to meet with the Israeli delegation  led by Amnon Shahaq before resuming his talks with the  Palestinian leadership this evening.</p>

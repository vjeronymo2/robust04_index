			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei down amid regional uncertainty Technical trading dominated the day's activity, with most investors absent ahead of the G7 meeting in Naples. The Nikkei index declined on arbitrage-linked selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225 average lost 93.51 to 20,526.51, marginally lower on the week. It saw a high of 20,691.84 in the morning on buying by individual investors, but institutional and foreign investors remained inactive and the index touched a low of 20,440.09 in the last hour of trading. Volume totalled 342m shares against 283m. Traders said the bulk of the business was linked to the settlement of July index options contracts. Investors also remained sidelined ahead of the US employment figures, which are expected to give some indication of short-term US monetary policy. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 7.55 to 1,660.88 while the Nikkei 300 lost 1.37 to 301.48. Losers outnumbered gainers by 640 to 318 with 206 unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.21 to 1,347.54. Terumo, the disposable medical equipment supply manufacturer, which saw its share price rise earlier in the week on its development of a three dimensional television, fell Y50 to Y1,120 on profit taking. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y6,000 to Y855,000 on reports that the company's office was being searched by police in connection with the arrest of an employee in an alleged bribery case. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 97.53 to 23,112.00 in volume of 30.3m shares. Roundup The course of US interest rates, yesterday's US jobs data and the start of the G7 summit left several markets apprehensive. HONG KONG's Hang Seng index closed 57.90 down on the day, and another 2.3 per cent lower on the week. Turnover shrank from HKDollars 3.37bn to a preliminary HKDollars 2.48bn. Luoyang Glass H shares made their debut at HKDollars 3.31 and tumbled to HKDollars 2.92 at the close, against their public offer price of HKDollars 3.65. BANGKOK fell after the Thai opposition filed no-confidence motions against four government ministers and the deputy prime minister, Amnuay Viravan resigned his posts in the coalition government and his own party. The SET index fell 15.52 to 1,287.34, up 1.1 per cent on the week, in moderate turnover of Bt5.07bn. MANILA took profits and the composite index dropped 45.38 to 2,583.85, 4.1 per cent lower on the week with the telephone stock, PLDT down 3.8 per cent to its year's low of 1,480 pesos. WELLINGTON hit a new 1994 low with the NZSE-40 index down 10.33 at 1,955.93, off 1.4 per cent with brokers fairly phlegmatic about the marking down process. TAIPEI put on 1.6 per cent in heavy trade, led by financials, electronics and some fund shares. The weighted index rose 96.45 to 6,191.79, or 4.4 per cent higher on the week. SYDNEY rallied in late trade to finish marginally stronger, helped by a round of afternoon bargain-hunting. The All Ordinaries index finished 2.7 higher at 1,964.9, off its intraday low of 1,957.0, and unchanged on the week. KUALA LUMPUR rebounded from early doldrums to close higher in retail-led buying, sparked by expectations of a technical rebound following one-and-a-half weeks of sluggish trade and growing expectations of elections. The composite index ended 6.41 higher at 987.78, but still 1.6 per cent lower over the week. SINGAPORE overcame recent weakness as bargain hunting developed at the lower levels and the Straits Times Industrials index ended 16.93 higher at 2,162.94, still 2.2 per cent lower on the week. SEOUL saw a technical rebound following recent retreats and the composite stock index added 3.25 to 948.96 for a 1.4 per cent rise on the week. Financials lost momentum after the government decided to delay a plan to foster financial conglomerates. JAKARTA was mixed in moderate trading although activity picked up on news that the government planned to raise its 49 per cent limit on foreign share ownership. The official index ended 1.90 lower to close at 452.20, for a 1.3 per cent rise on the week.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, December 29 (BTA) -- President of the  Republic Dr. Zhelyu Zhelev agreed to receive on January 13, 1994  Mrs. Madeleine Albright in her capacity as special envoy to  Bulgaria of U.S. President Bill Clinton, reporters learnt today  from Dr. Zhelev's foreign policy advisor Kamen Velichkov.    Mr. Velichkov specified that the purpose of the visit of  Mrs.  Albright, who is U.S. permanent representative to the United  Nations, will be to brief the Bulgarian head of state on the  results of the NATO summit due in Brussels on January 10.    Mr. Velichkov pointed out that some time ago President  Clinton sent a message to Dr. Zhelev, expressing his agreement  and desire to take into account Bulgaria's position on the  exceedingly important and relevant issue of Bulgaria's bid to  join the North Atlantic Alliance.    In his reply, Dr. Zhelev's advisor said, the Bulgarian  president agrees to receive Mrs. Albright and reaffirms his and  this country's principled and reasoned position in favour of  Bulgaria's cooperation with NATO and its future participation in  the alliance.    One important point in Dr. Zhelev's reply message is the  fact  that Bulgaria became the first country in Eastern Europe whose  legislature took a stand on this pressing issue, which is  important for all Central and East European countries, Mr.  Velichkov said. Last week the Bulgarian Parliament voted a  declaration on cooperation with NATO.    The message is part of an ongoing dialogue which started at  the meeting of the two presidents earlier this year and which  will continue with the forthcoming visit to Bulgaria by the  special envoy of the U.S. President, Mr. Velichkov said.</p>

			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ESTANCIA'S LY DISCOVERS RIGHT SPORT TO BE A STAR;  </P> <P> BADMINTON: SENIOR DISCARDED BASKETBALL. NOW HE'S HOPING FOR A RETURN TO  SOUTHERN SECTION FINAL.  </P> <P> Estancia High School badminton Coach Lillian Brabander must cringe when  imagining Hoang Ly with a soft jump shot.  </P> <P> If Ly was dangerous from the outside or had fancy moves inside, he might have  starred on the Eagles' basketball team. Instead, he gave up basketball after  starting on the junior varsity team as a sophomore to concentrate on badminton.  </P> <P> It was a wise choice, said Brabander.  </P> <P> "This kid was born with badminton skills," she said. "He's the Magic Johnson of  badminton. He does everything wonderfully. He has mental and physical gifts."  </P> <P> Ly, a senior, used those gifts well last season. He was 65-1 -- losing only in  the Southern Section singles final -- won five tournaments and was named The  Times' Orange County player of the year.  </P> <P> The appearance in the final, where he lost to Alta Loma's Dan Mussman in three  games, capped a year filled with accomplishments for Ly. He also placed third  in the U.S. Junior Nationals and won the Southern California Junior Nationals.  </P> <P> Ly, who opened his senior season by winning the singles title at a tournament  at Garden Grove March 2, is ranked second nationally in the junior division by  the U.S. Badminton Assn.  </P> <P> Ly, 19, has only three years of playing experience. But he realized the first  time he held a racquet that the sport felt right.  </P> <P> "For most beginners, you have to teach them how to hold a racquet, but when I  first tried I already knew how to hold it," he said. "Some players can't hit  the bird when they first start out, but I could hit it hard when I started. I'm  a natural, I guess."  </P> <P> Brabander, who has coached badminton at Estancia since 1967, said she has never  seen a player develop as quickly as Ly.  </P> <P> "Wow, was he ever a natural," she said. "He has the eye. That bird travels  faster than any other object in sports. Your eye needs to be able to see it  coming, see where you should place it and then make the connection. You can't  coach what this kid's got."  </P> <P> However, Ly said he still is learning the sport's finer points. Despite last  season's impressive record, he was unhappy with his serve and bothered by  inconsistent play.  </P> <P> "Last year my strength was smashing," he said. "I think my offense and defense  are balanced now. This year, I have everything."  </P> <P> One thing eludes Ly: a Southern Section singles championship.  </P> <P> The loss to Mussman last season, 15-12, 14-17, 18-16, was Ly's second  consecutive defeat in the final. As a sophomore, he lost to Diamond Bar's Marc  Carrido, 15-8, 18-15. Ly has a chance to avenge the loss to Mussman during a  tournament March 23 at Estancia.  </P> <P> "I'm going to beat him this time," said Ly, who won a Southern Section mixed  doubles championship last season. "I'm definitely looking forward to it."  </P> <P> Ly, who will compete in the 1990 junior nationals in June, is considering  attending Arizona State, which Brabander said has the top badminton program in  the country. Ly, however, would rather stay closer to his family and is leaning  toward going to Cal State Long Beach.  </P> <P> Ly's greatest goal, though, is making the U.S. Olympic team. Badminton, a  demonstration sport in 1988, will be a medal sport for the first time at the  1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Spain.  </P> <P> "That's my goal right now, to make the Olympics," he said.  </P></p>

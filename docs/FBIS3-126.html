"The National Party is not the only party  suffering because the ANC cannot control its supporters. It  will also be interesting to see if Mr Mandela takes action  against his supporters who don't heed his words. A large number  of ANC supporters have been found guilty of various crimes, like  smuggling weapons and murder, and no steps have yet been taken  against them."    He hoped to make known details of a pact with neighbouring  "Frontline" states soon about arms smuggling into South Africa.  "We are negotiating with Mozambique, Swaziland and Lesotho, and  although these things take time we are making progress."</p>

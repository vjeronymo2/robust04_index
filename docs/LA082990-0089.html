			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> R.S.V.P.;  </P> <P> BOB HOPE GOLF TOURNEY HOPE-LESS BUT SUCCESSFUL  </P> <P> No Hope  </P> <P> They called it the "Bob Hope-Howard House Golf Tournament," but it was  Hope-less. Organizers of Monday's charity tourney at the Mesa Verde Country  Club in Costa Mesa were certain the big guy would show. Instead, he sent his  wife, Dolores. "He came down with a flu or a stomach ailment and he had a sty  on his eye and he was just back from Vegas so he was real tired," explained  Gloria Osbrink, who heads the local support group for the House Ear Institute  in Los Angeles -- the fund-raiser's beneficiary. Osbrink said she found out  that Hope wasn't coming to the tournament shortly after golfers teed off  Monday. "His agent called the club," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tee for $250  </P> <P> Thirty-one foursomes ponied up $1,000 each and a hundred others paid $50-per  for a post-links filet mignon dinner in the clubhouse. Tourney organizer  Osbrink, who co-founded the fund-raising group with Athalie Clarke three years  ago, estimated net proceeds of about $70,000. Renown ear surgeon Dr. Howard  House parked his clubs on the fourth tee and whacked one up the fairway with  each group.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The 19th Hole  </P> <P> Buzzing in from the links at cocktail hour, the golfers left the sunshine and  tree-spiked vistas for silent auction bidding in a lounge with a full-service  bar a chip shot away. How did it go out there? "We were great," said John  Parry, who played the "best ball" scramble round with Matt Schafnitz and Gary  Boudreau. "I might as well start lying about it now." Duke Cooper hunkered down  at a window seat with his golf mates Chet Houston, Bill Dawson and Joe Van Der  Meulen. "It's a nice, sporty course," Cooper said. "We tried to be sporty,  too," Dawson added. Harry Boand and his wife, Jaynne, carded 74 with their Big  Canyon neighbors Betty Jane and Dick Smith. Karen and Frank Amelio of San Diego  kicked out the jams with partners Damian Seiler and Dan Chambers -- a lean 60  on a par-71 course. "We went nuts," Seiler said. But that wasn't the only  thrill of the day for the Amelios. "My husband had surgery (at the House Ear  Institute) in '84, six months before we got married," Karen said. "I met Dr.  House today and thanked him for my husband's life."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Faces  </P> <P> Famously nipped and tucked comedian Phyllis Diller -- a former patient of the  good doctor House -- stirred the rubberneckers and shoulder-shovers in the  crowd into action when she arrived for cocktails. She wore green knickers and a  huge diamond "P" dangling on her neck, and she popped her eyes wide for every  camera turned her way. For celeb-hunters, there were also singer/dancer Nanette  Fabray, TV actor Claude Akins and a man introduced at dinner as "Don Porter --  remember Gidget's father? Remember Sally Field's father?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Faces, Part 2  </P> <P> JoAnne Stewart and Ron Osbrink co-chaired the event. Committee members included  John Lusk, Sue Jarvie, Mary Lou Hornsby, Mary Ann Wells, Kay and John Turner,  Tina Schafnitz, Anthony Montapert, Athena and Peter Pitchess, Woody Smith,  Margaret Anderson, Anne and Bob Badham, Kim Cardenas, Patty and Harry Brown,  Sandy and Gerry Brodie, Bill Rouey, Bill Russell and Barbara Glabman.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Qoute  </P> <P> Called up to address the group during dinner, Dr. House took the microphone and  said, "Can you hear me all right? I guess that's the first question I always  ask." PAMELA MARIN  </P></p>

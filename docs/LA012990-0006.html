			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> EARTH DAY IS BACK TO FACE GROWING CHALLENGES, DANGERS  </P> <P> On the first Earth Day in 1970, Jeanne Davies remembers, students at Monte  Vista High School in Spring Valley set out to save the world.  </P> <P> Instead of holding classes on that sunny April day, Davies and her fellow Monte  Vista teachers organized an environmental symposium. Teen-agers wearing green  armbands sat outside on the lawn, listening to speakers talk about air  pollution, energy conservation and the dangers of urban sprawl.  </P> <P> By day's end, Davies recalls, "The students pointed fingers and said, 'You've  ruined the world for us.' And they decided they would take over Spring Valley.  We drew up traffic patterns, parks, a whole plan for the future. Everyone was  going to go out and save the wilderness, plan cities as they should be planned,  cut down on fuel use."  </P> <P> Two decades later, as San Diego prepares to celebrate the 20th anniversary of  Earth Day, Davies looks back fondly on that idealistic afternoon. But in the  face of today's pressing problems -- a troublesome list that includes ozone  depletion, deforestation and global warming -- her nostalgia is tempered by  what she describes as an urgent need for action.  </P> <P> "Had we gone on from 1970 in our thinking, we wouldn't be in the mess that we  are in today," said Davies, who has retired from teaching and now chairs the  San Diego Sierra Club's recycling committee. "The problems have changed, but  we're fighting the same battle. Where are my students today?"  </P> <P> Beginning this week, a consortium of local environmental groups, colleges and  businesses will kick off a series of environmentally minded events intended to  inspire San Diegans to make a new commitment to protect the planet. The 12  weeks of events, which include a speakers series, concerts and a San Diego Bay  cleanup, will culminate on the 20th anniversary, April 22, in a daylong Earth  Fair in Balboa Park.  </P> <P> Organizers and sponsors of the events say they are taking advantage of what one  political aide calls "a mainstreaming of the environmental movement."  </P> <P> "The environment is not just something for the '60s radicals anymore. It's for  everyone," said Cynthia Vicknair, executive assistant to San Diego City  Councilwoman Judy McCarty, who is seeking to set aside a portion of the April  16 council docket for environmental issues.  </P> <P> Today, in an attempt to build local interest, a private reception and media  conference will be held aboard the schooner Invader. During a tour of the San  Diego Bay, invited guests will sail past the damaged oil tanker Exxon Valdez  and will hear from Norman L. Dean, the National Wildlife Federation's legal  director, who is preparing to sue Exxon for the damage wrought by the tanker's  1989 oil spill off Alaska.  </P> <P> Later, at a reception at Reidy O'Neil's Irish Bar and American Grill in  downtown San Diego, Dean will speak on what many say is the most important  thrust of this year's celebration: "Individual Responsibility: Creating  Environmental Change." (Those interested in attending the reception from 6-8  p.m. should make a reservation by Monday morning by calling Carolyn Chase at  488-6116).  </P> <P> Gaye Soroka, executive director of I Love a Clean San Diego County Inc. and one  of San Diego Earth Day 1990's organizers, believes one of the flaws of the 1970  demonstration was that it emphasized legislative action without stressing how  individuals can make a difference.  </P> <P> The legislative victories that followed that first Earth Day were great: a  tough new Clean Air Act was passed with only a handful of dissenting votes in  both houses of Congress; the Clean Water Act was passed. That same year, the  federal Environmental Protection Agency was established.  </P> <P> But Soroka, who marched in an Earth Day demonstration in Philadelphia in 1970,  said she believes that many of the 20-million Americans who participated across  the country went home with the mistaken impression that protecting the  environment was solely the government's responsibility.  </P> <P> "We had a giant rally, we marched and listened to political speakers and bands,  lay in the sun and drank a lot of beer," said Soroka, who was a college  sophomore at the time. "We signed petitions and then went home. It didn't get  anywhere because it wasn't personalized."  </P> <P> The challenge for Soroka and other Earth Day 1990 organizers, she believes, is  to make this year's celebration a practical "call to action."  </P> <P> "What has to happen is that people say, 'I have to fix it.' That's the critical  thing. If we allow ourselves to be ignorant of where our elected officials  stand, if we don't sort our trash, if we don't pay attention to the products  and packages we buy or . . . if we pour our used oil down a storm drain -- then  we're just as guilty" as industrial polluters that are regulated by the  government, she said.  </P> <P> Soroka says she realizes part of the key is to educate San Diegans not only  about global problems but about local solutions.  </P> <P> "To hear the words 'ozone depletion' doesn't tell me what I can do to help,"  she said, adding that this year's events, many of which are still being  planned, will attempt to give San Diegans concrete suggestions -- from beach  cleanups to recycling to tree-planting to environmentally conscious grocery  shopping -- about what can be done to solve environmental problems.  </P> <P> To provide an incentive for local businesses to get involved, the local Sierra  Club chapter has commissioned a poster that promotes the 1990s as the "Decade  of the Environment." The limited edition commemorative poster, which features  endangered species like the California brown pelican and the San Diego horned  lizard, is available for use by local businesses that create pro-environment  projects.  </P> <P> Greentree Grocers on Mount Acadia Blvd., for example, will sell the $12 poster  at half price with the purchase of a reusable, canvas grocery bag -- an  ecological substitute for paper or plastic sacks.  </P> <P> Similarly, Ben &amp; Jerry's Hillcrest Scoop Shop has joined with the Sierra  Club to promote the Environmental Protection Initiative, which would require  oil spill prevention plans, reduced emissions of gases and regulation of  pesticide use, among other things. The shop, which will display and sell the  commemorative poster, is offering free ice cream cones to customers who bring  in five registered voters' signatures on the initiative ballot.  </P> <P> A broad-based campaign is also under way to get at least 100,000 San Diegans to  sign the Earth Day Pledge, which reads in part, "I pledge to do my share for  the planet by letting my concern for the environment shape how I: educate,  join, purchase, work, vote (and) act." The signed pledges will be distributed  to local politicians and tabulated nationally in an attempt to measure popular  support for the environment.  </P> <P> Finally, at the daylong Earth Fair in Balboa Park on April 22, educational  booths, museum exhibits, art and entertainment will aim to increase San  Diegans' environmental awareness. Included in the events will be a 5K/1-mile  "Run for the Rain Forest" and an Earth Art Show sponsored by the San Diego Art  Institute.  </P> <P> Pre-Earth Day events that are open to the public include:  </P> <P> * Earth Day 1990 Speaker Series, sponsored by the University of San Diego.  Beginning Feb. 7, USD will feature lawyers, authors, professors and political  leaders speaking on topics ranging from chlorofluorocarbons to the past,  present and future of San Diego Bay.  </P> <P> The first speaker, Feb. 7, will be Larry Agran, the mayor of Irvine. Among the  other highlights: David Brower, the director of Earth Island Institute, the  founder of the League of Conservation Voters and Friends of the Earth, as well  as the first executive director of the Sierra Club, will speak on the  preservation of natural resources March 29.  </P> <P> In addition to individual speakers, there will be two panel discussions: "U.S.  and Mexico: Shared Environmental Border Problems" on Feb. 22 and "Oil Spill  Prevention and Response" on March 15. For more information or a calendar of  events, call Melody Ashley, 260-4600, Ext. 2675.  </P> <P> * Two all-day Earth Day fund-raising concerts at the Arts Park in Del Mar. By  mixing jazz, country, folk and rock music with environmental displays,  organizers hope to draw attention to Earth Day and to raise money for the San  Diego Earth Day 1990 Coalition. On Feb. 11, Peter Sprague, Deborah Liv Johnson,  "Bongo" Bob Goldsand and Sonic Bar-B-Q will play from noon to 5 p.m. On March  11, the Wayward Saints, Bucket Ruckus and Nightshift will share the stage. A $3  donation is suggested. For more information or to find out how to set up a  display, call Richard Carter, 755-7025.  </P> <P> * A Feb. 22 panel discussion, "The Packaging Dilemma: Your Choices at the  Check-out." In an effort to show consumers the long-range impact of their  shopping decisions, a spokesman for the plastics industry, an executive from  the Big Bear Supermarkets chain, the editor of the Environmental Business  Journal and the conservation coordinator of the San Diego Sierra Club will  share the podium with San Diego County Supervisor Susan Golding. The panel will  be held at San Diego State University at 7 p.m. For more information, call I  Love A Clean San Diego County, 270-8393.  </P> <P> * In March, soon after the new 1990 telephone books are distributed in San  Diego and Coronado, I Love A Clean San Diego County will launch a phone book  recycling drive. The drive, which will run March 24 through April 8, will be  targeted in the city of San Diego. For more information, call 270-8393.  </P> <P> * On April 7, the San Diego Audubon Society, in cooperation with the California  Native Plant Society, will offer free guided walks to celebrate Earth Day. The  walks, which will each be led by a bird and a plant specialist, will be held in  several locations throughout San Diego County, allowing participants to attend  one close to home. For locations, call the Audubon Society office, 483-7620, or  Alice DeBolt, 459-8159.  </P> <P> To find out more about Earth Day, call 270-8477 or write the San Diego Earth  Day 1990 Coalition, 4901 Morena Blvd., Suite 703, San Diego, Ca. 92117.

A recombinant of PV1 was identified  during the molecular epidemiological survey by using sequence  analysis of the genomic PV1/2A junction region (residues  3296-3445). The PV1 isolates were tested at the beginning by  Sabin 1-specific PCR and Dot hybridization and was excluded from  vaccine-related PV1. Its sequencing data of the 150 nucleotides  shared 97 percent homology to Sabin 1. Expanded sequencing of  its 5'-side revealed many nucleotide substitutions identical to  those of wild PV1 from residue 3262 upward, which indicates the  recombination site at residues 3262/3263 junction. Fourteen of  57 PV1 isolates collected from 13 provinces or autonomous  regions were found to be recombinant by a recombinant-specific  PCR developed by us. The high sequence similarity among them  suggests that these 14 PV1 isolates probably were the progeny of  a recombinant produced by a patient dually infected by wild and  Sabin 1. Studies of virulence, immunogenicity, transmissibility,  etc. of this recombinant are going on.</p>

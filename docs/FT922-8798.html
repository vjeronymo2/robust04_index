			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (11): Key to Angola's survival since independence - The oil industry ANGOLA'S oil industry, largely protected from the vagaries of civil war and political uncertainty, has boomed during the past four years and the success story seems likely to continue for the rest of this decade. Oil has been the key to Angola's survival since independence - the sole underwriter of the war effort and guarantor of its international debts. Within 25 years, Angola has become sub-Sahara's largest producer after Nigeria, with the region's second-biggest reserve base. Recoverable reserve estimates over the next five years for fields in production, under development and those being lined up totals some 4.9bn barrels. Although the oil industry survived the turmoil of independence better than any other sector of the economy, production began to flag in the late 1970s, leading to a reorganisation of the sector between 1976 and 1979. The changes, which included the establishment of Sonangol as the government's business arm responsible for co-ordinating and controlling petroleum activities, resulted in a steady rise in production from 1982. Factors which attracted foreign companies to Angola 10 years ago - low operating costs, prospects for new discoveries and favourable contractual terms offered by Sonangol - are still drawing new investment into the sector. A further attraction is that Angola has never been a member of Opec. This has allowed it flexibility to sell what crude it can produce. Mr Joaquim David, director-general of Sonangol, the state-owned oil company, says with some pride: 'The companies that began with us in the initial years have stayed and new ones have been drawn in.' Peace for the country has coincided with record exploration levels and the discovery of lucrative deep-water wells. Sonangol in turn has begun to offer an innovative licensing regime which is proving highly attractive to foreign companies. Under the regime - known as a 'rate of return' profit oil - the percentage of production left to the investing company varies according to the field's level of productivity. Mr David is optimistic. 'Oil is a growing industry. Our production is five times what it was in the last years of the the Portuguese administration. We have every reason to believe upstream development will grow.' The importance of the sector cannot be over-estimated. Oil accounts for more than 90 per cent of total export earnings. Last year, crude oil exports earned Angola some Dollars 3.15bn compared with Dollars 3.55bn in 1990. The highest level ever of exploration activity in the offshore sector last year is set to assure oil's paramount role in the Angolan economy. A surge of development is now anticipated which should boost output from its 1991 level of 505,000 b/d to 680,000 b/d in 1996. Of the current output of 555,000 b/d, Chevron accounts for 300,000 b/d, Elf 165,000 b/d, Texaco 55,000 b/d, Belgium's Petrofina 30,000 b/d and Italy's Agip 5,000 b/d. In tandem, offshore operators have prepared extensive expansion plans. County NatWest WoodMac, in a report on the the West African oil industry drawn up early this year, estimates that expenditure in Angola will peak in 1993 and 1994 at Dollars 750m each year. Capital investment has grown rapidly over the past 3 years, from Dollars 210m in 1988 to about Dollars 500m in 1991. This compares with a previous high of Dollars 532m (1992 prices) in 1987. Mr Matthew Shaw of County NatWest Woodmac predicts that over the next nine years some Dollars 4.7bn of upstream investment is envisaged, compared with Dollars 3.3bn spent over the past nine years. Those expected to make the biggest commitments are Chevron in Cabinda, Texaco in Block 2 and Elf in Block 3. 'Chevron has a high degree of commitment to our Angola operation. In international terms it is one of the big five. In investment terms it will be at the top during the next three years. After 1995 it should be the biggest in liquid production,' says Mr Bob Connon, managing director of Cabinda Gulf Oil Company (Cabgoc). Cabgoc, in association with Sonangol, Elf Petroleum Angola, and AGIP Angola, operates the offshore concession of Cabinda. Area A of this concession is presently producing 310,000 b/d. The production sharing agreement (PSA) gives Sonangol 41 per cent, Cabgoc 39.2 per cent, Elf 10 per cent and AGIP 9.8 per cent. There is no production yet from the deep-water Areas B and C of the Cabinda concession. However, a three-year contract for the first phase is due to be signed shortly with Setal of Brazil and Lummis of Sweden. The contract covers the structures, treating and pumping equipment and the pipeline to shore. The complete development of the project up to first production, including this contract, is worth more than Dollars 400m. The cost is explained because of the expense of drilling in deeper water of about 350ft. The maximum water depth of current production is slightly over 200ft. The first oil is expected to flow in 1994. Peak production could reach an estimated 100,000 b/d. Mr Connon says the development is comparable to 'three large events in our history in Angola since we started in in 1954.' These included the development of Takula field in 1982, the introduction of waterflooding at Takula and the first development in the Malongo field. Onshore, where activity was effectively stalled by the civil war, drilling is set to be resumed within the next couple of years. In the Cabinda enclave, an area that has not been drilled since Cabgoc relinquished its concession in 1971, BP and Occidental are due to sign new contracts although the first well is not expected until 1994. On the mainland, where the war severely disrupted work, exploration work could resume. Some exploration acreage is already licensed to Fina and in the longer term new areas could be licensed although this is not expected until the end of the decade.</p>

			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Setback for Arjo Paper maker Arjo Wiggins was one of the chief casualties in the FT-SE 100 and also the most heavily traded as the company announced it had lost its finance director. The shares dropped 10 to 265p on turnover of 10m - the highest this year - after it was revealed that Mr Tony Isaac, was leaving to join chemicals group BOC. Mr Isaac had been with the group since its formation in 1990. His departure left only two British non-executives on the board and revived worries of growing domination by Groupe Saint-Louis, the French company which owns 39 per cent of Arjo. BOC shares were up on the news but fell with the sector to end the day 3 lower at 737p. Media conglomerate Pearson fell 31 to 628p after the Financial Times owner's first-half results showed operating losses in the company's book division and the chairman warned progress would be harder for the rest of the year. Profits were up 50 per cent to Pounds 69.3m and within the range of analysts' forecasts but there was concern over the prospects for the second half. Carlton Communications fell 11 to 843p on news reports that approval for a new fifth television channel in the UK was imminent. Its arrival would hit Carlton's control of the lucrative London region. The recent burst of strength in the bank sector spilled over into the sector's two laggards, Barclays and NatWest, which gained ground at the expense of Bank of Scotland. NatWest jumped 7 to 494p after turnover of 3.4m while Barclays moved up 7 to 586p on 6.8m traded. Royal Bank of Scotland edged up 3 1/2 to 434p. TSB, where buying was again stimulated by the buy note published by Hoare Govett in mid-week and which focused on the bank's ability to maintain profit margins and its dividend paying potential, gained 3 1/2 more to 227 1/2 p on turnover of 10m. Abbey National was aggressively bought, the shares moving up 5 1/2 to 420p, after 423p, with Swiss Bank Corporation said to have been a heavy buyer. Schroders, the second largest UK merchant bank by market capitalisation, fell 25 to 1478p and the non-voters 20 to 1393p, as a flurry of profit-taking followed the bank's interim figures, which were at the top end of expectations. SG Warburg, the only merchant bank in the FT-SE 100 index, edged up 6 to 778p in the wake of switching from Schroders. Smith New Court, the securities house regarded as the UK's premier marketmaking firm, moved up 5 to 440p following the elevation of Mr Michael Marks to executive chairman in succession to Sir Michael Richardson who announced his retirement as from December 31. Courtaulds Textiles which reports on Thursday jumped 18 to 511p after agency broker James Capel moved its recommendation from hold to buy. The house cited the long-term growth prospects and the boost to profits from the acquisition of Hartstone's hosiery business. Bowater, reporting on Tuesday, added 7 at 467p and RTZ, reporting on Thursday was 4 stronger at 884p. Retailing group Body Shop continued to shake off the recent gloom and the shares put on another 6 1/2 to 230 1/2 p. Speculation that food and drinks manufacturer Cadbury-Schweppes was considering a bid for Cott, the Canadian soft drinks group, left the shares trailing 7 at 484p, in trade of 2.3m. The shares have been strong performers in recent sessions, boosted by big US buying. NatWest Securities expects its interim profits forecast of Pounds 194m to be exceeded when the company reports figures next week, but said this is already reflected in the share price. The day's biggest rise among FT-SE 100 constituents was recorded in defence and engineering group British Aerospace. The shares closed 15 ahead at 513p, on speculation that a US leasing company was about to place a Dollars 900m order for Airbus aircraft. BAe not only builds the wings of the Airbus series but is also a 20 per cent stake holder in the Airbus consortium. However, several analysts dismissed talk of such an order and said smaller orders may be announced at next week's Farnborough air show. They also attributed the day's interest to general buying ahead of the air show. Engineering group Siebe shook off recent accountancy worries to jump 18 to 590p, as dealers awaited the traditional upbeat statement from the company at Monday's annual meeting. The oil sector was one of the market's better performing areas, led by BP which advanced 8 to 417p on turnover of 7.7m, following keen US buying interest. Shell put on 7 to 752 1/2p on 3.1m traded.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 25 (CNA) -- Taiwan is allowing imports  of seafood from cholera-affected or potential cholera-affected  areas as part of its efforts to join the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the department of health said  Wednesday [25 May].    For health safety, National Quarantine Service Director Wu  Tsung-neng said all fishery produce from cholera-affected areas  will undergo rigorous cholera checks and be kept for three to  four days in customs.    A shipment of frozen salmon from Chile, the first delivery  of  seafood since the government lifted bans on such imports, has  already hit the local market, Wu said.    Most countries impose no restrictions on fishery produce  imports from cholera-affected or potential cholera areas, Wu  said.</p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia and EC agree outlines of solution to aluminium export row RUSSIA HAS agreed with the European Commission the outline of a solution to the row over Russian aluminium exports, although details of the agreement's thorniest component, a ceiling for Russian exports, are yet to be decided. Mr Alexander Shokhin, Russian deputy prime minister for foreign economic relations, said after his return from talks in Brussels that the two sides had agreed a limit on Russian exports, which, once exceeded, would trigger consultations on how to proceed further. But he said that Russia wanted a relatively high ceiling to 'reflect the dynamic of Russian exports' and was opposed to any unilateral decision to impose sanctions on the part of the commission, the European Community's executive body, which temporarily restricted Russian aluminium imports in a 'safeguard' action last August. That action was temporary, to be extended or discontinued until an EC ministerial meeting next month. Russia is believed to have asked for an annual quota of 340,000 tonnes, which would correspond to an almost unhindered level of licensed Russian exports of aluminium destined for end users. Russia estimates another 150,000 tonnes leaves the country each year through other former Soviet republics in illegal exports. The two sides hope to curb this with a new system of double checking that they have already agreed to introduce. Russian officials say the EC has already agreed not to challenge a further 182,000 tonnes destined for further processing at metallurgical plants within the EC. The talks about aluminium are being tied to wider trade negotiations for a partnership agreement which Russia and the European Community hope to sign next year. Russia refused to initial a draft accord this summer on the grounds that its terms sought to benefit EC producers and services in areas where it had a competitive advantage over Russia while 'discriminating' against Russian goods which could compete on EC markets.</p>

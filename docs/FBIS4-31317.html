			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Shefqet Rexhepi on news conference held by Rexhep </F> Gjergji and Fatmir Sejdiu, members of the presidium of the  Kosova Democratic Alliance, in Pristina on 27 May: "Encouraging  Signs for the Albanian Political Movement in Kosova"]    [Text] President Rugova is successfully continuing his  visit to several West European countries. After his visit to  Denmark, he is now in Norway. His high-level reception and the  understanding shown for the Albanians' demands are encouraging  signs for the Albanian political movement in Kosova. On the  first day of his visits president Rugova met the speaker of the  Norwegian parliament, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Committee, the parliamentary groups, and representatives of  charities, who gave their full support to the peaceful policies  of the Albanians and promised Norway's full commitment to  helping to settle the question of Kosova in accordance with the  Albanians' demands. With these comments, Dr. Rexhep Gjergji,  member of the presidium of the Kosova Democratic Alliance [LDK],  opened yesterday's news conference in Prishtina.  <H5>  Voices That Initially Discounted the Elections </H5>   Rexhep Gjergji went on to stress that the recent meeting of  President Berisha and Gligorov in Poeradec was conducted as part  of a commuted Albanian policy to settle through democratic means  all the outstanding problems of the region, especially those of  the Albanians in Macedonia. Gjergji then hailed the start of  the daily publication of the newspaper FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT and  the initiative to increase the amount of Albanian-language  broadcasting on Macedonia Radio-Television, to expand the  secondary school system, and to open a teacher-training college.  Achieving state-forming status for the Albanians in Maoedonia  means full equality with other citizens of this republic. Only  in this way will Macedonia be stable and a factor of peace in  the region.    Talking about the elections of 24 May 1992, Rexhep Gjergji  said that in these first multiparty elections the electorate  gave their votes for their own deputies and president. These  elections were and will remain historic for the nation, for  democracy, and for the Republic of Kosova. Serbian military and  police forces have impeded the Constitution and operation of the  parliament. Nevertheless, the elections have lost nothing of  their importance. They gave legitimacy to the representatives  of Kosova and of the Albanians and showed who has the right to  decide and to speak on behalf of the people of Kosova. We  consider the demands for the parliament to be constituted for  the most part reasonable, as demands to further the formation of  our institutions. However, there are also occasional voices  that discount the elections. The parliament of the Republic of  Kosova will be constituted at the most favorable opportunity and  will operate freely, and nobody can decide anything about Kosova  before this is done.  <H5>  Weapons Campaign </H5>   During last week too, the weapons campaign was widespread in  the communes of Prishtina, Podujeve, Vushtrri [Vucitrn],  Skendera, [Srbica], Han i Elezit [Djeneral Jankovic], Gllogovo,  Malisheve, Suhareke [Suva Reka], Ferizaj [Urosevac], Lipjan,  Viti, Kline, etc. There were acts of barbarism on the part of  the Serbian police, citizens were brutally beaten, and there  were acts of destruction and vandalism. The Serbian police also  entered the Kosova Chamber of Commerce and arrested everyone who  was present, including its chairman Ismail Kastrati and  secretary Sulejman Ahmeta. The chairman and secretory are still  being held under arrest. There were also police interventions  in schools, while the most provocative incident was the blockade  of Prishtina market on the eve of Kurban sajram [Muslim  festival, on whose eve believers buy sacrificial lambs]. Thus  the Serbian regime demonstrated its vicious restrictions on  religious freedoms. The weapons collection campaign and the  forced recruitments of young Albanian men in the Serbian Army  have been accompanied by the plunder of large sums of money from  Albanians. There is plenty of evidence that can be published  about these incidents.    Rexhep Gjergji and Fatmir Sejdiu, members of the LDK  Presidium, went on to reply to journalists' questions. Asked  what would be the keynote of Dr. Rugova's speech to the UN  General Assembly, Fatmir Sejdiu said that Rugova's positions are  familiar, and they will be placed before this important  assembly. He will set forth his own standpoints, which are at  the same time those of the people.  <H5>  Vacillations of the International Community </H5>   In reply to a question, Rexhep Gjergji said that FLAKA E  VELLAZERIMIT had made an important contribution toward affirming  the demands of the Albanians, especially in raising their status  to a constituent element in the state. Meanwhile, commenting on  President Clinton's statement about "tightening the measures  against Serbia and Montenegro," he said that this was in  accordance with our stand that the easing or removal of the  sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro must be conditional on  quenching the hotbeds of crisis in the former Yugoslavia, of  course including the problem of Kosova. The demands of the  congressmen too, Rexhep Gjergji went on, approximate to our  stands, and it is probable that an ever-increasing number of  congressmen will support our cause.    Rexhep Gjergji added that the main factor causing these  crises and horrors in Europe is Milosevic and his gunmen.  However, the international community has vacillated in its  attitude toward him, and some of its measures have even  emboldened him.</p>

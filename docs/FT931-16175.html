			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Business as usual Of 33 US companies which took precautions to protect mini and mainframe systems in the event of disaster, but not personal computer networks, only three were in business a year later. The example is quoted by Norman Trister, head of Profile Computers, which has launched a service to enable companies to recover their PC networks. NetCall covers nearly every type of disaster than can affect a network. It aims to let managements concentrate on running their businesses when disaster strikes, not on recovering PC systems. Profile claims NetCall can get users back in business within eight hours. Engineers start recovery procedures within two hours. The service provides a high-specification standard PC network with applications and data restored and a full support programme. The collapse of a PC network, says Trister, 'need be no more than a temporary inconvenience'. Profile Computers: UK, 071 638 5566.</p>

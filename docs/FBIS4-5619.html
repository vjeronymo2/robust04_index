			<p>BFN     [Text] The government will provide full-scale official  development assistance (ODA) to Mozambique in the form of  bilateral assistance, in parallel with the participation of the  Self-Defense Forces [SDF] in the UN peacekeeping operations  [PKO] in the country. This was disclosed by a source at the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] on 6 April. The government  plans to display Japan's attitude in making international  contribution by providing its utmost "assistance for  reconstruction work" to the African nation. This will be the  second full-fledged ODA to a country, in which the SDF is  engaged in PKO activities, after Cambodia. Japan plans to  provide tens of millions of dollars to Mozambique, though the  amount is less than a total of $300 million given to Cambodia  for its reconstruction work. While a MOFA survey team has  already arrived in Mozambique, together with survey teams from  European countries and the United States, the government intends  to promote the plan in a concrete manner to lead other nations.  Moreover, the government plans to positively help Mozambique  smoothly conduct its general elections scheduled for October,  and it has begun studying a plan to send an election-monitoring  team based on the PKO Cooperation Law.    Since Japan regards the southern Africa region as an area to  which great emphasis in its ODA programs should be attached, it  has decided to provide aid to Mozambique. From now on, the  government intends to extend ODA to the peripheral region,  including South Africa, which will be newly born following a  constituent assembly election.    SDF members have been dispatched in rotation to Mozambique  since last May, and 53 members are currently engaged in duties  there. Moreover, Japan provided Mozambique with approximately  $200 million through bilateral assistance centering on food  supply and acceptance of trainees (between 1988 and 1992).  However, because the government army and the antigovernment  army have been smoothly conducting disarmament under the  monitoring of the UN peacekeeping operations in Mozambique  (ONUMOZ), a focal point of construction work has now shifted to  improvement of infrastructure in the country. For this reason,  Mozambique is now waiting for assistance from foreign nations.    Under these circumstances, the government has sent to the  country a survey team headed by Mitsugu Saito, chief of the  Development Cooperation Division under MOFA's Economic  Cooperation Bureau, saying: "More positive ODA will be  necessary from now on. If soldiers, who will lose their job,  have no place to go after disarmament is completed, all efforts  will come to nothing," (according to a MOFA source). The  government intends to hold the final consultations on working  out possible cooperation, including improvement of social  infrastructure and technical assistance after the survey team's  return home set for 15 April. Among possible projects are: road  repairs; the improvement of water supply and drainage; and  assistance for the electric power industry. While Japan  provided aid to Cambodia as a partner in the Asian region, ODA  to Mozambique is believed to "have an epoch-making significance  as Japan's visible assistance for reconstruction in Africa,  which is far from Japan" (as stated by a government source).</p>

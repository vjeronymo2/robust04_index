			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Avner Regev] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Circles close to Likud  Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu maintain that despite Netanyahu's  declaration that he will not implement the Oslo agreement if he  forms a government, the Likud chairman understands the agreement  will be implemented in the near future. For this reason he  intends to try to attain an understanding with Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin -- not necessary in the context of a national  unity government -- regarding the continuation of the process.  This understanding involves a compromise on the Golan Heights  while preventing the establishment of a Palestinian state as  part of the permanent arrangement. The circles add that there  are other senior Likud figures in addition to Netanyahu who, in  exchange for such an understanding, will give their support to a  peace arrangement with Syria involving withdrawal from the Golan  Heights buttressed by appropriate security arrangements.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the weekly "Media Network" feature] </F>   [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The radio ship broadcasting  off the coast of Yugoslavia, known as Radio Brod, went off the  air on Tuesday at midnight. The station had been broadcasting  to all of the former Yugoslavia since April of last year. The  European Union, which had been backing the project, said it  could no longer provide financial support because of an  administrative reorganization. The journalists from throughout  the former Yugoslavia who were involved in the project are  understandably furious. At a press conference on Tuesday they  said the weren't given any warning about the move and therefore  couldn't look for alternative financing.    The journalists have asked Italy for authorization to set up  a transmitter off the Italian coast. Italy, they say, is their  last hope because the republics of the former Yugoslavia have  all refused to allow them to erect a transmitter and the  Albanian government hasn't responded. [passage omitted]    The ship is now sailing to Marseille in the south of France  and the 19 journalists on board all plan to return home --  except for the three Bosnians, who have no home to return to.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Senad Durkalic] </F>   [Text] There is no doubt that the planes downed west of  Banja Luka were Serbian planes, although the Serbs -- true to  their custom -- denied that this was so. The only unclear point  is why did the Serbs gamble with NATO's patience? Did they  expect that they would again get away with their humorless  jokes, or have they finally started paying the high price of  their own mistakes? According to as yet unconfirmed information,  the illogical bombing of Novi Travnik and Bugojno is a fresh  Serbian ploy designed to pin the blame for the bombing on the  Croatian aviation, which would result in fresh conflicts between  the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] and the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Army. This would definitely bury the cease-fire signed between  the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the HVO, and the chetniks -- who  else -- would profit from this. In any case, the U.S. pilots  have exhibited their resolve to implement the UN resolutions,  which will perhaps finally force the Serbs to reconsider their  megalomaniacal and bestial appetites. An intercepted radio  message, transmitted a day before the bombing of Novi Travnik,  and ordered by the Serbian units in Donji Vakuf, reads:  Tomorrow six of our nightingales will sing the newly composed  Serbian heroic song about Bugojno. Are we dealing with the  carelessness of the Serbian ham radio operator, or yet another  rusty screw in Mladic's propaganda machinery? It does not  matter. What matters is that four [words indistinct] did not  work in this case, because how could six sparrows harm two  falcons?</p>

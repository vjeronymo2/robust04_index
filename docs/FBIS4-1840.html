			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lilian Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 4 (CNA) -- Many public and private  construction contractors are worried about the possibility of a  serious labor shortage beginning in April as two-year contracts  for foreign workers expire.    Although the Council of Labor Affairs (COLA) has revised its  regulations to allow foreign laborers to remain in Taiwan for  three years, the regulations have not yet been approved by the  Legislative Yuan, so the contractors say they will be unable to  overcome the growing shortage.    COLA first allowed the import of foreign workers to assist  with major public works, manufacturing and construction  industries in October 1991. The first wave of foreign laborers  have already begun to leave Taiwan, with the exodus expected to  peak in April.    And as COLA has not yet announced any measures to fill the  coming labor gap, contractors are worried that progress on the  Hsinchu and Taoyuan sections of the second freeway will lag  behind schedule, resulting in the suspension or downscaling of  work.    The contractors have expressed their hope that the  Legislative Yuan can approve the COLA revisions soon and also  suggested that COLA shorten the time it takes to process foreign  worker applications.</p>

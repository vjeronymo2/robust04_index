[Jarcevic] Good day.    [Stankic] How did the talks at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb  go, and have any results been achieved?    [Jarcevic] The biggest result lies in the fact that the  negotiations have begun and are being held in the building of  the Russian Federation in Zagreb.    We have achieved several good results. The first is that the  delegation of the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK] went to  Zagreb and that the fear that is always hanging over us whenever  we go somewhere has disappeared because the RSK delegation does  not necessarily have to betray the interests of its people and  its state, even if it travels to Zagreb. It can hold talks with  the Croatian authorities on an equal footing.    Another important fact is that we heeded the demands of the  two biggest powers -- the Russian Federation and the United  States -- to meet with the Croatian representatives in the  Russian Federation's building, because these two countries said  that the world community is fed up with the bloodshed in the  former Yugoslavia and that they are inviting us to come to the  negotiating table because they want to see the end of  hostilities, they want to see peace, and that after that  relations between the RSK and Croatia normalize.    They guaranteed that in this way they would prejudice the  political solution and that they are not interested at all in  the kind of life the ethnic communities of the former Yugoslavia  would establish in the future. They asked us to believe that  they sincerely want to help us stop the suffering of all  peoples. We accepted this message and went to Zagreb.    [Stankic] The end of hostilities and the cease-fire assume a  clear demarcation line. Did you discuss this?    [Jarcevic] The line of demarcation was the main topic of our  talks. You know we are talking about a border of some 1,600  kilometers. Because the border of such a length is varied, it  was not easy to agree on one simple principle that could be  applied on every kilometer of the border. This is so because in  some places the border passes through populated areas, in other  places it is near populated places, in some places it is near  industrial plants, or goes over the fields rich with ore or oil.  It is particularly interesting that the border passes near  Jasenovac [World War II camp], which is a sacred place for the  Serbian people. For these reasons, we could not apply a single  principle.    The greatest part of the talks were spent looking for  possibilities to meet the demands of the Croatian side in some  areas, and the demands of the Serbian side in other places. I  think that we have come to the conclusion that in withdrawing  our armies, we should apply symmetry. This means that when we  require their withdrawal for no more than 100-200 meters, we  will give the same opportunity to the Croats to require our  withdrawal where they need it. I think that this is one of the  most important results of the talks held yesterday.    Furthermore, it is also important that the Croatian  delegation has given us guarantees that they would no longer use  the military means to accomplish the programs of their  government, but that, regarding relations with the RSK, they  will do it only through negotiations.    [Stankic] Since you are talking about the military means, we  should also say something about the interpretation, about how  the borders are set in the areas in which the Army of Croatia  has invaded the territory of Krajina.    [Jarcevic] Of course, had it not been for the parts which  the Croatian Army had occupied, there would be no problems and  we would have most certainly signed an agreement yesterday on  the cease-fire and the end of hostilities. It is in fact in  these territories that we are experiencing the greatest  problems. We returned to Knin to consult the government and  other authoritative bodies in the RSK. One of the reasons as to  why the negotiations could not continue is the imprecisely drawn  position of both armies on the maps provided by the United  Nations Protection Forces [UNPROFOR]. Moreover, UNPROFOR showed  these maps to both delegations only shortly before the meeting  began. This is why we need seven days to study the maps and to  mark the actual situation on the line separating the two armies.    [Stankic] It was also decided at the Russian Embassy in  Zagreb to continue the talks.    [Jarcevic] The talks will continue and this is a good sign  that the RSK has been accepted as an equal partner in talks with  the Republic of Croatia, especially since we were brought to the  negotiating table by the two biggest powers in the world -- the  United States and the Russian Federation. In addition, the  talks were also attended by the deputies of the cochairmen of  the conference on the former Yugoslavia, top UNPROFOR officials,  and representatives of the European observer mission.    Let me again repeat that no one exerted pressure on the RSK  delegation. We held the talks in a relaxed atmosphere that was  not disturbed by anything.</p>

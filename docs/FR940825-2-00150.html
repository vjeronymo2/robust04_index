			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Applicability of Phlx Rules Regarding Index Options <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Except as modified by this order, Phlx Rules 1000A through 1103A, in particular, and Phlx Rules 1000 through 1070, in general, will be applicable to Semiconductor Index options and Index LEAPS. Those rules address, among other things, the applicable position and exercise limits, policies regarding trading halts and suspensions, and margin treatment for narrow-based index options. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Calculation of the Index <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Phlx Semiconductor Index is a price-weighted index and reflects changes in the prices of the Index component securities relative to the Index's base date of December 1, 1993. Specifically, the Index value is calculated by adding the prices of the component stocks, dividing this summation by a divisor that is equal to the number of the components of the Index to get the average price, and multiplying the resulting number by 100. To maintain the continuity of the Index, the divisor will be adjusted to reflect non-market changes in the prices of the component securities as well as changes in the composition of the Index. Changes that may result in divisor adjustments include, but are not limited to, stock splits and dividends, spin-offs, certain rights issuances, and mergers and acquisitions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Index value will be updated dynamically at least once every 15 seconds during the trading day. The Phlx has retained Bridge Data, Inc. to compute the value of the Index. Pursuant to Phlx Rule 1100A, updated Index values will be disseminated and displayed by means of primary market prints reported by the Consolidated Tape Association and over the facilities of the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA''). The Index value will also be available on broker/dealer interrogation devices to subscribers of the option information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Index value for purposes of settling outstanding regular Index options and Index LEAPS contracts upon expiration will be calculated based upon the regular way opening sale prices for each of the Index's component securities in their primary market on the last trading day prior to expiration. In the case of securities traded on and through NASDAQ, the first reported sale price will be used. Once all of the component stocks have opened, the value of the Index will be determined and that value will be used as the final settlement value for expiring Index options and Index LEAPS contracts. If any of the component stocks do not open for trading on the last trading day before expiration, then the prior trading day's ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  normally Thursday's) last sale price will be used in the Index calculation. In this regard, before deciding to use Thursday's closing value of a component security for purposes of determining the settlement value of the Index, the Phlx will wait until the end of the day on the last trading day before expiration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Contract Specifications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed options on the Index will be cash-settled, European-style options. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  Standard options trading hours (9:30 a.m. to 4:10 p.m. Eastern Standard time) will apply to the contracts. The Index multiplier will be 100. The strike price interval will be $5.00 for Index options with a duration of one year or less to expiration. In addition, pursuant to Phlx Rule 1012(a), there may be up to six expiration months outstanding at any given time. Specifically, there may be up to three expiration months from the March, June, September, and December cycle plus up to three additional near-term months so that the two nearest term months will always be available. The Exchange also intends to list several Index LEAPS series that expire from 12 to 36 months from the date of issuance pursuant to Phlx Rule 1101A(b)(iii). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A European-style option can be exercised only during a specified period before the option expires. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

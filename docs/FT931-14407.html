			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Arrears of VAT rising, MPs told ARREARS OF value added tax have continued to rise in the past few months, Sir Brian Unwin, chairman of the Customs and Excise department, said yesterday. Average daily arrears as a proportion of tax liabilities rose to 4.5 per cent by November last year against 4.4 per cent 12 months previously and a target of 3.8 per cent, Sir Brian told the Commons' public accounts committee. But he stressed that default surcharges levied against traders who consistently did not pay had fallen since the year end from Pounds 132m to Pounds 125m. Half of the outstanding amounts were from traders which had gone bankrupt and much of the remainder related to amounts of less than Pounds 200 each, which were uneconomic to collect. He told MPs that 2,200 jobs in the department would be subject to market testing in the current year. There would be no testing in core functions such as policy advice, tax assessment and determination of liability. Debt collection would be subject to market testing, but Sir Brian said careful controls would be installed by local offices to ensure there were no risks of breaching confidentiality or generating conflicts of interest among contractors. He said the changes brought about in VAT administration by the creation of the single European market should not increase collection costs, but might increase fraud.</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: Banks clear way for Euro Disney rescue All of Euro Disney's 61 creditor banks have accepted a financial restructuring package for the troubled leisure group, Banque Nationale de Paris and Banque Indosuez, the joint heads of the banks' steering committee, announced yesterday. The unanimous agreement, which ended resistance from a few of the group's smaller creditor banks, clears the way for the final phase of the leisure company's FFr13bn (Dollars 2.3bn) emergency restructuring. Euro Disney shareholders must now be asked at an extraordinary meeting to endorse proposals for a FFr6bn rights issue, which forms the core of the restructuring package. The meeting, expected to be announced imminently, should take place in about a month. Details of the share issue are expected to be announced a few days after the meeting, with the aim of completing the restructuring before the August summer holidays. Walt Disney, the US entertainment group which holds 49 per cent of Euro Disney, has promised to take up its full entitlement of the rights issue. The banks will underwrite the remaining 51 per cent. Yesterday's announcement of a green light from all the banks coincided with the inauguration of a high-speed rail link for the EuroDisneyland theme park. Mr Philippe Bourguignon, Euro Disney chairman, said the new terminus at the theme park, connecting the Paris-Lille and the Paris-Lyon high-speed railway lines, would improve access to EuroDisneyland. 'New horizons are opening to us,' Mr Bourguignon said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Luxembourg, May 3 (AFP) -- The European Court of  Justice ruled Tuesday [3 May] that Belgium was guilty of  discrimination against foreign students from other European  Union [EU] countries.    It said in a ruling that Belgium had flouted EU treaties by  asking students from other EU countries to pay higher enrollment  fees than non-Belgians.    The Court also blasted Belgium for fixing a 2-percent quota  on the number of EU students which Belgian universities must  mandatorily enroll.    The ruling followed a plea lodged by the European  Commission,  whose job it is to check that member states stick by EU rules.</p>

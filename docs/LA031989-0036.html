			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT BAHOOKA: TIKI DREAMS AND DEMON RUM  </P> <P> Of course, Polynesian cuisine, as we know it, has nothing to do with laulau,  poi or lomi lomi salmon. Think instead of plastic parrots glowing in the dim  light of a hundred hurricane lanterns, or the reeling sensation caused by too  many Flaming Puku-Puku Bowls bought on a forged ID. Think rumaki and flagstone  waterfalls, fried shrimp and bamboo. If you grew up on Virgin Zombies and  candy-sweet spareribs, you know what I mean.  </P> <P> Thirty years ago, every neighborhood had at least one tiki-bar, built, I think,  to slake the tropical thirsts of men who had served in the far-Pacific theaters  of W.W. II. James Michener and Thor Heyerdahl cleaned up on '50s tikimania; so  did Trader Vic and Don the Beachcomber. The most elaborate bars featured hula  shows or giant volcanoes that erupted every hour or so; the food, when it  existed, tended toward the coco shrimp and the pu pu platter. Lengthy drink  menus described, in florid pre-AA prose, exactly how a Suffering Bastard or a  Head Shrinker would anesthetize your date, and the drinks in question were  invariably served in a coconut or something, with two straws, a parasol and a  flaming crouton.  </P> <P> But like drive-ins and Art Deco office buildings, most local tiki-bars were  demolished or retooled in the '70s and '80s, followed too late by hip  nostalgia. (If everybody who collected Martin Denny records or Hawaiian shirts  had gone out for a Missionaries' Downfall every so often, the places would've  survived.) Countless Kelbos and Don the Beachcombers closed, the Torches was  razed for condos, the Islander became the briefly tony 385 North, and the Luau  on Rodeo Drive, where three generations of Beverly Hills High School students  purchased their first illicit drink, was replaced by the world's most expensive  mini-mall. Even Trader Vic's had its funky soul remodeled right out of it a  couple of years ago.  </P> <P> Upscale tiki-revival restaurants might be right around the corner -- I've heard  of one opening soon in Beverly Hills -- maybe serving kiawe-grilled ono or  lychee-macadamia creme brulee. But the most interesting tiki-bars were never  all that wholesome, and it's that scintilla of tawdriness, of otherness from  home, that makes the experience a bit of an adventure. That's why I take my  cravings for demon rum to Bahooka, though the drive from Rosemead seems halfway  to Samoa some nights.  </P> <P> Bahooka is the kind of place you'd expect to find near a scruffy tropical  seaport, all rusted nautical gear, stolen street signs, and scarred dark wood,  lit like a Navy-base bar and with more bobbing tropical fish than you'd find in  a Jacques Cousteau special. Lifeboats hang out back -- after the bar closes on  a weekend night, you'll always find a giggling kid or two waving from inside of  one -- and a mysterious board engraved "Joyce Kilmer" is nailed to the rear  wall: "I think that I shall never see/A tiki lovely as a tree," I guess. A sign  inside the front door reads "2 IDs Required -- No Swapmeet IDs." There are fish  in the foyer, fish tanks surrounding three sides of each booth, and fish  swimming inside the glass-topped bar, but not much fish on the menu, unless you  count some cod that seems to have swum all the way from Iceland through a sea  of old oil.  </P> <P> Fish puffs go with a Monsoon or a Jet Pilot or a Flaming Honey Bowl better than  you could possibly imagine, though the leaden deep-fried balls of food aren't  anything you'd want to look at by the light of day, and onion rings aren't half  bad. (Shy away from the "wingettes," by the way) There is no rumaki. Sorry.  </P> <P> When the steel-guitar lowings on the P.A. start to sound good, it's time for a  Shark's Tooth or a Cobra's Strike. Halfway into one of those, a sticky order of  Exotic Ribs seems just the thing, because the ribs are moist and kind of tasty  and soak up a lot of alcohol, and come with fries, sweet baked yams or  cobbettes. The cobbettes, definitely the cobbettes. You can also get teriyaki  chicken breast, which is sort of dry, ham with sweet 'n' sour sauce, roast beef  or fried golf balls of shrimp, but you won't. What will happen is that your  date will suck up the last of his or her Jolly Roger Bowl and carve your  initials in the booth. Don't worry, it's happened before.  </P> <P>  Bahooka, 4501 N. Rosemead Blvd., Rosemead, (818) 285-1241. Lunch and dinner  daily. American Express, MasterCard, Visa accepted. Full bar. Reservations not  necessary.  </P> <P>  Recommended dishes: onion rings, $3.25; Bahooka's Special Exotic Ribs, $9.95.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Customs Union and the Payments Agreement with  the Czech Republic are disadvantageous for Slovakia in many  respects. This is what Slovak Deputy Prime Minister Brigita  Schmoegnerova said at a news conference in Bratislava today.  She said, however, that the one to blame for this situation is  not the Czech partner, which is naturally asserting its own  interests, but the former Slovak Government, which was not  properly prepared to conclude these agreements. Schmoegnerova  added that the Slovak Cabinet will deal with this issue in the  near future.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Augustin Marian Huska, deputy chairman of </F> the National Council of the Slovak Republic and deputy chairman  of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, by Drahoslav Machala;  place and date not given: "Europe Is Favorably Disposed Toward  Slovakia, but Ill-Wishers Are Also To Be Found"]    [Excerpt] [Machala] You have just returned from talks in  the European Parliament in Strasbourg. The talks had a formal  but also an informal part. Did you learn anything of interest  for Slovakia?    [Huska] We have obtained information that is impossible to  obtain under normal circumstances. Unfortunately, we must  self-critically acknowledge that Slovakia does not have enough  politicians of a statesmanlike nature. This is a result of the  fact that it was the object rather than the subject of its own  history for too long.    I would like to alert those who so enthusiastically welcome  the victory of the Hungarian Socialist Party and expect some  "new" accommodating steps from it to the fact that, speaking in  Heidelberg in mid-March 1994, Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman  Gyula Horn deliberately and unfavorably referred to Slovakia as  "a country that belongs not to Central Europe but to the  Balkans." Some left-wing politicians in Slovakia present Horn  as a possibly more acceptable alternative for the improvement of  Slovak-Hungarian relations. We must quickly get rid of this  illusion. Any Hungarian politician, irrespective of his "faith"  and political orientation, whether he be a conservative, a  socialist, or a liberal, will promote in his practical policy  the selfish, solely Hungarian geopolitical interests. I am  drawing attention to this now so that, because of the proverbial  Slovak propensity to make concessions, we do not let ourselves  be hoodwinked by the honey-sweet statements of Hungarian  politicians. It is naive to believe that a  Warsaw-Bratislava-Budapest "socialist axis" might be some kind  of a rescue for the Slovak Republic. This is not a solution for  the state or national interest of the Slovak Republic.  Defending the territorial integrity of the Slovak Republic  against external pressures must remain our primary interest.  [passage omitted]</p>

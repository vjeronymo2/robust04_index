			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / International Company News: AEG sees DM90m battery sales AEG, Daimler-Benz's loss-making electrical and electronics subsidiary, expects annual sales of DM90m (Dollars 58.4m) from a new high-energy battery when full-scale production starts in 1998. Mr Frank Dieter Maier, the director responsible for a pilot production project launched in Berlin yesterday, said the aim was to seize a leading position in the new market for electrically-powered passenger cars. AEG aims to sell 15,000 of its sodium/nickel-chloride batteries in 1998, when laws come into force in California under which 2 per cent of car sales must be emission-free vehicles. Full production capacity - on a site yet to be selected - would cost several hundred million D-marks, Mr Maier said. Capacity of the DM20m pilot project, set up to perfect automated manufacturing processes, will be 450 batteries a year. He said the power units, developed in a joint venture with patent-holder Anglo American, the South African conglomerate, had three to four times more capacity than conventional lead-acid batteries, and gave a range of up to 150km in town traffic. Reviewing the financial situation at AEG, Mr Georg Stockl, chairman, said turnover had risen 7 per cent to DM6.4bn in the first eight months of the current year. However, incoming orders were up only 1 per cent compared with the same period of 1993.</p>

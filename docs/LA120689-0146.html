			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> EGYPT, ISRAEL AGREE TO BAKER'S PLAN FOR WEST BANK, GAZA TALKS  </P> <P> Egypt and Israel have agreed in principle to Secretary of State James A. Baker  III's plan for talks on the future of the Israeli-occupied territories and the  United States will host a three-way Middle East conference early next year, the  State Department announced today.  </P> <P> Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Baker received a "positive response" from  Egyptian Foreign Minister Ismet Abdel-Meguid to Baker's five-point proposal for  a framework for talks dealing with the future of Israeli-occupied West Bank and  Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> Last month, Israel sent a similarly worded reply but with certain "assumptions"  or reservations. Egypt, which is representing the Palestine Liberation  Organization in the preliminary negotiations, also added "certain views,"  Tutwiler said.  </P> <P> The positive response from both sides prepare the groundwork for a Washington  conference with the United States, Egypt and Israel, probably in January, if  various scheduling difficulties can be worked out.  </P> <P> The conference would deal with setting up the machinery to set up elections for  the Palestinian Arabs who will choose their representatives to a conference  with Israel to determine the future of the occupied territories.  </P></p>

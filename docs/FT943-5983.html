			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Technology: Dangers of data overload - Information is an asset that must be guarded With a computer on every desk, information now flows freely in most commercial organisations. But according to Robert Hawley, chairman of Nuclear Electric, the state-owned UK nuclear power generator, that very access to data is proving counter-productive. Companies are being saturated with data. Hawley is one of a growing band of industrialists who have recognised the need to control information before it can be properly exploited. Since last October, Hawley has chaired meetings of the Hawley Committee. Taking its cue from the Cadbury Report on corporate governance, this body is dedicated to producing practical guidelines for board members when dealing with information systems. Hawley's fellow committee members include leading figures from Smiths Industries, the aerospace and defence group, the Cooperative Bank, the Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Defence. This working party is complemented by KPMG, the management consultancy. It has been assigned the vital leg-work of trawling through British industry to establish data on the management of information. The main finding of the committee so far is that the saturation of information in business is undermining its value. Staff at all levels are overwhelmed with computerised data. 'In our attempts to make sure everybody is informed we're over-informing,' says Hawley. One way to tackle this problem is to limit access to IT systems. This might appear to fly in the face of the received wisdom of the 1980s that more databases meant better business. Hawley thinks otherwise, and has embarked on an ambitious programme to rationalise information in his own backyard. A Nuclear Electric working group is trying to establish just who needs what information. It is currently preparing for privatisation, so any move that trims an annual IT budget of Pounds 35m and also ties into management concerns about unlimited access to information is timely. The executive information system blinking from the terminal on Hawley's desk is updated with market data, the organisation's daily operations and the state of play at 15 nuclear power plants. But it can only be used by 100 staff. 'When I came on board, everybody wanted it. The popular sentiment was to expand the system by 100 staff at a time. But we run the business with this information. It's one hell of an asset and now we're protecting it.' According to Hawley, not enough executives view information as a vital and risky asset, even though 'the board is ultimately responsible for illegal use of data'. A deluge of publicity surrounded the recent British Airways' courtroom admission that staff effected illegal access to Virgin Airlines' booking data. But this case does not appear to have raised the profile of information as a critical asset to be guarded. Hawley is keenly aware that a report of the committee's findings will only be as good as the response it generates. Will industry take the conclusions on board? Hawley hopes it will and intends to distil the committee's conclusions into a painless read. 'We're not going to produce a tome. There will be a single page containing short and simple guidelines. That should spark enough interest to get board members reading a more detailed document listing our findings.' Hawley is convinced that this is too important an issue to gather dust. 'We're not studying the mismanagement of IT,' says Hawley. 'We are saying that information is an asset main board directors are consistently failing to recognise.' He says boards are not yet asking whether they are getting the right information. 'They can easily talk about the bicycle shed question - which big computer system to install. But they miss the whole issue of management of information.'</p>

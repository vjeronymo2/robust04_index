			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Former Burton chief joins Ratners board MR LAURENCE Cooklin, who was sacked at Burton Group after 14 months as chief executive of the UK fashion company, has been appointed to the board of Ratners, the jewellery chain. Mr Cooklin will become chief executive UK Jewellery and will report to Mr James McAdam, chairman and group chief executive. Mr McAdam said yesterday that Mr Cooklin had a considerable reputation as a hands-on manager. 'We have not taken him on as chief executive,' he said. 'It is very much a hands-on job. (At Burton) he was managing director of buying and the merchandising side.' He will be responsible for operational management at Ratners, H Samuel and Ernest Jones, the group's three jewellery chains. Mr Cooklin stepped into the chief executive slot at Burton when Sir Ralph Halpern, chairman and chief executive, was forced out by shareholder pressure following the collapse in profits in 1990. While at Burton, Mr Cooklin enjoyed a generous remuneration package, if not equal to that of his boss, the first earner of a Pounds 1m salary in the UK, then certainly in line with the extravagance with which the Halpern era became associated. Mr McAdam stressed yesterday that Mr Cooklin had been given a 'perfectly standard' two-year contract and would be receiving a salary in line with other board members.</p>

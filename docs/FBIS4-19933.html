			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Bonn (DPA) -- After a profound recession in  1993 and a weak beginning of the year in 1994, the "sky of the  economic development" is now getting lighter, according to FRG  Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party of  Germany). Even though the labor market remains "a big problem"  with an average of 3.9 million unemployed this year, economic  growth of 1.5 percent or even more in real terms all over  Germany can now be assumed, Rexrodt told journalists on Friday  [22 April]. Before the presentation of the spring report by the  six leading economic research institutes, which is expected to  take place next Tuesday, he said that this means a growth of at  least 1 percent for the old laender and of 8 percent of the new  laender. As a result, in the west an inflation rate with a "two  in front of the decimal point" is within reach. There he expects  an average of 3 percent, in the east 3.5 percent.    Rexrodt sees his assessment of the end of January confirmed  -- in particular since industry and the associations expressed  far more optimistic at the Hannover Fair than a few weeks ago  during the wage negotiations. [passage omitted]    Of the 3.9 million unemployed, 2.67 million will be in the  west and 1.2 million in the east. The companies' regained  competitiveness "does not have any effect for the reduction of  basic unemployment," Rexrodt admitted. However, together with  the Bonn action program, the current signals of the economic  development -- orders received, business expectations, as well  as capacity utilization of industry (79 percent in view of a  longstanding average of 85 percent), a strong construction  sector, as well as first improvements in the steel and chemical  industry -- provide prospects for employment in 1995. In the  new laender, too, the economic development is considerably  improving, not only in the construction sector but also  regarding other investments.    The Federal Government was harshly criticized by Social  Democratic Party economic spokesman Oskar Lafontaine. Since the  economic development is mainly based on exports, this shows that  the Federal Government "is unable to bring about a real upswing  for everyone." In order to avoid further weaknesses in  consumption, he once again called for a supplementary tax on  incomes of more than 60,000 German marks [DM] per year for  singles and DM120,000 marks for couples. In his view, the  purchasing power of the masses is not weakened -- in contrast to  the effect of the solidarity surcharge -- because more than 80  percent of all taxpayers will be exempt.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (24): Hopes for a break in the clouds - France: Taiwan's order for 60 Mirage jets provides momentary relief The French aerospace industry, which has been hit by falling orders during the past three years, hopes that by 1995-96 turnover will begin to improve. Some comfort was provided by Taiwan's 1992 order for 60 of Dassault's Mirage jets and 1,500 of Matra's Mica missiles. But, in general terms, the Taiwan contract provided only momentary relief, with new aerospace orders booked last year amounting to only FFr90bn, 19 per cent down on the Taiwan-inflated figure of 1992 though only 4 per cent down on the 1991 level of new orders. Turnover fell last year by 8.5 per cent to FFr110bn, (Dollars 21bn) with the brunt felt in the aero-engine sector (down 12.5 per cent) and by aircraft and missile makers (down 9.6 per cent), while avionics and equipment manufacturers escaped relatively lightly (down 4.2 per cent). Almost all companies are cutting back their work forces, or, as in the case of Airbus, putting them on short-time working. Serge Dassault, president of the group that bears his name and head of Gifas, the industry association, estimates French aerospace will have lost 15,000 jobs over 1992-95. In profit until 1991, the French aerospace sector has, overall, been in the red since then. The biggest money losers are state-owned: Aerospatiale, which cut its 1993 loss to FFr1.42bn (from FFr2.38bn a year earlier) but has this year had to get a FFr2bn capital injection from the government to help reduce its debt and fund promotion of its new A340 series; Snecma, the aero-engine maker whose 1993 loss increased slightly compared with 1992 to FFr804m on sharply lower turnover; and Thomson-CSF, the defence electronics specialist. The latter, in fact, made an operating profit of around FFr1bn, which was wiped out by its unfortunate stake in Credit Lyonnais that required it to assume losses and bad debt provisions of FFr3bn. All three companies are slated for privatisation, but the sale of Aerospatiale and Snecma is some time off. By contrast, private sector companies, like Matra (part of the Lagardere group) and Dassault have fared better, partly because of Taiwan contracts. Bernard Nicolas, Gifas' secretary-general, estimates that this year will see a similar 8.5 per cent decline in French aerospace turnover, but also a pick-up in export orders, especially for Airbus and perhaps through possible missile sales to Sweden and helicopter sales to the UK. But he feels the French government does not always act in the best interests of its defence industry. In particular, he is critical of the promise France gave China not to sell any more offensive weapons to Taiwan. While this may have opened the door to the Chinese market to French civil contractors, he says salesmen for companies involved in the Taiwan sale still cannot get visas to visit China. The French aerospace industry, at least, benefits from the fact that France is virtually the only country in the west or east which, far from awarding itself a peace dividend on the end of the Cold War, has decided to maintain defence spending in real terms. The government's military framework law for 1995-2000 sets a 0.5 per cent real increase in defence equipment spending for the first three years, and possibly more thereafter, depending on how the economy performs. And this starts from a 1994 base of FFr100.4bn, which is higher than in the UK or Germany. But Mr Nicolas notes that the Balladur government has resorted to a habit of the previous socialist government by 'freezing' FFr2.5bn of the 1994 equipment budget. The Gifas director also complains that the civil aviation portion of the 1994 budget only includes money for 're-imbursable advances' for existing programmes, not for new ones planned by Aerospatiale and Dassault. France, however, remains a firm believer in this 'transparent' form of direct aerospace subsidy, and from the bogged-down talks with the US, it would like to see emerging an extension of the 1992 US-European Union agreement to cover not just airframes, but also aero engines and equipment. Space accounts for about 15 per cent of French aerospace turnover, but its business fell last year by nearly 6 per cent. However, Matra-Marconi Space, the Anglo-French joint venture, has just boosted its capability by buying British Aerospace's space business. Despite recurrent rumours of national mergers, of the kind that produced BAe or Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), French companies have instead sought to cope with their industry's present crisis by reaching out to foreign partners. Aerospatiale is negotiating with Dasa to create in missiles the sort of joint venture they already have in helicopters; Thomson-CSF has recently capped its large number of joint ventures and acquisitions with the UK by announcing two joint ventures with Dasa on 'smart' munitions and missile propulsion; and Matra is on the verge of completing its long negotiations for a joint venture with BAe on missiles.</p>

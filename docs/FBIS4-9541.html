			<p>BFN     [Text] Erfurt/Sarajevo (DDP/ADN) - Serb infantry is still  within a three-kilometer radius of the Bosnian enclave of  Gorazde. This was stated by Bosnian Prime Minister Haris  Silajdzic in a telephone interview with Thursday's edition of  the THUERINGER ALLGEMEINE, which is based in Erfurt. Silajdzic  thus rejected UN statements that the Serb troops had largely  withdrawn from the town. Silajdzic called upon NATO to "take  its own ultimatum seriously." The UN should make use of its  possibilities for calling air strikes. The Serbs had withdrawn  heavy artillery from the 20 km radius around Gorazde, as asked.  However, now the same situation was developing as after the  ultimatum in Sarajevo, Silajdzic said. "If the movement of these  weapons is not stopped, in five to ten days time we will have  the same situation in northern Bosnia as we have in Gorazde,"  the Bosnian prime minister warned. The places around the  Posavina area in Bosnia or the towns of Brcko, Maglaj and Konjic  were in particular jeopardy.</p>

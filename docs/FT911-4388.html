			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Sandoz opens share register to foreigners CORPORATE issues steered bourses yesterday. Predictions of a further, although reduced, fall in German company profits in 1991 vied with unsatisfactory 1990 results in France, and the opening of Sandoz's share register to foreigners in Switzerland, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT was faced with a forecast of lower 1991 German corporate profits from Degab, Deutsche Bank's investment research arm; a Bundesbank decision to hold interest rates; and a BASF board meeting which held the annual dividend rate at DM13 a share. It was a little depressed by Degab, which expects a fall of 1 per cent this year after one of 5 per cent in 1990. This will be followed by a rise of 8 per cent in 1992 . However, it sees the fall concentrated in the automotive, chemical and steel industries. Cars and chemicals are heavily weighted in the DAX index, which closed 10.07 lower at 1,613.76 yesterday after a fall of 1.46 to 684.55 in the FAZ at midsession. The interest rate decision did not surprise dealers but the BASF dividend lifted the chemical company's shares, from a day's low of DM246.50 before the news to a close of DM251.30, up 60 pfg on the day. Turnover fell from DM8.2bn to DM7bn Mr Michael Geiger, an analyst with County NatWest in London, said that County expects an increase in German corporate earnings this year and next, to take the German market p/e down from 14.3, through 13.7 to 12.6. Degab expects banking, a very big sector, to rise by 11 per cent this year; County expects a far bigger improvement on the grounds that the banks will not have to repeat provisions against bond portfolio losses on anything like the same scale this year. Bilfinger &amp; Berger, the construction company, rose DM3 to DM900 after news of a deep discount rights issue yesterday. Mr Geiger said that the company would benefit from the new equity, and that the market had absorbed similar issues in 1989 and 1990. ZURICH concentrated on Sandoz, the chemical company, which announced the opening of its registered shares to foreigners, a stock split and a rights issue. The registered shares jumped SFr675 to SFr11,025, while the bearers fell SFr550 to SFr11,350 on the loss of their availability advantage over the registered stock. The Credit Suisse index closed 2.6 lower at 555.6. PARIS had a busy start with about FFr500m traded in the first hour, concentrated on BNP, Michelin and Peugeot. Receding hopes for lower interest rates, weaker bonds and concern that the market was about to run into a spate of rights issues pushed the CAC 40 index 13.71 lower to 1,185.74 in turnover estimated at about FFr2.5bn. BNP was the day's biggest loser, falling FFr40.40 or 14.4 per cent to FFr240.50 and was the day's second most active stock with 542,425 shares exchanged. The sell-off was prompted by surprisingly bad 1990 results, and a dividend cut. Accor, the hotel group, dropped FFr21 or 2.6 per cent to FFr800 on fears of a rights issue. The group denied a report that it planned to increase its stake in the Belgian travel firm Wagons-Lits. Accor also postponed for several days a financial news conference planned for yesterday. In the motor sector, Peugeot rose FFr8 FFr546 on volume of 183,750 shares. The market was relieved that the drop in the car maker's earnings coincided with earlier warnings from its chairman. STOCKHOLM fell on higher domestic interest rates and concerns about the impending first quarter reporting season. The Affarsvarlden index eased 1.2 to 1,087.9 in relatively high turnover of SKr406m after SKr302m. Electrolux free b shares fell SKr5 to SKr224 following a negative report on the company in a Swedish business magazine on Wednesday. MILAN continued to focus on the insurance and banking sectors. The Comit index rose 3.77 to 598.70. Generali rose L600 to L37,940 and hit L38,350 after hours while in the banking sector, Mediobanca closed at L15,980, up L200. Telecoms were also in the limelight. Stet jumped L28 to L2,376 and Sirti was up L90 to L12,890. Elsewhere, Cir, the holding company of Mr Carlo De Benedetti, recouped L35 to L2,645 after its recent weakness. AMSTERDAM closed weaker ahead of the expiry of April series options and index futures today. The CBS general tendency index eased 0.5 to 96.8. Chemical group DSM closed down Fl 4.00 at Fl 112.40 after going ex-dividend of Fl 5.00 and paper maker KNP ended Fl 2.50 down at Fl 53.90, ex-dividend of Fl 2.50. Nedlloyd was 50 cents higher at Fl 53.80 after reporting a 1990 net loss in line with its own forecast at Fl 148.2m. MADRID picked up slightly in the afternoon session but still showed a small loss at the end of a dull day. The general index closed at 283.91, 0.20 down overall but slightly up from the close of pit trading. HELSINKI fell another 1.7 per cent in moderate trade, blaming profit-taking as the Hex index fell 19.0 to 1124.1 after a 14.7 point decline on Wednesday.</p>

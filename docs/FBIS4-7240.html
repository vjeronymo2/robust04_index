			<p>BFN     [Text] Leaders of the revolutionary movement who had been  accused by Communist Party founder Jose Ma. Sison of plotting  with the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) to assassinate  him denied yesterday the charges, saying Sison "is either sick  of paranoia of the highest order or again up to some evil  scheme."    "By airing self-serving and serious charges without basis,  Sison is in effect giving policy guidance to the group of  Gregorio Rosal and similar brutal killers to escalate the  internal feud in the leftist movement, while he is ensconced in  the safety of his refuge in the Netherlands," said Antonio  Cabardo, vice president of Sandigan ng Kalayaan at Demokrasya ng  Sambayanan [Foundation of Freedom and Democracy of the People]  (Sanlakas), and one of the five leaders Sison had charged of  plotting to kill him. Others expressed the same sentiment.    Sanlakas is a multi-sectoral organization in the NCR  [National Capital Region] composed of former affiliates of Bayan  [Bagong Alyansang Makabayan -- New Nationalist Alliance]-NCR.    Cabardo said it is now clear that Sison is pushing for the  implementation of an earlier death sentence for four opposition  leaders, as he claimed to be the target of a similar slay plot.    Sison had charged in an interview over radio station DZMM  and  DZRH that the AFP and Romulo Kintanar, Ricardo Reyes, Arturo  Tabara, Felimon Lagman, and Cabardo had sent a hit team to  Europe led by a certain "Narding" to kill him.    The recent media pronouncement of Sison about the alleged  assassination plot and the present handling by Luis Jalandoni of  the peace negotiation with the GRP [Government of the Republic  of the Philippines] panel all point out to the tendency of the  Sison group to pull out from the peace negotiation, Cabardo said.    Thus, Sison and Jalandoni are laying the ground work for a  graceful exit from the peace process, a face-saving move that  would enable Sison to use the alibi of risks to personal  security of the NDF [National Democratic Front] panel for his  planned pullout.    Cabardo warned Sison that his Stalinist design will get him  nowhere, as comrades and the masses begin to see through the  ruse and realize that the policies and program he is spousing  are not for the revolution after all.    He ask the pro-Sison comrades to come to terms with reality  and recognize that the ideological struggle cannot be resolved  in their favor by eliminating the opposition within the  Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) physically, for many  others will later take up the challenge.</p>

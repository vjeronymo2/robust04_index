			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Hard times after death of king coal: The fate of NUM officials 10 years after the great strike Ten years ago today Mr George Hayes, the National Coal Board's area director for South Yorkshire, announced the closure of Cortonwood colliery, triggering one of the largest national strikes in British industrial history: the 1984-85 miners' strike. Since the strike, the number of miners has fallen from 196,000 to about 14,000 with political and industrial consequences which have been well charted. What has happened to the local officials of the National Union of Mineworkers? Those men - usually articulate and self-confident - formed a unique labour movement elite at the heart of the mining communities. As the pits have closed it is those men who have had furthest to fall, losing not only a well-paid job but social status. Many now struggle to earn a living as security guards, school caretakers, or taxi drivers and look back nostalgically on the days when they were, in effect, managing the working lives of hundreds of people. Few have changed their views about the strike. Mr Alan Cummings, 46, a senior official at Easington colliery, County Durham, still feels there was a political vendetta against the strike and remains bitter about the lack of support from the rest of the labour movement. Others, such as Mr Carl Browning, lodge secretary at Celynen South in south Wales, blame Mr Arthur Scargill for mishandling the dispute. Mr Cummings' pit only closed last year, since when he has been winding up union business and is only next month set to join the dole queue. Looking back, he says: 'The fact is we were thrashed. It wasn't just 10-0 it was 100-0.' He does not expect to be able to exploit his considerable experience of managing people or even to find a job on the Peterlee industrial estate. Instead he is thinking of returning to college. A fellow official at Easington, Mr John MacManey, has found a job doing unskilled work in a local factory packing batteries. Hardest to take is the close supervision. 'Down a mine you have to be able to trust people to get on with the job, but in factories they treat you like a moron,' he says. Mr Mick Appleyard, 50, former secretary at Sharlston colliery in West Yorkshire, suffers from arthritis and lives a lonely life on disability benefit, seeing old comrades from the Yorkshire NUM circuit rarely. Another official from Sharlston, Mr John Swithenbank, like many former miners works as a security guard on half the pay he got as a miner. He works for the Reliance security company on 12-hour shifts - three on days, three on nights, and then three days off. Mr Jim Heel, former NUM treasurer at Celynen South, survives as a small-business owner. His wife's hardware retail business has expanded since the pit closed and they run three shops. Mr Carl Browning, the Celynen South secretary, works as a caretaker in a local school, and has taken a large drop in earnings. He has remained politically involved, however, and sits as a magistrate. Sometimes miners take their strong union traditions into their new jobs. Mr Frank Clarke, former secretary at South Kirkby colliery, got a job at the Morrison supermarket in Wakefield and blew new life into the local TGWU general union branch. But it has not been easy for Mr Clarke. As an NUM official he was on full-time union business. As a TGWU representative at Morrison's he has to do union work in his spare time after a 50-hour week for little more than Pounds 150.</p>

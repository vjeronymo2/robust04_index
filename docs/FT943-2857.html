			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / International Company News: Chaebol lead quest for growth - Korea's industry leaders are investing heavily Hyundai Motor today will break ground for a new car plant at its Asan complex in what is part of a rapid expansion of production capacity by Korean industry this year. Plant and research investments by the country's 30 biggest conglomerates, or chaebol, are expected to increase by 55 per cent to an estimated Won24,200bn (Dollars 30bn) in 1994, according to the ministry of trade and industry. The Hyundai group is leading the field with Won4,500bn in investments, followed by Samsung with Won3,700bn and Lucky-Goldstar with Won2,800bn. The large spending on industrial facilities is in response to a sudden rise in exports. The weakening of the Korean won against the Japanese yen has lifted overseas shipments of electronics, cars, steel and ships. Investment spending is contributing to a recovery of the Korean economy, with GNP expected to grow 8.3 per cent this year. Korea's industrial base is impressive. It has the world's second-biggest shipbuilding industry, and ranks fifth in textile and petrochemical production and sixth in electronics, cars and steel. However, analysts warn that Korean industry's quest for greater size is being conducted at the expense of improvements in product quality, and may leave companies with excess production capacity if global demand weakens and the Korean currency appreciates. 'It's either feast or famine for Korea,' said Mr James Oborne, head of research at WI Carr Securities in Seoul. 'When global demand is good, Korea has the capacity to cover it quickly. But the downside is that it is left with surplus capacity when demand falls.' Moreover, there are doubts whether a production increase is wise when Korea is beginning to dismantle trade barriers, which have protected its lucrative domestic market, in preparation for joining the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 1996. The production expansion is being encouraged by the government, which traditionally paid little regard to market conditions in its ambition to transform Korea into an industrial powerhouse. Industrial investments are largely being financed by state-subsidised bank loans, which enable the chaebol to undertake the large spending, in spite of their high debt-equity ratios of 200 per cent to 300 per cent. The new Hyundai car plant, for example, is part of a government programme, known as X-5, to make Korea the world's fifth largest motor producer by doubling capacity to 4.65m vehicles by 2000. Korea's other main car companies, Kia and Daewoo, are increasing capacity, while Ssangyong is expected to start car production in 1996. The shipbuilding and petrochemical industries, which suffered losses a few years ago due to surplus capacity, are expanding production facilities in anticipation of increased world demand. However, the OECD recently warned that a plan by Korea's three main shipbuilders, Hyundai, Daewoo and Samsung, to expand their shipbuilding yards by 50 per cent could cause a glut in the global industry and lead to a price-cutting war with Japan and other nations. Although the production increase has received the approval of the state, the chaebol are clashing with the government over plans to expand their sprawling industrial empires into new sectors. The administration of President Kim Young-sam has adopted a policy of forcing the chaebol to concentrate on a few of their existing activities, in an attempt to reduce their economic dominance and prevent them from spreading their resources too thinly. The government, for example, recently proposed that the chaebol should cut their stakes in non-group companies to 25 per cent or less by 1998. The chaebol argue that they must diversify into new industries that offer high-growth potential. 'Korean companies should concentrate on specialised or niche industries, but without government guidance on what areas they should pick,' said Mr Lee Hahn-koo, president of the Daewoo Economic Research Institute, which is affiliated with Korea's fourth-biggest chaebol. Samsung and Hyundai are challenging the government on this issue. Samsung wants to enter the car passenger industry by 1997 through a technical joint venture with Nissan of Japan. 'We need car production to maintain our position as a leading producer in the machinery industry,' said one executive with Samsung Heavy Industry. The government is threatening to reject Samsung's licence with Nissan in an attempt to block the project. Hyundai recently said it planned to build a large plant to produce cold- and hot-rolled steel. 'The project makes sense from Hyundai's perspective since it would contribute to its integrated industrial strategy. Hyundai is the largest consumer of steel in Korea and having its own source of steel would lower production costs for its car and ships,' said Mr Keith Nam, head of research at HG Asia Securities in Seoul. Although Korean industry is expressing few qualms about the sudden burst in capacity leading to excess production, companies in the car and steel industries are using this argument to support the government efforts to stop the Samsung and Hyundai projects. They fear the entry of new competitors will undercut their market share. For example, state-controlled Pohang Iron and Steel, Korea's largest steelmaker, would lose its biggest customer if Hyundai proceeds with its plans. It recently announced an expansion of its steel production in an attempt to squeeze out Hyundai and maintain its monopoly on cold and hot-rolled steel.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Korean industries: 1993 production performance  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Industry              Global ranking      Share global production (%)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Electronics                  6                      5.2 Motors                       6                      4.3 Steel                        6                      4.6 Petrochemicals               5                      4.0 Shipbuilding*                1                     39.0 Textiles                     5                      4.7  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *in terms of orders, which have fallen to second this year with an estimated 16% share  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Korea Development Bank  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

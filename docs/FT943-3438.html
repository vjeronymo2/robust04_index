			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Investment eligibility Sir, Under current personal equity plan rules, a company listed on the Unlisted Securities Market is eligible for investment. If such a company chooses not to seek a full listing when the USM closes at the end of 1996 and consequently is marketed on the Alternative Investment Market, then it will be ineligible for investment. Unless the Pep rules are changed, this would mean that all such holdings will have to be sold out of the Pep. Maybe now is the time for all interested parties to write to the Revenue and suggest that a change in the rules would be to the benefit of both investors and companies.

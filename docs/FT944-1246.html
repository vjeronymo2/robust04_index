			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / De La Rue wins Portals for Pounds 682m: Security printer fulfils its paper dreams after eight-month chase De La Rue, the security printer, yesterday landed the prize it had been pursuing for eight months when its Pounds 682m offer for Portals was accepted by the board of the specialist paper manufacturer. The move will give De La Rue, which specialises in printing banknotes, control of one of its main paper suppliers and boost its access to Portals' customer contacts among the world's central banks. De La Rue is also keen to exploit Portals' anti-counterfeiting developments. Portals' acceptance ends a courtship which began in May when De La Rue initiated talks to pool research facilities. More formal discussions on a possible offer followed, prompting the Portals share price to rise and a Stock Exchange inquiry into how the news leaked into the market. The talks failed, reportedly overthe price being offered by De La Rue, only to be rekindled earlier this month, with a similar response in the shares. On both occasions, De La Rue specified that it would not make a hostile bid for Portals. Mr Jeremy Marshall, De La Rue's chief executive, said the move held great potential for both companies. 'With Portals paper manufacturing and our printing expertise, the enlarged group will be able to enjoy greater technological focus, particularly in anti-counterfeiting, and a strengthening of customer relationships.' In particular, it would also enable the group to offer customers a fully-integrated banknote manufacturing service. He added that the banknote facility would also fit well with De La Rue's other security printing businesses. He denied that, at nearly 31 times Portals' 1993 earnings per share, De La Rue had offered too much. 'This is a long-term strategic deal which is driven by our desire to increase the potential of the business, grow volumes and take advantage of the latest technology.' He admitted, however, that Portals' announcement last week of a Pounds 100m contract with the Indian government 'made us sleep easier' over the price. De La Rue expects the deal to dilute earnings slightly for the year to March 31 1995, be neutral in 1995-96 and enhance earnings the year after. Portals shares, which stood at 705p before the latest approach, rose 60p to Pounds 10.25 yesterday. De La Rue is paying Pounds 403m in cash for Portals, with the rest being paid by a fully underwritten issue of new shares. De La Rue's offer of nine shares and Pounds 124 in cash for every 20 Portals shares values the latter at Pounds 10.50 per share. Portals shareholders will be offered a full cash alternative of Pounds 10.11 1/2 per share and a mix-and-match facility. Mr Julian Sheffield, Portals chairman, will join De La Rue as a non-executive director. Lex, Page 16; Background, Page 18</p>

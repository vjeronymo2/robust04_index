			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Van Thijn Resigns Following in </F> Footsteps of Hirsch Ballin -- Possible Comeback by Van Thijn"]    [Excerpt] The chances of Interior Minister Van Thijn, who  resigned on Friday [27 May], returning in the new government  have not yet declined completely. "I am in no way ruling out  the possibility of calling upon Van Thijn," said PvdA [Labor  Party] Leader Kok.    On Friday, both Van Thijn (PvdA) and Justice Minister Hirsch  Ballin, his CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] colleague,  announced their resignation from the government. The vacant  posts will be filled by Kosto, secretary of state for Justice,  and by De Graaf-Nauta, secretary of state for Interior.    On Thursday, the Second Chamber forbade the so-called police  ministers Hirsch Ballin and Van Thijn from dealing with the  Inter-Regional Investigative Teams (IRT's) aimed at combating  organized crime. Immediately after the second debate in the  Chamber on the sudden decomposition of the Utrecht/North Holland  IRT, Hirsch Ballin -- who is a rising political star within the  CDA -- came to the conclusion that the Chamber was excessively  restricting him from performing his duties.    Hirsch Ballin announced his resignation at the cabinet  meeting on Friday morning. In the afternoon, after the cabinet  meeting, Van Thijn followed with his decision to resign. Van  Thijn maintains that he was not forced to resign by the cabinet.  After the political commotion concerning his position, "to be  quite honest it would be hard to justify my staying on," said  Van Thijn at a press conference in The Hague.    According to Prime Minister Lubbers, the departure of both  members of his government is "tragic, both for them and for  their cabinet colleagues." The departure of the two ministers  from the Lubbers-Kok government responsible for "police affairs"  brings the total of resignations from this government to five.    Lubbers denied that his political reputation, and hence his  chance of securing the presidency of the European Commission,  has suffered from this. The departure of Hirsch Ballin and Van  Thijn "is not an affair, but an example of a specific manner of  behavior between Parliament and the government. This is the way  things should always be," said the prime minister.    PvdA leader Kok underlined that he had "strongly" advised  both Hirsch Ballin and Van Thijn against resigning. The motion  adopted by the Second Chamber "did not force them," he said.  For that reason, Kok has no objection to a comeback by Van  Thijn, who took office in January of this year. "The events of  the past few days were not necessary as such," he said.    Van Thijn described his brief period in office at the  Ministry of the Interior as "bizarre." Approximately two months  after he took office, he was confronted by an extremely critical  Second Chamber following the sudden decision made at the  Amsterdam police and justice forum to cancel the IRT for Utrecht  and North Holland. Only in a second debate last week did the  Chamber accept a motion in which the two ministers were blamed  for the failure of the IRT experiment.    Van Thijn has not yet made any statement regarding his  political future. He said: "I have really not thought about it  at all. First I must recover from the confusion and emotion of  recent days." Unlike Hirsch Ballin, Van Thijn is not a member of  the newly formed Second Chamber. [passage omitted]</p>

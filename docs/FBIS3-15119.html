			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Today's sitting of the Russian Security Council was  devoted to the fight against crime, a subject Boris Yeltsin  broached in his address to parliament.    [Correspondent Vladimir Perfilyev] Head of state Boris  Yeltsin led the meeting. Two issues were examined: The federal  anti-crime program for this year and 1995, and the German  general consulate in Kaliningrad. President Yeltsin said that  the crime situation was posing a serious problem in Russia at  the moment. There is organized crime not just in separate  areas, but in the near abroad [former Soviet republics] and  abroad.    The low level of efficiency of the law-enforcing and  judicial  bodies is one of the main reasons for the increase in crime. It  is now the norm that criminals get off practically scot-free as  the crime fighting bodies remain ill-equipped for the job.    On the subject of amnesty, President Yeltsin said:    [Begin Yeltsin recording] I hope that the federal program to  step up the fight against crime will mark a change and become a  significant social document in the difficult work of the  law-enforcing and judicial bodies. I would like to stress that  those amnestied by the State Duma will be rearrested in  accordance with our laws as soon as they start any political or  other activity detrimental to the security of the Russian state.  The main result of our sitting today should not just be that we  looked into adopting the federal program, but that it will now  be implemented quickly. We need to display action as soon as  possible to convince Russian citizens that the state is capable  of dealing with the social evil that crime is. [end recording]</p>

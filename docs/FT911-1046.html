			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Soviets and Jamaicans to meet over bauxite shipping deadlock JAMAICAN and Soviet government representatives will begin negotiations later this month to resolve problems which have bedevilled an agreement for the island to ship bauxite for use in refineries in the USSR. The agreement replaced a pact which expired last December, and committed Jamaica to supplying 1m tonnes of ore annually over five years starting this year. Jamaican officials said that instead of taking the 250,000 tonnes of ore which was scheduled in the first quarter of this year, the Soviets took only 30,000 tonnes. They said a deteriorating economic situation in the Soviet Union was the cause of the breakdown of the agreement. The USSR is paying Jamaica with hard currency for the bauxite, but the island is committed to spending 25 per cent of its earnings from the deal to purchase Soviet-made goods. Soviet officials, however, have been unhappy with aspects of the earlier agreement, and industry sources here say similar concerns are affecting the new contract. One representative of the trade ministry in Moscow recently described the agreement as 'limited' in what it offered in trade between the two countries. The Soviets have also expressed concern that the trade balance has always been in Jamaica's favour. The Jamaica Bauxite Institute, a state agency, reported that Jamaica's raw ore exports of 1.1m tonnes in the first quarter of this year were 108,000 tonnes more than the corresponding period of last year. 'Shipments would have been better had we supplied the additional 220,000 tonnes to the Soviet Union as was expected under the contract,' the institute said. While seeking to repair the agreement with the Soviets, Jamaica, which is the world's third largest bauxite producer after Australia and Guinea, has secured another contract to supply ore. Pechiney of France is purchasing 450,000 tonnes of ore from Jamaica, through the Bauxite and Alumina Trading Company, a Jamaican state agency. The Jamaican industry says the deal is worth more than Dollars 11m. The government's effort to further expand bauxite production with the reopening of some mines which were closed seven years ago has not been successful. The General Electric Company of the US had proposed reopening the mines which were previously worked by a subsidiary of Reynolds Metals. The US company had told the Jamaican government that it would produce and market the ore, and use the profits to cover investments it planned to make in electricity generating plants in the island. Mr Carlton Davis, executive chairman of the Bauxite Institute, said this week that the proposals for marketing the ore were 'too tenuous'. The reopening and rehabilitation of the mines, and the power plant General Electric had proposed, would have represented an investment of Dollars 275m in the island. Mr Davis said that the problems with the Soviet agreement should not affect Jamaica's chances of achieving this year's production target of 11m tonnes. The island's bauxite production last year was 10.92m tonnes, 1.27m tonnes more than in 1989. Earnings of the industry last year were Dollars 714m, Dollars 156m above 1989.</p>

			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MARINA GETS TO KARLINER, BEATS OCEAN VIEW, 17-7  </P> <P> Randy Karliner played well, but Ocean View High's offensive line couldn't  penetrate a strong Marina defense in the Seahawks' 17-7 loss Friday at  Westminster High School.  </P> <P> Karliner, sacked six times and intercepted once for a Marina touchdown,  completed 12 of 28 passes for 193 yards for Ocean View (4-2-1, 2-1 in league  play).  </P> <P> He also completed a 34-yard touchdown pass to Jeff Bush in the final 1 minute  41 seconds of the game and carried 15 times for 73 of Ocean View's 155 yards  rushing.  </P> <P> Marina's Ingmar Northcott sacked Karliner three times unassisted, and assisted  on two more. Marina (5-2-1, 2-1), which only executed 14 plays in the first  half, took its first possession at its 20 after Ocean View's Ron Lightner  missed a 38-yard field goal with 6:24 left in the first quarter. Shawn Fulford,  who rushed for 102 of Marina's 164 yards, had a 45-yard run during this  nine-play drive. He scored from the one with 2:39 remaining.  </P> <P> In the fourth quarter, Dan Armstrong's 39-yard field goal gave Marina a 10-0  lead with 8:16 to play. Three plays after the ensuing kick, Chad Henderson  picked off Karliner's pass at the Ocean View 23 and ran it into the end zone in  the final 7:35. BOB BORSUM  </P></p>

The threat was made at a news conference here by Anatoly  Ezhelev, president of the Emergency Committee for the Protection  of the Press.    The committee, formed last month by the Union of Russian  Journalists, called on the government to take urgent measures to  "save freedom of the press" by paying debts and subsidies it  owes to state radio and television, as well as the country's  largest newspapers.    "People's right to receive news has become very expensive,"  said Ivan Laptev, president of Izvestia publishing house.    President of Russian state radio-television Oleg Popchov  said  that the relationship between journalists and the government  amounts to "a dialogue of the deaf."    Half of Russia went without television programming on  Thursday after communications companies went on strike over the  government's refusal to pay an 80-billion ruble ($50 million)  debt. The strike ended when the prime minister promised to pay  the debt.</p>

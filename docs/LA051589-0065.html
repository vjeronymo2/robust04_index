			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DREXEL APPOINTS EIGHT NEW VICE PRESIDENTS  </P> <P> Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. named eight new executive vice presidents as part  of a continuing shake-up following the firm's agreement April 13 to settle  Securities and Exchange Commission charges of securities fraud.  </P> <P> Peter Ackerman, 42, at one time thought to be a possible successor to Michael  Milken as head of the firm's junk bond department, was moved out of the  department and named head of Drexel's newly created International Capital  Markets Services Group. Drexel has said the new separate department was  established as a way of restricting the flow of confidential information  between the firm's corporate finance department and securities traders. As  executive vice president, Ackerman will continue to perform much the same  duties as before, designing the securities to be used in corporate  restructurings or leveraged buyouts, Drexel said.  </P> <P> James M. Davin, 43, who joined Drexel last year after 19 years at First Boston  Corp., was named executive vice president and designated as the senior trading  official responsible for ensuring that the firm's trading activities comply  with federal laws, Drexel said. The SEC settlement requires Drexel to appoint  such an official.  </P> <P> Stephen L. Joseph, 46, the brother of Drexel Chief Executive Fred Joseph, was  also named executive vice president and given responsibility for domestic fixed  income trading and sales, but not including high yield bonds or government  securities. He had established and been head of Drexel's mortgage-backed  securities department, which is being folded into a newly created "structured  asset" department.  </P> <P> Arthur Bilger, 36, Leon Black, 37, and John Sorte, 41, also were named  executive vice presidents. As previously reported, the three earlier this year  were named to jointly head the firm's corporate finance department.  </P> <P> The other new executive vice presidents are Michael J. Kugler, 50, in charge of  government securities trading and money market operations, and Walter J.  Sieczkowski, 44, who joined Drexel in 1987.  </P> <P> The eight new executive vice presidents join two Drexel officials who already  hold that title. They are John H. Kissick, currently serving as head of the  high-yield bond department in Beverly Hills, and Burton Siegel, director of  domestic and international institutional equities.  </P></p>

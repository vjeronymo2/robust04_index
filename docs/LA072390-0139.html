			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> NBA, PLAYERS DRAFT AGE 30-50 PRE-PENSION BENEFIT PROGRAM  </P> <P> The NBA and its players association agreed today to a pre-pension benefit plan  that will provide revenue for retired players between age 30 -- or one year  after retirement -- and 50 when their regular pensions begin.  </P> <P> The plan will be funded from the 53% of gross revenues which the league is  committed to paying to the players each year and was made possible because of  the growth of those gross revenues.  </P> <P> It will not alter salary caps set at $11.7 million, $12.5 million, $13.3  million and $14.2 million for the next four years.  </P> <P> The new program is designed as a mandatory savings plan with benefits  calculated according to the number of years a player is in the league, his  salary in relation to the salaries of all players, his age and the size of  benefit pool.  </P> <P> "Our players will be provided for," Commissioner David Stern said. "This is one  area we have looked at wistfully over the years, to create a fund that would  eliminate the specter of former NBA players who are destitute or short of  living expenses."  </P> <P> Each player receives approximately 8% of his salary as a contribution to the  plan each year he plays, with the contributions above and beyond his regular  salary.  </P></p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Truck sales on fast road to recovery TRUCK SALES in western Europe will recover at an increasing pace this year and next, following the decline in 1991, according to the German motor industry association (VDA). It expects especially sharp improvements in Britain, Sweden, and Spain. However, the German market, which has been given a considerable lift from unification of the country, will see a slowdown, the VDA adds. German producers will have to renew their efforts in foreign markets as a result, says Mr Kunibert Schmidt, the VDA's deputy managing director. Competition will continue to be intense and German manufacturers will have to work harder to offset their country's disadvantage as an industrial location, especially on costs. The VDA forecasts that the total west European truck market will rise by 1 per cent this year and 4 per cent next, after a 6 per cent drop in 1991. Excluding Germany, it expects sales in western Europe to rise 3 per cent and 6 per cent respectively compared with a 14 per cent decline in 1991. The German market, which jumped by 48 per cent last year, is expected to fall by 6 per cent in each of the next two years. By contrast, the similarly sized French market should move up by 2 per cent in 1992 and 5 per cent in 1993 after falling by 12 per cent in 1991. A marked upturn is forecast in the UK, with last year's slump of 29 per cent followed by a rise of 8 per cent this year and one of 11 per cent in 1993. In Sweden, which suffered a 36 per cent collapse in 1991, the market is likely to fall a further 14 per cent this year before climbing by 28 per cent in 1993. Mr Schmidt says German truck production has continued to develop strongly, with a rise of 11 per cent in the first quarter of this year. Total output in 1991 was 12.5 per cent higher at 355,500 units.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 28 Apr (EFE) -- Today, Chilean Foreign  Minister Carlos Figueroa stated strengthening the  internationalization of the Chilean economy is one of the great  objectives of Chilean foreign policy. During a lecture at a  private university, Figueroa described the guidelines of the  foreign policy of President Eduardo Frei's administration.    Figueroa said negotiating for a free trade agreement with  the  United States, or Chile's acceptance as a NAFTA member, should  be the government's priority goals. He explained that in order  to step up the internationalization of the Chilean economy,  alliances and agreements that will ensure the country's  appropriate insertion into the great world markets are necessary.    Regarding the European Union, Figueroa said this area is  very  important to Chilean foreign policy because, in his opinion, the  European economy represents the largest integrated market in the  world and is one of the most important megamarkets for Chile.    Another subject mentioned by the foreign minister as being  of  great importance to his foreign policy are relations with Latin  American countries, which should be relations that would  contribute to a climate of democratic stability. Figueroa  pointed out the need to participate, in a selective manner, in  initiatives to promote peace, the broadening of democracy,  respect for human rights, and development and equity in the  international system.    The minister said the current government, which was sworn in  11 March, hopes to implement a lasting foreign policy that will  provide continuity. That foreign policy should respect  international law and agreements and promote the legal and  peaceful solution to controversies and the search for peace.</p>

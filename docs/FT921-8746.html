			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Books: A writer's gift for getting the picture KEEPING A RENDEZVOUS by John Berger Granta Books Pounds 14.99, 248 pages INTO THEIR LABOURS by John Berger Granta Books Pounds 15.99, 513 pages AFTER A youthful career as a painter and art-teacher, John Berger emerged as a significant writer when he was in his mid-twenties. He became known in the early 1950s as an art-critic. Today having passed the age of 65, when people in many professions are forced to retire, Berger is as industrious as ever, his brain still teeming with ideas and insights. Berger's gift for seeing into a picture, his skill in defining its relation to society and to history, was apparent from the start. His arresting descriptions of paintings in engage terms reached a wide public when, in the early days of Monitor and Granada's cultural programmes, he became a guru of art-appreciation on television. He was the first critic ruthlessly to sort out the gold from the dross in the work of Picasso, about whom he published a controversial book, The Success and Failure of Picasso, in 1965. Not content with being merely a critical mediator between the artist and the public, Berger also had ambitions in fiction. As novelist he applied himself to that confusing period of European history when the Austro-Hungarian Empire finally crumbled, culminating in the outbreak of the first world war. Berger's hero was the son of an Italian merchant and his Anglo-American mistress, a young man who lived for danger and for the seduction of women. He was a modern Don Juan caught up in the rising tide of Serbian nationalism, Italian Irredentism, and other forces of peasant aggression. The novel straddled a Europe full of racial tension, with its climax set in Trieste. It was wonderfully well visualised in terms of the historical period. This was the novel G which won the Booker Prize in 1972. It represented the peak of Berger's literary achievement. And of his notoriety - he turned the customary speech of acceptance at the dinner into a speech of rejection, attacking his hosts for their exploitation of local labour in the sugar plantations of the Caribbean, and announcing his intention of donating the prize money to the Black Power movement. If the speech had been intended as a crude publicity stunt which - to judge from the passionate intensity with which it was delivered - it clearly was not, it could hardly have been better timed. The speech did wonders for the book, and even more for the Prize. It inaugurated a tradition of a verbal firework display at the end of the dinner that in recent years has tended to lapse. After that public performance Berger withdrew into obscurity to a village in the French Alps where he still lives. He has made an extensive study in this region of peasant life - 'a life' as he puts it, 'committed completely to survival'. Berger lives there not as an observer, a literary researcher with a tape-recorder and a note-pad, but as a member of this community. By now he is as familiar with the messy business of slaughtering a cow and carving up the meat, or shovelling the shit from the outhouse to a barrow in a nearby field - an annual chore he describes with relish - as anyone brought up to these tasks. But he remains nonetheless a writer, one who since 1974 has produced three novels, Pig Earth, Once in Europa and Lilac and Flag, aiming to trace the journey of the European peasant from the mountains to the metropolis. This trilogy, now appearing in one volume as Into Their Labours, is a remarkable achievement of observation and unpatronising sympathy. At the same time the journalism has not dried up. Keeping A Rendezvous is a collection of pieces dating from the late 1980s onwards and happily full of what Berger still does best of all. This is to stand in front of a work of art and tell us exactly what he sees. He does it with Velazquez's 'Portrait of Aesop', with Tintoretto's 'Woman With Bare Breasts', with the recumbent nudes of Henry Moore, with a collection of black and white photographs of the French countryside around Belfort, with a number of drawings on paper by old masters and moderns. In all these instances what Berger sees goes far beyond the ostensible boundaries of the picture. He is especially perceptive in describing that curious 20th century French folly, an ideal palace built out of tufa by Ferdinand Cheval, a village postman in the Department of the Drome who died in 1924 but whose monument still lives. One word of caution: Berger is not always the easiest of writers to read. He puts his paragraphs together like a game of dominoes and he seems to have an infinite number of double-blanks to place between each set of paragraphs. The Berger blank is like the Pinter pause, a pregnant moment of silence within the text. He over-uses it to the point where it has become an irritating mannerism. Berger likes to develop his ideas through parallels between different areas of experience, particularly between human and animal life. Sometimes these are illuminating but sometimes they simply lead nowhere. However, Berger at his best, as in the piece here on Jackson Pollock, is a remarkably rewarding interpreter of visual experience.</p>

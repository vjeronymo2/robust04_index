			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / ICI to end free hamper scheme ICI ON Teesside is to stop giving free Christmas hampers to its pensioners in order to save money as it continues its restructuring. Since hamper distribution began 25 years ago, the number of people qualifying has grown more than fifteenfold to well over 15,000, and now threatens to be twice the number of ICI staff in the area. The cost of issuing the hampers now exceeds Pounds 200,000 a year - a sum described by ICI as prohibitive. The news that this year's Christmas hamper will be the last broke in a letter to the pensioners from Mr David Allan, ICI on Teesside's personnel manager. The TGWU general union deplored the move, but ICI said some pensioners had said they understood the decision.</p>

			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI: TITANS HAVE THEIR MAN RIGHT NOW  </P> <P> About the only thing more ridiculous than John Sneed's former slick-back look  is his title, which reads, Cal State Fullerton acting basketball coach.  Considering the circumstances, Sneed needs the job qualifier the way he needs  another tube of Brylcreem.  </P> <P> But that's where Sneed finds himself these days, with an extra adjective in his  title and a whole lot of uncertainty in his future. How unnecessary.  </P> <P> Fullerton Athletic Director Ed Carroll said this week that the school soon will  begin advertising the basketball opening in at least one NCAA trade  publication. Meanwhile, applications already have started to trickle in.  Carroll said Fullerton had "an institutional commitment to affirmative action  and an open-search process."  </P> <P> Hear, hear! Affirm all you want. Process until you're blue and orange in the  face. To do otherwise would be wrong.  </P> <P> But when all is said and searched, when every application has been examined,  Sneed still should be the Titans' choice -- no ifs, ands or interims. After  all, he was there when Fullerton needed him most. Now it's time to return the  favor, to say nothing of the loyalty.  </P> <P> Twenty-six days before the season was to begin, Sneed was asked (begged?) to  assume the coaching vacuum left by the sudden and still-not-explained  resignation of George McQuarn. Sneed, knowing full well that the Titans were  light on talent and depth, quickly said yes.  </P> <P> He could have declined the offer, leaving the Titan administration with no  choice but to conduct a hurried and probably ill-fated search process.  Fullerton would have been left with a transition period as smooth as a  cobblestone road.  </P> <P> Instead, Sneed stayed and took his chances on a basketball program that  survives on a modest budget, plays in an oversized high school gym and competes  in a conference ruled by the likes of UNLV. Isn't that worth something, mainly  a real and legitimate opportunity to recruit and mold a team?  </P> <P> Fullerton appealed to Sneed's sense of loyalty and ambition in November. It  made him an offer he couldn't refuse: the keys to a Division I basketball  program, of which there are only so many. It also apparently made it clear that  the school felt duty bound to open the position for the taking at season's end.  In essence, all Carroll could promise Sneed was an audition and nothing more.  </P> <P> Sneed may or may not be the greatest coach since Adolph Rupp. Who's to say,  what with the situation he inherited. The Titans have become an improvisational  troupe, tinkering with this and that as they go along. Sneed is just now  becoming comfortable with the idea of coaching power, of media relations, of  styles and strategies and image. In politics, it's called, being  "presidential."  </P> <P> And big whoop if the Titans don't win the Big West Conference title. They  weren't going to win it anyway, even if Bobby Knight himself were on hand to  hurl a few folding chairs.  </P> <P> This is a team that returned not one starter. Its point guard is a freshman.  There is no true center. Sneed still doesn't have a second assistant coach. No  time. He can't even recruit players, what with the uncertainty regarding his  own status.  </P> <P> Recruit: "Whaddya mean, you don't know if you'll be my coach if I sign with  Fullerton?"  </P> <P> Sneed: "Well, see, the thing is, I'm just an acting coach right now. I won't  know anything for sure until, well, maybe mid-March, at the earliest."  </P> <P> Recruit: "Uh, Coach, signing day is in April. What happens if they hire someone  else? Then what do I do?"  </P> <P> Sneed: "Beautiful weather we're having, isn't it? There's such a freshness in  the air."  </P> <P> Recruit: "Later, man."  </P> <P> Someone needs to explain to the Fullerton administration that recruits aren't a  patient sort. Recruits don't understand institutional policy. They do, however,  understand that Sneed might not be around next season, which tends to undermine  their interests in becoming Titans. After all, why make a commitment to  Fullerton when Fullerton won't make a commitment to Sneed?  </P> <P> Somehow, Sneed has managed to remain diplomatic about the school's decision to  begin, as Carroll puts it, "our regular process." Who cares if the regular  process was on winter break back in November?  </P> <P> But when asked recently if it was hard to recruit players when the word acting  preceded your title, Sneed answered, "Is it hard for a married man to go out  and get a date?" he said.  </P> <P> By late Monday evening, the Titans could be 9-8 overall and 4-4 in the Big  West, which isn't half bad considering they're still searching for the right  style. Most recently, a zone press has sparked the beginnings of a running  team. It also has spawned talk of a respectable season, maybe something in the  12-14 victory range. We'll see.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Sneed develops his own identity as a head coach. He has become more  assertive on the sidelines. He has slowly reshaped the Titans with a variety of  strategies and personnel moves. He has displayed a sense of humor, as well as a  bit of a bark.  </P> <P> This is Sneed's one big chance. So far, he has done himself proud. Now it is  Fullerton and Carroll's turn to do the same.  </P></p>

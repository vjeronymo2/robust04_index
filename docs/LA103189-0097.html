			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Interest Rates Up on T-Bills: Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities  rose at the latest auction. The Treasury sold $7.8 billion of new three-month  bills at an average discount rate of 7.78%, up from 7.52% last week. Another  $7.8 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate of  7.62%, up from 7.5% last week. The new discount rates understate the actual  return to investors -- 8.05% for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling  for $9,799.00 and 8.04% for a six-month bill selling for $9,610.50. The  discount rate reflects the price discount received when government securities  are purchased at less than face value.  </P></p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (5): Applications for electronic filing cabinets - . . .  For Database TODAY'S electronic database has exactly the same problems as the old-fashioned filing cabinet with drawers: retrieving information is never as easy as it should be. Electronic data items do not get lost, mislaid or mis-filed as paper items do. The main concern in the initial design of an electronic database is the way data will be retrieved and used. It takes the vision of a seer to predict every situation, every possible detail which might prove of interest in the future. Even the auspiciously-named Oracle, one of the leading database products which runs on many different computers, can only deliver information that somebody has, at some point, defined, collected and keyed-in. Once there, the data is re-useable and can be shared between applications, and centrally updated. A decade ago, buying a database was a heavyweight, long-term decision, taken by IT experts who examined the entrails for predictions of performance by running benchmark tests. Performance mattered because the database is often the repository of information used in high volume transaction processing applications. The coding of the applications was vital (and still is) to performance, as is the organisation of data. Users of automatic telling machines know they are sometimes slow in response: there is probably a queue for the database as the details of the account are accessed and delivered, using the account number as the 'key' to retrieval. Relational databases allow any item or combination of items, (eg name, age) to be used as a key. MARKET LEADERS Heavyweight database products, at the top end of the market, still account for large chunks of the IT budget. They include IBM's stalwart of transaction processing: the long-lived IMS, and its relational heir, DB/2, as well as mainframe versions of Oracle, Software AG's and Computer Associates' Datacom, and Cincom's Supra, successor to the phenomenally successful Total, which dominated the database market in the 1970s. By the early 1980s, minicomputer users had already discovered flexibility of inbuilt databases such as in Pick systems and IBM's System 38, now AS400. Then came PCs, and the boom in database applications under 'standard' PC-DOS and later Unix operating systems. Determining market penetration is less easy than it used to be, because of the variety of hardware hosts in use. A few databases now run on a broad range of computers, but the deciding factor in the 1990s is less likely to be the computer host, performance, or even the development tools and data access facilities available (see Q for Query languages). The real selling point is more likely to be a specific application, and the decision maker may not be an IT expert at all. In fact, a departmental manager is now likely to buy a database by default, as part of an application. This accounts for the rise of the value-added reseller (VAR) as an important part of the sales chain, in many cases taking over the role once fulfilled by the consultant. Database vendors use 'runtime' licences for such situations. The end-user of the application receives an abbreviated version of the database, rather than the entire set of development tools. Users are still able to use query languages for ad-hoc reports, though in many cases they hardly know which database underpins their system. Relational databases, built for ready retrieval of data, made it easier to produce applications that could be closely tailored. Many database vendors, particularly in the competitive mid-range Unix market, now produce heavy tomes listing the various ready-made applications available, ranging from specialised pig-breeding packages to everyday accounting or marketing systems. Informix, Ingres, Oracle and Progress are among the database vendors who have built up a strong third-party 'stable' of VARs. Their directories serve users, VARs, and ultimately their own ends, because once users have acquired their primary application, they usually look for others from the same database stable. MORE THAN 120 PRODUCTS The Progress Applications Catalogue lists over 120 products, claiming 100,000 applications licences. Informix's Solutions Guide lists hundreds of applications, in 30 categories, one of which, accounting, offers 50 options. Oracle estimates 350 applications from 130 VARs, who may hold multiple development licences because of the various hardware platforms: one medical specialist sells as many as 200 runtime licences a year. Unlike many vendors of mainframe products on annual licences, PC and Unix database vendors rarely know all their users. Oracle is launching a campaign to locate all users, authorised or not. Tony Lacy-Thompson, senior product manager at Informix, admits it is sometimes a problem to know who all Informix end-users are, partly because work with OEMs, distributors and VARs has been so successful: there are around 400 Informix VARs in the UK and 2,000 worldwide - 'runtime licences probably account for about 70 per cent of the total licences, around half a million worldwide,' he says. Traditionally, the only way to do it has been to include a registration card, but they only have 2,000 names that way - 'now we've started issuing a serial number and key. We only give out the key once people have registered, and that gives us the opportunity to find our a lot about our users.'</p>

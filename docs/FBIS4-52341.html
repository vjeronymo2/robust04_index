			<p>CSO     [Text] Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) has  fabricated a prototype amplifier IC [integrated circuit] for use  in converting optically transmitted data into electrical  signals. It is capable of processing signals in the 60 gigahertz  (one gigahertz is equal to 1 billion hertz) frequency range. The  new IC substantially exceeds the capacity of old IC's which were  limited to processing signals with a maximum speed of 40  gigahertz. The new IC will enable the manufacture of repeaters  for basic circuits and can be used in future transmission of  multimedia data.    The newly developed IC will restore, prior to reproduction  and reprocessing, signals weakened through optical transmission  to a level where they can be used in microprocessors (MPU). It  incorporates indium phosphorous high electron mobility  transistor (HEMT) structures and is capable of handling  broadband signals.    The new IC also incorporates a dedicated circuit for  accurate  restoration of low frequency signals. In so doing, it possesses  the capability to restore signals of a broad band up to 60 hertz  to electrical signals with a high degree of efficiency from  direct current.    Further, when the newly developed IC is used to fabricate an  amplifier, the wavelengths are shortened as the frequencies rise  and resonate inside the amplifier and accelerate the emission of  static. NTT coped with that problem by conducting a  three-dimensional electromagnetic simulation based on a finite  allocation formula to arrive at the optimum configuration for  the amplifier. The result of this procedure was a prototype  which measures 20 mm in length, 25 mm in width, and 14 mm in  height.    High-volume transmission of data over optical communication  systems requires either an increase in the number of optical  fibers or expansion of the signal band width. The new IC falls  in the latter category and can be used in the future for  transmission of high data volume for purposes such as multimedia.    In the future NTT hopes to develop systems which can handle  signals in the tera (one tera equals 1 trillion) bits range by  fabricating prototype amplifiers of a higher capacity with two  of the new IC's linked in tandem.</p>

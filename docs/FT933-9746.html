			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Home loan offers THE ALLIANCE &amp; Leicester building society has introduced a new range of fixed rate mortgages in addition to its existing one-year fixed rate offer of 5.45 per cent (APR 8.3 per cent). The new rates are 6.25 per cent (APR 8.2 per cent) fixed for two years; 6.95 per cent (APR 8.2 per cent) fixed for three years; and 7.95 per cent (APR 8.5 per cent) fixed for five years. Loans can be for a maximum of 90 per cent of the property's value. They are available in repayment, endowment and pension-linked form, are available to all borrowers, and can be transferred to another property if the borrower stays with the A &amp; L. There is an arrangement fee of 0.5 per cent, up to a maximum of Pounds 300. Customers must buy buildings/contents insurance, and there are early redemption penalties. The society is also offering one-year mortgage discounts for buyers who are not first-timers. Loans of up to 70 per cent of the property's value get a discount of 3 per cent off the society's variable rate, now 7.99 per cent. There is a 2.5 per cent discount for loans up to 80 per cent, 2 per cent for up to 90 per cent, and 1 per cent for up to 95 per cent. There is no arrangement fee, but borrowers must buy buildings and/or contents insurance from the society. The Northern Rock has a rate of 7.29 per cent (8.1 per cent APR) fixed until August 1 1997. Loans are available up to 90 per cent of valuation, with a maximum of Pounds 150,000. There is an arrangement fee of Pounds 275, of which Pounds 100 is non-refundable, and borrowers must take the society's buildings and contents insurance. The mortgage is portable, but there is a penalty of four months' interest for redemptions within the fixed rate period. The Lambeth building society is offering a range of mortgages fixed until July 31 1996. The rates depend on how much is borrowed and whether the borrower opts for accident, sickness and unemployment insurance to cover the loan. In any case the borrower must take out buildings and/or contents insurance with the society. With mortgage insurance, the rate is 6.59 per cent (APR 8.8 per cent) for loans up to 75 per cent; 6.8 per cent (APR 8.9 per cent) up to 90 per cent; and 7.4 per cent (APR 9.5 per cent) up to 95 per cent.

There is a non-refundable arrangement fee of Pounds 250. If the mortgage is redeemed within the fixed rate period, and the borrower does not take out another mortgage with the society, there is a penalty of six months' interest. For redemptions after the fixed period, and up to five years, the penalty is three months. The Abbey National is increasing the minimum amount for a capital repayment on its mortgages from Pounds 100 to Pounds 1,000. Borrowers wanting to repay less than Pounds 1,000 will be encouraged to put the money in a savings account and make a repayment when they have Pounds 1,000.</p>

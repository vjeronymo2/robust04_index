			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Plans for Earth Summit enter critical stage PLANS for this year's Earth Summit enter a critical stage today as representatives of over 160 countries gather to complete an agenda for the June meeting in Rio de Janeiro. The meeting, expected to last five weeks, will try to secure world agreement on a global regime to protect the environment without applying too hard a brake to economic growth. This will include a wide array of measures, including an action plan dubbed Agenda 21 (for the new century) and an Earth Charter listing rights and obligations of governments and individuals. The Rio conference, organised by the UN, has been billed as an Earth Summit because heads of government are invited to lead their delegations. Mr John Major, UK prime minister, was among the first to accept. Emphasising UK support, Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, will address the meeting today, making clear the UK has not ruled out the use of fiscal measures, such as a carbon tax, as part of its strategy to clean up the environment. But he will point out the need for international agreements to make green measures effective. The EC has tentatively agreed on a carbon tax which it intended to propose at Rio. But there have recently been indications that it is backing off the idea because of lack of support outside the EC. Mr George Bush, who campaigned in the 1988 election vowing to be 'the environment president' has not said if he will go to Rio. His administration wants more data before considering environmental measures that could drastically raise costs for industry during a grinding recession. Last week, the US pledged Dollars 75m (Pounds 42.8m) to the international effort to reduce 'greenhouse gases' that have resulted in ominous climate change. But the US, by far the greatest source of emissions, has yet to consider broader incentives to curb the gases. The US has been blamed for lack of progress on a convention on climate change supposed to be signed in Rio. Mr Maurice Strong, a Canadian millionaire businessman and conference secretary-general, believes mankind's survival rests on saving the ecosystem. With the threat of global war no longer plausible, 'the primary issues we face today are all environment-related'. A paper for the New York session states that underlying Agenda 21 is the notion that humanity has reached a choice between continuing present policies or changing course to bring about 'more productive and better protected ecosystems and a safer, more prosperous future'.

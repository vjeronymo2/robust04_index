			<p>Thin   Film Quickly, Advantageous for Industrial Applications   <F P=102> 94FE0283E Tokyo KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO in Japanese 6 Dec 93 p 4  --FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0283E </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] A research group led by Professor Toyonobu Yoshida  of Tokyo University's Engineering Department recently succeeded  in fabricating a yttrium-base superconducting thin film on a  strontium-titanium-oxygen (STO) substrate, using a heat  plasma/flash vaporization technique. When this method is used,  subsequent processing usually is not required to manifest  superconductivity and a yttrium-base superconducting thin film  of large area can be produced in an extremely short time, so it  has great industrial merit as well. Research already has started  on specific applications, and this research group plans to do  applied research aimed at finding other uses.    Professor Yoshida, et al., have succeeded in synthesizing a  YBaCuO (yttrium-barium-copper-oxygen) high-temperature  superconducting thin film with a plasma process known as heat  plasma/flash vaporization. With this method, 10[.sup]18[/]  oxygen atoms, which have higher reactivity than ECR plasma, are  flashed at the rate of 1 square centimeter (cm) per second and  metal film formation is carried out in a gaseous state. The  research group mixed particles of an alloy of vanadium-silicon  and niobium-silicon, applied 40 kilowatt heat plasma/flash  vaporization, and in 15 minutes formed a superconducting thin  film 1 to 2 microns thick in the shape of a cylinder 14 cm in  diameter on the STO substrate.    Study of the thin film confirmed that it was  YBa[.sub]2[/]Cu[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]x[/], 123 [composition  ratio], and in superconductive phase. 10[.sup]6[/] A  (angstroms) per square cm superconductivity was confirmed. It is  said that for the substrate, magnesium oxide or zirconia also  are possible instead of STO.    Additionally, with this method, the after-processing that is  usually essential for high-temperature superconductors is not  necessary. It is thought that what demonstrates  superconductivity is slow cooling in the oxygen and that the  reason a large thin film can be formed in such a short time  probably is that accumulation speed is faster because in  radicals, cluster-like coating occurs.    Some of Professor Yoshida's group has begun joint research  with companies on specific uses, and it is said that prospects  for development have been confirmed. High-temperature  superconductivity research samples certainly do not require  after-processing and this leads to cost reduction. This  advantage in processing has raised expectations for expanding  the uses of this superconducting thin film.</p>

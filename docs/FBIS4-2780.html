			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Cotton Stays Under State Planning"] </F>   [Text] The government has decided against opening cotton  crops to market forces this year, the Ministry of Internal Trade  said.    The ministry spokesman, Ding Junfa, said dwindling output  forces the State to continue planning and managing all  purchases, marketing and storage of cotton.    The statement refuted calls from some local sectors to open  up the market.    Ding said the State will stick to a unified production and  price policy this year and rural supply and marketing  co-operatives will be the only organs allowed to purchase and  market cotton.    In the past two years, cotton output has fallen dramatically  because of poor weather, pests and plant diseases.    And government purchases from last fall's crop amounted to  only two thirds of the total from the harvest in 1992, a recent  report in the Farmers' Daily said.    The ministry is taking a series of measures to improve  cotton  purchases and marketing this year.    Major textile enterprises with good production and profit  records will be provided with an adequate supply, while those  involved in the speculation and profiteering of cotton will face  penalties, Ding said.    And to make up for the cotton shortage, some textile plants  are increasing the use of synthetic fibres and imported raw  materials, he added.</p>

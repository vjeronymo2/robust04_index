			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Former lottery chief held Mr Gerard Cole, the former chairman of Francaise des Jeux, the French lottery, was yesterday in police custody following a probe by public prosecutors in Nanterre. Mr Cole, who was a former adviser to President Francois Mitterrand, was strongly criticised in a report on the lottery published last year by the French financial inspection body. He has defended himself against accusations, including abuse of funds, but nevertheless resigned his position last December after prosectors began investigations in February 1993. He had been appointed in 1989. Separately yesterday, a French judge investigating corruption in the funding of political parties was embarrassed by accusations made against his father-in-law. Judge Eric Halphen expressed surprise that his relative - who had been taken into police custody - had allegedly received money from the wife of a suspect in a probe into RPR funding.</p>

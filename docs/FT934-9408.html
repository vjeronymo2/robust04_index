			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / UK to raise concerns about EC trade data THE UK is facing three years of unreliable and incomplete trade figures following problems with the European Community's new system of measuring intra-Community trade. The Central Statistical Office said yesterday it was delaying publication of complete visible trade figures for the first eight months of this year because a lack of data had made it difficult to seasonally adjust the figures. The delay marks a further setback for Intrastat, the EC's VAT-based system for measuring trade that was introduced at the beginning of the year to coincide with the single market. The problem has arisen as government officials from France, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK meet today to discuss the teething problems of the EC-wide system, which have proved far greater than expected. Officials believed the method of collection would be operating smoothly by the middle of this year. But detailed figures are unlikely to be produced before the end of the year and even then, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and Ireland are not certain they will be able to publish. Statisticians in the UK say problems connected with seasonally adjusting the figures mean a reliable series of statistics for Britain's trade with the rest of the world will not be possible for at least three years. The CSO said yesterday it needed another two days to 'reassess seasonal and constant price adjustments made under the new system now in use throughout the EC'. Figures for Britain's world trade published this year have been stamped with a government warning about their reliability. The CSO wants to make the next set of figures - the last set before the Budget on November 30 - as accurate as possible to avoid embarrassing, large revisions. The switch from a customs-based system of measuring intra-EC trade to one based on VAT returns has been beset by problems since its introduction in January. Last month Eurostat, the EC's statistical office, said publication of up-to-date figures was being hampered by a slow rate of reply by companies, particularly small companies. The UK has been quicker to produce monthly figures than other member states, although its plan to produce monthly figures by the end of July proved too optimistic. Pressure for today's meeting has come particularly from the UK, which is concerned that the new method of collecting data may be giving an inaccurate view of economic trends. Some economists are concerned the unreliability of export and import price figures may have led to an underestimation of the level of output in the UK.</p>

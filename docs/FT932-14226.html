			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Observer: In the shade When it comes to stock market forecasters there are good firms and bad. However, BZW has broken new ground by venturing into a particularly tricky area of British forecasting - the weather. As one of the lead brokers on the rights issue for Zeneca, ICI's bioscience subsidiary, BZW has pulled out all the stops to show off its client. Tucked away inside an impressively bullish 96-page report is a prediction that Zeneca's agrochemicals and seeds business will enjoy a 10 per cent rise in turnover and a 41 per cent rise in operating profit this year. One of the key assumptions behind the upbeat forecast seems to be that just because last year's climatic conditions were 'poor', the weather should be better this year. Even the Met Office would shy away from putting its name to a forecast like that.</p>

			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Welsh agency's grant halved Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, has halved the grant in aid of the Welsh Development Agency to Pounds 25m. The agency's budget for 1995-96 has been set at Pounds 153m. For the next two years the agency will raise most of the money it needs from sales of Pounds 180m of land and property sales. Total standard spending for local authorities in Wales has been set at Pounds 2.77bn, an increase of 2.7 per cent. The Council of Welsh Districts last night forecast that this would mean council taxes would rise on average by 10 per cent to 11 per cent. Mr Redwood has ordered a 15 per cent cut in administrative costs at the Welsh Office over the next three years and around 400 jobs are to be shed.</p>

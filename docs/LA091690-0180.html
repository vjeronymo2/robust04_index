			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SEASON'S NEW ROCK 'N' ROLL HIGH SCHOOL  </P> <P> Gil Grant jokes that it felt like he'd been grazed by a Mike Tyson uppercut  when NBC executives told him they wanted to produce his mischievous script  about life between classes at a contemporary high school, but only if he could  figure out a way to transform it into a musical. He wasn't knocked out, but it  took him a couple days to shake out the cobwebs and climb up off the mat.  </P> <P> "At first I thought, 'Oh great. I'm the guy who in the '60s, while everyone  else was going to The Doors concert, was home watching Dean Martin on  television every Thursday night,' " said Grant, a 40-year-old, bearded man with  an earring, who created "The Oldest Rookie" and wrote for years for "Eight Is  Enough." "I told them, 'Sure, if you want a hip high school show, you've really  come to the right person.' "  </P> <P> While Steven Bochco has sniped that "Hull High," which at one time was called  "Hull Street High," only became a musical because ABC already had bought his  musical, "Cop Rock," executives at NBC and Disney, which is producing the show,  said that they collectively decided that just doing a comedy about high school  wasn't enough "to hook the audience."  </P> <P> "The script was terrific. It was very funny," said Garth Ancier, president of  network television production at Disney. "But we thought it needed one extra  piece to really make it special. There were a number of ideas bandied about.  NBC had aired a musical a few years back called 'Rags to Riches' that had a  real vitality to it. And Disney has the tradition of being in the musical form,  and so we all wanted to try it. There was a great belief that a musical could  succeed."  </P> <P> Even when musicals, especially "Rags to Riches," have bombed as series?  </P> <P> "I think television has under-realized the potential of music in series  programs," said Perry Simon, NBC's executive vice president of prime-time  programs. "If you have the creative forces to make it work, music gives you a  tremendous upside with the audience. But the show has to succeed on its own  dramatic merits, with strong characters, stories and relationships. Music  cannot make a difference if it's being used as a crutch."  </P> <P> Grant, the show's executive producer, hired Kenny Ortega, the choreographer  from the film "Dirty Dancing," as co-executive producer and primary director of  the show. Then he retooled the script, looking for ways to inject music. The  first thing he hit on was a rapping Greek chorus of four teen-agers, who serve  as the conscience of the school and thread the story lines together with an  ongoing commentary in rap.  </P> <P> "Then we had to figure out how to do the bigger musical numbers," Grant said.  "And we decided to come at it either out of fantasy or something we call  heightened reality. Like the opening number in the pilot, it's just the high  school band and drill team practicing out in front of the school, but it's the  greatest band and drill team in the country."  </P> <P> The pilot, which has already aired twice on NBC, also featured an adolescent  boy's fantasy that shows the sexiest, youngest teacher in America, decked out  in a tight leather outfit, singing and dancing about similes and metaphors and  writhing provocatively on a huge volume of "Longfellow's Collected Works." A  future episode will showcase a young female libertine trying to infiltrate the  all-boys wrestling team in a smoky dance that is half wrestling, half ballet.  Another episode has a rap version of "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall" that  denounces drinking on a school field trip.  </P> <P> But, mostly, the show reminisces with great energy and some innocent  raunchiness about Grant's own high school experience in Arizona. "I didn't want  it to be 'TV 101' or 'The Bronx Zoo' because my experience of high school  wasn't some preachy and sanctimonious issue of the week. It was a series of  fragments and stories and problems that happened between Period 1 and at your  locker going to Period 2."  </P> <P> To that end, the scripts are written first, with an eye toward ironing out the  story lines and plot twists, and then Grant and his music people go back  through them to see where a music or dance sequence might enhance the action.  Often, during the actual production, Grant said that Ortega will choreograph a  whimsical dance bit at the last minute.  </P> <P> Unlike "Cop Rock," all of the music is prerecorded. And while the primary  actors do their own dancing, most of them lip-sync the songs to the voices of  professional singers.  </P> <P> Even with the prerecordings, to meet budget and time constraints, subsequent  episodes of the show will contain far less elaborate production numbers than  the pilot. Grant said that regular episodes will at most feature one full-scale  number and several other smaller musical bits.  </P> <P> Still, Grant says that the show costs 30% more than the average drama. Disney's  Ancier would only say that his company will spend more on this series than any  other hourlong show it currently has in the works. Disney is willing to suffer  a rather large financial hit initially, Ancier said, because it believes the  show's music and its hip MTV attitude will make it a viable and lucrative  product in the syndication market several years down the road.  </P> <P> NBC has deliberately programmed "Hull High" in a time period (Sundays at 7  p.m.) that has been devoid of programs for teen-agers since Fox moved "21 Jump  Street" to a different night a year ago. It is doubtful that "Hull High's"  ratings will ever surpass "60 Minutes," but it does provide an alternative to  the news magazine and to ABC's more serious-minded drama, "Life Goes On." Fox  will compete this season with two new sitcoms, including "Parker Lewis Can't  Lose," another rambunctious series set in a modern day high school.  </P> <P> "We might get lucky," Grant said. "Just because of the sheer amount of music  out there today. It's such a huge portion of kids' lives. It infiltrates  everything. We really do give those kids something to watch at that hour and I  think something for adults to watch with their kids."  </P></p>

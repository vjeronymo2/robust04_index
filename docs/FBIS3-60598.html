It has  been two years since the Ukrainian Armed Forces were  established. So, this question is still on everyone's mind  today. This is understandable, because such issues as defense,  armed forces, and defense budget are the center of attention in  any country, the more so when a country only begins to  reestablish its statehood, including its defense structures and  mechanisms.    Currently, these issues are vigorously discussed by the  Ukrainian people at all levels -- in the legislature, the  government, and the media. The Ukrainian Supreme Council has  adopted a military doctrine and examined a concept of Ukrainian  state security.    One of the most important issues is, of course, the problem  of nuclear weapons. Many controversies have been triggered by  the debate over this issue, which becomes more vehement every  day. In this article, I would like to touch upon a few aspects  of this topic.    First of all, is Ukraine a nuclear state? Everybody must  understand that currently it is not. It is not the same to have  rights to be a nuclear state (Ukraine undoubtedly has such  rights) and to be one. At this time, Ukraine can neither use  these weapons (Ukraine does not possess the control systems),  nor is it able to independently provide secure and efficient  maintenance of them (this is the sole competence of the  producers of these weapons, who are not controlled by Ukraine).    This way, the statements on "our" nuclear weapons that "do  not have to be turned back to anybody," or on Ukraine's nuclear  status, politely speaking, are not justified. A simple decision  to detain the nuclear weapons deployed on Ukrainian territory  will not make our country a nuclear state.    Secondly, can Ukraine become a nuclear state?    To become a real nuclear state, it is necessary to go  through  the entire process that other nuclear states have experienced,  meaning to develop full-value nuclear potential (except the  designing and production already existing in Ukraine).    Should a decision on Ukraine's nuclear status be adopted, it  will be necessary to develop our own nuclear-warhead technology,  appropriate production forces, scientific potential, as well as  solve the issue of nuclear testing (meaning to find a place on  Ukraine's highly populated territory where tests could be  conducted, since only countries that have well-developed nuclear  weapons systems can introduce a moratorium on nuclear tests --  it is not possible to develop new nuclear weapons without  testing).    Theoretically, Ukraine is able to solve most of these  problems (I will not say how many billions of karbovanetses or  even dollars it would cost). However, it should be pointed out  that given the current economic circumstances, this could be too  heavy a burden.    Thirdly, what could be the consequences of such a decision?    It is not hard to predict the political consequences of such  a decision. It is obvious that we will have to forget about  help from other countries, in practically all fields. The  sanctions against Iraq and South Africa should be remembered. A  possibility of more decisive acts by other countries should also  be taken into consideration, provided that those countries are  really concerned about Ukraine's nuclear program. The military  actions against Iraq's nuclear facilities may be cited as an  example.    This way, analyzing the political, economic, and military  aspects of national security, it is hard to avoid the feeling  that the "nuclear option" might not strengthen but weaken  Ukraine's security. Additionally, nobody claims that the  Ukrainian Armed Forces are not strong enough to protect the  country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, including  deterrence measures. This can be provided by an army with  conventional equipment, given its modern organization, the  proper training of servicemen, and appropriate weapons.    Undoubtedly, Ukraine's defense policy provides for strategic  objectives that are to be conducted by the strategic forces.  However, these forces and objectives cannot be confused with the  temporarily united CIS Nuclear Forces. Not attempting to dwell  on the strictly military aspects of this issue, it should be  pointed out that besides such types of armed forces as infantry,  air force, antiaircraft defense, and a navy, Ukraine should also  have strategic forces, or at least a strategic command of  Ukraine's Armed Forces. It must be understood that such forces  should play a dual role -- to be a potential deterrent, meaning  that the nature of their weaponry should deter a potential  enemy, and to conduct regular strategic assignments.    They could include such deterrence-strategic forces as the  Missile Deterrence Forces, equipped with conventional weapons  allowed by international agreements. First of all, such  equipment should include highly accurate cruise missiles with  appropriate ranges, ballistic missiles with highly accurate  warheads of high yield, and nonnuclear intercontinental  missiles, provided strict adherence to appropriate international  agreements.    Ukraine has defined its path to nuclear-free status.  Nevertheless, the Ukrainian Strategic Forces can have  conventional missile systems of appropriate ranges. The more  so, because these missiles can be equipped with conventional  warheads, particularly, with volume-explosive [obyemno-vybukhova  diya], kinetic, and vacuum action modes. By the way, the  firepower of these missiles, as well as of certain artillery  systems, resembles that of certain weapons of mass destruction,  such as nuclear arms.    I would put somewhat aside the possibility of using  intercontinental ballistic missiles. The most important issue  in this regard is the military expediency of such missiles and  their maintenance. Installing conventional warheads on  strategic ballistic missiles would be expedient only in case a  warhead has a high energy yield, like the ones in  volume-explosive and kinetic warheads. Otherwise, sending a few  hundred kilograms of TNT to another continent would make no  sense. Another problem is the possibility of developing,  servicing, and improving such kinds of weapons. It is no secret  that Ukraine is producing strategic intercontinental missiles.  To equip them with nonnuclear warheads does not seem very  complicated. However, such sophisticated carriers as  intercontinental ballistic missiles should be occasionally  tested. However, there are no appropriate testing grounds in  Ukraine. So, it is necessary to reach an agreement on testing  our missiles with Kazakhstan or Russia, where such facilities  exist.    The number and storage of such missiles also require deep  consideration. Longevity and efficiency of these weapons  depends on these factors.    An appropriate missile-attack warning system is also very  important. Without it, intercontinental ballistic missiles,  especially those in silos, could become easy targets of a first  strike due to their inability to launch a counterattack.    The final decision, of course, rests with military  specialists.    Ukraine has some TU-160, TU-95, and TU-22m heavy bombers.  Whereas the practically experimental TU-160 bombers, without  spare parts and ground facilities, have a problematic value for  Ukraine as strategic weaponry (they are useless as  nuclear-capable aircraft due to their tactical and technical  parameters), the TU-95 and TU-22m bombers have undoubted value  for strategic tasks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The nuclear  TU-95 bombers deployed in Ukraine can be converted into  nonnuclear ones, which is allowed by the START I treaty,  provided their further maintenance in Ukraine. There is no  doubt about the expediency of using TU-95 bombers as heavy  nuclear- capable aircraft, strategic surveillance aircraft, or  reconnaissance aircraft. For example, heavy B-52 bombers with  conventional munitions used by the United States in Vietnam  proved highly effective.    The modern TU-22m airplanes are also renowned throughout the  world as counter antiaircraft forces, thanks to their superb  technical parameters. Moreover, they are classified as  conventional weapons.    Such powerful long-range air forces could perform important  deterrence assignments in the framework of Ukraine's military  doctrine. Additionally, their second purpose could be launching  powerful strategic and conventional attacks during regular  combat.    A considerable part of the Black Sea Fleet could also  conduct  Ukraine's strategic missions. The protection of Ukraine's  southern sea borders is part of Ukraine's strategic defense.  Submarines and vessels armed with cruise missiles and other  kinds of advanced- technology weapons can successfully perform  such duties.    According to the present military doctrine, these forces may  conduct strategic defense tasks in the place of nuclear weapons.    The Airborne Forces are equipped with all kinds of modern  aircraft, such as heavy AN-22 and IL-76 planes, as well as  medium and light AN-72, AN-26, and AN-2 airplanes, which are  equipped with special landing weapons and have adequately  trained personnel (the remains of the 98th Division could become  the core of these forces). The Airborne Forces should also be  subordinated to the strategic command of the Ukrainian Armed  Forces, since they are also performing strategic duties.    The Ukrainian Strategic Forces could also comprise certain  mechanized well-armed infantry battalions, regiments, and  brigades, which should be able to operate independently.    The main units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces should be  strong  enough, first of all, to help the Strategic Forces repel any  potential aggressor, and secondly, to prevent any possible  encroachment on Ukrainian territory. All these forces should be  mobile enough to conduct combat operations of various nature and  magnitude, and given the minimum number of personnel, to operate  throughout Ukraine.    The Supreme Council's adoption of the final version of a  realistic and comprehensive military doctrine will facilitate  the quicker development of a modern armed forces that would be  able to successfully perform complex tasks, which they are  facing at the present stage of conversion into the new world  order.</p>

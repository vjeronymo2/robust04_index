			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing 11 Apr (XINHUA)--Not long ago, this  reporter visited the responsible personnel at the Beijing  Municipal State Security Bureau, the Municipal People's  Procuratorate branch, and the Municipal Intermediate People's  Court to inquire about Xi Yang's case, the trial process, and  related conditions. These individuals indicated that Xi Yang  spied on and stole state banking and economic secrets. This was  proved by solid evidence and confessed to by Xi Yang himself.  Xi Yang's crime was very serious. However, in view of the fact  that he confessed his crime and repented, in the first trial on  28 March, the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People' Court ruled  on the case and meted out a light sentence, sentencing Xi Yang  to 12 years in prison and depriving him of political rights for  two years. Xi Yang did not accept the judgment and has filed an  appeal. The Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court has  already transferred the case to Beijing Municipal Higher  People's Court for the second trial, which is currently underway.    According to the briefings, the 38-year-old Xi Yang, a  native  of Jiangsu's Taicang County, was transferred from an Army unit  to a civilian post in May 1983. Between April 1984 and June  1992, he was a reporter with the XINTIYU [NEW SPORTS] journal  under the jurisdiction of the State Physical Culture and Sports  Commission. Later he was deputy director of the editorial  department of JIANKANG ZHIYOU [FRIEND of HEALTH] under the  aforesaid journal. In June 1992, Xi Yang left for Hong Kong  because he had inherited property from his grandfather there.  In August of the same year, he was employed as a reporter for  the China page of Hong Kong's MING PAO daily. According to Xi  Yang's confession, in view of the fact that he had worked and  lived in Beijing for many years, MING PAO specifically  designated him to constantly conduct activities in Beijing. In  June and July of 1993, Xi Yang was active in Beijing under the  pretext of covering the Sino-British talks and the founding of  the Preliminary Work Committee for the Preparatory Committee for  the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. In actual fact, he  was not a bit interested in covering the topic that was  registered on his application; rather, he focused his energy on  establishing ties, doing his utmost to pry into major state  banking and financial secrets based on the requirements of a  responsible person from MING PAO, and according a "plan"  formulated beforehand. He did not submit applications for news  coverage to the related departments according to the  regulations, but resorted to illegitimate means and incited his  friend Tian Ye, an employee of the People's Bank of China, to  steal and provide him with voluminous state banking and  financial secrets, which included an unpublished People's Bank  of China deposit and loan interest modification plan, the bank's  secret policy decision on participating in the international  gold trade, and other important secrets. Instigated by Xi Yang,  Tian Ye stole an important document marked "secret," which he  delivered to Xi Yang so he could make a photocopy. Based on the  requirements of MING PAO, Xi Yang wrote an article based on the  stolen state banking and financial secrets and delivered it to  MING PAO for publication. As a result, the compromise of these  secrets has had serious consequences for the national economy.    Reports have indicated that Xi Yang and Tian Ye acted  surreptitiously when carrying out the above-mentioned  activities. To avoid attention, they did not meet at the Jianguo  Hotel, where Xi Yang was staying, but often met on a street  corner; they did not shake hands when they met, nor did they bid  one another farewell when they parted. On 31 July, Tian Ye  arranged a meeting with Xi Yang through a pager, and at  approximately 1700 that afternoon, they met in the street east  if Beijing's Changan Mall, where Tian Ye nervously told Xi Yang  that the People's Bank of China was investigating the incident  of MING PAO's publication of state banking and economic secrets.  Xi Yang said to Tian Ye: "We are the only ones who know about  each other; there should not be any trouble." "I will not  betray my friend." "When you have things in the future, do not  use the phone, use the pager to contact me as much as possible."  Xi Yang also suggested that, when Tian Ye goes to work on  Monday, 2 August, Xi Yang would call Tian Ye through the pager,  and if Tian Ye is okay, he should call back through the beeping  pager, to say he is safe. Xi Yang also said some words to  comfort Tian Ye. Thereafter, Xi Yang used the pager and the  telephone many times to ask whether Tian Ye "had any trouble."  A relevant person from the Beijing Municipal State Security  Bureau said: Facts have indicated that Xi Yang and Tian Ye  themselves knew that what they were doing was using illegal  means to steal and spy on state banking and economic secrets,  that their behavior had violated the state criminal code.  Furthermore, Xi Yang also admitted "knowingly breaking the law"  in his repentant letter, in which he pleaded guilty." Therefore  it was never a case of "mistakenly trespassing into a restricted  zone" as alleged by Hong Kong's MING PAO and others. After the  incident took place, MING PAO repeatedly asked Xi Yang to return  to Hong Kong as soon as possible, and this indicated that MING  PAO also knew about the nature of the incident. This case is  purely a criminal case and is not related to normal news  gathering activities by reporters. Since last year, more than  1,000 Hong Kong reporters have gone to the interior to cover  news, and no problem of this kind has emerged, except with Xi  Yang. We can see that the boundary between normal interviews  conducted by reporters and illegal stealing and spying on state  secrets is very clear and understandable to Hong Kong reporters.    According to reports, the Beijing Municipal State Security  Bureau deemed that Xi Yang was suspected of jeopardizing state  security and violating the "PRC State Security Law." Therefore,  it summoned him in accordance with the law on 27 September 1993  and detained him in accordance with the law on 28 September  1993. On 7 October of the same year, with approval from Beijing  Municipal People's Sub-Procuratorate, the security bureau placed  him under arrest. Article 4 of the "State Security Law"  stipulates that "any organization or individual who carry out  behavior which jeopardizes the state security of the PRC must be  prosecuted by the law," and "stealing, spying on, purchasing,  and illegally providing secrets" are behaviors which jeopardize  state security. Tian Ye was also detained and arrested in  accordance with the law. After investigating in the case, the  Beijing Municipal State Security Bureau handed it over to  Beijing Municipal People's Sub-Procuratorate on 23 September  1993. After investigating in the case, the Beijing Municipal  People's Sub-Procuratorate instituted proceedings at the Beijing  Municipal Intermediate People's Court on 14 December 1993. The  Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court sent copies of the  prosecution letters to Xi Yang and Tian Ye, and told them that,  as the accused, they have the right to defend themselves, and  may hire defense attorneys for this purpose. Xi Yang and Tian  Ye both said they did not want to hire anyone but would defend  themselves in court. According to Article 111 of the PRC  Criminal Procedure Law, "the people's courts shall conduct the  adjudication of cases in the first instance in public. However,  cases involving state secrets or the private affairs of  individuals are not to be heard in public." The cases of Xi  Yang and Tian Ye involved state secrets, therefore, in  accordance with the law, the court did not try them in public.    During the trial process, Xi Yang pleaded guilty and  repented for his crime. In the Statement of Confession and  Repentance, he himself wrote: "The fact that I violated the law  has caused undue losses to the state's economy and has brought  undue interference to the state's current policy of  macroeconomic regulation and control. As a Chinese citizen who  lived on the mainland for many years, I committed the above  illegal offense which has caused such a loss to State interests,  and the nature of this problem is serious."    After trying the case, the court maintained on the basis of  verifying the facts that Xi Yang, in disregard of state laws and  regulations on news coverage, pried into and stole state banking  and financial secrets and published them in Hong Kong's MING  PAO, thus violating the national criminal code. According to  the Supplementary Provisions on Punishment for Those Committing  the Crime of Releasing State Secrets, "one who steals, pries  into, buys, or illegally supplies state secrets to a foreign  establishment, organization, or person is to be given, where the  case is serious, a prison term of 10 years or more, life  imprisonment, or the death penalty and will be deprived of his  political rights." A person in charge of the Beijing Municipal  Intermediate People's Court pointed out: Xi Yang's crime was  particularly serious. Considering the comparatively good  attitude of Xi Yang, who pleaded guilty and repented for his  crime, the court leniently sentenced him at the first trial to a  term of 12 years in prison and deprived him of his political  rights for two years in accordance with the law. Tian Ye also  had a comparatively good attitude and was leniently sentenced to  a term of 15 years in prison and has been deprived of his  political rights for three years. The penalty meted out to them  is appropriate. On 28 March 1994, the Beijing Municipal  Intermediate People's Court announced in public their  first-trial sentences and immediately sent the notices of  judgment to Xi Yang and Tian Ye. According to the PRC Criminal  Procedure Law, they could lodge an appeal within 10 days after  the second day of receiving the notice of judgment. Tian Ye did  not do so, while Xi Yang, who did not accept the first-trial  sentence, did lodge an appeal. The Xi Yang case has now been  passed to the Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court for a  second trial.    The person in charge of the Beijing Municipal Intermediate  People's Court stressed: The principle we follow is that we  base our cases on facts and use the law as the criteria. Xi  Yang's crime is supported by irrefutable facts. Moreover, he  pleaded guilty himself. This is something that no one can  reverse. Reporters' normal news coverage is completely  different from prying into and stealing state secrets. The law  forbids obstinately equating the criminal act of prying into and  stealing state secrets as normal news coverage. Trying to  confuse the public by saying that black is white will not work  in China or any other country.</p>

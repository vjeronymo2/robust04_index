			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Lloyd's syndicate may face more legal action MERRETT syndicate 417/418, one of the biggest syndicates at the Lloyd's of London insurance market, faces the prospect of further legal action by Names over its loss-making 1985 year. Names are individuals whose assets back underwriting at Lloyd's. They are organised into more than 280 underwriting syndicates. Merrett already faces possible action from Names who joined 417/418 in 1984 and 1985 over allegations that the syndicate's underwriters should not have closed the 1982 year of account during which loss-making US liability insurance contracts were underwritten. Names who joined the syndicate before 1984 have been excluded from the action on the grounds that they may have a conflict of interest. Now, pre-1984 Names - who number about 2,000 - have formed an action committee. Mr Lawrence Overend, its provisional chairman, has written to all 4,000 Names who were members of 417/418 in 1985 suggesting that they may have much broader grounds for legal action. Meanwhile, figures compiled on behalf of members of the Lime Street Names Association show that the agency's working Names - those who had jobs at the insurance market - were placed on fewer loss-making catastrophe syndicates than the agency's outside Names. More than 300 Lime Street Names - about two-thirds of the total - have accumulated more than seven years of losses from syndicates managed by Feltrim, Gooda Walker, Devonshire and MacMillan agencies. A group of 28 Lime Street Names faces losses from 16 years of underwriting by these syndicates. By contrast only four of the 14 working Names face losses from more than seven years of underwriting by the same syndicates. The data also show that Lime Street's overseas Names are heavily represented on loss-making syndicates. Eleven of the 28 Lime Street members who face losses from 16 years of underwriting by the catastrophe syndicates are North Americans.</p>

			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER REPORT: DARK CLOUDS HANG OVER 8% AIRLINE TICKET TAX;  </P> <P> AIRLINES: PEOPLE WHO DON'T FLY AFTER PURCHASING A TICKET SHOULD GET BACK THE 8%  DOMESTIC TAX THEY PAID, EITHER FROM THE AIRLINE OR FROM THE INTERNAL REVENUE  SERVICE.  </P> <P> If you buy a discount airline ticket with a cancellation penalty and then don't  fly, you would get a refund minus the penalty.  </P> <P> But what about the 8% domestic tax? Is it refunded in full or do you get back  the tax that is the same percentage as the cancellation penalty? Or do you lose  the tax?  </P> <P> Actually, it depends on the cancellation penalty and the airline. And industry  observers believe that there should be a full tax refund, with the cancellation  penalty only applying to the fare.  </P> <P> Despite an IRS ruling to clarify the situation, there still seems to be  industry-wide differences among the airlines on refund policies concerning this  tax.  </P> <P> An Internal Revenue Service spokesman said an airline can refund the same  percentage of the tax as used for the cancellation penalty.  </P> <P> "It's up to the airline to ask for the refund, as the code doesn't require it,"  the spokesman said. "The refund should be in proportion to the cancellation  penalty, and whatever amount isn't funded to the passenger has to be given to  the IRS."  </P> <P> For example, however, what if you purchase a nonrefundable ticket and then  don't fly.  </P> <P> "The whole amount of the tax is due the government," the IRS spokesman added.  </P> <P> The IRS made a ruling (No. 89-110) in September because of queries made by  passengers, airlines and its own representatives.  </P> <P> But not all airlines have the same policy.  </P> <P> USAir refunds the entire tax if someone cancels on a fare with a penalty, plus  the appropriate amount of the ticket.  </P> <P> "If it were a $100 fare with a 50% cancellation penalty, the passenger would  get back $58. If it were a nonrefundable fare, the entire tax would go to the  IRS, and it would be up to the passenger to file the appropriate claim for it,"  a spokesman said.  </P> <P> Delta Air Lines, however, refunds the same proportion of the tax as called for  by the cancellation penalty on the ticket. "Passengers would get back, for  example, half of the tax, if the cancellation fee was 50%. But if it's a  nonrefundable fare, we turn the entire amount over to the IRS. It doesn't pay  for us to issue checks for these amounts," a Delta spokesman said.  </P> <P> Passengers, however, can always apply to the IRS for a refund of the tax on a  nonrefundable fare, the Delta spokesman added. "The tax on fares is a user tax,  and if the passenger doesn't use the service, the tax is no longer due."  </P> <P> However, the IRS spokesman said that refund of the 8% domestic air tax would  have to come from the airlines.  </P> <P> The Delta spokesman also said that the airlines could argue the tariffs filed  by the carriers governing the contract between the airline and the passengers  have language that indicates the amount paid for the fare will include any  applicable tax. "This has been a very gray area.".  </P> <P> A Chicago law firm, Block &amp; Levy Associates, has filed separate  class-action suits going back to 1985 against United and American Airlines,  alleging that these two carriers did not make proper refunds of the 8% domestic  air tax to passengers. The firm is seeking recovery for affected passengers,  according to Alvin Block.  </P> <P> Block said his firm had also filed a class-action suit against Western Airlines  on the same issue, which was settled earlier this year by Delta, which absorbed  Western.  </P> <P> "Delta gave passengers who had not received the proper refund of the 8% tax a  choice of a cash refund or some options with frequent-flier credits," Block  said. He added that the cases with United and American are still pending.  </P> <P> "Most airlines except these three have offered the right refund of the tax in  the past," Block said. "But previously, the IRS had been silent on this issue  and some airlines simply held on to the tax money or portions of it, depending  on the specific fare, without refunding any part of it to passengers who  canceled their flights on discount fares with penalties."  </P> <P> Millions of dollars have been collected by the airlines on these cancellation  penalties since those types of fares came into usage, according to Block. "Now  the tax law has been amended so that if the airlines keep any part of this 8%  tax, they have to turn it over to the IRS. There's no more windfall or unjust  enrichment of the airlines."  </P> <P> Where does all this leave consumers? "Still fending for themselves, unless  they're protected by a class-action suit," Block said. "If you don't fly, there  should be no tax due, and consumers should be able to get back the entire  amount of the tax paid, even with nonrefundable fares."  </P> <P> Marsha Scott of Glendale Travel said: "As agents for the airlines, we follow  their policy, which is generally to refund the same percentage of the domestic  air tax as applies to the cancellation penalty on that fare.  </P> <P> "The domestic tax is quoted as part of the fare, so most passengers aren't  really that conscious of it, but a great deal of money is involved when you  consider all of the tickets written with cancellation penalties and the number  of passengers who actually cancel these flights."  </P> <P> The system permits agents to refund some of the tax amount on other fares with  cancellation penalties, said Scott, so there should be no problem doing it with  nonrefundable fares as well.  </P></p>

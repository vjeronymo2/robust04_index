			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Labour says Treasury will broaden VAT Labour yesterday put tax back at the centre of its European election campaign as party leaders warned activists not to believe opinion poll forecasts of a landslide victory. Amid growing fears of complacency among party workers, Mr Jack Straw, Labour's campaign manager, dismissed a Gallup poll putting the party 33 points ahead of the Conservatives. Mr Straw said Gallup had 'a history of being the most erratic poll'. The poll, published in the Daily Telegraph, suggested that Labour's strategy of presenting the election as a referendum on the government's record was succeeding. Labour officials were keen to play down the survey because of fears that it might encourage Labour voters to stay at home or cast a tactical vote for the Liberal Democrats. In a clear attempt to refocus the campaign on domestic issues, after a week dominated by exchanges on the future of the national veto, Labour accused the Tories of preparing to extend value added tax to zero-rated goods. The accusation followed BBC radio interviews in which Mr John Major and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, refused to rule out imposing VAT on food, public transport, children's clothes, newspapers, books and periodicals. Mr Clarke said such issues were a matter for the November Budget. Mr Major said the government had 'no plans' to extend VAT, but 'these are matters the chancellor has to consider'. Mr Brown told an election press conference: 'Having made absolute, unconditional and personal promises at (previous) elections, Mr Major and Mr Clarke are now attempting to change ground and run away from yet another promise betrayed. 'We will not allow the Conservative party to escape their election promises. They must tell us now whether they repeat their pledges not to extend VAT, or whether they have abandoned them.' Mr Brown said Labour 'stands by and repeats its pledge not to extend VAT to food, children's clothes, public transport or to books and newspapers'. Mr Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat trade and industry spokesman, said it was 'very unwise' for Mr Brown to suggest that Labour would never extend VAT. He said: 'It is the sort of word politicians sometimes find comes home to haunt them. We are certainly not proposing to extend VAT. We don't have any great enthusiasm for extending the base. But it would be dishonest to say it will never happen.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] 'Ali Salim al-Bid, Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]  secretary general, said that it was Sanaa that started the war  in Yemen and that the war was forcibly imposed on the south.    In an interview he gave to AL-QABAS newspaper reporter  'Abd-al-Salam al-'Awadi in Mukalla, which was published today,  Al-Bid said that the southerners entered the union willingly  with sound convictions and dealt with it in the same sound  spirit and with democratic means.    'Ali Salim al-Bid said that integration did not take place  between the two parts of Yemen due to the existence of two types  of upbringing, two types of thought, two types of mentality and  two different methods. He said that the southerners wanted  democratic pluralism in a way that conformed with the spirit of  the age in the shadow of security, stability, and unity.    The YSP secretary general affirmed that southerners were  treated as third- or fourth-class citizens in the union. He  said that we have discovered from the way Sanaa treated us that  we were two peoples, not one.    'Ali Salim al-Bid stressed that the war that was taking  place  in Yemen affected the security and stability of the Gulf region  and the interests of its peoples. He called on the Arab  countries to work in the Yemeni people's interests, emphasizing  that the continuation of the civil war in Yemen was not in the  interests of the region as a whole.    'Ali Salim al-Bid said the announcement of the cessation of  the south from the north has come for the benefit of Yemen, to  prevent it from being divided into mini-states if the war, in  which there would be no victor or vanquished, continues.</p>

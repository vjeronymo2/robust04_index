			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Xtra-Vision declines 29% to IPounds 504,000 Xtra-Vision, the Dublin-based video rental company that is quoted on the USM, reported a 29 per cent fall, from IPounds 708,000 to IPounds 504,000 (Pounds 525,000), for the six months to August 2. The result was struck on static turnover of IPounds 10.8m and after a lower interest charge of IPounds 800,000 (IPounds 886,000). Earnings per share came out at 0.33p (0.47p). Mr Colm Menton, chairman, said the second half had got off to a good start, particularly in Ireland, although the current economic climate necessitated a cautious approach when making any forecasts about the full-year outcome.</p>

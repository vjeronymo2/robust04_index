			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PHILIPPINE PRISON STANDOFF ENDS; 5 HOSTAGES DIE  </P> <P> Troops rushed a Philippine prison Tuesday and shot to death 16 convicts who had  been holding members of a religious group hostage for three days. Five  hostages, including a 9-year-old boy, were killed.  </P> <P> Officials decided to storm the prison after some of the 15 hostages escaped and  told them the would-be escapees had killed other captives.  </P> <P> "We were not . . . dealing with reasonable people," said Justice Undersecretary  Silvestre Bello, who was involved in negotiations with the captors. "We had to  authorize a military operation, especially since there was an urgent need to  save the five living hostages."  </P> <P> The attack began about 3 p.m. Troops rushed forward firing automatic weapons  and secured the downtown jail in Davao, 610 miles southeast of Manila, after  about 40 minutes, witnesses and officials said. Officials said no hostages were  killed in the military assault.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hostages as Shields  </P> <P> A few hours earlier, the convicts had tried to escape by using hostages as  shields. During the confusion, a captive was killed, and five others fled. They  told police four other hostages had been slain. The dead, besides the  9-year-old boy, included a 16-year-old female hostage and Australian missionary  Jacqueline Hamill, 36, who had been in Davao a month.  </P> <P> All of the hostages were members of the Joyful Assemblies of God, a Protestant  group.  </P> <P> The standoff began Sunday at the Metropolitan District Command Center in Davao.  Bello said inmates overpowered a guard during a Bible session at the prison and  then looted weapons from an armory.  </P> <P> Police said most of the inmates had escaped in April from the Davao Penal  Colony and seized several hostages to protest conditions at the prison.  </P> <P> The leader of the convicts was identified as Mohammed Naser Samparani, a former  air force soldier convicted of murder.  </P></p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Inflation news drives FT-SE Index to new peak - Market Report International considerations were put aside on the London stock market yesterday, and the FT-SE 100 Index closed at a new peak on hopes that, following good news on domestic inflation, UK interest rates can be reduced sooner than expected. Pre-expiry activity in stock index futures continued to inspire Footsie-listed stocks, and dollar firmness supported the multinationals. The UK stock market gathered pace towards the close, ending the session with a gain of 30.4 on the FT-SE 100 for a final reading of 3,278.8. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, also at an all-time high, finished at 3,631.5, up 17.2. The market opened cautiously as Wall Street's overnight weakness was mirrored by further losses on European bourses, with the political developments in Russia taking the blame. However, good premiums on both December and March futures contracts soon inspired careful buying of equities in London. But the announcement that underlying inflation in the UK had dipped from 2.8 per cent to 2.5 per cent, better than predicted by the market, put muscle into the rise in equity prices. The welcome confirmation that domestic inflation remained subdued raised hopes that UK interest rates may yet be cut before the end of the year. The good news on domestic inflation took the London market's attention away from today's policy meeting at the Bundesbank. At the same time, general economic optimism was boosted by a further rise in retail sales last month. Gains were extended across the range of the market, with the surprising exception of store shares, which remained overshadowed by suggestions that Christmas trading may disappoint the best expectations. A further advance was signalled when the March futures contract on the Footsie moved above 3,300, indicating market confidence that domestic interest rates will be lower by the end of the first quarter of 1994. Several analysts have predicted that rates will fall to 4 per cent. A strong performance from the dollar stocks was highlighted by BP following a confident meeting with analysts in London yesterday. Pharmaceuticals were also in demand, and there was renewed buying of the bank shares which have heavily outperformed the stock market over the past month. Among the day's newcomers, Mercury World Mining Investment Trust, the biggest trust launch on record, ended at a discount of a few pence to the 100p issue price after turnover of 12m shares. Seaq volume increased to 752.7m shares yesterday from Tuesday's 705.5m, but traders stressed that futures-related trading had played an important part; genuine investment business was good, but not outstanding, according to dealers at a leading international brokerage house. Non-Footsie activity dipped to around 60 per cent of the total, indicating the significance of futures-related business as the big securities traders sought to unwind positions in futures. On Tuesday, retail business returned a value total of Pounds 1.47bn, again an excellent figure by comparison with this year's daily averages and also for a pre-Christmas trading period. Equities ended the day on a very confident note, although traders were prepared for further turbulence today from the futures markets as December positions are rolled forward into March.</p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Ford set to lose leading share of new-car market FORD is expected to have been ousted as leader in the UK market for new cars by Vauxhall this month - the first time it has failed to lead the market on a monthly basis since the mid 1970s. Meanwhile, UK sales of new cars have fallen sharply in February, partly because buyers have delayed purchases in the hope of a cut in car tax in the Budget on March 10. Ford said yesterday that it had orders for 6,300 vehicles on hold until after the Budget. It claimed that the retail market for private buyers had 'died' during the final days of February. Both Ford and Vauxhall forecast that official figures to be released next week would show sales of new cars for the month down to about 105,000 - a 15 per cent drop from the 124,342 in February last year and a 44.7 per cent decline from record sales of 189,850 in February 1989. In the face of one of the steepest declines in car sales in the post-war period, the motor industry has been campaigning fiercely for the government to cut or remove the 10 per cent special car tax. This tax is levied in addition to the 17.5 per cent value added tax and is responsible for pushing UK car taxation well above rates in Continental markets such as Germany and France. Ford said yesterday that orders for as many as 20,000 vehicles could be on hold in the whole motor industry pending the outcome of the Budget. It expected sales to strengthen in the second half of next month. The level of demand declined this month, with year-on-year sales 9 per cent lower after 10 days, 12 per cent lower after 20 days and an expected decline of 15 per cent for the full month. Ford has held the leadership of the UK market for new cars on an annual basis since 1977, when it ousted British Leyland (now Rover). With four selling days uncounted, Vauxhall had captured 20.5 per cent of sales, with Ford slipping back to second place on 17 per cent and Rover on 16 per cent. Ford is expected to hold its leadership with January and February sales combined. Ford insisted yesterday that it had not taken measures to boost its market share artificially in the final days of the month.</p>

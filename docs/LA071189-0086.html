			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRANSPAC CREWS AWAITING ADJUSTED RESULTS  </P> <P> With the leaders arriving in the 2,225-mile Los Angeles-to-Honolulu Transpac  yacht race, crews are awaiting adjusted results with handicap times taken into  consideration.  </P> <P> Although Silver Bullet was first to finish in the Class A fleet, her handicap  lead was short-lived as Taxi Dancer, third to finish, saved time allowance and  took over first in Class A and in fleet.  </P> <P> As of the 8 a.m. Monday roll call, the Class C yacht Medicine Man, still 334  miles from the finish at Diamond Head, has a chance to beat Taxi Dancer for the  overall corrected time victory. The results depend largely on the wind.  </P> <P> By late Monday, only 24 of the 46 starters had finished; final results may not  be known before Wednesday. ALMON LOCKABEY  </P></p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Stock exchange debates successor to USM The London Stock Exchange board will today consider a proposal to create a separately managed exchange with its own chief executive to handle trading in the shares of smaller companies. This 'Enterprise Market' would operate under the aegis of the main stock exchange, which would retain control over certain of its activities. The proposal, contained in a report from the stock exchange's smaller companies working party, says that separate management is needed to distinguish the companies with shares trading on the new exchange. The only alternative would be to give the new exchange lower regulatory requirements. The report will say that unless the new market has either separate management or lighter regulation it will never be able to distinguish itself from the main exchange and thus will have little reason for its creation. The board could either approve the report in its entirety or reject some of the recommendations. It will be released as a consultation document. The question of governance is believed to be the most controversial aspect of the proposed new market, intended as a successor to the Unlisted Securities Market, which closed earlier this year. Venture capitalists and others involved in the promotion of small companies believe a less regulated market would never gain public confidence. Indeed, they have proposed that the new market require more frequent trading statements than the main exchange. However, the stock exchange is said to be uneasy about ceding too much authority to a separate body. Also, in the light of recent amendments to stock exchange rules, making it easier for small or new companies to have their shares traded on the Official List, the exchange is said to have been sceptical about whether there was sufficient justification for the new market. The report was delayed by the illness of the committee's former chairman, Mr Ian MacPherson, chairman of Low and Bonar. There were also internal divisions, particularly between industry members and stock exchange representatives. The report urges the creation of the Enterprise Market as a distinct market under the aegis of the stock exchange. It is understood requirements would differ little from those of the USM. The new entity would embark on a marketing campaign to attract high growth companies.</p>

			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: KLM in staff pension fund deal KLM Royal Dutch Airlines has issued Fl 155.6m (Dollars 80m) worth of non-tradeable participation certificates to one of its staff pension funds, as part of a wider cost-saving deal agreed with its staff last year. The KLM Flight Personnel Pension Fund yesterday agreed to buy 4.75m profit participation certificates for a price of Fl 32.78 each, helping to bolster the airline's balance sheet. The price per certificate is roughly equivalent to the level at which KLM's ordinary shares were trading when the deal with employees was struck in July. KLM's shares have since risen to around Fl 46.00, in spite of the collapse of merger talks with Swissair, Scandinavian Airlines System and Austrian Airlines. The certificates give the pension fund the right to share in KLM's profit but they do not carry voting rights nor can they be traded. KLM is planning to make a rights issue later this year. The government has already pledged its support.</p>

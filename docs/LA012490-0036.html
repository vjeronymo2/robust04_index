			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BLUE ANGELS CLIP WINGS; 1 PILOT FORCED TO EJECT  </P> <P> Two of the Navy's Blue Angel jets collided over Superstition Mountain in El  Centro during a practice exercise, causing one pilot to eject before his plane  crashed, authorities said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Marine Capt. Chase Moseley safely ejected from his F/A-18 Hornet after he and  another pilot clipped wings while flying in a diamond formation, said Petty  Officer Kathleen Pettaway, a spokeswoman for the Blue Angels.  </P> <P> The other pilot, Cmdr. Pat Moneymaker, safely landed after the accident, which  occurred at 12:35 p.m. Tuesday. The other two Blue Angel pilots also returned  to the Naval Air Facility in El Centro, their winter training home.  </P> <P> In the diamond formation, a trademark of the Blue Angels, one pilot leads, two  fly side by side, and the fourth follows. During air shows, pilots sometimes  fly the diamond formation with their wings overlapping.  </P> <P> During Tuesday's mishap, Moneymaker flew in the lead position and Moseley flew  on the right-hand side of the diamond.  </P> <P> "The two planes touched or bumped, and one pilot determined that it was not  safe to stay with the aircraft," said Senior Chief Petty Officer Bob Howard, a  spokesman for the Pacific Fleet's Naval Air Force. "The other fellow decided  that it was safe to stay with the aircraft."  </P> <P> Officials said they did not know the extent of the damage to Moneymaker's  plane. Moseley's plane, which cost about $30 million, was destroyed.  </P> <P> After parachuting, Moseley was taken to El Centro Regional Medical Center,  where he was treated for minor injuries, nursing supervisor Kirby Viestenz  said.  </P> <P> The cause of the collision is under investigation, Pettaway said.  </P> <P> The Blue Angels are a precision drill team known for daredevil routines that  they have performed since the group's inception in 1946. The last Blue Angels  accident occurred in February, 1987, when a pilot had to eject after an  accident during training, Pettaway said.  </P> <P> The Blue Angels, also called the Naval Flight Demonstration Team, go through  about six months of rigorous practice before beginning their nationwide  performance season in May, Howard said. The pilots fly twice a day, six days a  week, beginning each morning at 6 and ending in early afternoon. Briefings and  a physical fitness program take up the rest of the day.  </P> <P> The Blue Angels' maneuvers are not special acrobatic tricks but "standard  procedures flown by all Navy fighter pilots; it's just that the Blues do them  in formation," Howard said.  </P> <P> Each year, hundreds of Navy pilots apply for the two or three openings that  usually occur on the seven-member team. Those selected have flown thousands of  hours and are considered the cream of Navy pilots.  </P></p>

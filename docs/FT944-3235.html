			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Halma extends growth record Halma, the sensor and detector manufacturer, extended its remarkable growth record with a 24 per cent increase in first half profits to Pounds 12.5m before tax, against Pounds 10m. The interim dividend of 1.12p (0.933p) is up 20 per cent, a rate of increase the group has maintained since 1979. Earnings per share rose 22 per cent to 4.2p. Mr David Barber, chairman, said the group had benefited from strong markets in America and Asia and had seen indications of some recovery in certain of its European markets. But the UK had shown little sign of growth. 'The UK was relatively flat and it feels pretty much the same in the second half.' Turnover rose by 14 per cent to Pounds 70.6m thanks largely to strong overseas sales which rose to 58 per cent of the total. Halma's direct exports, which have grown strongly over the past two years, rose 22 per cent to Pounds 22m. Mr Barber said that its Apollo fire detector subsidiary had seen US sales treble in the first six months. Trading margins swelled from 16.4 per cent to 17.7 per cent despite what Mr Barber identified as a changing attitude towards price increases. 'Even in a group like ours, selling highly specialised products, there is a feeling that you should not be passing on cost increases to customers.' In the UK profits rose 15 per cent to Pounds 8.73m on sales up only 5 per cent to Pounds 29.7m. US profits rose 30 per cent to Pounds 2.59m while the rest of the world doubled to Pounds 1.01m. Out of its main continental markets Mr Barber said France had been very good but the Netherlands was relatively flat. Profits were boosted by a full contribution from acquisitions made last year. Mr Sandy Morris, engineering analyst at NatWest Markets, estimated that these accounted for about half the growth in sales and profits. The company spent Pounds 4.8m on acquisitions and capital projects in the first half but ended with record net cash of Pounds 12.7m. NatWest is forecasting full-year profits of Pounds 29.5m which puts the shares at 220p, up 1p yesterday, on a forward multiple of 22 times earnings.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [All quotation marks as published] </F>   [Text] Bombay, March 2. BBC radio will broadcast a half  hour current affairs programme on South Asia every day from  April 4. This was announced on Tuesday in Bombay by Mr.  Alexander Thomson, the editor of the South Asia Report, which at  present has a duration of 15 minutes.    "The expansion of South Asia Report at this time shows the  commitment of the BBC to coverage of a region of immense  political, economic and strategic importance," he said. Mr.  Thomson and BBC's India correspondent, Mr. Mark Tully were in  Bombay to honour Mr. Jonas Kurkalang from Dadar, Bombay, one of  four prize winners of the `Can you hear me' competition  conducted last year by the South Asia Report. Amongst the other  prize-winners are two from Madras and one from Nepal.    New office in Delhi: Mr. Tully pointed that the  very fact that the BBC was increasing its coverage of South Asia  emphasised the point that the organisation continued to be  deeply committed to radio journalism. `Radio is not going under  and will not despite television', he said. He announced that the  BBC was opening a new and modern office in Delhi which would be  equipped to produce many of the programmes on the Hindi service  which had earlier been produced in London.    Mr. Tully also emphasised that it was the success of BBC  World Service television in India that had sparked the interest  of so many others in the region. `The BBC is determined to  remain one of the main players regardless of how much  competition there is', he said. He also pointed out that  although Star TV had been taken over by the Australian media  baron, Mr. Rupert Murdoch, BBC had a contract with Star TV and  "there is no sign that it will be broken even though it has an  early get out clause."    Reorganisation: Discussing the future plans of the  BBC, Mr. Thomson said that `Bush House is going through  fundamental reforms, almost a revolution in its history'. He was  referring to the process of reorganisation taking place whereby  the BBC planned to divide its coverage of the world into six  regions. The eastern region would essentially be restricted to  South Asia unlike in the past when it encompassed Iran and  Afghanistan in the west and Myanmar in the east.    As part of the expansion of its coverage of the region, the  BBC would be setting up an FM transmitter in Dhaka, Bangladesh  and a studio in Islamabad, Mr. Thomson said. This was the only  region where the BBC was expanding at a time when it was cutting  back in many other parts of the world.    Mr. Thomson also announced that in response to feedback from  listeners, the BBC would broadcast in South Asia on a new  frequency of 7160 in addition to the present 15310 on which it  was being broadcast. The expanded South Asia Report would begin  with a nine minute world news bulletin at 0700 hrs IST [Indian  Standard Time] followed by the current affairs programme.</p>

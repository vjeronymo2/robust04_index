			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Brilliant display revives desktops THE INCREASING popularity of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and graphics-orientated personal computer applications is driving the trend towards larger PC monitors and higher resolutions. Philips' Brilliance 2110 high resolution 21-inch monitor enables desktop systems to offer display performance usually only available on expensive graphic workstations. The new monitor is capable of displaying resolutions of up to 1600 x 1280 pixels on a double A4 size screen and exceeds the Swedish MPR-II standard for low emission levels. Fourteen preset video modes can be selected using a 16-character LCD display at the front of the monitor which has a top refresh rate of 76Hz in 1280 x 1024 mode to ensure a stable flicker-free display. The monitor costs Pounds 2,999. Philips: Netherlands,20 733 684;UK 081 689 4444.</p>

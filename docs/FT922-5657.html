			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / International Company News: Janome Sewing Machine falls in the red after tax JANOME Sewing Machine, the Japanese company entangled in the collapse of a stock speculator group, reported an after-tax loss of Y24.3bn (Dollars 186.9m) following the liquidation of two affiliates and the restructuring of its debts. Strong overseas demand for sewing machines pushed sales for the year 3.4 per cent higher to Y81.6bn, but pre-tax profit fell 39.3 per cent to Y1.14bn. Sales for the current year are expected to remain at around Y82bn, with pre-tax profit forecast to fall to Y500m. The Janome group is still negotiating with creditors over the fate of Y235.5bn in debt inherited through its dealings with Koshin, the stock speculator group, and Nanatomi, a property developer, both of which have collapsed in the past two years. Janome, the second largest Japanese sewing machine maker, has received several managers from Kyowa Saitama Bank, which has been negotiating with the manufacturer's other creditors in an attempt to buy time on the repayment of outstanding debt. Janome is expected to sell some of its extensive land holdings, though it is keen to delay the sales until a recovery in the weak property market.</p>

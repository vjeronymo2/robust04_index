			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / UK Company News: British Coal picks contenders to buy its smokeless fuel BRITISH Coal is discussing the sale of its smokeless fuel businesses, Coal Products, with two rival management buy-out groups and Anglo-United, owner of Coalite smokeless fuel. BC yesterday said that while it would consider offers from all parties, it had narrowed down the main contenders to those three. Coal Products made an operating profit of Pounds 2m for the year ended March 28. Last year it had debt of Pounds 50m; it has not yet filed its separate accounts for this year. However, the business is seen as having good potential to generate cash given BC's recent decision to close the loss-making Avenue Coke and Chemical plant near Chesterfield, which produces Sunbright fuel for the domestic closed fire market. The two rival MBOs are led by Mr Steve O'Donoghue, the former finance director, and Mr David Foster, the operations director. While Mr O'Donoghue appears to have the backing of the majority of Coal Products managers, the emergence of two rival MBOs could put the British Association of Colliery Management in a difficult position. It has been promised funds to help draw up an employee buy out bid. BC said it would back the bid which offered the 'best value' for its business. At the moment it was inclined to sell Coal Products piecemeal. While the struggle between two rival MBOs is believed to favour an outside buyer, Anglo's negative net asset value and debts of more than Pounds 200m has led some BC directors to question whether the company could afford to buy Coal Products. Anglo remains confident of putting together an attractive financial package. If it acquired Coal Products it would be expected to close some of the plants. Anglo currently produces about 400,000 tonnes of smokeless fuel for the open fire market. That is only about 50 per cent of its total capacity because it believes there is already too much capacity in the market.</p>

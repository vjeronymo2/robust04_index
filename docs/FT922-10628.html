			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: Hershey to take stake in Norway confectioner HERSHEY Foods, one of America's biggest chocolate producers, is to acquire an 18.6 per cent stake in Freia Marabou, the leading Scandinavian confectionery group, for NKr1.16bn (Dollars 179.56m). The holding is being bought from Orkla, the diversified Norwegian group. The deal represents a significant expansion of the US group's European operations which at present comprise a chocolate manufacturing operation in Germany. Orkla was forced to dispose of the interest by an ownership regulation in Norway following its merger last year with Nora Industrier. In last year's annual report, Orkla valued the Freia Marabou shareholding at NKr685m. The deal is expected to be completed by May. Orkla's 'A' shares closed NKr4 up to NKr181 on the news, while Freia Marabou's 'B' shares jumped NKr12.50 to close at NKr290. Hershey Foods is no stranger to Freia Marabou, having co-operated with the company for more than a decade. Hershey previously held a 17 per cent shareholding in Marabou, and occupied a seat on its board, before it merged with Freia two years ago. In 1990 Hershey sold the Marabou stake to Orkla for Dollars 78m. 'The purchase of these shares will represent both a financial and strategic investment for Hershey Foods. While we are confident that the purchase of this interest will in itself be a good investment, we are hopeful that we can build on it over time,' said Mr Richard A. Zimmerman, Hershey chairman. Last year Freia Marabou boosted profit, before extraordinary items, by 16 per cent to NKr512m. Hershey lifted 1991 net income to Dollars 219.52m from Dollars 215.88m. It said its 1991 activities represented a significant step toward its goal of increasing worldwide confectionery market share.</p>

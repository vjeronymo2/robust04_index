			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Hayri Birler: "He Who Sows the Seeds..."] </F>   [Text] As the impact of the Welfare Party (RP) victory in  the local elections shake the country, Sunday's protest rallies  that turned into violent shows of strength for anti-secularist  views, served as an eye opener for the country's leaders,  showing them the strong presence of fundamentalist forces.    Even Tansu Ciller, who conducted an election campaign based  partly on God, the Koran and prayer, has forgotten what she said  in her campaign and has lately declared: "These rallies are  against the regime. I demand a detailed survey of all  anti-secularist activities."    Of course, pro-Islamic factions have not reached such a  point  that they actually threaten the regime in Turkey--a country that  is 99 percent Muslims and, at the same time, has adopted  secularism as one of its main principles. These factions simply  wanted to demonstrate their strength by driving people out into  the streets.    I must stress that those who helped pro-Islamic forces gain  strength are--whatever their intentions and whenever they came  to power--those who have ruled the country during the last 14  years, namely: the military coup leadership of Kenan Evren; and  the Motherland Party's (ANAP) Turgut Ozal.    Before the Sept. 12, 1980 military coup, Turkey experienced  a  period of coalition governments which included the participation  of the National Salvation Party (MSP), the precursor of the RP.  Necmettin Erbakan, leader of the RP, became deputy prime  minister on three occasions in various coalition governments and  assisted in forming the coalition protocols, sometimes even by  issuing threats.    But, at that time, none of those protocols included promises  to make religious classes compulsory in the schools. It may  come as a surprise, but it is nonetheless true: It was the  Turkish military, known as the guardian of secularism, that  placed religion as a compulsory component of education in  primary schools, secondary schools, and gymnasiums. And this  was done, not through an amendment of any law, but as a  necessary part of the constitution!    Coup leader and President Kenan Evren, while ordering the  arrest of MSP leaders, was keen on telling the crowds on various  occasions that his father was a member of the clergy. He  stressed repeatedly how important religion was.    While explaining the implementation of new laws, he often  cited verses in the Koran for confirmation.    In order to play down the divisions in the country of the  "left" and of the "right," Evren emphasized the unifying force  of religion. This was done especially in the southeastern  provinces where flyers covered with versus from the Koran were  tossed out of airplanes.    Whatever its aims were, the military leadership of that  period was actually sowing the first seeds of pro-Islamic  enthusiasm that seems to have swept the country today.    ANAP (Motherland Party), which followed the military  government, gathered a variety of parties under its wing,  including the pro-Islamic forces, and proceeded to appoint  especially "conservative" people as ministers of education and  internal affairs.    One of Turgut Ozal's first actions as president was to  attend  Friday prayer in his official vehicle.    Those who defended the idea of a "Second Republic," with the  support of Ozal, demanded that secularist paragraphs be taken  out of the Constitution.    In a period when fundamentalists demonstrated against the  principles of the republic, defenders of a "Second Republic"  presented secularism as "the model of the 1930's" and criticized  it.    Not long ago, during the funeral of Ozal, a mob threw stones  at the military band shouting, "We do not want Christian  marches!" and rallied in the streets chanting religious slogans.  This was tolerated by the leaders of the country.    Concerning the level of pro-Islamic staff at the Ministries  of Interior and Education, the General Police Directorate's  Intelligence Unit reported the following in a secret report: "An  illegal body with the aim of incorporating fundamentalism into  society was formed at the Directorate. This body is especially  active in the units concerned with police education."    There were also demands expressed that Friday replace Sunday  as the state's official holiday and that shifts be organized so  that civil servants can attend Friday prayers.    Remarkably, many of those who graduated from theological  gymnasiums applied to university faculties that provide  personnel for the public sector.    About one-fourth of the students at Ankara University's  school of political science, which provides cities and towns  with governors, were originally from theological gymnasiums. A  week ago banners celebrating "police week," calling police the  "guardians of the state," did not include the words "secular  state."    Mehmet Agar, appointed by the government as head of police,  said, "I do not see any point in bringing up the subject of  secularism. This can lead to divisions in the society." And the  police, under the leadership of Agar, did nothing to interfere  with demonstrators who, last Sunday, waved pro-Islamic flags and  attacked public buildings and foreign missions. That was the  same police department that sat and watched as 37 people burned  alive in Sivas, doing nothing to stop the violence.    Pro-Islamic forces are denying the principle of national  sovereignty by claiming that "sovereignty belongs only to God."  They are also denying the principles of a secularist democracy  by saying that "the Constitution is the Holy Koran." These  forces gained strength in the period covering the last 14 years,  as described above. The seeds were sown and now they have begun  to bear fruit.    As long as the liberal and social democratic movements lack  the ability to devise solutions to national problems and as long  as the traditional right and left face political bankruptcy, it  is obvious that pro-Islamic forces will continue to gain  momentum.    What the leaders of the country need to do is make a  realistic assessment of the anti-secularist movements, save the  state sector from the increasing threat of fundamentalist  tendencies and produce political solutions as well.    Otherwise, Turkey will inevitably resemble Algiers in the  not-too-distant future.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rustam Arifdhzanov: "Threat to Black-Out </F> Television on 10 February is Signal for Strikes Throughout  Russia"]    [Text] The mass strikes that had been expected in March,  with actions by workers employed in the oil and gas, coal, and  part of the timber industry forming the traditional vanguard,  could begin as early as 10 February.    But the communications workers are the first to go on the  warpath against the reformed government. Feeling that in the  absence of Gaydar and Fedorov you can get money out of the  present government, at any rate having seen that the agrarian  lobby, led by Aleksandr Zaveryukha is succeeding in doing so,  the communications workers, who do not have such powerful  support in high places, have decided on an unexpected, but  pretty massive attack.    On 10 February we will not see any programs, aside from  morning and evening news bulletins, on the "Ostankino" and  Russian state television companies' channels.    The decision was made by the communications workers' trade  union central committee. In all other respects the latest  all-Russian strike is no different from previous strikes by  workers in other sectors. They are putting forward economic  demands, above all the payment of debts. The state television  and radio companies, and, therefore, the state, owed the  communications workers around 70 billion rubles [R] at the end  of last year. Not that much compared with the debts to other  sectors. At the end of last year the government directed the  Finance Ministry to pay the debt. This was not done, so the  debt continued to mount in January.    The doubling of electricity tariffs and the increase in  other  costs have already forced radio communications lines to shut  down in a number of cities in the country. The strikers intend  to continue the blackout until the debt is paid in full.  Television, which was the pawn of the old system, whereby the  viewer paid for its work by buying a television set, and then  part of the money added to the value of the television set was  redistributed at the top, now has to depend on government  charity. A government that recently slashed the Russian radio  and television company's budget by exactly 50 percent can hardly  be described as particularly charitable. What is, in the  circumstances, a reasonable decision to introduce television by  subscription nonetheless could have serious social consequences.    The former leaders of the strike movement are hard on the  heels of the striking communications workers. Although the  strike by oilworkers at "Yuganskneftegaz," one of the country's  biggest associations, planned for the same day, 10 February, has  been postponed, the association's working people have not  dropped their demands for the payment of debts. And we are  talking here about R500 billion. They are demanding a revision  of the system for the taxation of fuel and energy complex  enterprises and are proposing that Viktor Chernomyrdin  immediately hold an all-Russian conference of leaders of oil and  gas enterprises, trade unions, and strike committees. At the  same time, L. Mironov, chairman of the Russian oil and gas  enterprise construction workers' trade union, appealed to the  country's president. His open letter says that "the  behind-the-scenes games of politicians in the government...are  provoking mass actions by working people and the suspension of  oil and gas production in the winter, which is bound to have the  most disastrous consequences..."    Another trade union leader -- V. Ochekurov, chairman of the  timber industry workers' trade union central committee --  appealed to the leaders of parliament. The timber workers  warned that "there is a danger that timber processing  enterprises will close down." The reasons are the same. No pay  for five months.    Finally, we have the miners. The leaders of the Kuzbass  workers' movement have just stated at a Moscow press conference  that a major strike will begin on 1 March unless the government  presents by then a program to resolve the economic crisis.    Blank television screens could certainly spark off new  strikes this very winter.</p>

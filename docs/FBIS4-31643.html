			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 14 Jun (PAP)--In Warsaw today, National  Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk and Wieslaw Walendziak,  chairman of Polish Television SA [joint-stock company], signed  an agreement on cooperation in the production and broadcasting  of television programs on defense and military issues. Military  programs are to become more attractive.    Kolodziejczyk told journalists that the agreement will  enable  the presentation of issues related to the Army "in a flexible  way and in response to need, and not according to a rigid  schedule." He added: "I think that a battle for television  slots is a misunderstanding."    Walendziak explained that military programs will be produced  with "technological contribution from the Army". He said: "I am  pleased about the agreement because there has been a lot of  discussion recently about whether television is willing to  cooperate with state institutions. Of course, it is willing,  provided these institutions clearly express their expectations.  The Ministry of National Defense is the first ministry to say  very clearly what hopes it attaches to cooperation with  television, and which has not tried to do this in a dictatorial  manner," he said.</p>

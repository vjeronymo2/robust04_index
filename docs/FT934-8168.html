			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Sky TV opens broadside to sink decoder pirates SKY TELEVISION is believed to have adopted anti-piracy measures early yesterday in an attempt to disable unauthorised decoder cards. The satellite broadcaster altered the stream of data from its satellite system to its subscribers in trying to prevent the use of pirate cards. Yesterday Mr Chris McKenzie, general manager at Sky, said he had no comment. Last month Sky, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake, made it clear that it intended to take every legal and technical action it could against the pirates. Mr David Lyons, whose company Satellite Decoding Systems imported illicit decoder cards from the Republic of Ireland to the UK, said that his cards had not been affected by Sky's latest action. Mr Lyons has given legal undertakings that he will neither advertise nor sell pirate cards in the UK. He has returned to Ireland where he concentrates on selling Sky cards to continental Europe. Mr Lyons said yesterday that he was offering, or was about to offer, pirate cards for French satellite service Canal Plus, Belgian channel FilmNet and Scandinavian channels TV3 and TV1000. Recently the Scandinavian channels have taken action against Mr Chris Cary and Hi-Tech Innovation of Camberley who had been supplying pirate cards. TV3 obtained an injunction against Mr Cary and notified the police.</p>

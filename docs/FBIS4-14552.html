			<p>BFN     [Text] INTERFAX has received the draft agreement on civil  accord submitted today to the Federal Assembly chambers'  Chairmen Ivan Rybkin and Vladimir Shumeyko by Russian President  Boris Yeltsin.    The eight-page draft document consists of six sections. In  part, the draft document obliges the parties to the agreement to  refrain from introducing constitutional amendments harmful to  the situation in society. The parties also commit themselves  not to initiate any political campaigns in favor of early  elections to federal bodies not mentioned in the Constitution.    The participants in the agreement undertake to refrain from  using violence to settle any kind of problem. Initiators of  rallies, manifestations and strikes should assume responsibility  for the peaceful character of such actions. The parties call  not to use interpretations of the events of August 1991 and  September-October 1993 as a pretext for further confrontation.    The draft document requires the federation's constituent  members to refuse to change their constitutional status within  the next two years.    A permanent Economic Conference is to be established in  order  to coordinate proposals in the sphere of economic policies for  the period in which the agreement is valid. In accordance with  the draft, representatives of the president, the government, the  Russian Central Bank, the Federation Council, the State Duma,  major trade unions of workers, commodity producers and  entrepreneurs will participate in the agreement.    In accordance with the document, political parties and  movements and public organizations must under no circumstances  establish any armed formations. Any attempts to utilize the  state power structures for support of political programs and  demands are to be considered as illegal and immoral.    The parties believe that a permanent Conference on Security  could become an efficient instrument for working out coordinated  proposals in the sphere of security. The State Duma and the  Federation Council leaders will be included in the Russian  Security Council in order to shape coordinated state policies.    A conciliation commission composed of representatives of the  president, the government, the Federal Assembly chambers, the  State Duma factions and well known public activists and artists  is to be set up in order to work out a mechanism for  implementation of the agreement.    If the agreement is violated, the Conciliation Commission  will:    -- Make a statement in the media;    -- Raise the issue of the exclusion of such a participant  from the list of signatories;    -- Make proposals on political accountability of those  responsible for violation of the agreement going as far as their  dismissal.    In accordance with the draft, the agreement is to be  concluded for a two-year term and can be extended with the  consent of the signatories.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Money Markets: Rates close easier DWINDLING expectations of an imminent UK base rate cut were briefly rekindled first thing yesterday as the Bank of Spain lowered its intervention rate by 25 basis points to 12.40 per cent. There was a momentary thought that this might be part of a co-ordinated plan to allow a simultaneous UK base rate cut, and in 15 minutes of lively activity the three months interbank rate shed  1/16 to 10 1/4 -10 3/16 per cent. Short sterling futures jumped 9 basis points to 89.90, from an opening of 89.81 and a previous close of 89.80. 'The market was split 50/50 on whether there would be a cut', said one dealer. The Bank of England forecast a shortfall of about Pounds 850m, and invited an early round of bill offers. Dealers were reluctant to tender paper, however, in case there was a base rate cut on the way, and at mid-morning the Bank announced that it had purchased only Pounds 6m of Band 1 bank bills outright at 10 3/8 per cent. That indication of unchanged interest rates pushed short sterling futures down 5 basis points to 89.86. For the rest of the day, activity was quiet, with the Bank keeping liquidity tight. Later in the morning, the Bank revised the expected shortfall to Pounds 900m, and bought another Pounds 30m of Band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. In the afternoon, the forecast was revised upwards again, to Pounds 950m, and the Bank bought Pounds 55m of Band 1 treasury bills and Pounds 341m of Band 1 bank bills, both at 10 3/8 per cent, before providing unspecified late assistance of around Pounds 465m. Overnight money traded as high as 12 per cent. Short sterling futures closed at 89.90, and the three months interbank rate ended  1/16 lower on the day at 10 1/4 -10 3/16 per cent, with the market's belief that a base rate cut is likely around or before the Budget on March 10 strengthened by the day's events. Those expecting a cut sooner rather than later are focusing attention on Thursday, when the January trade figures are due. German call money rates eased further to 9.40/50 per cent, down from Monday's 9.45/55 per cent. Banks had overestimated the February reserve requirement, dealers said, and found themselves with surplus cash as the month drew to a close. In the US, Federal Funds traded at 3 15/16 per cent, just below the Federal Reserve's presumed target of 4 per cent. There were no reserve operations, said the Fed.</p>

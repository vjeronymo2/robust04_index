			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: Tough talking men of cloth - Jenny Luesby tests the fabric of high-speed textile makers When Snap-Drape won a Pounds 50,000 order from Eurodisney to dress five hotels - worth of tables in covers and skirts, it must have known it had broken through into the ranks of the outstanding exporter. 'In 1982, we thought table skirting would be a nice little earner for the two of us, my wife and myself,' says Mr Peter Graville, Snap-Drape's managing director. 'Within six months we realised we had a really good product, and we got serious.' For directors' lunches and conferences, wedding receptions and hotel buffets, Mr Graville and his wife toiled in the garage of their Cheam home, whipping up Austrian valances with swags, Victorian skirts with lace overlays and two - tier tables bedecked in regency pleats. In seven pleat - styles, nine fabrics and 150 colours, they moved into the screen printing of company logos and the marketing of mobile storage caddies. The result, last year, was export earnings of Pounds 1m for 30 miles of tablecloths and 33 miles of table skirting. 'We created a market,' says Mr Graville, 'that is why we succeeded.' 'It can take two hours to box a tablecloth around a six-foot table using pins - and then you have to undo it again. Ours clip on in minutes, and off, and on again.' Booming overseas sales in the UK textile industry are not based on price competition. They require something else, be it speed, flexibility, quality or design. Another winner that went down the design path is Crowson fabrics of east Sussex, which markets 2,500 choices of fabrics and wallpapers as next-day deliveries within Europe. The company has increased its exports from Pounds 7.5m to Pounds 20m in just three years, thanks to its 'design flair', it says. 'We have 11 designers, all of them under 25, who came to us straight from design college. The point is that their work gets copied. Their designs have made us industry leaders,' says Crowson. The company cites as its latest success a Javanese collection, in rich and vibrant colours, 'inspired by south sea island folk lore and art'. However, speed and flexibility feature more strongly as the bywords of this year's textile winners. 'Quick response production' is the industry jargon for what is better about British textiles. What it means is that for award-winning fashion exporters Mondbury, and Finesse 14-day delivery is a basic tenet, not an optional extra. 'Everything is built for speed,' says Mr Stephen Sugarman of Finesse. Cash-rich, Finesse 'does not work with banks,' he says. The company keeps bulk fabric stocks to feed the 50 sub-contractors that it employs: 'They get the order and they get the fabric, the same day.' Finesse has increased its exports five-fold in the last three years, to 75 per cent of its roughly Pounds 9m of annual sales. 'We've got there by catching the market,' says Mr Sugarman. 'If they want ruffled blouses in Europe, we supply them, and if they sell out in 10 days, we supply them again. Every week, I drive around Europe, making contacts, marketing our service. In garment runs from 500 to 10,000, what we offer is speed.' Mondbury operates to much the same philosophy, but has carved out a niche market in French and German mail order women's clothes. 'Our prices are much the same as our competitors, but we're quicker,' says Mr Anthony Ruffman. Mondbury's chairman. 'We can deliver a finished product in two weeks, and that's impossible from south-east Asia.' In three years, Mondbury has doubled its exports, to Pounds 3.2m. 'Our move into the export market was a conscious decision. We had to do something. The UK market was getting tougher and tougher. Our turnover and our margins were falling. But with a low cost base and minimal overheads, we've been able to compete in Europe.' 'In fact, what has surprised us is just how conservative the European market is for women's clothing. It doesn't change. We sell Princess-line type dresses. None of them are short and they're all in Polyester, which wouldn't suit a younger market. And every year navy and white is a winner.' Youth is, nonetheless, a feature of Mondbury's award. Snap-Drape, Crowson, Finesse and Mondbury are all youngsters in the British textile industry, every one established between 1978 and 1982. It is the old timers that the world's market for high-quality garments has embraced. J. Barbour and Sons, the maker of weatherproof country clothing, traces its history back to 1894. Today's award is its second, having doubled its exports again since winning in 1992. It now sells more than half its production overseas, with the US, Germany and France its three biggest markets. But the prize for the vibrant oldie must surely go to James Johnston and Company of Elgin, founded in 1798. Export sales now account for 40 per cent of its total production with annual sales of more than Pounds 2m in both Germany and Japan. It, too, has gone for quick response production. 'We can serve the just-in-time syndrome because we are completely vertical in our production methods,' says Mr James Sugden, Johnstons' managing director. 'We bring raw cashmere into the Scottish Highlands and then process it completely, into a branded garment, for export. There are no intermediate processes and we have control over speed and quality.' 'We've also become more aggressive in our buying policies - access to China is easier, and we're now buying our cashmere off the back of the goat in Mongolia. But there really are a lot of unexploited markets out there for luxury clothes. Just building up a distribution network has boosted our sales.' Thus, Johnston has doubled its exports of cashmere clothes in three years, to Pounds 9m. It is a tough job being a successful British textiles exporter, but it seems as if the men of cloth have not yet been deterred.</p>

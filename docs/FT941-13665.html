			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / World Trade News: BNP takes lead in Hungarian road financing Banque Nationale de Paris has syndicated finance for eastern Europe's first concession motorway, designed to connect Hungary to the west European network. Construction began in December on the Ecu 329m (Pounds 245m) project. A consortium led by Transroute International, a subsidiary of the French highway operator, is building 42km of dual carriageway to complete Hungary's M1 motorway between Budapest and the Austrian frontier. There it will link up with Austria's A4 motorway to Vienna. Completion is scheduled for the end of 1995, in time for the Budapest Expo in 1996. Later a 15km spur will extend from the main route to the Slovakian border to join up with the highway to Prague in the Czech Republic. The motorway sections begun yesterday are missing links in the Trans-European Motorway system (TEM) and between the two halves of Europe. Eastern Europe's former communist regimes neglected highway development and most countries' motorways do not extend far beyond their capital cities. The M1 concession is also a test case for build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects both in Hungary and in eastern Europe. The private sector will finance total project costs, including capitalised interest, of Ft32.5bn (Pounds 214m). Members of the Elso Magyar Koncesszios Autopalya consortium will meet roughly a fifth of the cost through equity. The London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is taking a 10 per cent stake and France's Caisse des Depots et Consignations will hold 13.9 per cent. Transroute International, the operator, will control only 4.2 per cent; and Strabag, the Austrian building contractor, is the largest shareholder with 21 per cent. The remainder of the financing will be evenly divided between forint-denominated and international borrowing. The consortium plans to issue forint bonds, stimulating Budapest's capital markets. The EBRD has committed Ecu129m in equity and loan financing. The Hungarian authorities hope that the progress of the M1 concession will speed up similar tenders for three other motorways to link Budapest with neighbouring countries. Completion of the motorway projects and two toll bridges are expected to involve about Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) in investment. The Transport Ministry's motorway directorate intends next month to name a preferred bidder for construction of 130km of highway to take the M5 motorway south-east of Budapest towards the Serbian and Romanian borders. In contention are a partnership of Grands Travaux de Marseilles and Transroute, and another French consortium led by Bouygues, the building contractor. East European countries are faced with budgetary stringency and a pressing need for infrastructural development to stimulate the economy and provide a foundation for new investment.</p>

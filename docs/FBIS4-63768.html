			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 24 May (AFP) -- Ukrainian President Leonid  Kravchuk accused Russian President Boris Yeltsin Tuesday [24  May] of violating international law by intervening in the  political crisis between Ukraine and its separatist republic of  Crimea.    "The Russian president may warn his own institutions but not  the president of another state," Kravchuk told a group of World  War II veterans he was meeting with.    Yeltsin last Friday called on Ukraine not to use force in  responding to Crimea's decision to restore a 1992 constitution  which grants the predominantly Russian-populated republic on the  Black Sea greater autonomy from Kiev.    Yeltsin also said that neither Ukraine nor Russia should  intervene in Crimea.    Kravchuk also wondered out loud before his audience Tuesday  whether recent comments by Sergei Filatov, Yeltsin's chief of  staff, represented "the position of the Russian state."    Filatov implicitly criticized Kravchuk on Monday by  denouncing "those irresponsible politicians seeking to take  advantage of the situation (in Crimea) in order to delay  presidential elections" scheduled June 26 in Ukraine.    Kravchuk stressed that the Crimean issue must not become a  source of discord between Ukraine and Russia.    He said that as long as Crimean leaders did not recognize  that the autonomous republic was "an integral part of Ukraine"  there was no room for compromise on the issue.    The Ukrainian parliament has declared the Crimean  independence move "illegal" and has given the local legislature  up until Monday to reverse its decision.</p>

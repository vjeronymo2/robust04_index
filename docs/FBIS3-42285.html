The court saw two videotapes on which the supreme state  security prosecution recorded a staged version of the incident  and how it was carried out. The fifth and sixth defendants  related how the crime was committed and the role of each one of  them, as well as the role of the seventh defendant who  participated in the crime, how they prepared the explosive  charge used in the incident, and how they monitored the prime  minister's movements.    The court also saw a videotape about an examination of the  house of the fifth defendant Salah al-Din [name indistinct] in  al-Minufiyah, in which the police found electrical equipment,  weapons, and explosives being prepared for use in some terrorist  operations. [passage omitted]    The Supreme Military Court decided to adjourn its sessions  until tomorrow to hear the remaining witnesses who assisted the  police or took part in capturing the defendants.    The court decided to refer the fifth defendant, Salah  al-Din,  to a physician to determine the truth about his claim that he  was tortured. The court also decided to summon the commander  and some members of the prime minister's guard to hear their  testimony. [passage omitted]</p>

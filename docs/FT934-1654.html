			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: LMS supported by Pounds 2m exceptional gains Profits at London Merchant Securities, the property and investment company, slipped from Pounds 10.9m to Pounds 10.1m pre-tax in the six months to September 30. The shares eased 2p to 109p. Under FRS 3 the corresponding figures have been restated to bring extraordinaries above the line: last time profits of Pounds 11.3m were declared. While gross rental income edged ahead to Pounds 17.2m (Pounds 16.9m), net rental income from investment properties declined to Pounds 14.8m (Pounds 15m). Lord Rayne, chairman, said that reflected the 'full effect of the carrying costs of new developments as yet unlet'. Property trading profits grew to Pounds 624,000 (Pounds 75,000) and operating profits to Pounds 13.3m (Pounds 12.8m). Under FRS 3, First Leisure, in which LMS has a 14.6 per cent stake, is now treated as an investment. Therefore the dividend receivable is shown, rather than a share of the leisure group's profits. Within other income down at Pounds 4.43m (Pounds 6.33m) because of the effect of lower interest rates on cash deposits, income from First Leisure was flat at Pounds 596,000. This time there were exceptional credits of Pounds 2.05m (Pounds 812,000) from a rise in other investments and the release of a Pounds 574,000 provision against investments. Interest payable expanded to Pounds 9.5m (Pounds 8.8m). During the period the core businesses were expanded by the acquisition of seven bingo clubs in the Midlands. Lord Rayne said organic growth was continuing. Earnings per share worked through at 2.31p (2.53p) and the interim dividend is held at 0.8p.</p>

			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHILD'S RIGHTS NEED RESPECT TOO  </P> <P> The No. 1 cause of death in children under the age of 1 is child abuse. In our  media-saturated society, publicized cases of abuse tend to cloud the reality of  the problem. Grim details and horrific tales of a deranged abuser give the  image that the problem is only prevalent where there is a severely disturbed  parent, such as the Orange County woman who ran over her baby with the car and  pleaded postpartum depression as an excuse.  </P> <P> But what about the individual who is not overtly aggressive? Do we stop to  consider the thousands of people that lead "normal" lives and beat their  children as a form of punishment or a release of their own frustrations? We  cannot turn our backs and say, "Well, I don't abuse children." Child abuse is  not an individual's problem. It is society's problem. We need to work together  to give children a life free of emotional and physical abuse.  </P> <P> Child abuse appears in two general forms: physical abuse and emotional abuse.  Physical abuse can and does consist of slapping, punching, biting, burning,  scratching and sexual molestation. This mistreatment can both maim and kill a  child. Emotional abuse, which is the most difficult to detect, is a subtle,  insidious destruction of a child's self-esteem and psychological sense of self.  This form of abuse can be the most dangerous to a child's psyche. A child that  is constantly intimidated, belittled and neglected is going to have trouble  interacting with peers, authority figures and society in general. An abused  child has severe difficulty growing emotionally; this often leads to  psychological problems later in life.  </P> <P> Most abused children will not report their own suffering, fearing further abuse  from their persecutor. Unexplained bruises, welts and burns, children who are  consistently uncared for and hungry, abrupt changes in behavior and prolonged  listlessness are all possible signs of child abuse and should be questioned. If  abuse is reasonably suspected, a national referral service is readily available  at (800) 4-A-CHILD.  </P> <P> In order for a child to be freed from this suffering, the abuse must be  reported. However, once the report is made, the situation can sometimes go from  bad to worse. Abused children tend to develop a love-hate relationship with the  abuser. Often an abused child will be removed from the home screaming for the  same person that was abusing him or her, since the child prefers "hell" to the  unknown. A child may also protect the abuser and deny the abuse in an attempt  to win love or out of fear of the wrath that may result in admitting to the  suffering. The child's hesitation to report the details is further complicated  by the fact that the legal system is usually intent on reuniting a family.  </P> <P> As a therapist, I cannot express how painful it is to help children protect  themselves when the law cannot. By focusing intently on a parent's rights, the  law often returns abused children to the parents, resulting in further abuse,  and sometimes death. A child's rights must be considered to be equally  important, if not more important, as a parent's, if only for the fact that a  child is defenseless against an adult. A recent case in Orange County shows the  court's focus on parental rights and family reunification.  </P> <P> A father had been abusing his 7-year-old daughter through repeated physical  beatings, verbal harassment and sexual molestation. Once the abuse was reported  and proven, the law intervened to separate the father and the child.  </P> <P> After the separation, the courts wanted to give the father another chance --  even though there had been documented evidence of verbal, physical and sexual  abuse. The father was allowed unsupervised, off-grounds visitation rights and  the abuse continued. When it was finally realized that abuse was still  occurring, the father was restricted to supervised visitations. This child  suffered needless pain and psychological damage -- that may be irreversible --  in order to preserve the parent's rights. But what about the child's rights?  Our legal system is so intent on reunification that it will be recommended even  when it is not in the child's best interest.  </P> <P> Why should a child's rights take a back seat to the parents'? Child-abuse  legislation needs a change of focus. Parents should not always have the  ultimate right, and reunification is not always the answer.  </P> <P> Statistics show that once a family is reunited, child abuse usually occurs  again. Children deserve the legal right not to be abused.  </P> <P> Our courts need to set some precedence regarding children's rights. We need to  offer alternatives and counseling to abusive parents, as well as the children.  It must also be realized that depression and alcoholism do not relieve parents  of their responsibilities.  </P> <P> We must all work with the legal system by reporting child abuse and instituting  laws that protect children before another child is afflicted.  </P></p>

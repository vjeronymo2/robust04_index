			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Armani accused of copying design TWO young British designers have taken legal action against Giorgio Armani, one of the giants of Italian fashion, for allegedly copying their design. Mr Antoni Burakowski and Ms Alison Roberts - known professionally as Antoni &amp; Alison - claim that a T-shirt in this winter's Armani collection is based very closely on one that they designed in 1989 and displayed in Italy, including Mr Armani's home base of Milan. The Antoni &amp; Alison T-shirt bears the words 'I feel amazing fantastic incredible brilliant fabulous great', while the Armani shirt says 'I feel outrageous amazing brilliant terrific great' with a similar lay-out. Mr Mark Stephens, Antoni &amp; Alison's London solicitor, said yesterday that a writ had been issued against Mr Armani personally and against three of his companies. The first pre-trial hearing is due on Thursday. In their defence, the Armani companies admit that the design printed on their T-shirt was 'inspired' by Antoni &amp; Alison but deny any wrong-doing. They say the original design is 'neither artistic nor original'. Antoni &amp; Alison would be seeking damages in the region of Pounds 300,000, Mr Stephens said. Armani had already withdrawn its T-shirt from sale in the UK. Mr Burakowski said the case was ironic because 'Armani himself is a frequent victim of copying and often has to sue people to protect his name'.</p>

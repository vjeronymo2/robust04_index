			<p><P> October 15, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS;  </P> <P> CITY TO MEET WITH ANNEXATION FOES  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks officials plan to meet with a group of landowners who oppose a  proposed annexation of the Rancho Conejo Industrial Park, City Manager Grant  Brimhall said.  </P> <P> The Ventura County Local Agency Formation Commission last month reversed an  earlier decision not to allow Thousand Oaks to move ahead with annexing the  350-acre industrial park.  </P> <P> LAFCO's action paves the way for the city to annex the industrial park, but  officials still need to gain approval from a majority of the businesses and  landowners for annexation to proceed, Brimhall said.  </P> <P> Meetings with the business owners have not yet been scheduled, he said.  </P> <P> The industrial park is north of the Ventura Freeway and is almost completely  surrounded by the city.  </P> <P> Opposition by more than 50% of the registered voters in the industrial park  could block the annexation effort, a LAFCO official said.  </P> <P> If 25% to 50% of the property owners protest, the city would have to call a  special election.  </P> <P> Many landowners contend that the annexation would be bad for business, but they  have agreed to meet with city officials, said Jim Bilicki, who represents more  than 50 of the property owners.  </P> <P> Business owners protested the city's attempts earlier this year to annex the  industrial park, saying that business costs and utility fees could increase if  the area becomes part of the city.  </P> <P> Differences between county and city zoning requirements could require  businesses to upgrade their buildings to conform to city standards, Bilicki  said. Trash rates would also increase an estimated 25% if the area were to be  annexed, he said. PSYCHE PASCUAL  </P></p>

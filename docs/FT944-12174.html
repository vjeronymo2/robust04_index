			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / FT Review of Business Books (7): Submerged tensions - Richard Waters laments a missed opportunity to tell an interesting story / The US Conglomerate 'THE MAKING OF HARCOURT GENERAL' by Bettye H Pruitt Harvard Business School Press, Dollars 35.00, 310 pages If chapter headings such as 'Professionalisation of the Entrepreneurial Enterprise' and 'Diversification' set your pulse racing, this book is for you. If not, put it down quickly and move on. Ms Pruitt is a peculiar breed of writer. She refers in her preface to 'those of us who practice history as consultants in the corporate world.' She is a vice-president of a company which 'specialises in the historical analysis of institutional development.' Perhaps it should come as no surprise, then, that her tale sinks under a morass of consultant-speak. Harcourt General has been a curious example of the US conglomerate. Since starting out in 1922 in the movie theatre business - it was known for most of its life as General Cinema - the company has been dominated by just two members of the Smith family; father Philip and son Richard. It still retains echoes of the family business (the Smiths retain a veto over any takeover of the group.) Under Richard, the company bought its way into soft drink bottling, retailing - through Neiman Marcus - and eventually publishing. It bought Harcourt Brace Jovanovich in 1991 when that company was still reeling from the financial consequences of fighting off advances from the late Robert Maxwell. Like all modern conglomerates, it has unbundled itself again, shedding bottling, cinemas and insurance. Yet only in its final pages does this story come briefly to life. There, we glimpse for the first time the tensions between family shareholders and the professional managers who now largely run the group. The 1991 acquisition of Harcourt itself is a fascinating story of financial manoeuvring. Until this point, though, The Making of Harcourt General has been a tedious recounting of events, with little sense of the personal or corporate dynamics behind the company's growth. The characters are mere ciphers. We are told that 'it would be difficult to find a flaw' in the character of Philip Smith who founded and ran the company until his death in 1961. He was apparently 'both brilliant and charismatic, yet never self-aggrandising or overbearing.' Was there ever such a paragon of business virtue? Son Richard also remains a mystery, although that may be because he is not a natural subject for a book like this. Writing in 1987, Fortune magazine described him as a 'strait-laced New Englander' who 'loathes publicity.' While the lack of rounded human characters robs the book of interest for the general reader, fans of corporate history are also likely to find it disappointing. There is little analysis of General Cinema's financial strategy. Reading between the lines of Ms Pruitt's account, you just glimpse the outline of big and clashing egos, and the hint of some almighty disagreements and internal feuds along the way. This might have made interesting reading. Unfortunately, the author skips over these real-life tensions with the ease of a management consultant doctoring a contentious report.</p>

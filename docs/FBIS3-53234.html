[Sha'th] Thank you.    [Husayn] Dr. Nabil, could you please brief us on the results  of the meetings of the past two days?    [Sha'th] The talks seek to reach a written, signed agreement  so that the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho can begin  as soon as possible. We have returned to Taba following a  hiatus in the talks during which the Palestinian-Israeli Liaison  Committee dealt with complicated issues including control over  the border crossings and specifying the size of the Jericho area  and the security zones that will surround the Israeli  settlements in Gaza. We are still discussing these issues,  among many others. We have a committee discussing the transfer  of civilian powers to the Palestinian national authority in Gaza  and Jericho. This committee has been successful and has already  decided on the transfer of most departments. The Security  Committee has been discussing the border crossings, Jericho, and  other security issues. A third committee will formulate the  general agreement that will also deal with the Palestinian  national authority's powers.    [Husayn] Dr. Nabil, in what spheres have you made progress?  What spheres remain pending?    [Sha'th] Progress has been made in the transfer of civilian  powers. Discussions within the Security Committee are very slow  and difficult. This is really the consequence of the Israeli  attitude to these issues, especially as they are raising the  stakes, insisting that the discussions will last long, and that  they will not observe the 13 April date for completing  withdrawal. Their public statements that they will not observe  the agreement hinder progress on the security issue, the biggest  problem in the negotiations.    [Husayn] Have you proposed a compromise on control over the  border crossings?    [Sha'th] Each side is making proposals. But I believe we  need to negotiate much more before we can announce real progress  on this issue.    [Husayn] Dr. Nabil, after reports from Taba said that  agreement had been reached specifying the size of the Jericho  area as 55 sq km, you denied this and said the reports were  fabricated. What are the facts?    [Sha'th] The reports were fabricated. The Israeli spokesman  said the same when he was asked. The head of the Israeli  delegation Major General Shahaq also stated that they were  fabricated reports.    [Husayn] Have you reached a solution on specifying the size  of the Jericho area?    [Sha'th] We are still working on it. Brother, these are the  difficult points. They need much effort.    [Husayn] Dr. Sha'th, I believe that Maj. Gen. Shahaq stated  that the Israeli delegation came to Taba to negotiate over what  he called the Cairo document. What do you think of this  statement?    [Sha'th] I believe this news has also been distorted. We are  negotiating on the basis of the Declaration of Principles and  the Cairo concepts. On some of these concepts the two  delegations are close to each other and on others they are far  apart. Hence, there is no such thing as a Cairo agreement,  merely several concepts. Doubtless, we will profit from the  ideas on which we have agreed. We will continue negotiating to  reach agreement on the rest.    [Husayn] Dr. Sha'th, the Israeli delegation reportedly  presented 10 different maps to the Palestinian negotiators  yesterday, Tuesday. How true is this? What can you tell us  about the maps?    [Sha'th] True. They submitted maps about new areas they have  added to Jericho. They also submitted maps reducing the  security areas around the Gaza settlements. They also proposed  architectural plans for the border crossing buildings. All this  reflected Israeli positions, which, although more advanced,  remain insufficient for Palestinian purposes.    [Husayn] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, in a move seen by observers as  U.S. intervention, or rather assistance, the U.S. State  Department issued a statement yesterday, Tuesday, urging the  Palestinian and Israeli delegations to find prompt solutions to  the unresolved issues. Do you see any significance in this U.S.  statement?    [Sha'th] I believe the Americans want the Palestinians and  Israelis to make some progress before the meeting between  Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton. I believe that  pressure should be applied to the Israelis. As for us, we are  willing to achieve results as fast as possible.    [Husayn] Will you ask Egypt, the United States, or any other  party to intervene if the Israeli attitude remains the same?    [Sha'th] Naturally, if there is no progress. The Egyptians  maintain constant contact with us and are following every  development.    [Husayn] We thank Dr. Nabil Sha'th.    [Sha'th] Thank you.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] Brothers: The continuous obstacles in the  negotiations to implement the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of  Principles agreement -- which are caused by Israeli  intransigence and the maneuvers of the Israeli negotiating team,  which tries to evade the spirit and letter of the agreement --  confirm, once again, the truth about the Palestinian reading of  the agreement. This reading proved at the negotiations to be  the more accurate reading of the agreement, the closest to its  spirit, and the most accurate to interpreting its clauses.    The stumbling of the talks indicate, beyond any doubt, that  the Palestinian reading is facing the Israeli reading -- with  full strength and firmness -- and that the fierce conflict  between them refutes the desperate allegations by the  rejectionist forces on Palestinian capitulation and on the  weakness of the Palestinian negotiator in the face of the  Israeli negotiator.    If the arguments of the rejectionist forces on capitulation,  weakness, and enormous concessions -- which the Palestinian  negotiator is supposedly making there -- are true, we would not  have seen obstacles, conflict in the negotiations, or Israeli  intransigence, since the Israeli negotiator would have taken  everything from the Palestinian negotiator -- as claimed by the  statements of the rejectionist. The agreement also would have  been implemented from the first moments in the negotiations in  accordance with the Israeli way and reading.    Yes, if the Palestinian negotiator was weak and surrendered  to the Israeli negotiator, we would not have passed through  three months of heated negotiations, which have been fruitful  thus far, between the two parties.    Will the Palestinian rejectionist forces look at these facts  thoroughly and with a national eye so as to practice a role --  even as an opposition -- to support the Palestinian view and the  Palestinian reading, which is aimed at turning the agreement  into a first step on the path of building the independent  Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.    Yes, this is what we want from the agreement. There is no  difference over this national objective. Will there be a review  of stands before it is too late?</p>

The Nordic  foreign ministers have had talks in Stockholm about developments  in Russia and the Baltic countries. The Nordic countries will  assist the Baltic countries in setting up their own peacekeeping  force.    [Correspondent Mikko Maeaettaelae] The Nordic foreign  ministers gathered in Stockholm, who were joined by the newcomer  Tore Godal of Norway, devoted a large part of their talks to  issues in areas in their close vicinity. Finnish Foreign  Minister Heikki Haavisto commented on the latest news from  Russia on the resignation of Finance Minister Fedorov by voicing  the hope that he would be replaced by an equally good man. On  the other hand, Haavisto suspects that the reform policy in  Russia will slow down.    The Nordic foreign ministers point to the aggressive  nationalist trends appearing in Russia, voicing the hope that  Russia will adhere to the foreign policy it has chosen and that  it will become closer to the rest of Europe. The hope is  expressed that Russia will respect the inviolability of other  states. The foreign ministers urge Russia and, on the other  hand, Estonia and Latvia to reach an agreement on the withdrawal  of Russian troops from the Baltics. This is what Foreign  Minister Heikki Haavisto had to say:    [Begin recording] [Haavisto] It is based on the  international  treaties concluded and it would increase stability here in  northern Europe, in our close vicinity.    [Maeaettaelae] How rapid a withdrawal would the Nordic  countries wish for?    [Haavisto] As I have seen it, the issue between these Baltic  countries and Russia has been that withdrawal should take place  by the autumn.    [Maeaettaelae] The Danish defense minister has said that a  new cold war can be expected in Europe unless Russia withdraws  its troops from the Baltics. What do you say to this?    [Haavisto] I don't think it is a question of that. These  countries are now having businesslike talks with each other and  I believe that they will be acting in accordance with the  principles as they have promised at various international  conferences. [end recording]    [Maeaettaelae] The Nordic foreign ministers take a positive  view of the fact that the Baltic countries are joining  peacekeeping work. The Nordic countries are prepared to assist  the Baltic countries in establishing a peacekeeping unit  operating under the auspices of either the United Nations or the  CSCE. This is what Foreign Minister Haavisto has to say about  Finland's ways of helping:    [Begin recording] [Haavisto] Well, mainly in training. We  have considered that we have the capacity in Niinisalo to take  on pupils for training from the Baltic countries -- that is the  primary way in which we are taking part.    [Maeaettaelae] Is this in fact military assistance?    [Haavisto] No, this is purely training specifically for  peacekeeping duties. [end recording]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [First installment of article by Colonel Georgiy Kostenko, </F> academician, under the heading "Organizational Development of  the Armed Forces of Ukraine: Experience, Problems, Prospects";  "Fundamentals of National Military Doctrine: Structure, Content,  Strategy"]    [Text] In connection with the Supreme Council of  Ukraine's adoption of the Military Doctrine of Ukraine, readers  are asking NARODNA ARMIYA to describe in more detail the stages  of the creation and conceptual provisions of this important  official document and the structure and content of the Military  Doctrine. We accommodate their wishes.    An analysis of the material connected with the confirmation  of the first military doctrine in the history of the Ukrainian  state shows that in the discussion of the draft the people's  deputies of Ukraine constantly raised two attendant  questions--on the content of foreign policy and on the attitude  toward weapons of mass destruction, since without a  determination of the position on these two principal issues,  adopting the Military Doctrine was practically impossible. This  is why the members of parliament approved in a relatively short  period of time three important documents: "Guidelines of the  Foreign Policy of Ukraine" (2 July 1993), the Military Doctrine  of Ukraine (19 October 1993), and the decree of the Supreme  Council of Ukraine "Ratification of the Treaty Between the USSR  and the United States on the Reduction and Limitation of  Strategic Offensive Arms Signed in Moscow on 31 July 1991 and  the Protocol Thereto Signed in Lisbon on Behalf of Ukraine on 23  May 1992" (18 November 1993). That is, while still in draft  form, the Military Doctrine accelerated confirmation of base  documents determining the content of the holy of holies of  national security of our fatherland--the strategy of Ukraine's  military security. It would be perfectly correct to call the  "Guidelines of the Foreign Policy of Ukraine," therefore, the  doctrine of the foreign policy of our state, which is of  importance in an understanding of the theory and practice of our  organizational development for defense.    The qualitative state of contemporary military theory is  reason to believe that the military scientists of the former  Soviet Army have to their credit in the sphere of the theory of  military doctrine output of a world standard. This permits the  expectation in the future of the adoption of national military  doctrines by many states of the former Union. The adoption of  military doctrines by the Republic of Belarus and the Russian  Federation are confirmation of this. I would like to emphasize  particularly here that, as distinct from the said doctrines of  the contiguous states, only the Military Doctrine of Ukraine has  an open content. This is practical realization not only of the  principle of a strengthening of trust in the military sphere but  also the mentality of our people, which have throughout their  history fought only defensive wars. This fundamental fact  predetermined the defensive nature of the Military Doctrine of  Ukraine.    But the defensive focus of military organizational  development does not simplify the creation of the military  organization of a state which has embarked on the path of  independent development. The sum total of objective and  subjective factors that have determined the complexity of the  organizational development of the army and navy of Ukraine is  without counterpart in world practice. The assertion that there  is a simple version of the transformation of the groupings of  the troops and forces of the former Soviet Army located on our  territory into the armed forces of Ukraine is from the  scientific viewpoint absurd, and from the professional  viewpoint, not serious. The organizational development of the  armed forces of Ukraine is a problem of many levels requiring a  comprehensive solution. If there is at all an unambiguous  resolution of it, one word may be used to describe this  path--intellectual. After all, only professionals with in-depth  theoretical knowledge and firm practical skills can create a  mechanism of effective military organizational development. It  is essential for this to know not only the content of our  national military doctrine but also the general approaches to  its formation.    Considering the phenomenon of the disintegration of  superpowers and the complexity of military organizational  development, military science toward the end of the 20th century  has formulated its recommendations for states that have embarked  on the path of independent development. In sum, these  recommendations amount to the fact that it is expedient to build  the military organization of a sovereign state in stages, on the  principles of scientific content and legality. There is reason  to believe that, despite perfectly permissible digressions, such  recommendations of military science have been taken into  consideration in Ukraine.    At the first stage (from 16 July 1990 through 24  August 1991) Ukraine was determining its position with regard to  its statehood. At the second stage (from 24 August  1991 through 3 January 1992) the Supreme Council of Ukraine had  in anticipation prepared the prescriptive-legal base for the  organizational development of its own armed forces. At the  third stage (from 3 January 1992 through 19 October  1993) the organizational development of the army and navy began  and the Military Doctrine was prepared and confirmed.  Confirmation of the individual concepts of the organizational  development of branches of the service, arms of the troops  (forces), and headquarters components ensuing from the Military  Doctrine is to be expected at the fourth stage, and  at the fifth stage, confirmation of the official  program of the organizational development of the armed forces  and the official program of the development of arms and military  equipment drawn up on the basis of these concepts.    Today, being at the start of the fourth stage, it is not  hard  to anticipate that, first, the elaboration of the concepts and  official programs will require tremendous input and that,  second, the organizational development of the armed forces is a  process of higher-than-usual research-intensiveness, which will  require fundamentally new knowledge and abilities of military  scientists and military specialists.    The progressive nature of the future laws on military  matters  is expressed not only in the fact that the armed forces of  Ukraine are authorized forces and resources for operations in  all four environments--in space, in the air, on land, and at  sea--but also in the fact that it is prescribed that the state  have its own military doctrine.    Military doctrine is a scientific category. Realized in the  form of an official constitutional-level document, it negotiates  two stages of opposition. The first--on the part of  military scientists and military specialists in the period of  elaboration of the draft, and the second, on the part  of members of parliament at the time of confirmation. This fact  makes permits the belief that ultimately military doctrine  represents the sum total of victorious ideas in the sphere of  assurance of military security and the organizational  development of the armed forces and their use. The military  doctrine of the state is commissioned by legislative mechanisms,  but its draft is prepared mainly by scientific methods. In  accordance with this principle, substantiation of the structure  and content of the military doctrine is the main mission of  military science. But, negotiating the procedure of  confirmation, the military doctrine undergoes certain revisions,  and, after its approval, military science begins to experience  the influence of the doctrine. That is, there is quite a strict  direct connection and feedback between military science and  military doctrine. This is the first fundamental point.    The second is as follows. There is every reason to believe  that the latest knowledge has been taught in the military  educational institutions in respect to the theory of military  doctrine. But a comparison of the material of the debate in the  journals VOYENNAYA MYSL and VOYENNYY VESTNIK of the Association  of Independent Publications permits the conclusion that at the  present time the theory of military doctrine is incomplete and  cannot count on universality. The studies that have been  conducted permit two conclusions. The first is that  military doctrine should contain the sum total of precepts which  permit its conjugation with the economic doctrine of the state.  Otherwise there is a danger of the conversion of military  doctrine into a military declaration divorced from the material  basis of its state. The second is that it is  essential that military doctrine have two groups of doctrinal  precepts--classical (general) and specific  (particular)--characteristic of the specific state. With this  approach the theory of military doctrine may lay claim to  universality.    The classical doctrinal precepts in the Military Doctrine of  Ukraine, therefore, are the causes of a possible war; the  sources of military danger; the attitude of the state toward  war; the basic tasks of the state in peacetime and wartime; ways  of ensuring military security; the missions of the armed forces;  the principles of the organizational development of the army and  navy; qualitative indicators of the organizational development  of the armed forces; focus of the training of the army and navy;  the role and place of other structures of the military  organization of the state; preparation of the state and society  for defense; opportune preparation of the economy for support of  the armed forces; and ways of realizing the military doctrine.  Given such precepts, the military doctrine may be conjugal with  the military doctrines of contiguous and other states and thus  be the basis of the assurance of military security.    The doctrinal precepts of the specific content ensue from  the  particular features of the geostrategic location of the state,  the state of its economy, and the quantitative-qualitative  indicators of the armed forces.    For Ukraine such particular features might be as follows:    The first--the state and its armed forces are  built in organizational unity. Dividing these two processes into  independent processes is practically impossible. By virtue of  this fact, the crisis state of the economy is reflected with  particular gravity in the combat capability of the army and navy.    The second particular feature ensues from the  specific character of the disposition of the groupings of troops  and forces stationed on the territory of Ukraine. It has come  about historically such that they were created in a different  military-political situation, were built according to different  strategic plans, and provided for different versions of military  operations. In the course of the organizational development of  the armed forces of Ukraine it will be necessary to transform  the troops and forces of the former two strategic axes of the  Union into groupings of troops and forces capable of warding off  aggression on any axis.    The third particular feature is expressed in the  fact that there are no chemical, biological, or tactical nuclear  weapons on the territory of Ukraine. The process of the  elimination of the strategic nuclear forces has begun. This  factor predetermines the need for the creation in the process of  organizational development of the army and navy of an equivalent  capable of ensuring the military security of Ukraine as a  nuclear-free and neutral state.    The fourth particular feature consists of the  existence of an intrinsic contradiction in the process of the  organizational development of the armed forces. On the one hand  it is essential to form full-fledged organs of command and  control and large formations and units and, on the other, to  reduce the quantity of the combat equipment to the quotas  established by the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in  Europe, to which Ukraine is a subscriber.    The fifth particular feature is connected with the  problem of the Black Sea Fleet, which may be resolved only  politically. Applying the methods of military science is very  difficult here.    The sixth particular feature is determined by the  priority need for the formalization in a treaty and legal  respect of the land border of Ukraine as a sovereign state.    The seventh particular feature has sociopolitical  roots. Even quite recently, from the start of the 1940's through  the start of the 1950's, there were on the territory of Ukraine  the elements of four wars: world, patriotic, civil, and national  liberation. This phenomenon signified the enhanced role of the  subjective factor, which is expressed in the fact that  individual social strata continue to settle historical scores  between themselves instead of seeking ways of consolidating  society and building the state and armed forces of the future.    Considering these particular features, the Military Doctrine  of Ukraine realizes the following specific precepts: the  strategic mission of the state; the role and place of Ukraine in  Europe and the world; the content of military security; the role  and place of military doctrine; the main military-political  goal; the content of the foreign policy and military-political  course; participation in the building of the structures of  regional and international security; the attitude of the state  toward weapons of mass destruction; the purpose of  military-economic policy; scientific and technological  priorities; ways of providing the army and navy with equipment;  the procedure of the funding of programs of material and social  support for the servicemen.</p>

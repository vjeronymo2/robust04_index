			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Hualon is a 'victim of hearsay': Laura Tyson interviews chief of Taiwanese textile company linked to share controversy Hualon-Teijran, the Taiwanese textile manufacturer, is determined to proceed with plans to build a plant in Northern Ireland with financial help from the British government, despite the recent share payment default controversy to which the company has been linked. Mr Liang Ching-hsiung, president of the Taiwan-listed company, in an interview depicted Hualon-Teijran as having fallen 'victim to hearsay' in this and previous scandals that have plagued its founding Oung family, maverick scions of a Shanghai textile dynasty. Mr Liang sought to distance the company he runs from other companies associated with Mr Oung Ta-ming, the focus of attention in the share scandal earlier this month involving 28 securities firms and TDollars 7.6bn (Pounds 182m) in defaults. He also sought to dispel concerns that Hualon-Teijran's Pounds 157m investment project near Belfast, undertaken with Pounds 61m in UK government aid, would go the way of an earlier state-subsidised project in Northern Ireland, the De-Lorean car factory, which collapsed in the early 1980s. 'Hualon has always been a solid, dedicated manufacturing operation, not a speculative company,' Mr Liang said. 'I particularly want to emphasise that our company has no relations whatsoever with Oung Ta-ming or his securities businesses and we know absolutely nothing about his share trading activities. In fact, all we know is what we read in the newspapers, like everyone else.' Mr Oung, a Taiwanese legislator and prominent share speculator, founded and built up a loosely knit group of companies now reckoned to be Taiwan's tenth biggest industrial group. Control is split among Mr Oung and three younger brothers. Mr Liang, who has worked at Hualon-Teijran since 1968, described the history and structure of the group in an effort to clarify what he regarded as misconceptions about the management of and relationship among companies within the group. He also presented Hualon-Teijran's version of events preceding a 1991 share-bribery scandal which led to the downfall of a cabinet minister. Mr Oung You-ming, the third Oung brother and chairman of Hualon-Teijran, left Taiwan after the scandal broke and has not returned to face charges in connection with the case. He now runs Hualon's businesses in Malaysia. Mr Liang said the case was politicised and Mr Oung You-ming will ultimately be found innocent. 'When the timing is right, Oung You-ming will of course return to Taiwan, but at the moment he has no concrete plans to do so.' Unlike other Taiwanese family run conglomerates such as Formosa Plastics and Koo's Group, the Oung family companies do not have a central holding company or centralised management and finances, Mr Liang said. Thus the term 'Hualon group' is actually a misnomer as the various entities have always been run independently, despite the fact that until the late 1980s family members sometimes held positions in more than one company. Mr Liang said that 1989 'marked a very important milestone for the family and for the businesses. At that point, Oung Ta-ming went into semi-retirement. He no longer wanted to have anything to do with the manufacturing side, so he let his brothers take over those businesses.' When Mr Oung You-ming took over Hualon-Teijran he began to look for opportunities to expand overseas and diversify. In 1990 the Taiwan government began offering financial incentives for investment in high-technology industries. Mr Liang said the younger Mr Oung wanted to take advantage of those incentives, but by law the consolidated investments of a listed company could not exceed 40 per cent of total registered capital. (This restriction was lifted in 1991.) To comply, Hualon-Teijran decided to sell 5m shares in Kuo Hwa Life Insurance. As Kuo Hwa is an unlisted concern, bidders could not be solicited publicly. Mr Oung tried to sell the shares privately to other tycoons, but none was interested given that the stock exchange index's fall from 12,000 in February 1990 to around 3,000 in October. The shares were sold in December 1990 to the daughter of Mr Clement Chang, minister of transportation and communications at the time, for TDollars 120 a share, compared with Mr Oung's original asking price of TDollars 150 a share. The shares were estimated by accountants to have a net asset value of TDollars 80. Regulators were notified of the transaction and a public announcement was made, as required by law. Authorities made no objection to the sale, Mr Liang said. 'We were trying our best as a law-abiding company to abide by the law of the country,' he said. In February 1991 Mr Hsu Rong-chi, a self-styled expert on the insurance industry, filed a suit against the sale, claiming that the shares were worth TDollars 500-TDollars 800 each, Mr Liang said. (Through his underground radio station, Mr Hsu this year mobilised Taipei cab drivers on several occasions to pro test against the ruling party. He was convicted last month of using the airwaves to incite violent demonstrations and sentenced to eight months in jail.) Mr Oung was temporarily prevented from leaving the country by prosecutors, but the restriction was lifted later. He subsequently left Taiwan legally and did not 'skip bail' as is widely believed, Mr Liang said. Hualon-Teijran's shares are widely dispersed among 180,000 shareholders. Mr Oung You-ming holds 3 per cent and Kuo Hwa Life Insurance 8 per cent. The company forecasts pre-tax profits of TDollars 1.15bn on turnover of TDollars 27bn in 1994, against a loss of TDollars 384m in 1993.</p>

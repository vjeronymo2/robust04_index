			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Hanson Yesterday's Pounds 500m convertible issue from Hanson was just the thing to stir a market impatiently waiting for the big takeover bid. But in the context of a balance sheet already carrying gross debt of Pounds 6.3bn, the sum scarcely signifies. Perhaps more material is the chance for Hanson to indulge its favourite trick of borrowing money cheap and depositing it dear: but after expenses and dilution, even that will make scarcely any difference to earnings per share. The fact remains that Hanson, like BTR, needs a big deal before too long. In view of the recent rise in world markets, it might be argued that it is late in the game already. But Hanson's standing with the banking community will doubtless allow it to raise unlimited credit when the time comes. It could even be argued that, at a time when the market is looking for geared recovery plays, it is not in Hanson's interest to be held back by cash on its balance sheet.</p>

			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Triumphs in the face of adversity: FT writers assess the few world leaders who tasted success in 1992 Nineteen ninety-two will go down as the year most of the world's heads of government would rather forget. For the leaders of the industrial democracies, from Mitterrand to Mulroney, it was a year of economic disappointment and political disenchantment. Those who faced the verdict of the voters, either on their performance (George Bush in America or Albert Reynolds in Ireland) or their policies (Poul Schluter and Francois Mitterrand in the Danish and French Maastricht referendums), found themselves subject to harsh, sometimes terminal, rebuke. Even for those who survived the test (Britain's John Major or Japan's Kiichi Miyazawa), electoral victory was only a prelude to deepening domestic difficulty. Yet the encircling clouds were not completely bereft of silver linings. Surprising as it may seem, a number of presidents and prime ministers may well be looking back on this year with something resembling . . . not affection, perhaps, but quiet satisfaction. To recognise this fact and provide some seasonal consolation, the FT has decided to create a new set of awards, which shall be known, faute de mieux, as the Plastic Spoon Prizes for Political Achievement. The PSPPA are fragile and readily disposable. To qualify you need to be a serving head of government (various definitions accepted) with at least three months in office (preferably much, much more); you have to have achieved a significant turnround in your own, your party's or your country's poll ratings/public image/international reputation/economic performance; and you should have a reasonable prospect of political survival beyond the next four weeks. First prize this year - the Alchemist's Award - goes to the unlikely and diminutive figure of Italian Prime Minister Giuliano Amato. In six months as prime minister, this 54-year-old Socialist law professor has performed an extraordinary feat of alchemy, turning political dross into gold. The dross he inherited was the weakest of the 51 postwar coalitions foisted on the much abused Italian electorate, taking office amid an exploding financial crisis. Most commentators wrote him off at the start as an ineffectual caretaker in hock to the vested interests of the ruling Christian Democrats and Socialists. But not only has Prof Amato survived; he has done more to reform the state in less time than any of his predecessors, and clawed back some of Italy's lost credibility abroad. The secret of his alchemy has been clever exploitation of his weakness. Amato's political career was that of a technician in the shadow of Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader. He was only chosen when Craxi was forced to forego his ambitions for the premiership as a result of a corruption scandal in Milan. More importantly, his coalition has depended on four parties discredited by a slide in votes at the April general election and a mere 16-seat majority in parliament. All these negative elements he turned to his advantage. He has emerged untainted by the scandals surrounding Craxi; the party is in fact desperate he should take over. The coalition has been held together because he has let the parties squabble among themselves while he has got on with governing. His main tactical weapon has consisted in continually invoking the dire state of Italy's finances. He once described the budget as a Christmas tree from which everyone takes something. There are no more presents. The urgent need to tackle the public sector deficit has enabled him to push through an emergency budget for 1992 and a tough austerity package for 1993, to reform the health service, pensions, the civil service and local administration, and to begin privatisation. In each case he has presented a blunt alternative: if the measures are not adopted, the government falls and worse will follow. With a relaxed public style and quick wit, his popularity ratings are high. Arguably he has become indispensable to guide Italy through a delicate transition period while the parties agree on a new electoral system and Italy's public finances are put in order. We have three runners-up in the political metamorphosis category. First, a souffle spoon to Paul Keating, who as Australia's Labor prime minister has spent much of this year successfully disproving his favourite maxim that a souffle never rises twice. Keating frequently uses the souffle test to dismiss political opponents. But it could equally have applied to the demoralised Labor government he inherited from Bob Hawke last December. When Keating moved into The Lodge, the modest Canberra residence of Australian prime ministers, Labor was trailing the conservative opposition coalition by up to 18 points in the opinion polls. A year later, Labor MPs are almost unable to contain their surprise at the prospect of a historic fifth consecutive victory in the next election, which must be held by June. The latest poll, by Newspoll for The Australian, has Labor 12 points ahead of the conservatives, compared with a deficit of 12 points at the end of October. That turnround amounts to a dramatic political success for Keating, and a stunning rejection of John Hewson, leader of the conservative coalition. Keating has gradually diverted public attention from Labor's record by attacking the opposition's taxation and social policies, assassinating the character of Hewson, now widely known by the Keating nickname of 'feral abacus', suggesting an out of control computer, and exploiting Australian nationalism. His achievement is all the more extraordinary against a background of weak economic recovery which has raised unemployment to a postwar record of 11.4 per cent and twice forced the government to reduce its growth forecasts. However, the volatility of the opinion polls suggests that the electorate has been signalling its dislike of opposition policies as much as approval for the government. And the opposition has just modified its most contentious policies in a radical overhaul of its election manifesto - a fact which could deflate the Keating souffle as fast as it rose. Second runner-up: Israel's Yitzhak Rabin. When 1992 began, Rabin's Labour party was in opposition, and he was not even leader of it. Twelve months later he is firmly esconced as prime minister, leading a government which believes it has the chance to deliver unprecedented peace with Israel's Arab neighbours and prosperity at home - although doubts as to his prospects of doing so in 1993 have increased following the crisis over Israel's expulsion of 415 Palestinians this month. Rabin's remarkable political resurrection - he was previously prime minister in the mid-1970s - was launched in February when he unseated Shimon Peres as Labour leader in a ballot of party members. The June general election had already been called and Labour was desperate to avoid a fifth election failure under Peres. As army chief of staff when Israel won its victory in the 1967 Six Day War, Rabin had the credentials to reassure an electorate always nervous about security issues - and especially about Labour's commitment to trade at least some of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in return for peace with the Palestinians. The result was banishment into opposition of the Likud party for the first time in 15 years and Rabin's triumphant return at the head of a Labour-led, centre-left coalition. After six months in office, the breakthrough in the Middle East peace talks in which Rabin has invested so much political capital has yet to materialise  -indeed, the current controversy has thrown a dark shadow over the peace process. But relations with the US and Europe, which fractured under the Likud, are restored and the peace talks may yet yield agreements in 1993 with the Palestinians, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. Third runner-up, and winner of the John Major Award for emergence from obscurity, is Hanna Suchocka, who was appointed prime minister of Poland last summer and has since presided over an impressive, though still fragile, improvement in her country's economic and political fortunes. In the first half of this year, Poland was in such a state of government crisis and economic slump that it risked becoming branded the sick man of central Europe. The surprise appointment of Suchocka, a tough-minded 46-year-old lawyer from the backbenches, provided a much-needed jolt. Unsullied by the infighting which has tarnished the Solidarity movement and the parties it spawned, she rapidly took hold of her ill-matched, seven-party coalition. Her brisk, no-nonsense manner appealed naturally to a population weary of factional struggles. Just as important, she managed to establish a modus vivendi with Lech Walesa, Poland's politically restless president who was in conflict with most of her predecessors. Suchocka's arrival happily coincided with the first signs of export-led growth in the economy. But the advent of the new government also seemed to engender a new sense of confidence in the country at large, bringing her a crop of unusually high poll ratings. Buoyed by this support, she was able to ride out a wave of strikes in the early autumn, after which her government moved to arrange an 'enterprise pact' with the unions and negotiated a new agreement with the International Monetary Fund. All these achievements remain tentative. The enterprise pact has still to be signed, and trade union unrest is growing. Moreover, in the new year the going may get tougher. Suchocka's popularity is slipping and her backing for a controversial ban on abortion has cost her support among women. If these trends continue, the worry is that Poles will again begin to lose faith in their future, and the will to persevere with free-market reforms will fade once more. Finally, three awards for unlikely achievement. Sub-Saharan Africa has sunk to such a debilitated and impoverished state that a leader emerging from 1992 with any credit whatsoever has pulled off a considerable political achievement. One such is Flight-Lt Jerry Rawlings, the 45-year-old Ghanaian who in November managed the transition from long-serving military leader to civilian president, in an election which was effectively a referendum on Ghana's structural adjustment programme. A mixture of fiery radical and hard-headed pragmatist, Rawlings fulminates against the shortcomings of the west. But he was one of Africa's first leaders to bite the bullet of economic reform. Since 1983 he has been implementing a World Bank recovery programme. He made no pretence of mastering the intricacies of measures he once described as 'economic blah blah blah'. But he saw no alternative cure for an economy ruined first by Kwame Nkrumah's autocratic socialism and then hit by the slump in cocoa prices. A combination of devaluations, trade liberalisation, reductions in the budget deficit and cuts in the overstaffed civil service has brought results. When he went to the polls last month, he could boast an average real growth rate of 5 per cent a year and an inflation rate down from 123 per cent in 1983 to less than 20 per cent. However, Ghana has yet to show that it can maintain growth without the substantial external assistance - more than Dollars 5bn - it has received since 1983. President Rawlings's toughest test may be yet to come: when aid falls, will the era of growth come to an end? In Latin America, some of the bloom came off the continent's better known recent success stories this year. The leader who made most waves and came out, surprisingly, in a strengthened position, was Peru's President Alberto Fujimori, who wins the special award for Most Effective Japanese Leader of 1992. Fujimori's success was relative; after the disasters that have afflicted Peru in recent years, 1992 could hardly have been worse. None of the country's problems has gone away, and the economy is again in recession. The president's behaviour - in suspending the constitution and congress in April (his autogolpe or self-coup) - was also highly controversial. Nevertheless, by the end of the year he had manoeuvred himself into a much more favourable position than at the start. He has regained international financial support for his economic programme. This involved some backtracking and the holding of elections, but he was left with a significantly more pliable Congress. His security forces also dealt a savage blow to Sendero Luminoso, the fanatical left-wing guerrilla group which has been posing a growing threat to the Peruvian state, by capturing its mysterious leader, Abimael Guzman, and parading him - balding, with middle-aged spread - on television. The unlikeliest achievement of all in 1992 has to be that of the Kurds of northern Iraq. Against all the odds, they have remained free and united, in spite of being victims both of Saddam Hussein's regime and of the UN sanctions against it, as well as intermittent blockade by Iran, attacks by fellow Kurds from Turkey, and invasion by Turkish government forces. In May they elected their own parliament, and they have begun to rebuild their homes, farms and factories under their own autonomous administration. Much of the credit for all this is due to their two leaders, Massoud Barzani and Jalal Talabani, who have overcome decades of rivalry to forge an effective partnership, symbolised by this year's elections. The result, certified free and fair by Britain's Electoral Reform Society, was a dead heat. Each man's party won 50 parliamentary seats, and in the presidential contest neither won an overall majority. Anywhere else in the third world this would surely have led to fighting. Instead, the two leaders formed a coalition and have indefinitely postponed the run-off ballot which should have decided between them. They have shown statesmanship, too, in ruling out both independence (which most of their supporters want) and any new talks with Saddam. Instead they used their enhanced credibility to unite the Iraqi opposition on a democratic platform with western backing. Hardest of all, they have been prepared to fight Turkey's Kurdish separatists (PKK) in order to keep the vital support of the Turkish government - a policy which paid off in November when the PKK agreed to stop sabotaging their supplies and to move its forces away from the Turkish border. In some places, mere survival is achievement enough to warrant a Plastic Spoon Prize.

			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Test-tube research that breeds blockbuster success - Daniel Green on speculation and sensitivity surrounding drug companies' share prices YESTERDAY'S gyrations in the share prices of SmithKline Beecham, Glaxo and Wellcome reflect the drug companies' sensitivity to both the US regulators and the news flowing from research laboratories. Many years of testing pass between the discovery of a chemical and its approval by health authorities. During this time, rumours of technical breakthroughs, trial results and regulatory decisions make the sector a speculators' paradise. Although the industry is fragmented - even the biggest player, Merck of the US, has a market share of less than 5 per cent - the secret of success does not lie in world domination. Over the past decade, some of the most spectacular performers have conquered niches. Glaxo and Wellcome became winners by creating one, or perhaps two, blockbuster drugs, products which usually combine a large potential market with a technical breakthrough. 'We define a blockbuster drug as one with sales of at least Dollars 500m a year,' says Mr Jonathan de Pass of BZW. 'In 1990 there were 24, in such areas as ulcers, asthma, herpes and cholesterol control.' Blockbuster drugs dominate the huge US market. If US doctors do not prescribe the most effective drug available, even if it is only a little better than its rivals, they face the possibility of legal action from patients who do not return to complete health. Glaxo, the UK's biggest drug company, is the classic example. Its fortunes have been built on the Zantac ulcer treatment. Zantac and its nearest rival Tagamet, made by SmithKline Beecham, work in similar ways. 'The difference between them is small, but enough to incline many doctors to pick Zantac,' says Mr de Pass. Wellcome's Zovirax is a more extreme example. It is so much better than its rivals that it has more than 80 per cent of the herpes virus treatment market, according to Wellcome. Glaxo raked in Pounds 1.6bn from Zantac sales in the last financial year - almost half its total sales. Zovirax sales climbed 26 per cent to Pounds 471m. But companies which depend on single blockbuster drugs are more vulnerable than their diversified rivals to new competitors. Any blockbuster can be toppled by a newcomer. This happened with Tagamet, knocked off its best-selling perch by Zantac. And now Zantac is threatened. 'Glaxo shares have been occasionally unsettled in recent months by Losec, a new ulcer drug from Swedish company Astra,' says Mr Robin Gilbert of James Capel. A drug can be forced off the market quickly by health regulators. The US Food and Drug Administration banned two Fisons drugs a year ago after what it saw as shortcomings on the manufacturing side. Their absence from the market has cost Fisons Pounds 65m. For many companies, such uncertainty would be unsettling. The prospect of rapid changes in fortune might be expected to deter investors from the shares. Yet the p/e ratio of the health and household sector is more than 24, compared with a market average of about 14. Wellcome was the best performing Footsie stock during 1991, the shares rising 151 per cent. Glaxo was the top Footsie stock over the last two years, the shares more than doubling in value. One reason for such investor demand is that drug sales hold up during recessions. 'This security is combined with the potential for high growth and high profit margins, which is particularly appreciated at a time of disruption elsewhere,' says Mr Gilbert. Even the decline of an obsolescent drug can be slowed with heavy marketing, price cuts and the launch of non-prescription versions. The future performance of a drug company can be gauged by an examination of the drugs under test. Analysts and investors keep a close eye on a drug from its invention in a test-tube, through several stages of trials with animals and then humans, to approval by the FDA and other national health authorities, such as the Committee on the Safety of Medicines in the UK. A drug's potential hangs in the balance for many years. The behaviour of drug company's shares seems likely, if anything, to become more excitable over the medium term. Governments are keen to cut the cost of healthcare and want to reduce drug prices. Proposed European Community price rules should do that. They leave relatively free, however, the pricing of new treatments. This will put an even higher value on the peerless blockbuster. It should ensure many more years of scanning the research journals for anyone with more than a passing interest in the pharmaceutical industry.</p>

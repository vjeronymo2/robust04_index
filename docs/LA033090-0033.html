			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Two teen-agers were shot late Wednesday, the third straight night young people  have been hurt in suspected gang-related shootings, police reported.  </P> <P> The latest incident occurred about 10 p.m. when Richard Mendez, 19, and an  unidentified 15-year-old companion were wounded as they walked from a store in  the 4600 block of Wightman Street in East San Diego.  </P> <P> The two youths were followed by a car. When the car stopped, the two teen-agers  tried to run into an alley, said Lt. George Saldamando of the Police  Department's gang unit.  </P> <P> Saldamando said several people were in the car, and one of them fired a shotgun  loaded with birdshot.  </P> <P> Mendez was hit in the arm, and was treated at Hillside Hospital and released.  The 15-year-old was hit in the chest and was taken to Mercy Hospital, where he  was listed in serious but stable condition Thursday.  </P> <P> Although it was the third successive night of violence, Saldamando said the  incidents are not related.  </P> <P> Those in the car, Saldamando said, may be members of an Asian-American gang.  The shootings may be the result of an influx of Asian-Americans in what is a  predominantly Latino community. Different gangs are now "beginning to run in  the same area and are now bumping heads," Saldamando said.  </P> <P> He added that police have a "good, solid lead" on the identity of the shooter.  </P></p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: European traders' panic subsides EUROPEAN government bond markets recovered yesterday from the panic that shook them at the start of the week. However, volatility persisted in some quarters. Longer-dated UK gilts bounced back by a quarter of a point as sterling stabilised on the foreign exchange markets. Although the currency remains firmly at the bottom of the Exchange Rate Mechanism, some observers were already predicting with relief the end of devaluation fears. The long gilt future on Liffe edged up from 98.15 to close at around 98.22, near its high of the day. Gains among shorter-dated gilts were meagre, reflecting continued pressure in the money markets pending the latest money supply data from Germany. THE Italian government bond market experienced another highly volatile day, although bond prices managed to end the day firmer. The market opened firmly, continuing the trend from Monday afternoon, as traders continued to buy to cover short positions taken on the market. But prices soon slipped. 'Once the shorts had been covered, there was really nothing to support the market,' one trader said. The BTP futures contract on Liffe, which had opened at 93.00, fell sharply to 92.15. Later in the day though, a stronger lira helped the market recover its equanimity, pushing the futures contract back up by almost a full point, to 93.06, by the close. With the sell-off by foreign investors since the Danish rejection of Maastricht now largely thought to be over, traders expect considerable wariness before international investors return to the Italian market. GERMAN bond prices settled into a tight trading range as the market looked forward to a batch of economic data for a clue as to the Bundesbank's next move on interest rates. Most expect M3 growth for June, due this week, to come in at about 3 percentage points above the ceiling on the Bundesbank's target range, set at 5.5 per cent. The latest consumer prices figures, the first of which are due at the end of the week, are also expected to show some improvement - though, again, they will remain outside the Bundesbank's target. After a June rise of 4.3 per cent, consumer prices are expected to show a rise of between 3.4 and 3.7 per cent. Ahead of these numbers, the market remained quiet, with the bund futures contract edging up from 87.13 to 87.17. US Treasury prices were little changed at the long end and slightly easier at the short end after the Federal Reserve chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, gave little away in his testimony to Congress. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/32 at 103 31/32 , yielding 7.652 per cent, and the two-year note was down 1/32 at 101 5/16 , yielding 4.269 per cent. The short end eased slightly because some investors thought Mr Greenspan's comments in his Humphrey-Hawkins report indicated that the Fed would not ease monetary policy again in the current business cycle.</p>

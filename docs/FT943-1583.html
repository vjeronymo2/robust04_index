			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Sceptical Sir, I fear your leader, 'Well done, Mr Clarke' (September 17), gives too much credence to the harsh judgment of the financial markets over the UK's inflation prospects. You omit any acknowledgement that the reduction in inflation since sterling's abrupt departure from the ERM was achieved despite highly unfavourable circumstances. During that two-year period sterling has declined by 15 per cent on a trade-weighted basis, while commodity prices have risen by more than a third. In view of the scale of these external inflationary shocks that have been successfully absorbed by UK industry, I am sceptical of your comment that the recent mild upturn in inflation indicates an absence of excess capacity.

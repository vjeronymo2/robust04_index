			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Universal training credit is considered THE INTRODUCTION of a universal credit or entitlement to either vocational training or academic study for post-16-year-olds is being investigated by the government, Lisa Wood writes. Credits would introduce the marketplace into schools and further education. Critics of the present system argue that the vocational training system pays by outcome, such as the attainment of qualifications, in contrast to funding for both schools and further education colleges. A universal credit would extend arrangements now being offered to a number of young people on Youth Training, the government's main training scheme for young people. Individuals are given a credit with which they can choose to purchase training with an employer. By 1996 all young people going on to YT will have such an entitlement. The government believes that the credit empowers the individual and encourages him or her to take greater responsibility for their training. The Confederation of British Industry, which will be taking part in the government's consultation exercise on the universal credit, is a strong advocate of such a move. The review will also consider whether the state is getting value for money with increased staying-on rates at school and how best young people can be guided to taking the route most appropriate to them -  be it academic or vocational. Staying on rates at school have increased significently in recent years but non-completion rates of both training programmes and academic courses are high.</p>

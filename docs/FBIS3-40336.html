			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Fullerenes continue to generate a lot of interest.  After forming a quasi-crystal cylinder, now carbon 60 has given  birth to a polymer capable of scratching diamond, currently the  hardest known material. By placing a pinch of carbon 60 powder  between two diamond dies and twisting them, a noncrystalline,  semitransparent derivative is obtained that is not diamond but  which probably marks the beginning of a new class of ultrahard  materials. The result of joint French-Russian work (French  chemists from Orsay, Tours, and the ENS [teacher training  school] working with Russian researchers from the Vereshchagin  [name as published] Institute), this compound could have  industrial applications in the manufacture of tools for oil well  drilling and diamond working. It must, however, be possible to  obtain sufficient quantities of the substance.</p>

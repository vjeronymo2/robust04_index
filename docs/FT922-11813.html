			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / BBC probe condemns current affairs CURRENT affairs programmes on the BBC have been condemned as inappropriate, flat and dull in a document submitted to the corporation's governors and top management by an internal task force. An appendix to its report on the BBC as an information provider says overlapping specialist programmes have prevented the corporation from explaining fully central issues such as the future of the National Health Service or European monetary union. The task force is one of 15 looking at every aspect of the BBC's future in advance of renegotiation of its Royal Charter, which will run out at the end of 1996. The report, BBC Current Affairs Television - A Strategy for the Nineties, criticises the division of current affairs into four specialist areas - politics, foreign affairs, social affairs and business and economics. In reality, the anonymous author argues, issues overlap. Overall, the task force believes the BBC does not provide appropriate current-affairs coverage to fulfil its role as national broadcaster. 'Resources are devoted to addressing what is assumed to be an interested minority, and the BBC's duty to speak to everyone comes second,' says the report. The craft standards of the programmes are said to be high 'but their perspective is narrow'. The report adds: 'So, the overall effect, as many witnesses have remarked, is dull and flat.' It also says that the convergence of specialist programmes has undermined Panorama, the BBC's current-affairs flagship, and that Panorama's distinctiveness is being irreparably reduced. The comments are broadly supported by other members of the task force, which is chaired by Ms Glynwyn Benson, the new editor of Panorama. The comments implicitly criticise the policies of Mr John Birt, the BBC deputy director-general and director-general-elect, who was responsible for setting up the new specialist programmes. The report calls for a current affairs portfolio to include: A primary role for Panorama in explaining the main issues. A popular early evening issues show dealing with everything from sexual harassment to dangerous dogs. A more topical Question Time with relevant politicians. Time Bomb, a new BBC2 programme to reveal the 'clouds on the horizon we all need to know about'. Only if there was money left over would there be a specialist secondary current affairs portfolio, which would include programmes such as BBC2's The Money Programme and in-depth political interviews.

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Tecs urge 'value for money' audits Employer-led Training and Enterprise Councils have called for the Audit Commission to conduct 'value for money' studies into them, in a move to fend off criticisms that they have wasted Pounds 250m a year of public funds. Tecs, which are responsible for administering government programmes worth more than Pounds 2bn a year, are routinely audited by the National Audit Office. Two leading Tec chief executives, Mr Richard Guy and Mr John Howells, recommend much wider studies into Tecs by the Audit Commission in a report published today by the Policy Studies Institute. The recommendations form part of their defence against criticism in a recent study by Professor Robert Bennett of the London School of Economics, which said that Tecs had failed to make efficiency savings worth Pounds 255m a year and that only a handful of Tecs had radically reformed their structure and operations. Mr Guy and Mr Howells, chief executives of South and East Cheshire Tec and Teesside Tec respectively, accept some of Prof Bennett's more general comments about Tecs but say that his financial claims 'do not stand up', and that the calculations rest 'on a succession of unsound comparisons'. They say, however, that the Audit Commission has the resources, the experience and expertise to apply consultancy-based methods as well as carrying out normal financial audit. They say: 'Tecs would benefit from the sort of cost-cutting studies which the commission has carried out across local government and the health service.' Policy Studies, Policy Studies Institute.

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Howard revises police proposals The government yesterday made significant changes to part of its flagship law-and-order legislation, bowing to criticism that its proposals would centralise control over the police and courts. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, abandoned plans in the police and magistrates courts bill to have the people who chair police authorities appointed by him, and agreed to introduce greater local flexibility in determining the size of authorities. Further concessions came from Lord Mackay, Lord Chancellor. He said amendments to proposals, which have been described by Lord Taylor, Lord Chief Justice, as threatening the judicial independence of justices' clerks, would underline the government's commitment to independent, locally managed courts. Chairs of local magistrates' courts committees will continue to be appointed by the committee without needing the Lord Chancellor's approval. Terms of employment for justices' clerks will be left to local discretion - meaning that Lord Mackay will have no power to impose fixed-term contracts or performance-related pay - and many renewals of clerks' appointments will not need Lord Mackay's approval. The changes could be seen as an embarrassing reverse as the government tries to demonstrate a firm grip on law-and-order issues. Ministers put a brave face on the announcement, which was described by Downing Street as 'certainly not a climb-down or a U-turn'. The need for changes became apparent when the bill was savaged by senior Tories in the Lords last month. Lord Whitelaw, the former deputy prime minister, who led the opposition from Conservative peers, said the bill would now have his 'full support', virtually guaranteeing that it will pass through the Lords without further significant changes. However police staff associations remain opposed to proposed reductions in the proportion of local authority representatives on police authorities. The associations also oppose plans to set national objectives for police forces and powers to amalgamate forces without public inquiries. The local authority associations said that unless police authorities contained a significant majority of democratically elected representatives they would become unaccountable quangos. Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said the announcement was 'a humiliating retreat' which left the bill with 'no consistent rationale'.</p>

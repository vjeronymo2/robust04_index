Surveys, studies, or research which provide specific information or data necessary for the NRC to exercise its regulatory or research mission responsibilities will not be funded by a grant. Applicants requesting support for work which has a direct regulatory application should submit their requests as an unsolicited proposal for consideration as a contract rather than a grant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The primary purpose of NRC grants is to support the development of knowledge or understanding of the subject or phenomena under study. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The exact course of the work and its outcome are usually not defined precisely, and specific points in time for achievement of significant results need not be specified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The NRC desires that the nature of the proposed investigation be such that the recipient will bear prime responsibility for the conduct of the research and exercise judgment and original thought toward attaining the scientific goals within broad parameters of the proposed research areas and the resources provided. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Meaningful technical reports (as distinguished from Semi-Annual Status Reports) can be prepared only as new findings are made, rather than on a predetermined time schedule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Simplicity and economy in execution and administration are mutually desirable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposal Format <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposals should be concise and provide a thorough understanding of the proposed project.

Nonprofit organizations, universities, and professional societies shall submit proposals utilizing the standard forms stipulated in OMB Circular A-110, (Attachment M). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The format used for project proposals should give a clear presentation of the proposed project and its relation to the specific objectives contained in this notice.

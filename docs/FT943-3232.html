			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Ministers warned on mortgage help The government was yesterday warned not to cut mortgage-interest subsidies to people on benefits before the private sector can provide alternative cover. Amid signs that ministers plan to reduce mortgage interest relief in the Budget, the social security advisory committee, which advises the government on the welfare state, said people with big mortgages were already being forced to take out insurance to cover interest payments. It noted that the government had recently lowered the upper limit for a mortgage on which it would pay interest relief to Pounds 125,000. But it warned that the availability of insurance cover was 'variable' and that further cuts would bring hardship to unemployed homeowners. The committee said that insurance groups could be encouraged to look at mortgage-interest cover in a number of ways. It said: 'One possible solution might be for the mortgage lenders to adopt a pooled-risk approach to unemployment and insure themselves against an individual being unable to pay them.' This would spread the risk evenly and ensure that no company was heavily penalised. It also called on the government to signal any intention to cut mortgage relief well in advance. This would encourage homeowners and insurance companies to make decisions on replacing state provision. State Benefits and Private Provision. Social Security Advisory Committee.

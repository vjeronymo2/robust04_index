Varma] </F>   [Text] The second coming of boomlike conditions on major  bourses is structurally different from the heady pre-securities  scandal days.    One significant difference is the low level of participation  by the common investor in the ongoing bull phase. Unlike during  the Harshad Mehta heydays, the common investor stands dazed by  the upswing in stockmarket indices while he finds himself cash  strapped.    During the pre-scandal period when the stockmarket was  reaching dizzy heights, the favourite topic among office  employees and even among housewives at kitty parties was how to  reap the highest returns in the shortest timespan. This time,  though the upward trend in markets and the scope for making fast  bucks is being spoken about, a certain weariness and confusion  can be detected.    Justifiably so. Because when the bull operators led by Mr  Mehta raided the stockmarkets, they were also pulling a  substantial section of the middle class into the whirlpool of  stockmarket operations. After the bust, thousands lost their  money saved for their children's marriages or careers and  post-retirement benefits.    Mr T.J. Jacob, a deputy commandant with the Special  Protection Group, says, "I preferred buying shares to building a  house. And I lost heavily." This is just one example.    After 18 months of lull, mainly because of the uncertainty  that loomed over stockmarket operations, the market began to  show signs of recovery in late October last year. It is  interesting that even though foreign institutional investors  were allowed entry into the stockmarket as early as in the first  half of 1992, all of them preferred to watch the developments.    A group manager in the merchant banking division of ANZ  Grindlays Bank said that the ongoing boom has its roots  elsewhere. "A reason for the non-involvement of the common  investor is Securities and Exchange Board of India attempts to  institutionalise the stockmarket investment, as practised in the  developed countries," he said.    Prescribing the minimum limits for investors--Rs 5,000  [rupees] for equity and Rs 1,000 for mutual funds and other  fixed deposits--is proof of this. It insulates small and medium  investors against the volatility of stockmarket behaviour.    It would also lead to a more realistic individual income. As  per the new rules, a person applying for allotment of equities  is required to furnish his permanent bank account number which  can be traced by the income tax department if necessary. More  transparency would be brought into financial transactions.    This however would bar very small investors from entering  the  market. The only players in the stockmarket would be individuals  with high liquidity or financial institutions.    This situation brings the focus on financial institutions,  both Indian and foreign, as potential stockmarket players.  Considering the excess liquidity with banks, poor industrial  performance and not so encouraging credit offtake, domestic  financial institutions are unlikely to lead the bull rampage.    Consider this case. Industrial performance in 1991-92  registered a negative growth of 0.1 per cent. In the following  year though positive it was only 1.8 per cent. During the half  year period of this fiscal year, the growth was only 1.5 per  cent as against the projected 4 per cent. Mining and  manufacturing sectors are performing poorly this year.    Inflation, another vital parameter during this period, rose  to disheartening figures. From an alarming 13 per cent in  1991-92, it slid to 11 per cent in 1992-93 and is hovering  around 8.4 per cent. Capital intensive and infrastructural  industries have not yet picked up.    On the other hand, FIIs [foreing institutional investors]  which do not have to consider any obligations have the entire  stockmarket for a free run. That is what is happening. FIIs  waited a full year though they were registered in 1992. This  delay was necessitated by the need to gauge the prospects and  profitability of the Indian stocks. Moreover, by this time,  Indian corporates themselves had established their creditibility  overseas. The oversubscription of global depository receipts and  Euro bonds by a host of Indian companies is proof.    At a time the authenticity of the commitment to economic  liberalisation has been proved and Indian stocks are lying low,  the FIIs decide to enter the market. This then is boom time. For  foreign fund managers who operate on global dimensions, Indian  stocks seem the cheapest and the best.    It is also remarkable the recovery of Indian stocks began  when other Asian markets were down. Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur,  Bangkok and Seoul are at present undergoing a lull. In this  situation it is only logical for foreign funds to find their way  to Indian stockmarkets.    The gain of the national stock index shows that FIIs are  more  into cash scrips than forward trading. NSE [?National Stock  Exchange] gains have outstripped the rise in the Sensex, the  index for the Bombay Stock Index. Sensex has a narrower base  than the NSE, and forward deals influence its movements more  than they do in the case of the NSE.    These factors indicate the involvement of the common  investor  in the present boom is likely to be minimal. There is danger in  the FII funds generated boom. When the FIIs decide to book  profits, stock markets may be forced to make a crash landing.  Then, the fact the boom is not backed up by strong economic  fundamentals will become clear, and alarmingly so.</p>

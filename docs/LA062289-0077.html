			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHAMBER REPAYS HOLLYWOOD SIGN FUND $46,500  </P> <P> The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce has restored $46,529 to a trust fund set up  to maintain the landmark Hollywood sign, acknowledging that the money was used  improperly to cover the chamber's own operating expenses.  </P> <P> "What happened should not have happened, and by taking this action we hope to  wipe the slate clean," said Larry Kaplan, the chamber's president and chief  executive officer.  </P> <P> However, Kaplan said the chamber's executive board had not decided whether to  repay an estimated $45,000 in interest forfeited by the Hollywood Sign Trust  during the 10 years that money from the trust was on loan to the chamber.  </P> <P> "That's something we're having our lawyers and accountants look into, and we  don't expect to reach a final decision on that for another couple of weeks," he  said.  </P> <P> Although he said the chamber borrowed $53,158 from the trust fund in 1979 and  1981, Kaplan said the $46,529 repayment, made last Friday, "reflects the fact  that the trust also owed the chamber some money."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, community activists critical of the chamber's handling of the  transaction called for the interest to be repaid immediately, and said they  intend to ask the state attorney general's office to conduct an audit of the  chamber's finances.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'I Find It Unbelievable'  </P> <P> "I was shocked to read they had used the money from the trust for their own  purposes, and I find it unbelievable that they would now hesitate to repay the  interest," said Ed Cohan, a lawyer representing three homeowner groups at odds  with the chamber over the sign. "I'd like to know who else can borrow money  interest-free."  </P> <P> Last month, The Times disclosed that of $122,166 in assets reported by chamber  officials last year as belonging to the trust fund, $53,158 had been on loan to  the chamber for at least five years.  </P> <P> The famous sign atop Mt. Lee in Griffith Park is under the jurisdiction of the  Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks. But by agreement with the city,  the chamber has been responsible for its upkeep since 1978, after raising  nearly $300,000 to save it from demolition.  </P> <P> The trust fund was established in 1978 as part of the fund-raising effort.  About $214,000 of the almost $300,000 placed in the fund was spent that year to  rebuild the sign. The rest was to be held in the trust fund to maintain the  sign.  </P> <P> Under terms of the trust's tax-exempt status, chamber officials agreed that the  funds were to be used exclusively for the maintenance of the sign, and that the  trust was "not to be affiliated with or controlled by the Hollywood Chamber of  Commerce or any other organization."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fees Outstrip Expenditures  </P> <P> However, federal and state records showed that as of the most recent filing  period, ending last June, the trust had spent only about $600 for maintenance  of the sign since the fund was created, and more than $3,300 on bank and  accounting fees.  </P> <P> In the wake of the latest developments, a Recreation and Parks official said  this week his agency may want to "take another look" at its informal  arrangement with the chamber over the sign's management.  </P> <P> "From what's happened, I think a better form of documentation is needed," said  Assistant General Manager Sheldon Jensen.  </P> <P> "What we have now should probably be replaced with a binding agreement that  clearly spells out what our responsibilities are, what theirs are, where the  revenues come from, where they go and who authorizes them, those kinds of  things," he said.  </P> <P> A source close to the chamber's executive board told The Times last month that  the money borrowed by the chamber was used to cover the chamber's operating  expenses.  </P> <P> In an interview this week, the chamber's Kaplan confirmed that the money had  been used for that purpose.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Lean Times' Blamed  </P> <P> "This is a dynamic, growing organization, but it hasn't always been that way.  There have been some lean times, and the money was apparently used to get the  chamber through some of those lean times," he said.  </P> <P> Saying he was "not going to apologize for things that happened in the past,"  Kaplan -- a former chief of staff to City Councilman Michael Woo who replaced  Bill Welsh as head of the chamber last month -- insisted there was "nothing  sinister" about the transactions.  </P> <P> "It's not a question of malfeasance on anyone's part. It's more a case of  admittedly, to some extent, sloppy practices," he said.  </P> <P> Although federal tax records indicated that the trust fund loaned $53,158 to  the chamber in 1984, an accountant for the chamber said that the money was  actually borrowed in two increments several years earlier.  </P> <P> Accountant Randy Weaver said the chamber borrowed more than $38,000 from the  fund in 1979, and another $15,000 in 1981. Weaver said the terms of the first  loan were unclear, but that the chamber agreed to pay the trust fund 10%  interest on the 1981 loan.  </P> <P> Although Kaplan said the interest on both loans amounts to "more than $45,000,"  the chairman of the chamber's executive board, Don Tillman, said he was unsure  about the amount and that officials were "investigating as to what the interest  rate is going to be."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Commitment  </P> <P> But both men were careful to say that the chamber had not committed itself to  repaying interest, regardless of the amount.  </P> <P> Critics, who have for months pressed the chamber to disclose its financial  dealings involving the sign, quickly expressed displeasure over the matter.  </P> <P> "It doesn't make the chamber look very good," said Bob Higgins, vice president  of the Whitley Heights Assn. "They've been caught with their hand in the piggy  bank and they're sort of saying, like a child, 'I didn't mean to and I'll put  the money back.' But in the meantime they've profited enormously off that  money."  </P> <P> Christine O'Brien, president of Hollywoodland Homeowners Assn., said she plans  to ask the state to conduct an audit of the chamber's finances "so that maybe,  finally, we can get some straight answers. We've had nothing but resistance in  our efforts to find out about (the sign's finances)."  </P> <P> Her group and two others have joined with communities in 11 states to oppose  the chamber's bid before the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office to gain  exclusive use of the word Hollywood for commercial purposes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Built in 1920  </P> <P> The sign, built in the 1920s, originally spelled out "Hollywoodland," the name  of the real estate subdivision it was built to promote. Originally illuminated  by 4,000 20-watt bulbs, the often-vandalized sign has long been a sore spot  with residents in the nearby Hollywood Hills.  </P> <P> For years, they have complained of their neighborhoods being under assault from  trespassers, loiterers and vandals drawn to the sign.  </P> <P> Residents were upset last year after the chamber announced a proposal to  permanently light the sign with the help of a solar energy company. The  proposal was dropped after widespread public opposition.  </P> <P> "I think a lot of the ill-wind being generated toward the chamber and its  handling of the trust fund stems from past disagreement over the sign, no  question about it," Kaplan said. "I want to put all that behind us and look to  the future."  </P></p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Unita likely to reject 'unity' offer The Angolan government last night announced a national unity administration offering minor portfolios to Unita, but diplomats said the rebel guerrilla group would probably reject the offer, Reuter reports from Luanda. The announcement came as fighting abated in northern Angola, where Unita forces launched an offensive, but the country remains close to full resumption of civil war. Unita, backed by the US and South Africa in its 1975-91 war against the MPLA government, has captured three provincial capitals since its defeat in UN-supervised elections in September. It now occupies 75 per cent of the country.</p>

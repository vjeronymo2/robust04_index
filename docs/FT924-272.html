			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / British banks bullish about US expansion: transatlantic opportunities for growth THE happiest face in the line of directors trying to explain this month why Royal Bank of Scotland had made a pre-tax profit of only Pounds 20.9m was American. Mr Larry Fish, chief executive of the bank's New England subsidiary, had two reasons to be cheerful. Not only had Citizens Bank contributed Pounds 19.7m to profits, but alone among Royal Bank's banking operations, it envisages rapid growth. Over the next three years, Mr Fish wants to double Citizens' current assets of Dollars 4.4bn (Pounds 2.9bn) by buying banks in Massachusetts and Connecticut. He plans to expand the Rhode Island bank's Dollars 350m capital through issues of subordinated debt. 'We are not going to let our mouth get ahead of our tummy and buy something in Ohio. We are going to expand sensibly and contiguously,' says Mr Fish. Mr Fish is not the only director of a British clearing bank to be talking about expansion in the US. Mr John Tugwell, chairman of National Westminster Bank's Dollars 22bn subsidiary in New York, is also bullish. 'We have got to do something to increase our size, because I would say we are not really big enough to give our parent company a steady level of return,' he says. Such talk marks a turning point in how British banks regard their US operations. After enduring losses in the late 1980s, and debating how quickly they could sell, the mood has changed. As they struggle with bad debt at home, US operations are becoming an attractive source of income. But the banks are choosing different strategies for the US, based partly on what they own there, and partly on their global aims. Some analysts think the US market is a logical place for the banks to expand, given their difficulties with domestic loan provisions and recession. 'In the long term, the US economy may well do better than the British one, and if you are National Westminster you are not going to increase your market share at home very much,' says Mr Ray Soifer, a bank analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. The market also presents opportunities for growth because of the supply of small banks needing rescue. The fragmented industry - there are some 14,000 banks - is consolidating as large US banks merge and absorb smaller ones. But this also means that British banks which want to remain in US retail banking may have little choice but to expand. The expansionist mood is nonetheless odd given the history of clearing banks in the US. Starting with Midland Bank's ill-fated purchase of the California-based Crocker National Bank in 1980, they have poured huge amounts into largely unsuccessful attempts to run US branch networks. NatWest lost Dollars 845m on its US business between 1989 and last year, mainly through bad debt provisions. Aside from this murky history, there are doubts about whether British banks are ever likely to be significantly better at running branch networks in the US. 'It has to be a universal truism that retail banks operating in a market other than their domestic one fail. They simply do not have the local market knowledge to assess risk properly,' says Mr Nick Collier, a bank analyst at Morgan Stanley in London. Barclays accepted that view after making a loss of Pounds 217m on its US operations last year. It is selling its New York retail bank and will instead offer corporate lending and investment banking services. 'Retail banking is capital intensive, and successes outside home markets are few,' says Mr Richard Webb, deputy chief executive of Barclays in the US. The bank sees this less ambitious strategy as cost-effective. Yet other banks are trying to disprove conventional wisdom. NatWest's strategy is partly forced on it by the need to make its US operations worth more if it chooses to sell. NatWest Bancorp is expected to make more than Dollars 130m this year, and its post-tax profits will be boosted for the next three years by a tax loss carry-forward of Dollars 700m. But Mr Tugwell thinks it needs to grow to maintain earnings. He says the consolidation of the US banking industry means it must expand even to maintain its current standing. This may mean growing to some Dollars 40bn in assets and only then does he believe it would be sensible to consider selling. Yet it is clear that he would put forward a strong argument for keeping the US base. Mr Fish thinks Citizens should also double in asset size, although from a much smaller base. Citizens has grown nearly as much as it can in Rhode Island: 60 per cent of the state's households have some link with the bank. 'This is a wonderful banking franchise, but it is pretty much capped, and the economy is not too vibrant,' he says. Instead, he wants acquisitions in the bordering states. The question with expansion is whether the banks will get into the same trouble as they did in the past. Talk of rapid growth marks a new phase for Citizens, which Mr Fish says has gained in asset quality from being 'a very, very conservative institution'. He is careful to play down any suggestion of careless expansion. 'We are not going to go around putting bad loans on our books,' he insists. This cautiously expansive mood is even shared by a bank which has slimmed US oper-ations over the past three years, Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. HSBC's Marine Midland subsidiary has dropped in asset size from Dollars 26bn to Dollars 16.5bn as managers from HSBC pushed it back toward being a regional bank based in upstate New York, cutting activities into which it diversified in the late 1980s. Mr John Bond, Marine Midland chief executive, says the bank suffered from diversifying into 'exotic things' such as wholesale lending and leasing. Mr Bond has been devoting effort to reforms such as reducing the bank's cost-income ratio and improving service. Yet he does not dismiss the notion of Marine Midland growing by consolidating its branch network in New York state. 'I would like to be more profitable, and market dominance gives you economies of scale,' says Mr Bond, who will become HSBC's London-based chief executive next month. He is likely to watch any growth closely from London after HSBC's last brush with giving local managers their head. This was partly caused by a regulatory deal which barred HSBC from exercising control for five years after buying a stake in 1978. The past has also affected NatWest's view. 'We had local management and it got us into trouble. We did not have the right level of control from London,' says Mr Tugwell. The Royal Bank is unusual in having retained a US management team at Citizens throughout. Yet the exertion of more control from the UK means that if any new growth goes wrong, most British banks will have only themselves to blame.</p>

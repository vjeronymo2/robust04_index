			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Gu Ping (0657 1627): "Debtor Countries Should </F> Be Respected"]    [Text] The 27th annual meeting of the board of directors  of the Asian Development Bank [ADB] which ended on 5 May in  Nice, France, was an important meeting to jointly negotiate  plans for Asia's development. It was attended by  representatives of 55 countries and regions, including China.    Achieving the fourth general capital increase was an  important achievement made at the meeting. At the close of the  meeting, new ADB President Teruo Sato announced that the meeting  already had enough votes to guarantee the doubling of the ADB's  current $24- billion capital to $48 billion. This was the  result of the Asia- Pacific region's relative political  stability and economic vibrancy, and of the confidence of  international capital in the region. The decision conforms to  the aspirations of the vast numbers of developing countries in  the Asia-Pacific region and is also in the interests of the  creditor countries. Therefore it is generally welcomed.    Nonetheless, when discussing the question of the general  capital increase during the meeting, some creditor countries  linked the question of capital increase with some policy  conditions, thus adding political conditions to the capital  increase. The U.S. representative once remarked that "good  management" was a key part of the ADB's credit terms. Asked  what "good management" meant, he spoke only evasively, but did  not give a direct reply.    The vast numbers of developing Asian countries showed  concern  and objected to this U.S. advocacy, pointing out justly that  when increasing capital on the past three occasions, the ADB has  never linked a capital increase with political considerations,  and that the ADB therefore should continue to observe these  rules. The Chinese representative solemnly pointed out: China  supports the ADB's capital increase, but disagrees with linking  policy questions with the capital increase. Moreover, it  proposes that the ADB should place economic growth in the first  place when formulating its credit policy. The practice of some  who stubbornly link impertinent matters together will not work  under the common struggle of developing Asian countries.  However, this once again reminds us that attempts to intervene  in the internal affairs of other countries using economic and  other issues are worth guarding against.    It goes without saying that only the developing countries  themselves best understand their national conditions and the  importance and urgency of loan items. Over the years, the ADB  has made unremitting efforts to improve and upgrade the quality  of loan items, and the majority of creditor countries have put  forward many rational proposals on loans and have helped improve  the quality of loan items. This is welcomed by vast numbers of  developing countries. In the ADB's future cooperation, creditor  countries should continue to respect debtor countries, rather  than do anything contrary to this. If so, the developed and  developing countries can cooperate much better in the ADB, which  is an important organization. Such cooperation is in the basic  interests of all parties.</p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> D.A.'S INQUIRY HAS MINIMAL IMPACT;  </P> <P> DESPITE CRITICISM, WRIGHT APPEARS IN STRONG POSITION FOR REELECTION  </P> <P> Despite the Ventura County district attorney's well-publicized criticism of  Assemblywoman Cathie Wright's actions involving traffic tickets that she and  her daughter received, the Simi Valley Republican appears to remain a  formidable candidate for reelection in 1990.  </P> <P> Asked Thursday whether she still planned to seek a sixth two-year term, Wright  replied, "Of course, why not?" as she left the Assembly floor.  </P> <P> Renowned as a determined political street fighter, Wright appears to be headed  for her first serious primary challenge since she won the seat in 1980.  Political professionals say she remains favored, despite any damage inflicted  by Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury's 97-page investigatory report.  </P> <P> "It's a safe Republican seat," said one prominent political consultant who  asked not to be identified. "It's extraordinarily difficult to defeat a  Republican in a primary. Most people don't like to contribute financially  against an incumbent."  </P> <P> It will be particularly time-consuming and costly for a challenger to become  known in Wright's heavily Republican 37th District, which extends from Lompoc  in Santa Barbara County through Simi Valley in Ventura County and to the Santa  Clarita and Antelope valleys in Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> Another possible handicap for challengers is Proposition 73, the campaign  reform act that limits contributions in state and local races to $1,000 from  individuals and $2,500 from political action committees each fiscal year.  Incumbents start with a broader base of special interest contributors who can  give them $2,500 annually, and they have already been raising money during the  present fiscal year, which ends June 30.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Bradbury's probe has given opponents considerable ammunition. The  district attorney culminated a 10-week investigation by asserting that Wright  had "demonstrated a clear pattern of attempting to obtain special treatment for  herself and her daughter with the police, the courts and the Department of  Motor Vehicles" over a 10-year period but had committed "no clear-cut criminal  violation."  </P> <P> Victoria Wright, 24, who lives with her mother, has received 28 traffic  convictions since 1981. After Bradbury opened his inquiry in March, Victoria  Wright's license was revoked and she spent 20 days in the Ventura County Work  Furlough Program for violating probation with a traffic offense.  </P> <P> Cathie Wright, 59, responded this week by charging that Bradbury was  politically motivated and had misused public funds because his inquiry failed  to charge her with breaking any laws. She called the report shameful, but has  declined to discuss its accuracy or impact. She did not return a phone call  Friday seeking comment on these matters.  </P> <P> Both of Wright's potential Republican primary opponents said they were  encouraged by Bradbury's findings even though the district attorney did not  seek an indictment.  </P> <P> Bob Larkin, a Republican activist and businessman from Simi Valley who has  declared his candidacy, said: "It just reaffirms my resolve to run for the  office" and make ethics the cornerstone of his campaign. He vows to focus on  Wright's relationship with Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco).  </P> <P> </P> <P> Patronage Charged  </P> <P> "It starts with Willie Brown and the Legislature," said Larkin, 52. "He brought  patronage and the profit motive to California politics and with Cathie  associating herself so closely with him, I think it's rubbed off."  </P> <P> Wright's relationship with Brown has sparked controversy among Republicans in  the Assembly. She refused to join her GOP colleagues, abstaining when they  voted for another Democrat to replace Brown as speaker in December. A  subsequent Republican bid to punish her by removing her from the Assembly Rules  Committee failed when Brown and the Democrats refused to go along. The Speaker,  in turn, awarded Wright unusually choice committee assignments.  </P> <P> Brown also recommended an attorney to Wright to represent her daughter when she  faced a possible jail term for driving without a license last year. Then,  according to Bradbury's report, Brown called Ventura County Municipal Judge  Herbert Curtis III on March 28, 1988, from Washington, identified himself as a  close friend of Cathie Wright's and told Curtis that Victoria Wright did not  deserve to go to jail.  </P> <P> Brown blasted Bradbury as irresponsible for failing to take legal action but  then using the inquiry "as a tool for the purposes of condemning other people."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Decision Expected  </P> <P> Hunt Braly, 34, the longtime administrative assistant to state Sen. Ed Davis  (R-Valencia), said that as a result of Bradbury's report, "I am closer today to  running than ever before but have made no final decision." He said he expects  to do so within a month.  </P> <P> A contest between Wright and Braly "is going to be nasty," said a Davis  supporter, who predicted that Braly will run. "It's not going to be a pretty  sight."  </P> <P> Braly, an attorney who lives outside the district in Woodland Hills but is  buying a condominium in Valencia, said his campaign would have three major  issues.  </P> <P> "The No. 1 issue is the Willie Brown connection. You can't play bosom pals in  Sacramento and then come down to the district and say how bad he is. That's  hypocritical," Braly said.  </P> <P> "Point No. 2 is the ethics of the whole driving situation. Just because someone  isn't indicted does not mean they are cleared. There's no question there's  impropriety and there seems to be no sense with Cathie she did anything wrong."  </P> <P> The third point, he said, "is whether Cathie has been a true leader for the  district on transportation, school facility issues and park/open-space issues."  </P> <P> Asked whether he would support Braly if he runs, Davis said this week: "Should  I back Hunt, it would be perfectly logical in looking back at her threatening  to run against me. I will give her all the consideration she gave me."  </P> <P> For nearly a year, Wright openly considered challenging Davis in his 1988  primary, much to his consternation, before she decided not to run.  </P> <P> Staff Writer Mark Gladstone in Sacramento contributed to this story.  </P></p>

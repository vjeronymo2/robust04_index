			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / People: Leaving Forte Alan Hearn, group operations director of Forte, is to leave the hotel and restaurant group in September. Management restructuring meant that his role had become less relevant. Each of Forte's hotel brands now has its own head and the group felt there was less need for an overall operations director. Hearn, 52, had been with Forte for more than 20 years and was appointed to the board in 1988. Forte said yesterday that Hearn's decision to leave the company was not unexpected. He had helped to introduce the new management structure and was largely a victim of his own success.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In the Sarajevo area the aggressor violated the  cease-fire today with small arms fire and light artillery. He  fired from Nedzarici at Mojmilo and Dobrinja, from Brekin Potok  at Kosevo stadium and Jezero, and with an antiaircraft gun and  machine gun from (Orlovac) at the Kosevo stadium and Grdonj,  while an M-84 machine gun was firing indiscriminately from  Kromolj at Brekin Potok and Pionirska Dolina.    By the way, in the 100 days since the [NATO] ultimatum, the  Serb aggressor has violated the cease-fire exactly 1,375 times.  The consequence of this is 11 killed and 106 wounded members of  the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 1st Corps.    Today started on the Ilijas front with artillery attacks by  the chetniks. One tank and three howitzers from (Ubare) and  mortar batteries from Srednje fired at Korita and Jasen. Two  howitzers from (Medojevici), and a tank and howitzer from  (Nabozici) fired all day at Jasen and Meskovac. Infantry  attacks followed. On two occasions the chetniks attempted to  break through our defense lines at Jasen and (Polom), but  without any success. In these attacks the aggressor suffered  serious losses, with about 20 chetniks killed and a number of  others put out of action. Despite the serious losses the  chetniks did not abandon the attacks. They had attempted a  further three breakthroughs at Jasen by late afternoon, while  other parts of the front were exposed to artillery attacks.  These are still under way but with reduced intensity.    This has been a statement by the 1st Corps Information  Service.</p>

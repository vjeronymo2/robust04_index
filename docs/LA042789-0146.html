			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> FUND DRIVE BUILDS FOR WHEELCHAIR ATHLETES  </P> <P> Julie Alban says she has almost reached her goal of raising $10,000 in prize  money for the winners of the wheelchair division of the Long Beach Marathon.  </P> <P> "Wheelchair athletes are a model of courage and determination in the disabled  community and the able-bodied world," Alban wrote in a letter she recently sent  to 600 potential donors. "I would very much like to see greater equality in  these races for all of the athletes."  </P> <P> Alban, 23, has been in a wheelchair since last year when she was shot in the  back by her then-boyfriend, Bradley Ackerman, the stepson of Long Beach Press  Telegram Chairman Daniel H. Ridder. Ackerman, 24, was subsequently sentenced to  life imprisonment for the shooting.  </P> <P> Alban said she decided to raise money for the wheelchair athletes after  realizing that although organizers of the May 7 marathon had set aside $30,000  to be divided among the event's 10 able-bodied winners, no funds had been  earmarked for the winners in the wheelchair division.  </P> <P> As of early this week, she said, she had already received about $8,000 in  contributions. Donations, she said, may be sent to 1040 Elm Ave., Suite 100,  Long Beach, Calif. 90813.  </P></p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Portillo scorns EU 'fast lane': Minister boosts claim to lead Tory right by speaking out for market forces Mr Michael Portillo last night underlined his claim to the leadership of the Tory right with an abrupt dismissal of fears that Britain might be left in Europe's 'slow lane' and a call for tighter curbs on the welfare state. In the latest of a series of speeches this year which have set out his basic political philosophy, the chief secretary of the Treasury accused advocates of greater European integration of 'bamboozling' the electorate. He also warned of the dangers to individual freedom and to economic efficiency from the growth in the powers of European governments. Underlining his commitment to market forces, he said the role of governments was to create the conditions in which individual initiative was free to create prosperity. He added: 'It has recently been argued that the free market is a jungle to be tamed by governments. It is at least as plausible to argue that governments are a jungle to be tamed by the free market.' Mr Portillo told an audience in Barcelona during an official visit to Spain that arguments that Britain could not afford to miss the European 'bus' or must remain in the 'fast lane' had reached the height of absurdity. They suggested that 'speed is more important than direction, that being in a crowd is more important than heading for the right place'. But 'What if the bus is the wrong one? What if the fast lane leads to the wrong destination?' Setting out his agenda for the European Union, Mr Portillo said that the creation of the single market should be the prelude to ever-increasing global free trade. There would be no point in seeking the benefits of free trade in Europe if the Union then saddled itself with higher prices and outmoded industries by putting up barriers to other countries. He added that as Europe mapped out its future it was vital that supporters of limited government and of free trade made their voices heard. They also had to ensure that the regulations necessary to ensure a level playing field within the single market were kept to a minimum. Mr Portillo, whose speeches have sometimes angered Mr John Major, the prime minister, was careful to frame his remarks as being in tune with those of the prime minister. He twice quoted Mr Major to reinforce that impression. But the speech will be seen at Westminster as the latest attempt by the Euro-sceptic right of the Tory party to ensure that Mr Major continues to promote its agenda.</p>

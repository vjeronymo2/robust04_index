			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A FLASH ON ICE;  </P> <P> HOCKEY PLAYER HAS ALL THE RIGHT MOVES AT AGE 12; HE'S SO GOOD, IN FACT, THAT HE  MAY HAVE TO MOVE TO COLDER CLIME  </P> <P> They call him "Flash," this 12-year-old from Rancho Palos Verdes touted in  international hockey circles as the next Wayne Gretzky.  </P> <P> Richard Park's stick-handling and passing are so crisp that comparisons with  the Los Angeles Kings' superstar are inevitable. He is no match for boys his  age, and has dominated teen-agers four years older. Born in Korea and raised in  Southern California, Richard is excelling in a sport long-dominated by Eastern  and Canadian interests.  </P> <P> "At his age he does things on the ice that I guarantee not all the pros can  do," UCLA hockey Coach Jack White said.  </P> <P> A center/defenseman, Richard recently led the Los Angeles Junior Kings to the  California Pee Wee Division title in his first season. In one game he scored 10  goals. In tournaments in the United States and Canada last winter he was so  brilliant his picture appeared in International Hockey Weekly. His story has  been told in French, Korean and English newspapers.  </P> <P> "He's the best 12-year-old I've seen in a long time," Junior Kings Manager Nick  Racanelli said.  </P> <P> An amateur hockey club in Chicago is trying to persuade Richard's parents to  move him there.  </P> <P> "The kid's a gem," said Al Thomas, manager of the Chicago Young Americans, a  Triple-A amateur team composed of some of the best teen-age prospects from  America.  </P> <P> Richard is unique to hockey because of his heritage, size and the area in which  he lives. There has never been a Korean-born pro hockey player. Only two or  three Asians have ever played pro hockey, according to the National Hockey  League.  </P> <P> At 5-foot-8, Richard is large for his age. "People think Koreans are always  small, but that is just not true," said his sister, Christina, 20.  </P> <P> And in Southern California where the Park family lives, hockey ranks up there  in importance for most young people with homework and a new pair of snowshoes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Pure Hockey Sense'  </P> <P> "He has the pure hockey sense that you don't see very often in players from  Southern California," said Dave Kizanis, his local coach.  </P> <P> All the attention has been a little overwhelming for Richard. "Richard doesn't  like the attention, he's really shy," Christina said.  </P> <P> Richard's reputation precedes him. He was mobbed in Minnesota. In Quebec, young  girls asked for autographs. In Washington state, he was credited with boosting  attendance at a national tournament.  </P> <P> Consequently, "he's not a regular 12-year-old," Christina said. "He has had to  mature real fast."  </P> <P> Richard's mother, Jean Park, is not so sure.  </P> <P> "Yes," she said when asked if she thought the pressure was too intense  sometimes. "I think it does bother him."  </P> <P> Most of the time Richard just wants to hang out with friends at a shopping  mall. "I get kind of tired of (the attention) sometimes," he said.  </P> <P> When a reporter and photographer showed up one recent Saturday afternoon at Bay  Harbor Olympic Ice Arena in Harbor City to watch Richard practice with his  team, the young player was less than thrilled. He fussed about posing for a  photo with his mother and sister. When practice ended he hid in the locker  room.  </P> <P> Kizanis coaxed him. Richard tugged at his dark hair which protruded from under  a Kings hockey cap. His shoulders rested against a cold concrete wall. He  stared at the ceiling. An icy silence stifled the room.  </P> <P> But when the talk turned to surfing, Richard's eyes suddenly lit up and with a  youthful grin he spoke of his day, which had begun at 5 a.m. at the Manhattan  Beach Pier with a borrowed surfboard.  </P> <P> "Man, I hurt my butt," he said.  </P> <P> The Park family -- two boys, two girls, Jean and her husband Paul -- moved to  the United States and settled in Brea almost eight years ago. Paul Park is in  the import business. Christina took skating lessons soon after the family  arrived.  </P> <P> "I wanted to do something I couldn't have done in Korea," she said.  </P> <P> One day she took her little brother to the rink. "We gave him a lesson and the  teacher told us that he was just too good, that he already had an ability to  skate," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lived Here Since Age 4  </P> <P> When Richard was 5, the family moved to the Palos Verdes Peninsula. He wanted  to skate every day.  </P> <P> Richard said he sometimes feels the eyes of two nations staring at him. He has  lived in the United States since he was 4 and considers himself a regular  American kid. Christina said he wants to become a naturalized citizen when he  turns 18, but he would still be eligible to play Olympic hockey for his  homeland if he chooses.  </P> <P> "I don't speak Korean that well," Richard said. Yet the Korean work ethic that  puts family and education ahead of all else is why he is so good on the ice.  </P> <P> Richard attends hockey camps around the country. There are weekly clinics in  Burbank, Pasadena and Van Nuys. His mother said the money the family spends on  hockey each year is substantial.  </P> <P> "I don't really like hockey," she said. "I just love to watch my son."  </P> <P> She believes her son should treat hockey as a hobby. Education to Koreans is  more important, and because Richard gets "only Bs" he is sometimes scolded by  his family.  </P> <P> "Without an education you are only a dumb hockey player," said Christina, a  premed student at Loma Linda University.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Typical Teen-Age Reaction  </P> <P> Richard describes himself as "kind of a smart ass" in his parents' eyes, but  Christina says he is really a momma's boy.  </P> <P> "Mom is too strict sometimes," Richard said. "When I ask her if I can go out  with friends to the mall, she says no. My friends' parents let them go."  </P> <P> Jean Park said she would do anything for her son. "I try to copy the American  people," she said. "But school first, hockey second."  </P> <P> If Richard wants to stay on top of his game, experts agree he will have to  leave Southern California to play against better competition. The problem here,  they say, is that there just aren't enough ice rinks.  </P> <P> "In another year they'll have to be doing some serious thinking about getting  him into an area where he can develop, an area where everyone is good," said  White, the UCLA hockey club coach.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Family Considers Moving  </P> <P> Richard has been an exception to the rule among players here, said Racanelli,  Junior Kings manager and a former Canadian. "The problem in Southern California  is that you just don't get the good coaching," he said. "He'll have to leave  here and go somewhere where everybody is good."  </P> <P> Canada, the Midwest or Northeast are good bets for the Parks. They recently  began discussing a move.  </P> <P> "Maybe in a year," said Jean Park, who said she will follow her son wherever he  goes.  </P> <P> Richard knows he must go, too. "Maybe one more year," he said. "But I would  miss my friends."  </P> <P> Jean Park left the rink to go to the coffee shop where Thomas, the coach in  Chicago, wanted to discuss the possibility of having the young player move now.  He promised more ice time and a $52,000 budget that would pay for most travel  expenses.  </P> <P> But Richard was not interested at that moment. Nighttime was approaching, the  hockey playoffs were on TV.  </P> <P> Maybe he would go to the mall later with some friends.  </P></p>

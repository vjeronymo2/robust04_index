			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A JOINT VENTURE INTO PERESTROIKA  </P> <P> As I stood by the recently vacated Soviet army barracks, there flashed through  my mind a felicitous phrase encountered somewhere in the dim past: Life is what  actually happens to you while you are making all kinds of other plans.  </P> <P> Certainly none of my "other plans" had ever included my being in this township  of 50,000 about 100 miles from Leningrad.  </P> <P> Yet here I was, participating with a small group of Americans and a large group  of Soviets in a ceremony celebrating the conversion of a military facility into  a factory for the manufacture of children's clothing (a consumer product so  short in supply as to be desperately desired throughout the Soviet Union).  </P> <P> The official act of conversion we were there to witness had the legal effect of  "transferring the land and buildings from a military unit to the Garant  Cooperative for the production of children's clothing with the assistance of  American businessmen Mr. H. Willens and Mr. W. Bilson, they being present at  the procedure of signing this act." And directly above the signature of Urij  Menshikov, the authorized official of Kingisepp, appeared these words: "I do  stress as well that the transformation of a military unit into a civil one is  real evidence of perestroika policy having the aim to improve the life of the  Soviet people."  </P> <P> My own words, expressed on behalf of my partner, Los Angeles business executive  Wesley Bilson, plus apparel manufacturer Bernard Grenell, project coordinator  and translator Sophia Lansky and corporate planner Gail Woodward (a "team"  uniquely qualified to share entrepreneurial skills and experience with our new  Soviet friends) stressed the symbolic significance of the Kingisepp conversion  as described by Menshikov: "To transform a military facility into a children's  apparel factory captures the very essence of a universal priority shift from  which all the people of the world would benefit at this moment in human  history. We Americans here today actively support your perestroika because it  seeks to redirect from military priorities to civilian needs the human skills,  the technology and the financial resources required to deal with potentially  terminal global problems. Let us hope that the small but significant step we  witness here today becomes an example that inspires many more such steps toward  the safer, better world we want for our children."  </P> <P> Dressed in full uniform, Col. Victor Makarov, the former commander of Kingisepp  Army Base, stated that "only a short while ago I could not ever imagine that I  would witness what is taking place here today . . . and yet I consider this act  as a measure that is humanistic, just -- and justified."  </P> <P> Although the audience reaction seemed warm and favorable to each speaker in  turn, it struck me as being especially responsive to the words of Raisa  Gorbachev when they were read for her by Vladislav A. Starkov, editor-in-chief  of the popular Soviet journal Arguments and Facts. In her message, the first  lady "conveyed her warmest wishes to the organizers of the children's-clothing  venture being set up with the assistance of American businessmen," and  expressed her hope "that Soviet people will welcome this as still more evidence  of the new friendship which has been emerging in Soviet-American relations."  </P> <P> Probably because of the message from Mrs. Gorbachev, the event received  nationwide television, radio and print-media coverage, thus communicating to  most of the Soviet Union the fact that seasoned American business executives  were -- as an act of enlightened self-interest -- gladly sharing, at their own  expense and with no profit potential in mind, their skills and experience,  gained over many years.  </P> <P> I thought about enlightened self-interest as some of us were being given a tour  of the buildings already being remodeled at the base, and at the banquet  afterward I proposed a toast to a dramatic example of enlightened  self-interest: the Soviet-American partnership that destroyed a would-be  world-destroyer by the name of Adolf Hilter.  </P> <P> And I ended the toast with these words: "Let us drink to the reestablishment of  that de facto partnership between the United States and the Soviet Union for in  it lies the best hope not only for preventing catastrophic war, but also for  solving, one step at a time, global ecological threats for which the only cure  is prevention."  </P></p>

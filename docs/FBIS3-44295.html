We are more confident than any time before of China's future.    Li Peng said when analyzing the reasons for the world's new  understanding of China in 1993: The fundamental reason was that  China's reform, opening, and economic construction made great  development under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.    He said: Just a number of years ago, when seeing the drastic  changes in Eastern Europe and the dissolution of the Soviet  Union, some people in the world alleged that "China would also  collapse." Facts showed that China did not collapse; instead, it  developed and grew stronger. At present, many economists and  commentators in the world and even some politicians have made  more optimistic predictions and forecasts on China's economic  strength and developmental vista than we did. Although such  predictions and forecasts may not be in keeping with the facts,  in any case they reflect from another angle the world's  acknowledgement of China's achievements.    Li Peng pointed out: At present, Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics not only has  taken shape completely, but also has shown its strong  effectiveness in practice. At the same time, the third  generation leading collective, with Jiang Zemin as the core, has  taken shape and has been maturing gradually. Thus, our  modernization drive not only has theoretical grounds, but also  has organizational guarantees. Today we are more confident of  China's future than at any previous time.    He pointed out, however, that in the world, some people who  harbor malicious intentions are still spreading the allegation  about the "China threat" in an attempt to sow discord between  China and its neighboring countries and to undermining China's  favorable surrounding environment. It was a U-turn from the  allegation about China's "collapse" to the allegation about the  China "threat," and such arguments were indeed perplexing. The  two extreme ideas reflected some people's ignorance about  China's real situation. A developed and strong China will never  pose a threat to any other country, but will only make greater  contributions to world peace and development.    As for how to approach some different opinions between the  central and local authorities, or between different localities,  and how to approach unevenness in economic development, Li Peng  said: China is a unified country, and the socialist market  economy we are striving to build is also a unified market.    He said: Of course, it is hard to avoid different opinions  on various issues between the central and local authorities, and  there certainly is unevenness in economic development between  different localities. The gap between China's east and west is  widening, but the western region itself has developed, and the  living standards of the people there also have been continuously  raised. In the world, uneven development is also a common  phenomenon, and there is no exception in various countries. In  addition, the party and government have fully noticed the gap  between the east and the west of the country, and are taking  measures to solve this problem.    Li Peng said: If some people are worried, out of their good  will, about the development unevenness in various parts of China  and the contradictions caused by some reform measures or by some  local interests, then their concern is understandable. However,  if some people, out of their ill intentions, hope and even  assert that the development unevenness between the east and the  west of the country will lead to China's division, and if they  want to see trouble occur in China, then their hope certainly  will fall through.</p>

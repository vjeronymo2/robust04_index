			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Rio finds a hero: A colourful mayor has brought hope to the city Anyone who does much business in third world cities can empathise with the British investment banker who recently hurled his telephone out of the window of his hotel on Copacabana beach after a tenth failed attempt to make a local call. For residents of Rio de Janeiro, the ailing telephone system, while probably a minor problem, provides a fitting symbol for a city where everything is stretched beyond its limits. The transport system is chaotic; sprawling slums deface hillsides; the bay is polluted almost beyond redemption; and chronic unemployment has pushed many into drugs and prostitution. Crime is so rampant that US State Department travel advisories tell tourists not to walk in the streets. Just as many of Rio's 10m population were giving up hope, a civic leader has emerged, pledging to change all this. Since becoming mayor in January, Mr Cesar Maia, a left-wing economist from the Democratic Movement party (PMDB), has propelled Rio into national headlines. He has introduced the city's own time zone, and half-jokingly has threatened to issue its own currency to replace the inflation-racked cruzeiro. He closed off the main commercial thoroughfare for a week of open-air concerts by the Moscow Philharmonic and dressed up as a purple Ninja turtle to encourage children to have vaccinations. Mr Maia believes such stunts are necessary to boost the city's self-confidence and give it a new image. 'I want to show that Rio is different from other Latin American cities - it's playful and rebellious.' Behind all the promotion, however, Mr Maia is serious. His ultimate aim is to make Rio a 'global city' modelled on Madrid and Barcelona, offering a range of facilities to attract business and tourists. Initially he wants to bring in foreign and domestic investment to improve the city's infrastructure, and to privatise public services where possible, to leave the administration free to concentrate on 'the big picture'. By cracking down on crime and boosting its cultural offerings, he plans to capitalise on the city's spectacular beauty to make the city an international business centre. To accomplish this, Mr Maia has assembled an internationally respected team of advisers, including Mr Marcilio Moreira Marques, a former federal economy minister, who is in charge of attracting foreign capital and aid; and Mr Eduardo Modiano, former head of Brazil's privatisation programme. His brief is to put roads, the marina and even the city's renowned carnival into private hands. The mayor and his team face a staggering challenge. Urban planners reckon that Rio's population is three times greater than its housing, infrastructure and employment base can support. More than 1,500 slums and irregular settlements house a third of its residents. Evidence of the lack of investment in Rio's infrastructure is abundant. Huge pot-holes in the streets contribute to frequent traffic accidents. Giant pits stand as grim reminders that the city went bankrupt in the late 1980s halfway through building a metro system. Rio's decline can be traced to 1960 when Brasilia became the capital of Brazil. Since then its traditional shipbuilding industry has collapsed and its importance as a port dwindled. As unemployment rose, crime surged. Businesses moved to Sao Paulo, and tourism slumped. Unemployment and crime in turn rose still higher. The syndrome has intensified since the national economy fell into recession in 1989. It was the issue of law and order that carried Mr Maia to power. When the Earth Summit took place in Rio last June he was lagging in the polls. But the tight security surrounding the conference showed local people how pleasant Rio could be if crime was contained. Afterwards, Mr Maia's ratings rocketed when he said he would use the army if necessary to make Rio safe. To help stem the fall in tourism, which has dropped 70 per cent since 1989, he has created a special force of undercover 'tourist' police. Dressed in T-shirts and Bermuda shorts, its members travel in beach buggies and on jet-skis. Mr Philip Carruthers, head of the Rio hotel association, says results are already being seen in terms of fewer tourist muggings. Encouraged by the new anti-crime mood, a Rio judge has imprisoned 14 of the city's main crime bosses, who are under investigation for alleged involvement in arms and drug trafficking. The state prosecutor is investigating 15 senior policemen for 'illicit enrichment'. To improve business facilities, Mr Maia has secured the city's first important investment commitment in decades. Embratel, the state telecommunications company, has selected Rio as the site for Latin America's first Teleport - a sophisticated communications centre which will update the city's telephone system as well as offer office space equipped with satellite technology. Embratel is currently looking for private investors and multilateral loans to help finance the Dollars 1bn project. But Mr Maia's main focus is on culture. 'I see culture as part of economic policy,' the mayor says. 'To make Rio work, we need to make it a special place to visit. Top executives do not go to New York just for business - they go to enjoy its cultural offerings.' Arguing that the city's natural beauty is an economic asset which must be protected, Mr Maia has sent in bulldozers to 'remove' slum dwellings from richer areas. Such actions, while applauded by business men and hoteliers, leave him open to charges from representatives of the slum-dwellers that he is 'governing for the rich'. The mayor counters that his administration is the first to have provided regular public services such as rubbish collection in slum areas. The collapse this month of a hillside slum in heavy rain and the gunpoint robbery of a visiting American pop group at the airport show how far Rio has to go before it again merits the title 'Marvellous City'. Rio has not yet decided whether its new mayor is a prankster or a genius. But there is a new mood of optimism which could be the first step to recovery.</p>

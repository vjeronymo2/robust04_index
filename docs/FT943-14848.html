			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Credit Lyonnais probe pours scorn on state's effectiveness as 'close to nil': David Buchan on the message of the parliamentary inquiry into troubled French bank France's parliamentary inquiry, published yesterday, into how the country's largest bank, the state-owned Credit Lyonnais, came to pile up record losses and bad debts is most striking for its indictment of the ineffectiveness, even pointlessness, of state ownership. The report says Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, president of Credit Lyonnais from 1988 until his dismissal last November 'carries the chief responsibility' for the bank's disastrous lending spree cul-minating in a FFr6.9bn (Pounds 810m) loss last year. But it also criticises the state and the regulatory authorities - including Mr Jean-Claude Trichet who directed the Treasury before becoming governor of the Bank of France last year with a seat on the Banking Commission - for their laxness as well as the bank's outside directors. The report does not propose any new sanctions or radical reform. In its nine-week inquiry, the parliamentary committee says it came across 'no case of corruption uncovered or approved by Credit Lyonnais'. However, it added that Mr Jean Peyrelevade, the bank's new president, promised it that he would prosecute any 'rare collaborators who might have been indelicate or frankly dishonest' if and when solid evidence came to light. As to reform, the report just urges the state and the Banking Commission to exercise more control in the future. From a political point of view, it is likely to undermine any remaining case for state ownership, except among the Socialist and Communist parties whose minority representatives on the inquiry dissented from the report. Credit Lyonnais is already on the government's list of companies for privatisation, which the assembly's finance committee chairman said yesterday was 'the best road' for the bank. Even, Mr Philippe Seguin, the assembly's president who chaired the inquiry, says in his introduction to the report that the state's effectiveness as Credit Lyonnais' shareholder was 'close to nil'; as a staunch Gaullist, Mr Seguin cannot be said to be predisposed against government interference in the economy. The report itself is tougher than the Seguin introduction. It was largely written by Mr Francois d'Aubert, a UDF deputy and relative free-marketeer who was sued for libel by Credit Lyonnais for a book he wrote about the bank called Argent Sale (Dirty Money) and who said yesterday the inquiry turned up nothing to lead him to retract his allegations. The report acknowledges that Credit Lyonnais had already acquired some doubtful clients, such as the late Mr Robert Maxwell and Mr Bernard Tapie, before 1988. But it says the real surge in its expansion began with Mr Haberer's desire to turn the bank into a German-style 'industrial' bank, his gamble on rising property prices and his bid to use European deregulation to give Credit Lyonnais a continental network, often paying too much for inadequately audited acquisitions. By last year Credit Lyonnais had taken equity in 1,500 companies at home and controlling or minority stakes in 107 banks and companies abroad. The report singles out two categories of investment. Like many other banks, Credit Lyonnais lent far too much in property, amassing some FFr50bn of doubtful loans, of which FFr42bn have been hived off into a separate state-backed company to improve the bank's solvency ratio. The report claims the finance ministry and the Bank of France, via the Banking Commission, not only allowed but actively encouraged the bank to limit its provisions against bad property debts. The second category - the degree to which the bank was ordered to help prop up loss-making state industries - is disputed. Mr Seguin, who parliamentary officials say consistently tried to 'smooth the report's rough edges', says, for instance, that there is no evidence to show that Credit Lyonnais' decision to take a stake in the Usinor-Sacilor steel company or in Aerospatiale 'owed more to the wish of the public authorities than a deliberate choice of the bank'. But the report claims 'increasing bankruptcies led the state, in order to save jobs, to interfere with the bank's autonomy', just as, it adds, prime minister Edouard Balladur did last autumn in forbidding state companies to lay off workers. Whatever the motive, the result was to enable Credit Lyonnais to count dud shareholdings as 'own funds' on which still more loans could be extended. Much of the bank's problems lay with four out-of-control financial subsidiaries - Althus, SDBO (Mr Tapie's main bank), IBSA, and CLBN, its Dutch subsidiary which financed the bid by two Italians, Mr Giancarlo Paretti and Mr Florio Fiorini, for the MGM film studio. The report highlights the problem of cross-border banking supervision - an issue, incidentally, largely ignored in the Maastricht negotiations for European monetary union - of a 95 per cent French-owned bank incorporated in the Netherlands. Warnings by the Dutch central bank about possible money laundering by CLBN clients went ignored by Mr Haberer, the report says. Of Credit Lyonnais' directors, the report finds most fault with its former six 'independent directors' who when they bothered to turn up to board meetings relied on the state's six representatives to do their job for them. It praises the six directors representing the bank's own personnel for asking the most pointed questions of the Haberer management, but says inevitably these often concerned internal housekeeping rather than strategy. There was a clean sweep of the bank's independent directors last month. The new team includes Mr Bernard Arnault of LVMH, Mr Alain Gomez of the state-owned Thomson group (which has 21 per cent of Credit Lyonnais), Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere and Mr Francois Pinault, heads of groups bearing their name. In response to press criticism that these men are all substantial customers of his bank, Mr Peyrelevade said: 'Better they are Credit Lyonnais' clients than some other bank's'.</p>

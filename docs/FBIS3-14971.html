			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Panorama" program] </F>   [Text] A news conference was held in Moscow today on the  results of the session of the defense ministers of the CIS  countries. Kirill Shakhnovich reports.    [Shakhnovich] Taking part in this session from 24-25  February  were delegations of the military departments of eleven states of  the Commonwealth. The session resulted in the adoption and  signing of such important documents as:    -- a decision on the confirmation of the statute on the  council of defense ministers;    -- a decision on the secretariat of the council of defense  ministers of the participating states;    -- a decision on the establishment of the coordination staff  and the principles of its makeup;    -- a decision on additional measures for the stabilization  of  the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border; and also,    -- a decision on the period of the presence of collective  peacekeeping forces in the Republic of Tajikistan;    -- a decision on the interstate commission for military-  technological cooperation of the CIS member-states; this  decision is popular because even those countries who do not  participate in this bloc can come to this commission and because  the problem of replenishment of military spare parts is a highly  acute one for all armies today.    And the final point, which was signed by the eleven states  of  the Commonwealth, refers to the preparation of draft documents  on the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the victory in the  Great Fatherland War of 1941-1945.    Here in particular is what was said at today's news  conference by Viktor Samsonov, the head of the staff for  coordination of the armed forces of the CIS Countries:    [Begin Samsonov recording] As for seeking to set up a system  of collective security, this of course involves the signing of a  treaty on collective security, and we propose that at some point  we shall set up joint armed forces of the Commonwealth countries  which will form the basis of a system of collective security of  the whole Commonwealth, and of each state individually. There  is an analogy here with the NATO bloc, but without rejecting  totally the experience of NATO, which has functioned for a long  time now, I would say that there is much in the experience of  the CIS states that is its own and special to it, experience  which has not come directly from other states, but of course  there will be mutual experience.    However, the setting up of collective security naturally is  being more and more understood among the states of the  Commonwealth, and this is shown by the preceding session in  Ashgabat, where another three states entered the signing of the  treaty on collective security.

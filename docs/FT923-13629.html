			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Survey of Japan (2): Reform will be difficult - Politics AFTER months in the political doldrums, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, is enjoying something of a revival. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will fare much better than it feared in the forthcoming elections to the Diet's upper house, to be held on July 26. However, the recovery in the prime minister's fortunes will do little to improve his capacity to govern. The LDP is steadily losing control of the Diet, making it increasingly difficult to secure the passage of anything except routine legislation. This month's poll will probably make it even more difficult than before to solve the party's more serious challenges - including electoral reform, possible revisions to tax laws and international demands for an end to the ban on rice imports. Only a few months ago, LDP officials considered ditching Mr Miyazawa. The government had suffered badly from the prime minister's handling of two nasty political scandals involving allegations of bribe-taking, from the economic downturn, and from the arguments over the controversial bill to allow Japanese troops to serve on United Nations missions. Mr Miyazawa's fortunes hit rock-bottom when the LDP lost a by-election in Nara - an ancient capital of Japan, and a traditional LDP stronghold. But the prime minister's stock has since staged an unexpected recovery. This is partly caused by a lull in the two political scandals which grabbed so much space in newspapers earlier this year. Interest in the affair concerning Kyowa, a steelframe maker turned property developer, has largely died away, following the arrest of a former cabinet minister who now faces trial on bribe-taking charges. The public prosecutor's office is still investigating a much larger scandal involving Sagawa Kyubin, a truck delivery company, and its links with gangsters and politicians. But leaks from the prosecutor's office have become scarce in recent weeks. Whether the probe has come to an end, or whether the prosecutors are merely maintaining a discreet silence until after the election, remains to be seen. The prime minister has also benefited politically from the passage of the peace-keeping forces legislation, which completed its tortuous way through the Diet in early June, amid stormy scenes inside the chamber and demonstrations in the street outside. According to opinion polls, people remain deeply divided over the bill; its opponents are concerned about a possible revival in Japanese militarism. But LDP officials are relieved that the inter-party arguments over the bill are finished at last. Moreover, the opposition parties' filibustering tactics, including the 'ox-walk' slow-voting technique, won credit from no-one. Even the decline in the stock market and the economy seems, paradoxically, to have bolstered support for the LDP and the government. In the initial stages of turmoil in the financial markets, voters were happy to criticise the government, particularly the finance ministry. However, as the economy has deteriorated further, so alarm about the country's future has spread throughout Japan. As in previous economic crises, there is a growing feeling that the Japanese must pull together - a sentiment which has rallied support for the ruling party, just in time for the upper house elections. Polls will be held in half the seats in the 252-member chamber. Elections are held every three years - with members sitting for six years, so the seats now being contested were last fought over in 1986, when the LDP won a resounding victory on the back of the personal popularity of Mr Yasuhiro Nakasone, the then prime minister. The party therefore expects to lose seats this time: the question is how many. It is defending 75 out of 127 seats being contested. LDP officials believe they might lose about 10. Independent analysts think it could be as many as 15. But even the loss of these few seats could be crucial in future national politics. This is because the LDP lost its majority in the upper house in 1989, when voters registered their anger at the party's involvement in the Recruit affair. Since then, the ruling party has relied in the upper house on the support of the main centrist party: Komeito. For example, without Komeito's 20 votes in the upper house, the LDP would have failed in its attempt to pass the peace-keeping bill. Thus, although the LDP has kept its majority in the lower house, despite all the trials of the Recruit affair and other scandals, its ability to pass legislation is now severely limited. The LDP and Komeito together hold 134 seats out of 252: a bare majority. If the LDP loses 10 seats this majority is forfeited (even if Komeito loses no seats, which seems unlikely). So the LDP will be forced to rely on making deals with other centrist parties, including the Democratic Socialist Party. The LDP and DSP have worked together before. But the LDP's inter-party clout will decline in proportion to the seats it loses. LDP officials are concerned about the erosion of their control of the Diet. They point out that Japanese parliamentary practice has long included close consultation with opposition parties. So a smaller representation in the upper house may make little difference. This is all true. But during its three decades in office, the party has rarely been forced to make difficult decisions about changing the law. Japan has largely been governed by bureaucrats acting within the framework of existing laws. The challenges of the 1990s are different; parts of the post-war legal framework are now in urgent need of reform. For example, Japan is under pressure from trading partners to open the rice market, which is protected by food security laws. The tax system places a heavy burden on wage-earners, while giving numerous breaks to the self-employed. Land use laws still favour farmers over townspeople. So do electoral regulations which give people living in rural constituencies a disproportionately big voice in the Diet. Leading LDP officials are aware of these problems. But it is difficult for them to reform a system which they helped to create, and which helps to keep them in power.</p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Drug sales fall after Bonn health reforms FRANCE overtook Germany as western Europe's largest prescription drugs market in the first two months of the year, according to data from IMS International, the specialist pharmaceuticals market research company. German sales have been affected by a price freeze. The market has fallen about 15 per cent since healthcare reforms introduced at the beginning of January. The company estimates sales in the seven largest western European markets - which represent about 85 per cent of the whole western European market - were Dollars 7.32bn (Pounds 4.84bn) during January and February. Purchases by pharmacies - about 80 per cent of total drugs sales - reached Dollars 2.09bn in France compared with Dollars 1.6bn in Germany. Italy was the third largest market with sales of Dollars 1.59bn, followed by Spain (Dollars 783m), the UK (Dollars 758m), and Belgium (Dollars 253m). Sales in the Netherlands were estimated at Dollars 248m, although the figure was extrapolated from January data. The figures exclude sales to hospitals. The biggest selling type of drug were cardiovascular medicines, although sales were down 2 per cent at Dollars 1.52bn. Alimentary and metabolism drugs, which include ulcer treatments, dropped 1 per cent to Dollars 1.24bn. Respiratory medicines were static at Dollars 756m. However, anti-infectives, which include anti-virals and antibiotics, increased 6 per cent to Dollars 805m, while central nervous system treatments increased 2 per cent to Dollars 800m. IMS International figures for 1992 suggest the seven countries had sales of Dollars 49bn, up 8 per cent on 1991. Cardiovascular sales were up 7 per cent at Dollars 10.86bn, alimentary and metabolism increased 8 per cent at Dollars 8.34bn, central nervous system rose 9 per cent to Dollars 5.32bn, anti-infectives increased 9 per cent to Dollars 4.46bn, and musculo-skeletal were up 5 per cent at Dollars 2.82bn. The fastest growing areas were cytostatics, used to treat cancer, up 20 per cent at Dollars 1.15bn, and blood and organ treatments up 13 per cent at Dollars 2.5bn.  ----------------------------------------- WEST EUROPEAN DRUG PURCHASES BY PHARMACIES  -----------------------------------------                               Jan-Dec 1992                         Dollars m        %  ----------------------------------------- Top 7 Markets              48,993      100  ----------------------------------------- France                     12,266     25.1 Germany                    12,232     25.0 Italy                      11,065     22.6 Spain                       5,456     11.1 United Kingdom              4,890     10.0 Belgium                     1,554      3.2 Netherlands                 1,530      3.1  ----------------------------------------- Source: IMS International  ----------------------------------------- Pharmaceuticals Survey, Section II</p>

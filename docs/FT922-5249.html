			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Reform call for textiles industry THE TEXTILES industry in the Scottish Borders region needs radical restructuring and an infusion of new capital and ideas if it is to survive, say consultants appointed after a series of job losses in the industry. Werner International, the consultants, urges the industry to make good a long-term lack of investment in production equipment, to improve training and to attract a younger labour force. The consultants praise the quality of the area's textiles production, 70 per cent of which is exported, but say weavers that persist with classic Scottish products will have difficulty in surviving as tastes change and Italian competition intensifies. They also warn that weaving companies are vulnerable because they depend on a UK clothing market that is in 'irreversible contraction'. Spinning companies should be able to defend their position, the consultants say. Knitwear will face growing competition from China, especially if Japanese companies operating there improve the quality of Chinese knitwear. Spinning, weaving and knitwear are the main industry in the Borders region, employing 5,500 workers. The report was commissioned last year by Scottish Borders Enterprise, the region's enterprise company, after numerous mill closures and the loss in two years of 1,000 jobs. Werner says smaller borders textile groups should approach Japanese, EC and US textile companies to buy the Scottish companies or set up joint ventures with them. Borders companies should themselves create larger groupings through mergers. Werner advises Scottish Borders Enterprise to promote the creation of marketing companies to function as co-operatives, and to establish a product development and design centre to provide consultancy services. Scottish Borders Enterprise said at a conference of industry leaders in Galashiels, Roxburghshire, last week that it would lead an initiative to encourage the industry to change its ways. The Werner report says that while larger companies are diversifying into non-traditional products, smaller companies need to follow suit and to develop stronger overseas marketing links. The smaller knitwear companies need to adopt an 'industrial' rather than an 'artisanal' approach to manufacturing, the consultants say. The consultants found that only two Borders knitwear companies employ workers of the youngest employable generation, with the others relying on highly skilled older workers. Efforts must be made to recruit and train a new generation of textile workers, the consultants say. A Strategic Plan for the Textile Industries in the Scottish Borders.

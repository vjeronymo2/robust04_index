			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Western uranium output falls URANIUM PRODUCTION outside the former eastern bloc countries last year was only 26,900 tonnes, the lowest since 1976, but enough to take cumulative western world output past the 1m tonnes mark, according to the UK-based Uranium Institute. Western production in 1991 covered only 57 per cent of utilities' reactor requirements - uranium has only one use, to produce nuclear energy - and the rest was covered by the drawdown of stocks and deliveries from the Commonwealth of Independent States, eastern Europe and China. In its latest market study, the institute estimates that western uranium stocks are about 78,000 tonnes but suggests not all of this is available. In any case, 'given the shortfall of about 20,000 tonnes in 1991 between western production and requirements and a 1991 mine capacity utilisation rate of 62.1 per cent, these available stocks could be consumed within a relatively short time,' it adds. In most countries in eastern Europe, uranium output has fallen to a level where it just satisfies domestic requirements, the report indicates. However, in the CIS production last year was 10,500 tonnes - substantially higher than had been previously estimated. Estimates of uranium resources in eastern Europe, the CIS and China have been updated and are substantially lower than previously believed. At a recoverable cost of up to USDollars 80 a kilogram, resources in eastern Europe at the end of 1990 were estimated to be 61,000 tonnes, those in the CIS at 355,000 tonnes and those in China at 50,000 tonnes.

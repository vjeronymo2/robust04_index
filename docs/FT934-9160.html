			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading STOCK index futures broke through a significant barrier yesterday, but the effort proved too great and the December Footsie contract ended below the day's best, writes Peter John. A desultory performance was contrasted by continuing high turnover, with more than 14,000 contracts transacted in the lot for December expiry. That issue began the day very weakly and hit parity with the cash market at one stage, touching 3,081 at its lowest ebb. This compares with an estimated fair value premium of about 10 points. In the afternoon it raced through 3,105, a level challenged earlier in the week. Once above that it moved ahead to 3,130, but the buying proved overdone and it settled back to close just above 3,100. Traders said that in spite of heavy selling last week as US money was repatriated on expectations of rising inflation there, open interest remained high at around 60,000 contracts in December. It was suggested that UK arbitrageurs bought lots sold by US investment funds. In traded options, volume was up to just under 40,000 contracts with British Steel topping the list of equity options. Steel's turnover of 3,181 lots was however the result of one deal to buy 3,000 out-of-the-money, January 140 calls at 3p each. Dealers said that, at expiry, the shares must be above 143p for the trade to be profitable.</p>

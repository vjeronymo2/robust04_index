			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source at the Defense Ministry has  denied reports put out by the media of the bloody al-Ahmar clan,  reports which have been repeated by the news agencies and  radios, to the effect that the forces of the al-Ahmar gang have  reached the Dar-Sa'd area in Aden governorate.    In a statement for the Yemeni news agency, SABA, the source  said these reports were totally untrue. Dar-Sa'd town is  tranquil and under the total control of the forces of national  alignment, unity and democracy.    Moreover, the battles are taking place in the areas of  al-Dali, Karish, and Mukayras, which are hundreds of kilometers  from Aden. The source stated that the forces of unity and  democracy are winning victories on all battle fronts, seizing  advanced positions and routing the forces of the oppressive  al-Ahmar gang.    The source said putting out such reports reveals the state  of  confusion and hysteria afflicting the forces of the gang of the  al-Ahmar clan, who in their sick dreams are hiding the truth to  obfuscate the successive defeats they are suffering by turning  them into imaginary victories.</p>

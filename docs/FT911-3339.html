			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Disposal helps limit fall at British Dredging a period when the UK building trade hit a severe recession - British Dredging managed to limit its profits fall to just under 14 per cent, from Pounds 4m to Pounds 3.45m. The final dividend is raised to a proposed 4.8p, to lift the total from 7p to 7.4p. This marine dredging company is also involved in the supply of sand and gravel, the manufacture of paving blocks, other concrete products and tiles, builders' merchanting and ship repairing. Mr Fane Vernon, chairman, said that the structure of the group was changed significantly during the year by the sale in April of a 50 per cent stake in British Dredging Aggregates to RMC Group for Pounds 4.39m and by July's acquisition of Selco Trade Centres, the building materials supplier, for an initial Pounds 3.5m. Mr Vernon noted that the Pounds 443,000 contribution from Selco partly offset reduced trading profits from established operations, where concrete products fell to Pounds 792,000 (Pounds 1.23m) and marine aggregates to Pounds 331,000 (Pounds 1.79m). Group operating profits were down by Pounds 1.42m at Pounds 1.9m, though the share of profit of associated undertakings rose to Pounds 308,000 (Pounds 13,000) and net interest received almost doubled to Pounds 1.25m (Pounds 674,000). Earnings slipped to 13.06p (14.53p) per share. There was an extraordinary gain of Pounds 2.58m (Pounds 322,000) relating mainly to proceeds from the disposal to RMC. The company was proud of its 'very strong' position, with net short-term cash deposits, loan notes and investments at the year-end totalling Pounds 7.2m (Pounds 6.9m).</p>

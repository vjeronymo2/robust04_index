Olga Bolmatova, FINANSOVYYE  IZVESTIYA, Analyzes New Draft Laws on Foreign Investment"]    [Text] Specialists from the RAMSIR [Russian Agency for  International Cooperation and Development], the Ministry of the  Economy, the Central Bank, and the Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations have developed a draft of the Law "On Amendments and  Additions to the Law of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist  Republic 'On Concession Contracts and Production-Sharing  Agreements Signed With Foreign Investors.'"    The Law "On Foreign Investment," which was passed on 4 July  1991 and reflected the view of the world as of late 1990, has  become hopelessly obsolete. Much debate has developed concerning  the draft of a new redaction: Should national or special  treatment be granted to foreign investors? Should a "grandfather  clause" be introduced, and for whom? Who should be considered a  foreign investor? As a result, the old wording of the legal  treatment has been kept in the redaction which is now being  considered by the government: no less favorable than national  treatment.    The definition of a foreign investor has been broadened in  amendments and additions to the law: Now not only foreign  individuals and legal entities, states, and international  organizations may be granted this status, but also "foreign  economic units without the status of legal entities" (that is, a  group of companies or persons) and citizens of Russia  permanently residing abroad in the event they import to the  country monetary funds, property, and property rights.    In keeping with the draft of the law, now not only "all  types  of property assets" will be considered foreign investment but  also the rights to them and intellectual property rights. The  law specifies that foreign exchange and the currency of the  Russian Federation, which according to the Instruction of the  Central Bank "Opening of Ruble-Denominated Accounts by  Nonresidents," is credited to type I (investment)  ruble-denominated accounts, can be used for investment purposes.    The inclusion in the law of a "grandfather clause" has  become  a more serious step to accommodate foreign capital; the clause  guarantees enterprises in which the proportion of foreign  investment comes to no less than 30 percent of authorized  capital that for three years from the moment of registration of  the enterprise, legislation will apply to it that was in effect  at the moment of registration in the event that "conditions for  investment activities deteriorate." If the contribution of a  foreign investor amounts to at least $100,000, the clause will  apply for 10 years. Interestingly, the law thus gives foreign  investors a guarantee against changes in tax treatment, which is  not common in world practice. To be sure, the procedure for  implementing this clause is not spelled out in the draft law.    It is interesting to note that the "grandfather clause" in  investment legislation is an absolute muddle: We read in the  Edict "On Perfecting Work With Foreign Investment" of 27  September 1993, which apparently performed the function of  reassurance following Edict No. 1400: "Newly issued regulatory  acts (?) which govern the conditions for the operation of  foreign enterprises and joint ventures (?) on the territory of  the Russian Federation shall not apply for three years to  enterprises that exist as of the moment said acts take effect."  Further on it is explained that the provision in question does  not cover the introduction of more preferential conditions. At  the RAMSIR, where they called this edict harmful and inexpert,  they are apprehensive about thousands of enterprises proclaiming  themselves "joint ventures," having found any, even  questionable, investors who would agree to invest at least one  dollar in their authorized capital.    Another document which likewise appeared during the period  of  the legislative change of seasons, the Edict "Issues in  Production-Sharing Agreements in the Utilization of Minerals,"  says that if norms are established in Russia "that worsen the  commercial results of the activities of an investor," amendments  shall be made to the agreement which ensure the old level of  profitability for the investor. However, this edict will remain  in effect only until the relevant law comes out, but according  to the latest redaction of the of the draft Law "On Concession  Contracts and Production-Sharing Agreements Signed With Foreign  Investors," amendments shall be made to the agreement only in  the event of a change in legislation which "substantially  worsens" the position of the investor.    New rules for registration of enterprises with foreign  investment are yet another change which is planned to be  included in the law on foreign investment. A limit will be  established: Enterprises in which the volume of investment does  not exceed $100,000 will be registered at the level of  republics, krays, and oblasts. Larger enterprises, as well as  those engaging in the extraction and processing of coal, oil,  and gas, will be registered at the RAMSIR. According to the  draft, foreign companies will no longer have the right to create  branches in Russia; branches already in existence will undergo  repeat registration.    A total of 40 amendments are being made to the law on  foreign  investment, which consists of 42 articles. Obviously, under the  circumstances a new redaction of the law rather than amendments  and additions should be at issue.    The law on concessions has been in preparation for a year  now. As early as 21 July of last year the Supreme Soviet passed  the Law "On Concessions and Other Contracts Signed With Foreign  Investors," which described concession contracts,  production-sharing agreements, contracts for the provision of  services, contracts for long-term leases for state-owned  facilities, "and other contracts." At the time the president did  not confirm it. Apparently this was the reason why the  aforementioned edict on production-sharing agreements appeared  during the period of phased constitutional reform (it is not  ruled out that it was due to the need to move along the  "up-in-the-air" Elf Aquitaine project).    In its last redaction the law is entitled "On Concession  Contracts and Production-Sharing Agreements Signed With Foreign  Investors." The RAMSIR said that the law will be of "cognitive  significance" to the regions and of practical significance to  foreign investors, who will understand that "we are drawing  close to worldwide norms."    The law specifies the jurisdiction of the center and the  regions in drawing up lists of facilities offered for the  signing of contracts with foreign investors and outlines the  content of such contracts.    The draft laws on concessions and on foreign investment will  be among the first submitted to the Duma. For now, the  government is discussing the draft Edict "On Incentives for the  Attraction of Foreign Investment to Priority Sectors of the  National Economy."</p>

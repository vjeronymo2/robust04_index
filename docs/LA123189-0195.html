Harbor Blvd., began Saturday morning and  will continue until noon Monday. Members offer fellowship and refreshments for  those who want to socialize during New Year's but who do not want to celebrate  with alcohol.  </P> <P> The group usually holds the marathons several times a year during various  holidays.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 22 KYODO -- China's Forestry Minister  Xu Youfang will visit Japan in May for talks on Japan's request  for the loan of a pair of ibis for breeding, Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa told reporters during his return flight from  China to Tokyo.    Hosokawa made the request for the birds to Chinese Premier  Li  Peng on Sunday [20 March].    Hosokawa told Li there is only one pair of ibis left in  Japan  and they are too old for artificial breeding, Japanese officials  said.    He asked China to lend Japan a pair for breeding as there  are  some 40 captive ibis in China that have either artificially or  naturally produced offspring, they said.    Hosokawa said State Planning Commission head Chen Jinhua  told  him on Monday morning in Beijing that China will dispatch the  forestry minister, who is also in charge of environmental  issues, to Japan in May for talks with his Japanese counterparts.    Chen expressed China's readiness to help on the ibis  breeding  issue as a way of promoting China-Japan friendship and  environmental cooperation, Hosokawa said.</p>

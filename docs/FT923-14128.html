			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Italian bosses feel the pinch TOP MANAGERS in the Italian public sector are likely to be among the first victims of the new Amato government's impending purge on spending. The issue of their salaries has been forced on to the agenda by the embarrassing discovery that one of the last acts of Mr Giulio Andreotti's outgoing government was to award 25 per cent pay increases to the heads of state companies and financial institutions. This had gone unnoticed until this week when the decree, dating back to June 15, was published. It provoked a chorus of political protest. Officials of the new government said it would be hard to justify high salary raises when public sector pay could be frozen and Rome wished to convey an image of austerity. A new decree is now expected either to limit the rise or cancel it altogether as a side bar to the emergency austerity budget due to be announced at the end of the week. The biggest increases have gone to Mr Franco Nobili of Iri, the main state holding company, to Mr Gabriele Cagliari of Eni, the state oil concern, and to Mr Gaetano Mancini of Efim, the state industrial holding company. Their annual pay, backdated to January, 1991, has increased by L62.6m (Pounds 28,530) to a gross of L312m each. For heads of lesser entities such as the state cinema concern, the rise was worth an annual L37.5m to a gross of L106.2m By European standards these gross salaries are not excessively high and had remained unchanged since 1987. The nature of the remuneration packages for senior executives in the public sector has never been transparent. Indeed, the management has been invariably selected on the basis of political friendship and party affiliation.</p>

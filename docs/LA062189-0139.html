			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> N.Y. YANKS TRADE HENDERSON TO ATHLETICS;  </P> <P> 4TH-LEADING BASE STEALER OF ALL TIME SWAPPED FOR 2 PITCHERS, OUTFIELDER  </P> <P> Rickey Henderson, the fourth-leading base stealer of all-time, was traded by  the New York Yankees to the Oakland Athletics today for pitchers Greg Cadaret  and Eric Plunk and outfielder Luis Polonia.  </P> <P> Henderson, who is in the last year of a five-year contract and has been unhappy  with what the Yankees have been offering him, was hitting .247 with 25 stolen  bases this season. He has 819 career stolen bases.  </P> <P> Henderson was acquired by the Yankees from Oakland on Dec. 8, 1984, and signed  a five-year contract. He had said the Yankees had until the All-Star break to  sign him and was said to be looking for a three-year deal worth more than $8  million.  </P> <P> "We appreciate the fine performance he's given us during his 4 1/2 years with  the Yankees and wish him all the best in his return to Oakland," Yankees Vice  President Syd Thrift said of Henderson.  </P> <P> "With the addition of Plunk and Cadaret, we'll strengthen our pitching staff  considerably. Polonia gives us an offensive spark not only at the plate but  also on the bases."  </P> <P> Henderson's best season with the Yankees was 1985, when he hit .314 with 24  home runs, 72 RBIs and 80 stolen bases while scoring 146 runs.  </P> <P> He batted .263 in 1986, but still stole 87 bases and scored 130 runs, then was  limited to 95 games in 1987 due to a leg injury, batting .291 with 41 stolen  bases.  </P> <P> Last season, he rebounded to hit .305 with 93 stolen bases, though he hit only  six home runs.  </P> <P> He set the modern major league record for steals in 1982 with 130 while with  Oakland.  </P> <P> Cadaret, a 27-year-old left-hander who was Oakland's first draft pick in June,  1983, was 0-0 with a 2.28 earned-run average in 26 games this season. He is in  his third major league season and has an 11-4 lifetime record.  </P> <P> Plunk, 25, is a hard-throwing right-hander who was 1-1 with one save and a 2.20  ERA in 23 games. He came to the Athletics from the Yankees in the trade that  sent Henderson to New York. He is 16-16 lifetime with eight saves.  </P> <P> Polonia, 24, was hitting .286 with 13 stolen bases.  </P></p>

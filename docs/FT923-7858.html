			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / A scandal that threatens to shackle reform: India's government is facing a difficult struggle to keep its radical economic policies on course India's radical economic reform programme is in danger of running out of steam. The government of Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao, facing a balance of payments crisis when it took office last year, responded with a drive to open the economy to international competition and shake the shackles of bureaucracy from the large, inefficient public sector. But there is a growing feeling in Delhi that the momentum has been dissipated in recent months by a financial scandal, bureaucratic inertia and disappointing economic performance. 'The traffic light has turned from green to amber,' says Mr Jaswant Singh, a leading opposition politician who backs the direction of reform but criticises its management. All is by no means lost. Nobody is suggesting that reforms have been irrevocably derailed. Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister and chief architect of reform, insists: 'We have set out a programme and we are moving at the pace at which we said we would move. We haven't given up anything.' Other politicians and officials who back reform, however, admit the pace is likely to slow. A three-month parliamentary recess beginning next week will remove the burden of parliamentary disputes and give the government an opportunity to spell out the next steps in the reform programme, including a reduction of industrial subsidies and moves to revitalise banks. More important, it will provide a chance to regain the psychological momentum for reform. Mr Singh's team of reformers are victims of the high expectations created by their radical approach. They advocate a fundamental shift towards the market by a country traditionally devoted to values of self-sufficiency, dominated by the public sector. Unlike most other reforming socialist economies, such as those of eastern Europe and China, however, India already had a vibrant private sector that could help to drive the economy ahead. The potential was tremendous. But India also differs in having a well-developed democracy. China's leaders may argue behind the scenes about economic reform, but they do not have to face daily a rowdy and suspicious parliament. Indian opposition parties have seized upon the Bombay financial scandal and are set to keep it in the political limelight at least until the end of the year through the proceedings of a newly-formed joint parliamentary committee. The scandal, which erupted over fraudulent dealings in the country's securities markets and which involves funds of about Rs35bn (Pounds 625m), revealed a merry-go-round of transactions between banks, stockbrokers and investors, both fuelling and benefiting from a surge in the virtually unregulated Bombay stock market. The scandal caused the downfall of some of India's top brokers and bankers and has damaged leading financial institutions as well as foreign banks. Standard Chartered, apparently the worst hit, has made Pounds 100m of provisions for expected losses. Parts of the banking system are almost paralysed by the multiple investigations now under way, raising worries that industry could be starved of capital. The scandal's impact, however, is also political. One of the driving forces of reform, Commerce Minister P Chidambaram, had to resign in July because he had made a small investment in a company implicated in the fraud. 'He was determined to push reforms at a greater pace than anyone else,' says Mr Salman Khurshid, deputy commerce minister. Mr Manmohan Singh himself has been forced to devote much of his time to warding off opposition attacks related to the scandal - though there is no suggestion of wrongdoing on his part. The scandal's positive effect is that it underlines the need for reform of the financial sector. But it has also occurred in the area of the economy which has so far been allowed the greatest freedom from control. And, ominously, the response to the scandal has exposed enduring suspicion of private sector activity. For Mr Rao and Mr Singh, the road to reform was never going to be easy. And it was always going to get more difficult as more politically contentious issues were tackled. A number of factors remain in their favour. Even now, they enjoy a political consensus behind the broad thrust of reform. Opposition politicians agree that there is no desire to go back to the 'license raj' in which bureaucrats had to approve virtually any corporate decision. The government can also take heart from signs that the country's disappointing economic performance may be improving. Year-on-year inflation has dipped below 10 per cent, agricultural production this year will be better than had been expected, and exports and industrial production have seen a marginal upturn. Such improvements are party a reflection of the reforms which have already been achieved. In little more than a year, the government has abolished most of the industrial licensing system and removed most restrictions on foreign investment. It has relaxed import restrictions and begun to cut tariffs; reduced some subsidies; cut the fiscal deficit and deregulated some interest rates. It has also begun the privatisation of some public sector companies; and made the rupee partially convertible. The most important reforms still to be tackled, apart from continued cuts in tariffs and subsidies and a move to full rupee convertibility, are in the public sector. A restructuring package now near completion for the nationalised textile industry involves the loss of 75,000 jobs and probably the write-off of large debts to the government. Many other industries require similar treatment. Mr Singh is seeking to build a consensus in these areas before proceeding. This week he floated the idea of banks issuing equity without mentioning the word privatisation. 'What we are trying to do is to get the workers on board, and I find that when the facts are explained to the trade unions and workers they do realise that we are grappling with these problems in a fair, effective manner,' he says. He admits that this causes delay, but believes it will also contribute to the durability of reform 'which will have the backing of all thinking sections of our population'. The nagging worry which could undermine the whole process, however, remains India's export performance. 'I can't say I'm happy at all,' says Mr Khurshid at the commerce ministry. It was a balance of payments crisis which precipitated reform, as India suddenly ran out of cash to pay for imports. Industrialists say they have become much more export-minded as the economy's isolation and protection from the rest of the world is dismantled. But the results have yet to show through. With reserves buoyed by IMF and other borrowings, as well as weak demand for imports, there is no fear of a similar crisis now. But India's long-term credit rating has yet to be raised by debt agencies after last year's downgradings by both Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's. Growth in exports would improve international confidence and ease fears that the country could slip back into another crisis.</p>

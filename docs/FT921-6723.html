			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Baker initiative on bail offences attacked - Law and Order GOVERNMENT measures aimed at cracking down on 'bail bandits' who re-offend before coming to trial met charges of blatant electioneering from opposition parties yesterday. Mr Kenneth Baker, home secretary, argued that a considerable toughening of the law was necessary to deal with 'the hard core who persistently re-offend'. Last year some 50,000 out of half a million people granted bail were convicted of offences while on remand, up from 35,000 five years ago, he said. He went on to outline legislation to make offending when on bail a factor to be taken into account by courts when sentencing, improved means for identifying likely re-offenders and an Pounds 8m grant to increase the number of bail hostels. The timing of the initiative met with scorn from Labour and the Liberal Democrats. While formally welcoming several of the measures, they said that a doubling of the crime rate to more than 5m cases a year since 1979 had demolished the Conservatives' case to be the natural party of law and order. Mr Baker's Commons statement of the crackdown on bail offenders was widely seen in Westminster as a bid to upstage Labour's attempt to take the initiative as the Liberal Democrats also levelled charges of government complacency. The rising tide of crime now frequently ranks in the top five issues of greatest concern to voters, according to opinion polls. Politicians are also aware that definitive crime figures are due to be published towards the end of March, when an election campaign is thought almost certain to be under way. Leaks have suggested that these could show a 20 per cent rise in crime in the past year alone - a potentially highly damaging blow to the Tories. Labour officials said yesterday that private polling has shown they now lead the Tories by 40 points to 34 when voters are asked which party would be good or excellent at tackling crime. Yesterday Mr Hattersley said a Labour government would meet demands from chief constables for an increase of up to 3,000 in police strength. Economies within the Home Office, including reducing numbers of remand prisoners held in police stations, could finance the increase, he claimed.</p>

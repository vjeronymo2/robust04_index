			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladislav Stoychev on today's session of National </F> Assembly in Sofia -- live]    [Excerpt] First, a sensational piece of news: National  Assembly Deputy Veselina Rasheeva has resigned from the  chairmanship of the commission popularly known as the Clean Past  Commission, which answers to the Union of Democratic Forces  [SDS] National Coordinating Council. The commission is  responsible for carrying out Paragraph 4 of the decision of the  Sixth SDS National Conference, aimed at uncovering former  members of the BCP [Bulgarian Communist Party], leading members  of the BCP nomenklatura, and members of the Active Fighters  Against Fascism Union who have found their way into the SDS  structures.    Ms. Rasheeva's reasons for her resignation are that the  National Coordinating Council is disregarding the commission's  recommendations and, moreover, an instruction has been issued in  the council's name that the "clean past" Paragraph 4 should be  implemented selectively. Ms. Rasheeva will continue to serve as  a member of the commission. [passage omitted]</p>

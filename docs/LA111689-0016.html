			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOU CAN HELP: IF IT RESULTS IN A TIE, READER WINS  </P> <P> Jerry Donin of Pomona is wondering whether any person or company in the Los  Angeles area still makes custom neckties. Can you come up with a source, or  will Donin feel like tying one on for ever having stuck his neck out with such  a request?  </P> <P> Mary Bem of Newbury Park would like to find some Changes lipstick with aloe  vera; she claims it's the only type her husband likes on her. Can you let us  read your lips with a source, or will Bem have to fudge things a bit and wonder  whether it pays to kiss and tell?  </P> <P> Elaine F. of Alhambra is looking for Size 8 underpants with band legs and  larger-than-normal leg openings. Just My Size no longer carries them. Can you  put Elaine's hopes on a new foundation, or will she be left wondering whether  she'll ever again have a leg to stand on?  </P> <P> Reader-to-Reader Help Line: Marlene at (808) 969-7422 (collect) needs a  Panasonic Voice Talking Calculator Model JE-720U, which is no longer being  manufactured. Make sure that your actions speak louder than words by letting  your voice be heard on this matter. . . . Molly at (714) 593-6997 is looking  for the main seal (between motor and water tank) for a Rexair Model-C vacuum  cleaner that she purchased in 1949 and which obviously hasn't been produced in  years. Please see to it that Molly will soon be able to raise a lot of dust  again. . . . Patricia at (818) 287-7679 would like to locate a G.E. bonnet-type  hair dryer; the factory says that this product was discontinued about six years  ago, and Patricia says hand-held dryers don't do the job for her. We don't want  to split hairs, so please see to it that Patricia is soon dry behind the ears  again.  </P> <P> Note: The Reader-to-Reader Help Line is only for one-time items or for products  no longer available in stores. And you must give us written permission to  publish your telephone number, so that others may contact you directly.  </P> <P> For Pat Bush of La Jolla, who was in the market for a small soft-serve yogurt  maker, life should soon again be a soft touch. Earl B. Schuman of Los Angeles  says that Salton, Inc., makers of Hotray Products, manufactures two sizes of  small yogurt makers: GM-10 (family size, 2 liters), and GM 5W (1 liter).  Schuman says he bought his two at ABC Premiums on Beverly Boulevard in Los  Angeles, but most department stores should carry them. If not, the  manufacturer's address is: Salton Inc., 1260 Zerega Ave., Bronx, N.Y. 10462.  Mrs. G. O. Erickson of Ventura says she bought a small yogurt maker at Ventura  International Cookware &amp; Coffee Center, 337 E. Main St., Ventura. We even  heard from two readers who had yogurt makers they no longer needed, and we  forwarded their names to Bush in La Jolla. And Clifford Merry of Los Angeles  sent us his recipe for do-it-yourself yogurt. If interested, send a stamped,  self-addressed envelope.  </P> <P> Here are additional sources for the Click Clack game (Jacob's Ladder): Susan  Palacios says the Graber Olive House, 315 E. 4th St., Ontario, has them in the  gift shop for $4.65. And for do-it-your-selfers, Ken Slonecker sent us a page  from Popular Mechanics of December, 1985, which shows you how to make a Jacob's  Ladder easily.  </P></p>

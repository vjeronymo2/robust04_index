			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] On 22 April, between 23 and 26 persons were  allegedly killed in the coastal city of Gonaives, northwest of  Port-au-Prince, by soldiers during a police operation staged at  dawn in a working-class neighborhood, according to corroborating  sources. It is the most serious act of collective repression  committed in a provincial city since the 30 September 1991 coup  d'etat. The neighborhood [Raboteau], which is the main slum area  in Gonaives and is famous for its resistance to the Duvalier  dictatorship in 1983, is reputedly home to numerous partisans of  President-in-exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide. [passage omitted]    The [Justice and Peace] Commission, which considers an  additional investigation necessary for a final assessment of the  event, does not rule out the possibility that even more people  were killed or injured because the attackers fired on homes at a  level that would compel occupants to exit. The Justice and Peace  Commission describes the situation in Raboteau as very tragic.  The populace, men and women of all ages as well as children, had  to flee the area where gunfire was heard throughout throughout  the day on 22 April.    The Justice and Peace Commission points out that the 22  April  raid, carried out by military troops and well-known members of  the Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti,  followed a first wave of terror in Raboteau after the suspicious  burning of tires in the streets. In fact, says the Justice and  Peace Commission, the forces of order were looking for a man  named Arnault Mtayer, also known as The Cuban, which gave rise  to searches without warrants and the sacking of several houses  in Raboteau.</p>

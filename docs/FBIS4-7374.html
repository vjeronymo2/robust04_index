			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 29 (KCNA) -- A national symposium  on "For the Ultimate Solution of the Rural Question Under the  Banner of the Socialist Rural Theses", a famous work of the  great leader President Kim Il-song, was held here on Thursday.    The historical letter sent by President Kim Il-song to the  national agricultural conference on February 24, 1994, gives a  perfect exposition of the goal and tasks for the final solution  of the rural question, including the questions of continuously  pushing ahead with the three revolutions, ideological, technical  and cultural in the countryside to make the farmers  revolutionary, assimilate them to the working class and imbue  them with the socialist idea and with the chuche idea, and of  improving the technological and cultural standards of the  agricultural working people to meet the requirements for making  all the members of the society intellectually-proficient, and  carrying out the five tasks of electrification, water supply and  bus service in the rural areas and central heating and gas  systems in the rural villages to eleminate the distinctions  between the urban and the rural population in their living  conditions and complete the industrialisation and modernisation  of agruculture on a high level, and of converting cooperative  property into all-people property.    The speakers at the symposium said the work which raises the  final solution of the socialist rural question and the complete  victory of socialism as immediate practical questions and  comprehensively indicates tasks for their solution is a great  programme for the complete victory of socialism.    The work is an immortal grand programme which has further  developed in depth the theory of the working class on the  socialist rural construction and a true textbook of socialist  construction which indicates in a unique way the tasks and ways  for the ultimate solution of the socialist rural question and  the complete victory of socialism, the speakers stressed.</p>

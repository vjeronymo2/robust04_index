			<p>BFN     [Text] During a businessmen's dinner commemorating the 50th  anniversary of Fedecamaras [Venezuelan Federation of  Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry], President  Rafael Caldera said "for the private sector of the Venezuelan  economy, a public official who steals money through the  construction of public works is as reprehensible as a member of  the private sector who purchases dollars at the Central Bank of  Venezuela to resell them for an illegal profit, or he is as  reprehensible as a businessman who raises prices astronomically  under the pretext of inflation because this will increase social  groups' exasperation."    The president believes it is necessary to understand this  and  reach an agreement of solidarity "because when a salesman  disproportionately increases prices ahead of time, based on a  report that inflation may affect a specific sector of the  economy, he is engaging in an act of corruption against which we  must all fight." Corruption has invaded all sectors of  Venezuela, and we must struggle against this, not only for its  effects in the public sector but also for its effects in the  private sector, he said.    During the event, the president said "the country is  demanding a complete reorganization of public expenses, and this  entails a long, in-depth, and very serious task that must be  assigned to experienced people, but they must also have a social  sensibility and be aware of the country's reality."    Caldera said: "It is a fact we are facing very critical  economic problems, and the Fedecamaras chairman has cited a  particularly critical issue: A decrease in actual income for  Venezuelan families. This presents a series of questions, and  people often wonder about what economic policy my administration  adopted. I could answer with a quote from Simon Bolivar, the  liberator: A government's excellence does not reside in its  theory; instead, it must be adequate for the nature of the  country in which it is implemented."    He said: "We do not believe, nor do we want to believe, in  the implementation of a dogmatic policy, zero orthodoxy. We are  prepared to accept all the recommendations, formulas, and  solutions that are adequate for the current situation, the  country's nature, and its advisability for the people."    The head of state added that we are trying to overcome the  nearest obstacles, including the terrible fiscal deficit that  has compelled us to reduce public expenditures and strive to  overcome, through various formulas in our revenues sector, the  deficit provoked by a drop in oil revenues. Caldera explained  the reduction in public expenditures had to be implemented in a  short time "with a very complex budget in whose preparation we  do not participate."    He mentioned the so-called Sosa Plan, which includes tax  reforms and "demands a special sacrifice from our fellow  citizens. We know a tax on bank debits is a transitory burden;  it is like the taxes that war economies establish in certain  countries. They are essential for achieving a reasonable  balance in the area of fiscal expenditures."    President Caldera said: We have clearly announced and  sustained that position, and we said it is part of a commitment  that involves all Venezuelans: the struggle against inflation,  the defeat of inflation, or at least its reduction to acceptable  levels. It is a primary goal and not an aim per se.    The president also mentioned the need to increase domestic  and foreign private investments, and added "we are aware that in  order to accomplish this, we must try to create the necessary  conditions to attract these investments to our country." This,  he added, undoubtedly demands safety, legal as well as genuine.  We are taking great steps to improve, swiftly but also  efficiently, the problem of individual and property safety.  This is an essential objective not only of the central  government but also of the regional and municipal governments.  We are also aware that one of the obstacles to investments in  any country is inadequate safety as provided by the legal system.    He said he intends to present an initiative before Congress  that includes reforms to the Constitution, reforms "such as the  one that failed last year due to parliamentary details. The  initiative includes in-depth reforms to the judicial branch that  will allow corporations to operate without the need for a lot of  paperwork. The judicial branch will intervene when the  interests of the corporations do not correspond with those of  the justice system or the Venezuelan people."    Likewise, the president highlighted the importance of  promulgating the Concessions Law because "we have great hope in  that law, and we are preparing to launch several initiatives  aimed at encouraging investors to take on risks through this  concession system with certain guarantees." Caldera said his  government is determined to encourage an awareness of tourism  "because this sector offers great opportunities to our country  in every aspect." He invited investors to invest in the  country's tourism resorts.    Caldera cited the need for a strong and effective industrial  policy and pointed to the special commission established to  recommend steps to be taken by the government to orient and  stimulate the industrial sector.    The country is willing to proceed with the process of  privatization with regard to the Venezuelan Corporation of  Guayana [CVG] and other industries dependent on this  corporation. We are perfectly willing to enter into joint  ventures. Caldera said the government is also disposed to  encouraging investments in crude oil and gas ventures that may  be beneficial to the country.</p>

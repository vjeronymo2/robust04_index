			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> SCHOOL CUTS VOTED IN BUDGET SHORTFALL  </P> <P> The Irvine Unified School District has voted to compensate for a $2.2-million  budget shortfall in the 1990-91 year, including raising school lunch prices and  eliminating some bus service.  </P> <P> The $2.1 million in cuts for the most part will not affect classrooms, although  the board voted to cut weekly elementary school music classes for the sixth  grade and to alter scheduling for other primary grades, saving about $40,000.  </P> <P> School lunch prices will increase from $1.25 to $1.50 for high school students  and from $1.15 to $1.25 for elementary school students. Bus service will be  eliminated for some areas, though the school board has not decided which routes  will be cut.  </P> <P> In anticipation of budget shortfalls in succeeding years, board members said  they are prepared to eliminate money for all high school sports teams. The  teams cost about $600,000 a year.  </P> <P> However, board members said the teams could continue if they are funded through  such other sources as booster clubs or the city.  </P> <P> Assistant Supt. Paul Reed emphasized that cuts in athletic programs would be  needed only if the current shortfall continues.LAURA MICHAELIS  </P></p>

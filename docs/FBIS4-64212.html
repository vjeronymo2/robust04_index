			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press release issued by the UK Ministry of Defense: </F> "Statement on the Defence Estimates 1994"]    [Text] Malcolm Rifkind, Secretary of State for Defence, has  today announced publication of the 1994 Statement on Defence  Estimates.    The 1994 White Paper reports on the achievements of the  armed  forces and the Department, as well as building on the theme of  previous post-Cold War Statements -- the evolution of Britain's  defence policy, and the restructuring of its armed forces in  response to the changing strategic setting.    Mr. Rifkind points out that the restructuring programme  under  Options for Change, which is now nearing completion, "has not  altered the fact that our armed forces remain world class." He  added that "we continue our efforts to ensure the greatest  military output for the money we devote to defence."    The White Paper also emphasises that it is the Government's  firm intention, against the background of the Defence Costs  Study ("Front Line First"), to maintain Britain's front line  capabilities.</p>

			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> * "Mexicans are stupid and naturally lazy," Ruben Sierra remembers Anglo  teachers saying when he was growing up in San Antonio. "You'll be lucky if you  ever amount to much."  </P> <P> Recently named dean at Valencia's California Institute of Arts School of  Theatre after a national search, Sierra -- a playwright, actor and director --  helped found the Seattle Group Theatre in 1978 while earning a master's degree  at the University of Washington.  </P> <P> "The most exciting learning is where you're sharing," said Sierra, adding that  he'll encourage students to take risks. "Say. . . 'Let's experiment. If it  doesn't work, we'll find what does -- together.' "  </P> <P> * Samuel Mark, who heads the USC office of civic and community relations, has  been promoted to an assistant vice president at the campus. A native of Havana,  Mark created the office of Hispanic programs in USC's College of Letters, Arts  and Sciences. He is the editor of the Directory of the Hispanic Community of  the County of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> * Pediatrician Linda Velasquez's journey toward becoming a peace activist was  an odyssey that taught her "to stop being a victim and to work for those  victims of the arms race."  </P> <P> This year Velasquez earned Immaculate Heart College Center's second annual  Corita Kent Peace Award, honoring those "who, through their lives, words and  actions, express the dream of life without war."  </P> <P> Velasquez also expresses that dream through her work at the Edward Roybal  Comprehensive Health Center in East Los Angeles, where she encourages parents  to become involved in their children's education. "Parents appreciate someone  taking the time to talk to them," she said. "Well-child care is more than  making sure the baby is not dead." EDWARD J. BOYER  </P></p>

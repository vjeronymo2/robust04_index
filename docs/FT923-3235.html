			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Construction Contracts: New civic theatre in Yorkshire LAING YORKSHIRE has been awarded the contract for the Pounds 5.2m conversion of a 173-year-old listed Georgian building in Huddersfield into a theatre. Kirklees Theatre Trust selected the company to carry out the refurbishment of the former Queens Square Chapel to create a 465-seat civic theatre with small cellar theatre, foyer and bars. Designed by Kirklees Metropolitan Council design practice, the main auditorium will have a flexible layout enabling it to be set as a conventional theatre with a stage at one end and an orchestra pit or with a thrust stage. The cellar theatre will seat around 150 and will be used for alternative cabaret, fringe shows and small scale drama. The refurbishment and conversion work is due for completion in spring 1994.</p>

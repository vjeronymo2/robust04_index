For 18 months the zone has been under the control of the  Joint Peacemaking Forces: On the one side those of Moldova and  Russia, on the opposite side those of Russia and the Dniester  region. The left-bank security zone, once the scene of combat  operations, is a zone of alienation. A "quiet" war for  influence over the villages along the river is being waged there  between Chisinau and Tiraspol. Some villages have -- by  decision of their local assemblies -- placed themselves under  the Dniester region's protectorate, while some have raised the  state flag of Moldova.    The quietness in the neutral zone could be shattered:  Unresolved political problems are building up unhealthy  tension. According to local inhabitants, today's situation is  reminiscent of March 1992 -- the start of the armed conflict in  the eastern regions of Moldova.    Between Dubossary and Kochiery, whose streets run into each  other, there is a traffic control barrier. In front of the  barrier, where Russian soldiers warm themselves by a simple  fire, is the Dniester region; beyond lies the territory of  Moldova. Here plutoniers (the rank in the Moldovan police  corresponding to sergeant) stamp their feet on the frost -- an  unusual occurrence in the south. While not established by any  laws or envisaged by the United Nations, the border is  nevertheless marked out.    Vehicles are searched "for weapons" at the barrier. For the  inhabitants, particularly the children who hurry from Dubossary  to the Moldavian school in Kochiery and, the other way around,  from Kochiery to Dubossary, the barrier is opened. The ban  applies only to police, who are not allowed to show themselves  in the city in uniform. But, according to the guard post  sergeants, it is dangerous to travel to Dubossary even without  their uniforms -- if they are recognized, they are beaten up.    The Moldovan guard post appeared alongside the peacemaking  post recently, after the declaration of the special situation in  the Dniester region and in response to the militia guard post.  Both sides fear acts of provocation during the Moldovan  parliamentary elections, which will be held in Kochiery but  forbidden in Dubossary.    However, conflict could break out for reasons that have  nothing do with politics. By decision of the Dniester region  authorities 800 hectares of land in the use of Kochiery's  Viktoriya sovkhoz is being expropriated.    Ths land struggle in Dubossarskiy Rayon, which is described  by the Chisinau press as nothing less than provocation, is not  the only ground for settling accounts between the right and left  banks. Not far from Dubossary stands the only bridge across the  Dniester left intact after the fighting. On the right bank is a  Moldovan guard post, on the left bank a Dniester region guard  post. On the bridge itself is a joint guard post with Russian  peacemaking troops. Recently Russian soldiers have refused to  do duty detail on the bridge: The bridge is in a defective  state. Because of a widening lateral crack the joint monitoring  commision has banned heavy trucks from crossing the bridge.  Only cars and scheduled buses are permitted, and only then on  condition that the passengers get out. Traffic nevertheless  remains heavy. While the Moldovan and Dniester region sides are  working out who is to repair the bridge and thus control the  traffic, trucks carrying food use it, Moldovan peacemaking  troops drive tracked vehicles across it, and Turkish wagons slip  across on the quiet -- for the now customary bribe in dollars,  rubles, or leis. Only "suvorovki," the Dniester region rubles  overstamped with a picture of Suvorov, are not in use here.  "Who wants them?" They make a charge for the crossing on both  the left and the right bank. They also tell you amicably that  the bridge could collapse.    The village of Dorotskoye, like the famous Malinovka from  the well-known operetta, found itself caught between crossfire  from "left" and "right" during the armed conflict. It has  remained under dual control. There are two administrations in  the village -- the rural soviet and the Moldovan primarie [city  hall] -- and two detachments -- the police and the militia. A  battalion of Russian peacemaking forces is quartered here. The  emergency situation prevailing in the security zone is indicated  not so much by the largest number of armed men per square  kilometer in the CIS as by the frightened and anxious looks on  the local peasants' faces. They have been afraid to talk to  journalists. Just imagine having "Whites to the left of you and  Reds to the right." Albeit that the Dniester region guards are  perhaps the less welcome in the Moldovan village.    The Russian peacemakers are also "foreigners" here. A week  ago a drunken picket at the guard post on the bridge demanded  that Russian soldiers remove reinforced concrete blocks  obstructing traffic and remove themselves at the same time.  According to reports from the ordinary soldiers, they often  receive threats of reprisals. The Moldovan peasants' attitude  to the Russian soldiers is clear-cut -- they are occupiers.    Reminders that you are on foreign soil are also heard from  the Dniester region side. You will hear all manner of things  from the Cossacks and border troops whose guard posts are to be  found, according to the battalion commander, on virtually every  corner.    According to official figures the Joint Peacekmaking Forces  lost around 20 men last year. This was for a variety of  reasons, including mishandling of weapons and "drink-related"  accidents. Just before the new year the battalion in Dorotskoye  lost one of its men. The leadership of the local Moldovan  kolkhoz could not find boards to make a coffin for the  "occupier."</p>

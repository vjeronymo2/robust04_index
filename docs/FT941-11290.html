			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Threefold support for soaring Helsinki  -Interest rates, economic optimism and foreign buying Finland has begun 1994 as it ended 1993, as western Europe's top performing stock market. Already the Hex index has risen 23 per cent this year, eclipsing the optimists' wildest expectations. Mr Kim Lindstrom, managing director of UBF Fund Management, admits to being caught out by the strength of the surge. Like many commentators he expected the market to carry on rising this year, but at a much slower rate than in 1993 when the Hex climbed 91 per cent. 'At the start of the year, I thought share prices would rise by 25 to 30 per cent this year; now 35 to 40 per cent looks more likely,' he says. At yesterday's close of 1,962 the Hex is within striking distance of its 1989 all-time high of 2,009. Most analysts regard the scaling of this peak as a mere formality - a matter of weeks, at most. Three factors continue to drive the market. One is the dramatic slide in interest rates; the Bank of Finland's 5.25 per cent base rate is at its lowest for 40 years. This has led to a significant switching out of bank deposits and, with further cuts in rates expected, there has been an explosive growth in mutual funds, which are thought to be funnelling as much as 80 per cent of their funds into domestic equities. On one estimate, mutual funds now have FM5bn (Dollars 900m) under management, against just FM570m at the end of 1992. The second factor is the marked increase in optimism about Finland's economic outlook. GNP is expected to rise this year for the first time since 1990; the current account should move strongly into surplus; and there are even suggestions that Finland's 20 per cent unemployment rate has reached its peak. A dramatic improvement in corporate profitability is underpinning the optimism. Finally, there is foreign buying. Foreigners accounted for much of 1993's big surge on the Helsinki bourse, after restrictions on foreign share ownership were relaxed at the start of the year. They remain net investors, thanks to the fundamentals and because a strengthening of the Finnish markka is providing favourable currency exposure. Signs that the market has entered a new phase are apparent from the way that buying preferences have started to change. In recent days, banking and finance companies, construction issues and real estate investment groups have come to the fore, eclipsing the big export groups which led the way during 1993. Forestry, one of the star sectors of 1993, has underperformed the market this year with a gain of a relatively modest 12 per cent. As worries about overheating grow, the market advance will inevitably slow and become less sure. The rise will be dampened further by an increase in equity supply. A number of groups are expected to launch new share issues to rebuild recession-weakened balance sheets. There is also a good chance that the government, finally, will launch its privatisation programme. One suggestion is that it will initially seek to sell off chunks in state-controlled companies already listed, such as Enso-Gutzeit, the forestry group; Valmet, in paper machinery; and Outokumpu, in mining. The relatively small size of the Helsinki stock exchange - total market capitalisation is only around FM160bn - has always made it one of Europe's more volatile markets. With foreigners now accounting for an estimated FM30bn of that total, the dangers of sudden lurches are all the greater, particularly if overseas institutions decide to lock in profits or find more attractive investments elsewhere. Few anticipate a sudden foreign pull-out as things stand. But there is concern about developments in the country's giant eastern neighbour, Russia, where the political climate has changed following the successful showing of the nationalist Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky in December's parliamentary elections. So far the stock market has shrugged off the Zhirinovsky factor, but should his pronouncements end up being more than mere talk, Helsinki will be one of the bourses to suffer most.</p>

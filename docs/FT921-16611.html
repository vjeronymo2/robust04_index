			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Failed French TV station seeks rescue AN ADMINISTRATOR is expected to be appointed within the next few days to take charge of La Cinq, the French television station which earlier this week filed for bankruptcy, and to try to hammer out a rescue package for the channel. La Cinq, which has for some months been struggling against mounting losses, filed for court protection against its creditors on Tuesday thereby becoming the first significant casualty of the French government's television deregulation drive. The administrator will analyse the state of affairs at the station and try to devise a way of enabling it to stay on air. The collapse of La Cinq, which was launched in 1986, marks a serious setback for Hachette, the heavily-indebted French media group that has been running the channel for the past 18 months. Hachette is, together with Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the controversial Italian media mogul, the biggest shareholder in La Cinq with each owning 25 per cent of the equity. Hachette first invested in La Cinq in May 1990 as part of the strategy devised by Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, its president, to turn the group into a major player in television. The decision to file for bankruptcy followed Hachette's failure to implement a drastic cost cutting package  - which would have shed 292 of the station's 537 permanent staff and 292 out of 372 temporary employees leaving it to broadcast with a team of just 27 journalists. Hachette, which has extensive interests in French book and newspaper publishing as well as owning the rights to Elle magazine, incurred hefty borrowings after a series of US acquisitions. Last week it told the Conseil Superieur de l'Audiovisuel, the body that regulates the French TV system, that it would not provide any additional capital for La Cinq, which lost an estimated FFr1.12bn (Pounds 115.6m) - slightly more than its overall turnover - in 1991 contributing to accumulated losses of around FFr3bn. Other existing shareholders also refused to pour more money into La Cinq. The other investors include Mr Robert Hersant, the right-wing French newspaper baron, with 7.5 per cent and the French banks - Credit Lyonnais, Societe Generale and Credit Commercial de France - together with GAN, one of France's largest insurance groups, and Kleinwort Benson, the London-based bank. La Cinq has had a chequered history in its six years on the air. Its introduction, combined with the privatisation of TF1 and the launches of Canal Plus and M6 formed part of a TV deregulation programme intended to offer new channels to French viewers by bringing private capital into the system. However, La Cinq, which styled itself as 'family station' in spite of being best known in France for its late night soft pornography, never really succeeded in attracting enough viewers or advertising revenue.</p>

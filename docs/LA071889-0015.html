			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FOREST FIRE BLAMED ON DUMPED ASHES  </P> <P> A brush fire that burned 2,250 acres in the Green Valley and Lake Elizabeth  areas late last month was caused by a resident who dumped hot ashes from a  wood-burning stove, officials said Monday.  </P> <P> The resident, whom authorities declined to identify, could be charged with a  misdemeanor for starting a fire by negligence, said Special Agent Wayne Crowder  of the U.S. Forest Service. "The fire was not intentionally set. We have his  admission that he had been dumping out hot stove ashes there for quite some  time."  </P> <P> Crowder said he will interview more potential witnesses before a decision on  charges is made.  </P> <P> Investigators sent a report on the fire to U.S. Forest Service lawyers in San  Francisco, who could file a civil suit against the man.  </P> <P> The ashes reportedly were dumped on the morning of June 28, shortly before the  fire roared northwest through heavy brush in the Angeles National Forest and  burned for two days.  </P> <P> The blaze began near El Clavelito Road south of the San Francisquito Campground  in the northwestern part of Green Valley. It destroyed one house and several  outbuildings.  </P></p>

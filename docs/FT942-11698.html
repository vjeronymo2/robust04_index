			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of Greater Philadelphia (3): New authority spans the river - Old rivalries will be buried when two ports merge The Delaware River is the axis which defines the Philadelphia region. The city and its neighbouring communities grew up around the wharves and warehouses that have thrived along its banks since the days of William Penn. At the same time, the Delaware is a natural barrier, splitting the region in two. The states of Pennsylvania and New Jersey have traditionally viewed the river as the demarcation line in a struggle over the spoils of the maritime trade. It is an age-old rivalry which is finally coming to an end. After decades of political wrangling, a preliminary agreement to form a bi-state port authority was reached last December. The agency, which will co-ordinate the activities of publicly owned marine facilities on both sides of the river, is expected to hold its first board meeting in May. It is the first step in an merger process which will take two years to complete. Proponents of unification believe the move will hone the region's competitive edge as a shipping centre. 'The ports will put less effort into competing with one another and more into competing with other North Atlantic ports,' says Joseph Menta, a spokesman for the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority (PRPA), which owns piers and freight terminals on the Pennsylvania side. 'The entire port community supports the move,' says Mr Tom Kelly, head of the powerful Philadelphia Marine Trade Association, which represents about 40 private steamship and stevedore companies along the river. 'It is something that had to happen if we were to remain competitive.' The ports of the Delaware Valley already rank among the busiest along the eastern seaboard. Taken together, their facilities handle some 70m metric tons of international cargo a year, more than any other port on the east coast, including New York, Baltimore and Norfolk. More winter fruit passes through Philadelphia and Camden than any other port in the US, and they lead the eastern seaboard in imports of meat, paper products and steel. Last year, when ports around the country were experiencing a slowdown, Philadelphia and Camden managed to increase tonnage. Still, the two sides have expended too much effort in fighting over the same cargo, port officials say. By underbidding one another, the rivalry effectively forced the states to take up more of the tab, in the form of higher port operating subsidies. Under a plan approved in December, the PRPA will combine its resources with those of its counterparts across the river, the South Jersey Port Corporation. The merged entity, known as the Ports of Philadelphia and Camden, will become a subisidiary of yet another agency, the Delaware River Port Authority (DRPA), which operates a regional mass-transit system and four suspension bridges over the river. The DRPA is already involved in promoting the regional ports through a network of international offices organised under its world trade division. But its role as trade ambassador created some confusion among overseas shippers. At some point in negotiating a contract, the agency had to defer to the relevant state authority, which would complete the deal. The fresh approach is intended to bring more coherence to the task, says the Rev Nicholas Rashford, president of St Joseph's University in Philadelphia and chairman of the DRPA. 'What is going to change is that the people on the operating level will be doing the marketing,' he says, 'I think that will make us much more effective.' Even critics of the merger agree that the ports, with the DRPA's assistance, have done a good job of selling themselves, but some question whether the unified agency will do any better. Leo Donovan, a consultant with Booz, Allen and Hamilton, recommended against the merger after conducting an early study on unification. 'Both ports are thriving by competing in their own markets,' he argues. Philadelphia moves large volumes of Chilean fruit, Australian meat, Finnish paper and steel through its terminals. Camden, which lacks facilities to handle containerised cargoes, is strong in lumber, scrap metal and other bulk industrial commodities. The merger, Mr Donovan says, would not necessarily make the ports more competitive against other regions and would not create the economies of scale necessary to make their operations more efficient. 'The danger is that it would lead to a monopoly which would encourage 'feather-bedding' and patronage' in the staffing of the bi-state agency, says Mr Donovan. Competition between the two had kept workforce levels and labour costs in check, he says. Mr Rashford says Mr Donovan's criticisms do not take into account the principal benefit of unification - enabling the ports to consolidate their capital investment programmes. Paul Drayton, executive director of DRPA, said the agency would make available Dollars 300m over the next three to five years for port investment and other economic development projects. The money will come from the huge cash surplus which the DRPA generates by collecting bridge tolls. The agency has already made a big port-related investment with the construction of Amerport, an 'intermodal' rail transfer facility opened on the Philadelphia waterfront two years ago. Amerport gives shippers of intermodal containers - suitable for transport by rail, truck or ship - immediate access to three full-service railways linking the port with most of the US and Canada. The only terminal on the east coast offering such extensive rail connections, it has proved so successful that an expansion is already being considered. 'The idea is to have one agency looking at the big picture, not two looking after their own narrow interests,' says Mr Drayton. Instead of duplicating projects, the unified port authority would have the power to develop the two sides in a complementary fashion, he says. But the DRPA has already raised controversy in its development efforts. Some Dollars 50m in financing was approved in the waning days of last year, with most of the money earmarked for projects unrelated to the port, such as a Philadelphia skating rink and improvements to an aquarium in Camden. Mr Drayton declines to comment on last year's spending decisions, which were made before his appointment. But he says the DRPA would make funds available for both types of development, although it was not holding out 'an open checkbook'. 'Infrastructural investment has to made in the port,' he says, but these are not the kind of investments in which you are going to see a direct return.' Where the private investors were unwilling to step in, the DRPA would consider the broad economic impact of its spending decisions, he says. But one of the tasks facing the new authority, in its role as regional development co-ordinator, is determining which of its activities, if any, should be turned over to the private sector. 'For the region to prosper, it isn't important which operator gets the cargo, as long as someone in the area gets the cargo,' says Joesph Diemer, a spokesman for the DRPA.</p>

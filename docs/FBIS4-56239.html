			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 28 Apr (EFE) -- Argentine Economy  Minister Domingo Cavallo today charged the U.S. Government with  creating "an adverse political atmosphere" by announcing the  implementation of economic sanctions if Buenos Aires does not  approve a patents law on pharmaceuticals, including the payment  of royalties to foreign laboratories.    Presidential Media Secretary Raul Burzaco told journalists  that despite U.S. pressure, Cavallo, who now is in Washington,  informed Argentine President Carlos Menem that Argentina  "remains in the race to enter NAFTA."    Burzaco indicated that the cabinet and the president  reviewed  the situation raised by the government of U.S. President Bill  Clinton after Menem said on 27 April that "Argentina will not  cease to function" if Washington implements sanctions against  his country.    Cavallo told U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor that  Washington's pressure "will make more difficult the approval of  a patents law on pharmaceuticals" in Argentina, a law that  Congress has been studying for two years.    Argentine laboratories, which have a 56-percent share of the  local pharmaceuticals market with yearly sales totaling $3  billion, challenge the payment of royalties, involving annual  payments of $500 million to foreign laboratories, mostly U.S.  laboratories.</p>

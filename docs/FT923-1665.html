			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Bryant bounces back with 97% advance to Pounds 20.3m BRYANT GROUP bounced back in the 12 months to May 31 with a 97 per cent advance in pre-tax profits to Pounds 20.3m, against a depressed Pounds 10.3m. Last time the West Midlands-based housebuilding and construction company made provisions of Pounds 12m  - Pounds 8m for house sites and Pounds 4m for property developments. In the period under review, this had fallen to Pounds 5m, split Pounds 2m and Pounds 3m respectively. Operating profits rose 37 per cent to Pounds 21.4m (Pounds 15.6m). The Pounds 10m pre-tax increase was struck on turnover ahead at Pounds 322.9m (Pounds 282.8m) and against a background of continued depressed confidence in the housing market. However, Mr Andrew Mackenzie, managing director, said that the company would continue to expand organically  - in Yorkshire, where Bryant has seven sites, and in the north-west, where it has six. Although further geographical spread, especially in the north, is likely, acquisitions are 'extremely unlikely', he said. House sales increased 25 per cent to 2,330, split evenly between the south and the core central areas, even though the average selling price fell to Pounds 86,000 (Pounds 90,000). This produced a 73 per cent climb in operating profits to Pounds 15.6m (Pounds 9m) on turnover of Pounds 196.6m (Pounds 159m). However, house sales had slowed recently, Mr Mackenzie said. With prices in the land market becoming 'more realistic', Mr Chris Bryant, chairman, said that the land bank had grown to nearly 10,000 plots with planning status. Year-end borrowings were Pounds 15.6m, giving gearing of 8 per cent (5 per cent). It would not, according to Mr Michael Chapman, finance director, be pushed above 20 per cent by future land purchases, Associated undertakings' borrowings fell to Pounds 21.7m (Pounds 25.4m). 'A broad mix to spread the risk,' said Mr Chapman, was the recipe in the construction side, where operating profits rose by Pounds 2m to Pounds 4.6m. Turnover was Pounds 100.5m (Pounds 97.4m) but is likely to fall to the Pounds 60m mark in the current year. There were Pounds 24m of property sales, and lettings stand at 80 per cent. Profits declined to Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 4m) on turnover of Pounds 27.3m (Pounds 32.7m). The final dividend is unchanged at 3.4p for a total of 4.8p, covered 1.2 times by earnings of 5.5p per share. COMMENT With the housing market still in deep recession, Bryant has helped itself with prudent provisioning made extensive enough  - some Pounds 30m so far  - and, more importantly, early enough. It has made a virtue of selling at a price to find buyers and avoiding having to rely on sweetening deals to make sales. Its low plot costs have let this strategy work, as the results show. Although house prices have slipped, Bryant has increased volumes with more or less the same overhead  - the number of sites rose from 85 to 90. Forecast profits of Pounds 22m pre-tax for the current year give a multiple of 15.9. That, and a safe yield of about 7 per cent make the stock attractive within the sector.</p>

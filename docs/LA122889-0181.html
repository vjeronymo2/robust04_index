			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> SIMI VALLEY STREET TO BE RUNWAY  </P> <P> A plane that ran low on fuel and made an emergency landing in a field in Simi  Valley was expected to be cleared for takeoff today from a rural residential  street west of the city, authorities said.  </P> <P> Simi Valley police said the single-engine Cessna, piloted by Michael L. Dimeco  and carrying his wife and two young children, landed at 5 p.m. Wednesday in the  vacant field at the southeast corner of Madera Road and Los Angeles Street.  </P> <P> Dimeco told police the plane was almost out of fuel and he had radio  communication problems that prevented him from contacting an airport.  </P> <P> "That corner is the only one that's not developed," Lt. Dick Thomas said. "It  was the only place to land in that area."  </P> <P> Police did not know where Dimeco was headed when forced to land.  </P> <P> The Ventura County Transportation Department granted Dimeco a permit this  morning allowing the refueled plane to take off from Tierra Rejado Road, about  a mile from where it landed.  </P> <P> The California Highway Patrol said officers would stop traffic for the takeoff.  </P></p>

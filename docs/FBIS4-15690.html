			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "News Bulletin" No. 474] </F>   [Text] Vilnius, April 8, ELTA -- Lithuanian radio and TV  board has appealed to the government asking to allot money to  re-transmit "Ostankino" TV and "Mayak" radio programmes in  Lithuania. The board chairman Gediminas Ilgunas confirmed this  in a news conference on Friday [8 April].    If the government approves the offer, "Ostankino" programme  would be seen shorter than previously: daily from 18.00 until  the end or 45 hours a week. It would cost about 800,000 Lt  [litas] a year, Ilgunas said.    Programme of "Mayak" radio is suggested to broadcast only in  ultra-short range daily from 7.00 to 24.00.    Shortening of the programme or refusing it is determined by  the fact that "Ostankino" company that had earlier paid for  re-transmission of its programmes in Lithuania now refused to do  that. At the moment, the company is heavily indebted to  Lithuanian communication services.    Free time of the 2nd TV channel where only "Ostankino"  programmes had been shown is planned to lease for private TV  companies in a competition.</p>

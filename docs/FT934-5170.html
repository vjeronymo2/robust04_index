			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Modest plan for polls: Let Hong Kong's people decide how China should be handled The moment of truth for Hong Kong's governor, Chris Patten, has at last arrived. Seven months of talks have left him scarcely any nearer agreement with China than when he started, and time has run out. He has to introduce legislation within the next week or two, enabling local elections to be held next year. He can wait a bit longer, but at most a few months, before tabling a bill to fix the arrangements for choosing a new Legislative Council (LegCo) in 1995. From a distance it seems strange that so much energy is being expended by both sides on such small details. Why should China care what assembly is elected in 1995, and by what method, when sovereignty reverts to it in 1997 anyway? And why should Britain bother to insist on a slightly more representative LegCo for the last year and three quarters of its 150-year rule? The whole argument centres on the notion of the 'through train', under which the LegCo elected in 1995 is supposed to stay in office through the transfer of power, until 1999. The very fact that China is being so difficult about the 1995 elections suggests that Mr Patten may be on to something. If the Chinese leadership had no qualms about dissolving LegCo and derailing the through train as soon as it gained sovereignty in Hong Kong, it would not care what happened in 1995. Clearly it does have qualms. It knows that in 1997 'the eyes of the world' will be on Hong Kong. Not that it cares about the eyes of the world as such. But there is good reason to suppose it does care about the eyes of the US Congress, and also those of the population of Taiwan. Trade with the US, and peaceful reunification of Taiwan with the mainland, are both important elements in Chinese policy. Both could be severely damaged if China has to begin its rule in Hong Kong by dismissing the chosen representatives of Hong Kong's people. Such an act could well provoke mass demonstrations, which might have to be suppressed with violence and even bloodshed. It would look bad. That doesn't mean it won't happen. It could hardly look worse than Tiananmen Square in June 1989. If China's rulers believe an act of spectacular repression is the only way to prevent Hong Kong infecting the rest of China with instability, they are unlikely to shrink from it. But no doubt they would rather avoid it. Therefore their first preference was to win British co-operation in procuring a docile LegCo in 1995. That Mr Patten seems determined to refuse. Their next choice will probably be to use their influence in the existing LegCo to emasculate Mr Patten's proposals on their way to the statute book. To that, Mr Patten seems half resigned - to the extent that some Hong Kong democrats suspect a secret Anglo-Chinese understanding to proceed that way, giving China what it wants while saving Mr Patten's face. The trouble with that conspiracy theory is that not much of Mr Patten's face would be saved. He would still have to accept a humiliating defeat, and he could not even claim convincingly that he was bowing to the wishes of the people of Hong Kong. The defeat would be inflicted on him not by the directly elected representatives of the people but by those of the unreformed functional constituencies or 'rotten boroughs', controlled by businessmen whose economic interests depend more and more obviously on Beijing's goodwill. He would be cancelling Christmas after putting it to a show of wings among the turkeys. That would not leave him with much authority during the remaining three years of his term. Those who say Mr Patten's policies involve risks for Hong Kong are right. But Hong Kong democrats also have a point when they say it is for the people of Hong Kong, rather than Britain, to decide whether those risks are worth taking. The problem is that letting them decide would in itself involve taking the risk. Should Mr Patten put his proposals to a referendum? I think not. Even if that did not provoke China to an extreme reaction, it would lead to a polarised and confrontational debate in Hong Kong, leaving no room for compromises. What is needed is an elected assembly, more representative than the existing LegCo yet not prejudging, by its very existence, the issue in dispute with China. I have a suggestion. Why not hold elections now? Ordinary British-style elections, one person one vote. No functional constituencies, 'election committee' or other colonial nonsense. Hold them for an assembly with no pretensions to last beyond 1997, but with an explicit mandate to advise the governor how to run the colony, and how to deal with China, during the last three years of British rule. If the assembly advised Mr Patten to take risks, at least the risks would be run by those giving the advice. If it advised him to accommodate Chinese wishes, at least it would be clear that Britain was doing what the majority of Hong Kong people wanted. Of course, China would not like this idea. But that is not the main reason why it will not be adopted. There is another thought, much more alarming to the minds of ministers in Whitehall: the thought that such an assembly might reopen the issue of right of abode in the UK for British passport-holders. Granting that right is the one action still in Britain's power which would offer security to people in Hong Kong after 1997. As long as the UK refuses it, Mr Patten should not be surprised if Hong Kong residents are more and more anxious to keep in Beijing's good books, and less and less interested in the minutiae of an electoral system which is guaranteed not to last.</p>

			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHITE HOUSE PRESSING SENATORS TO PUBLICLY BACK TOWER  </P> <P> The White House, concerned that opposition by Senate Armed Services Committee  Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) could derail John Tower's nomination as secretary of  defense, is privately pressing senators to endorse Tower publicly without  waiting for a final FBI report on his background.  </P> <P> Nunn, obviously nettled that the lobbying is taking place before the final  report is filed, declared Tuesday that he will wait and examine the document  before deciding how to vote on the nomination in committee.  </P> <P> And he said he expects most senators of both parties to await the committee's  recommendation before making a commitment on how they will vote when the  nomination comes before the full Senate.  </P> <P> President Bush, according to informed sources, ordered the lobbying effort  after Nunn told him at a private meeting on Feb. 7 that he had "serious  concerns" about certain allegations involving Tower. Nunn told Bush that, if a  committee vote were taken at that time, as some had urged, he "would vote no  because of those concerns."  </P> <P> Nunn, as well as other senators on the committee, were known to have expressed  concern about allegations involving excessive drinking and an accusation by a  suspect in the Pentagon procurement fraud investigation that illegal  contributions had been channeled to Tower's campaign when Tower was a senator.  </P> <P> With the FBI continuing to investigate those allegations, the committee agreed  last Wednesday to delay any action on the nomination until after the Senate  returns next Tuesday from a recess.  </P> <P> The investigation is now being concluded and a report should be completed in a  few days. A source familiar with the inquiry said that no "smoking gun" had  been found.  </P> <P> Marlin Fitzwater, White House press secretary, said Tuesday that Frederick D.  McClure, Bush's assistant for legislative affairs, is leading the White House  lobbying effort for Tower's nomination and that several senators had agreed to  "speak out" for Tower.  </P> <P> Fitzwater, interviewed at a luncheon session with editors and reporters of The  Times' Washington Bureau, at first said that several Democratic senators were  among those who would speak out but refused to name any. Later, after checking  with McClure, Fitzwater said that there are no commitments from Democrats and  that the lobbying is confined to Republican senators.  </P> <P> However, sources familiar with the lobbying told The Times that the effort is  aimed at lining up Democratic senators also. And one Democratic member of the  committee, who asked not to be identified, said that he has been contacted but  told the White House that he plans to support Nunn in whatever position he  takes.  </P> <P> Nunn said that there is nothing "inappropriate" about the White House lobbying.  But he said it is strange that the Administration would be pressing senators to  speak out before the final FBI report has been filed, especially because White  House counsel C. Boyden Gray has told him that it "would not be proper" for the  committee to make a decision before seeing the report.  </P> <P> Another committee member, Sen. Timothy E. Wirth (D-Colo.), said: "I find it  incredible, extraordinary, that they're asking us not to take a position until  we have the report but they are urging others to take a position."  </P> <P> Wirth said that Nunn is the key to Tower's fate. If the chairman votes against  him, the Democratic-controlled Senate probably will reject the nomination. "It  all depends on Sam," Wirth said. "Everybody has such respect for Sam, and he's  very cautious."  </P> <P> Another committee member, Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), is "very, very troubled"  by inconsistencies in Tower's statements about his consulting work for British  Aerospace Inc., an aide to Levin said. The aide said it is likely that Levin  will ask that Tower be recalled to testify about the discrepancies.  </P> <P> Tower told the committee two weeks ago that he represented the British aircraft  and weapons maker only on civil aviation matters, such as the sale of  commercial jets. But, in a divorce deposition taken in June, 1987, Tower stated  that he had given the company advice on "selling certain systems to the Defense  Department."  </P> <P> Tower sat on the board of directors of the U.S. subsidiary of the British firm  and was paid more than $260,000 during the 2 1/2 years that he was associated  with the company.  </P> <P> A Tower attorney said that the divorce deposition was a casual accounting of  what he did for British Aerospace and a number of other defense contractors and  was not meant to be a definitive statement of his consulting business. He said  that the more recent statement to the committee is accurate.  </P> <P> However, when Tower registered as a legislative lobbyist in February, 1988, he  explicitly listed British Aerospace as a "defense contractor" and not as merely  a manufacturer of commercial aircraft.  </P> <P> Staff writers John M. Broder and Ronald J. Ostrow in Washington contributed to  this story.  </P></p>

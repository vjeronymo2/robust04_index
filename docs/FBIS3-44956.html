			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "PWC's Pressure Point"] </F>   [Text] China's Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) for the  post-1997 administration has put the Hong Kong Government in a  very difficult spot. It has asked to consult civil servants as  it develops plans and policies for the future. It is a clever  request which squeezes a tender pressure point. What, after  all, could better help a smooth transition than advice from  those who know the workings of government? The Government  yesterday responded to the PWC's initial specific request by  warning that the Secretary for Economic Services, Gordon Siu  Kwing-chue, would not be allowed to appear before the committee  in Beijing. It further made it clear it had no plans to relax  its wider ban on official civil service contacts with the PWC.  But how that edict holds up as time passes may become a test of  the Government's self-confidence in the final years of British  rule.    By inviting civil servants to appear before it, the PWC has  challenged Chris Patten's authority over his staff and presented  him with a profound dilemma.    Mr Patten has strong arguments for refusing to let his  officials talk to the PWC. Nothing would give more credibility  and legitimacy to what is, to all intents and purposes, the Hong  Kong takeover committee. The PWC has no official status in  Sino-British relations and cannot take the decisions for which  the Joint Liaison Group (JLG) was set up. But treating it as  though it were a legitimate body would tend to sideline the JLG  and turn it into a rubber stamp. The influence of Britain and  its governor would wane as his civil service switched its  attentions, information, and advice to China. The Legislative  Council would become an increasingly irrelevant talking shop.  And the loyalty of civil servants would be divided: which  government would be their real master?    But if Mr Patten maintained his ban, he would be accused of  a  lack of cooperation and of undermining the smooth transfer of  sovereignty. That in itself would not worry him. What would be  harder to ignore is that as China develops the authority of the  PWC, it will gain importance in the lives of Hong Kong people.  If China continued to block progress in the JLG, the PWC might  usurp some of its functions. Starving it of the information it  needs to make the best decisions might be damaging to the  territory in the long run. Further, as 1997 draws nearer,  advising the PWC might be the best way for the Hong Kong  Government to influence its thinking and, therefore, the  policies to be pursued over the longer term.    Here is the core of Mr Patten's dilemma. If he allows  cooperation now, he might be forced into the role of  co-conspirator in China's plans to reduce his influence. But if  he rejects cooperation outright, over time he risks reducing his  chance to influence developments.    Mr Patten's own strategy centres on building up Legco's  authority. But this task has been made harder by China's threat  to disband the territory's parliament after 1997. So the PWC's  request for contact with civil servants is not one that can be  easily met with automatic and total rejection. It is an issue  to which Mr Patten must give further deep and serious thought.</p>

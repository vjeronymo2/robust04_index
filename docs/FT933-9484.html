			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / 'Archaic' licensing rules attacked THE Consumers' Association has urged the government to abolish the 'unnecessarily archaic and complicated' liquor licensing system. 'The present system is woefully out of date in meeting customer needs,' the association says in response to a Home Office consultation paper on possible reforms of the law in England and Wales. The association adds: 'It represents the single most effective barrier to potential new entrants into the retail beer market. Liberalisation of the laws would make the market more accessible . . . and go some way towards challenging the market power maintained by the established brewers through their tied estates.' Other methods of regulation could ensure that the public interest was protected, the association says. Unscrupulous operators who serve alcohol to children, for example, could be banned from the trade. Issues affecting the suitability of premises, or questions of noise and nuisance, could be dealt with by enforcement of planning laws. If the government persists with the present system, administered by licensing justices, then 'any degree of liberalisation would be a step in the right direction', the association says. Statutory grounds for refusing licences should be instituted, it says. 'We are concerned that the current system, which allows the justices such wide discretionary powers, is neither transparent nor fair.' Refusal of a pub licence on grounds of lack of need or demand in a locality should be abolished, the association adds. 'Need should be decided in the marketplace itself.' The association also supports greater relaxation of opening hours. It is particularly critical of restrictions on Sunday afternoons and their effect on the tourist trade.</p>

			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Survey of the Canary Islands (5): Captive market for bananas  -Growers look to Gonzalez to secure German support WHEN German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Spanish President Felipe Gonzalez meet in Lanzarote next month, their discussions will centre largely on a matter of some importance to their peoples - bananas. The two leaders may, for all that is known, loathe bananas, but the citizens of their countries do not: Germans love to eat them, and Canarios love to sell them. The Canaries retain a monopoly over the Spanish market, an anomaly granted them by the European Community but which is due to be phased out by 1996. Nearly all of the islands' annual banana exports, which amounted to roughly 400,000 tonnes valued at Pta25bn last year, are shipped to Spain. That captive market is set to be flung open to non-EC producers. The EC is the world's largest banana market, consuming almost 37 per cent of the world's 7.9m tonnes exported in 1988, but the 12 member states run three different import regimes. The German method is the most liberal; the EC's biggest importer operates an annual quota, which is raised annually in line with demand and is met almost entirely by the cheaper and larger produce from the so-called 'dollar area' of Central America. Under current EC rules, 46 per cent of banana supplies comes from protected sources, normally possessions or former colonies of EC member states. The other 54 per cent largely comes from Central America. All EC countries, except Germany, have a 20 per cent tariff against Central American bananas. Preferential and duty-free access to the UK market is granted to the Windward Islands, Jamaica and Belize. The European Commission has wavered on the issue of its members having different attitudes to imports, making the Lanzarote meeting of crucial importance to Canarian banana producers. With their islands about to become fully integrated with the EC, they expect Mr Gonzalez to secure Chancellor Kohl's support for an internal EC regime beneficial to the Canaries. For the Germans, the banana is equally symbolic; exemption from common tariff rules governing the fruit was a key condition for West Germany's signature of the the Treaty of Rome. Last December, when the commission gave the green light for full integration of the Canaries (at the original behest of the islands' autonomous parliament), it indirectly raised the question of what will happen to the Canaries' agriculture, which accounts for 12 out of every 100 jobs. Bananas and tomatoes represent 70 per cent of agricultural production and 60 per cent of the total value of exports. According to Mr Juan Sans, adviser for the EC in the department of agriculture of the Canaries' government, 'there is enormous pressure being applied at Brussels by Central American producers of bananas, who are basically in the hands of three or four large oligopolies. 'They want to see completely free and unhindered entry to the EC market, because they can produce more cheaply thanks to lower wages and better climatic conditions. 'Such free entry for their produce would, purely and simply, mean the disappearance of the Canaries and other producers. That would be a catastrophe, not just for the workers on the islands but for the shipping fleets and so forth', he says. A number of 'non-papers' are currently under consideration in Brussels. Spain has not yet officially defined its position, though this may alter after the Lanzarote meeting. But canny Canarios are already willing to bet that Germans will soon have to start paying more for their bananas, which are likely to come from Tenerife rather than Tegucigalpa. However, full EC integration, implying adhesion to the Common Agricultural Policy, would also mean that other important local crops - such as tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers and pineapples - would gain unrestricted access to the EC market. Furthermore, the islands are likely to benefit from an EC programme of assistance worth some Pta3.7bn over three years, aimed at reducing Canarian agriculture's dependence on bananas. In any event, the deal currently being worked out in Brussels would guarantee the Canaries their captive banana market in Spain until 1996.</p>

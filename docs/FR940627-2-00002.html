Under section 702 of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;39), the Secretary of Agriculture must conduct an investigation and make a determination as to the validity of the allegations no later than 30 days after receiving a complaint.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the investigation of the Director of the Dairy, Livestock and Poultry Division, Foreign Agricultural Service, conducted pursuant to the regulations at 7 CFR 6.40&hyph;.44, I have determined that the duty-paid wholesale price during the period December 1993 through April 1994 in the New York-New Jersey market area was $1.55 per pound, $1.56 per pound, and $1.12 per pound for Swiss cheese blocks imported from Austria, Denmark, and Germany, respectively. I have also determined that during the same period in the same market area, the duty-paid wholesale price was $1.80 per pound and $1.69 per pound for cuts, slices, loaves, etc., of Swiss cheese imported from Denmark and Germany, respectively. During the same period in the same market area, I have determined that the price for Swiss cheese trims and end pieces imported from Austria was $1.37 per pound. In addition, I have determined that the domestic wholesale market price during the period December 1993 through April 1994 for U.S. produced Swiss cheese in the New York-New Jersey market area was $1.76 for blocks, $1.85 cuts, slices, loaves, etc., and $1.54 for trims and end pieces.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, Department of Commerce, has determined that the average daily export restitution payment provided by the European Union during the investigation period was $0.74 per pound for Swiss cheese imported from Denmark and $0.73 per pound for Swiss cheese imported from Germany. In the case of subsidies provided by the Government of Austria export restitution payments ranged from $1.847 per pound to $2.261 per pound during the investigation period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I have, therefore, determined that price undercutting of U.S. produced Swiss cheese in the United States by imported subsidized quota Swiss cheese from Austria, Denmark, and Germany is taking place, and I have notified the United States Trade Representative accordingly.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Done at Washington, D.C. this 21st day of June, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </ACTION> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Richard Rominger, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Acting Secretary of Agriculture.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;15503 Filed 6&hyph;22&hyph;94; 1:34 pm] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;10&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

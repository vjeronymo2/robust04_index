			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Lisbon urges sharper EC trade policy PORTUGAL will press for closer links between the European Community's trade and industrial policies during its current six-month EC presidency, according to Mr Luis Fernando Mira Amaral, the Portuguese industry and energy minister. He said in an interview that Portugal fully supports moves by Mr Jacques Delors, the EC Commission president, to introduce measures in the Community's next financial package to improve the competitiveness of European industry against a sharpening challenge from the US, Japan and newly industrialised countries. This was made more urgent by the trade liberalisation envisaged in the Uruguay Round negotiations. Such moves had to be accompanied by measures to strengthen Europe's industrial competitiveness. 'There is no idea of returning to protectionism,' he said, emphasising that existing agreements between the EC and Japan for the motor industry already implied the development of to help Europe's car industry. This should be extended not only to sectors such as aerospace and electronics, but also to traditional industries such as textiles. A Community policy to boost industrial competitiveness was a logical 'internal' counterpart to its external trade policy, he said.</p>

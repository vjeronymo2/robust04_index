			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Priority for pampered pets BRITISH consumers spend, on average, 15 times as much as Greeks on pet food  -but less on buying food for themselves and their families than citizens of any European Community country except Portugal. The British also take more holidays than any other European nation and read more daily newspapers than any of their Continental neighbours. Those snapshots emerge from a survey of spending patterns by Woolwich Building Society, which claims that in spite of the recession Britons are better off than consumers in many other parts of the EC. Judging by the Pounds 343 a year they each spend on alcohol, second only to the Danes, the British might appear to be a nation of dipsomaniacs. The figure mainly reflects high prices, however. UK consumption of wine and spirits is low by European standards and beer consumption only average. Children seem not to be over-indulged in Britain. Annual spending on toys and games, at Pounds 18 a head, is below the Pounds 33 in France and less even than the Pounds 22 the average Briton spends on pet food. Mrs Thatcher's vision of Britain as a nation of homeowners takes something of a knock. Although 65 per cent of Britons are owner-occupiers, the proportion is higher in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain.</p>

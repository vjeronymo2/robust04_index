			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After the FCA published the proposed rule, the General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accounting Office (GAO) issued a report entitled ``Farm  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Credit System: Repayment of Federal Assistance and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Competitive Position'' (GAO/GGD&hyph;94&hyph;39, dated March 10, 1994),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which recommended that the FCA require the System to exclude  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Farm Credit Insurance Fund (Insurance Fund) from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> System's combined financial statements because of the GAO's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> view that exclusion is the most appropriate accounting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment. On May 10, 1994, the FCA responded to the GAO's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendation in a letter to Congressional committees which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described the FCA's approach to Insurance Fund reporting as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflected in this rulemaking. The final regulations require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the System prepare the Systemwide combined financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principles (GAAP), provide supplemental financial statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data with and without the Insurance Fund, and give a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thorough discussion and analysis of the fund in the report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to investors. The FCA believes that these regulations, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted, will ensure that investors are provided with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meaningful information regarding the Insurance Fund and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect of the fund on the System's financial position.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Provided below are a section-by-section analysis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes to the proposed rule and FCA responses to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Section-by-Section Analysis of Public Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Section 630.2_Definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Section 630.2(b) and (h)_Definitions of ``Combined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Financial Statements'' and ``Systemwide Combined Financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Statements''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For preparation of the Systemwide combined financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statements, the final rule requires that each bank provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Funding Corporation with bank-only financial data as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well as with combined financial data of the bank and its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related associations. The FCC and the FCBB commented that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed regulations should be clarified to address how  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the consolidated financial data of a bank and its wholly-owned subsidiaries should be reported in the Systemwide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disclosure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To distinguish financial data prepared on a combined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis from that prepared on a consolidated basis, a new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of ``combined financial statements'' has been added  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in &sect;630.2(b) of the final rule. The definition is added to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarify that combined financial statements are prepared by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> group of affiliated entities that share the same financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest regardless of whether any of the entities has the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability to exercise control over another. In contrast,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consolidated financial statements are prepared by a parent-entity to include the financial data of subsidiaries that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are under its ``control.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To prevent this newly added definition of ``combined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial statements'' from being confused with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of ``Systemwide combined financial statements''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contained in &sect;630.2(g) of the proposed rule, proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;630.2(g) has been simplified to define ``Systemwide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combined financial statements'' as the combined financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statements required by this part. Proposed &sect;630.2(g) also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is redesignated as &sect;630.2(h). The proposed language  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifying the purpose for which the Systemwide combined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial statements are prepared has been moved and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combined with provisions pertinent to financial statements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in &sect;630.20(l).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Proposed Definition of ``Material''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 630.2(f) of the proposed regulations provided a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of ``material'' similar to that found in Securities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 405. The FCA received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two comments on the proposed definition of ``material.'' The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AICPA asserted that defining ``material'' other than as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established in accounting literature would be confusing and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inconsistent if audits of the Systemwide combined financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statements are required to be performed in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS). The AICPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended either deleting the proposed definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``material'' or amending it to refer to the materiality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition in GAAS or in Financial Accounting Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Board Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 2,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Qualitative Characteristics of Accounting Information (FAC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCA notes that the definition of ``material'' in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule was intended to govern information presented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outside the basic financial statements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Regardless of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed definition, the Systemwide combined financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statements required by this part are subject to materiality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria established in GAAP. Specifically, pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;630.3(c), <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the Systemwide combined financial statements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be prepared in accordance with the accounting and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting standards set forth in part 621 of this chapter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because &sect;621.2(g) defines the term ``material'' in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with FAC No. 2, the GAAP definition of ``material'' contained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in part 621 of this chapter will govern the System's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preparation of Systemwide combined financial statements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, materiality judgments for preparation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Systemwide combined financial statements must be made in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with GAAP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Information presented ``outside'' the basic financial statements refers to information that is not considered necessary for presentation of financial position, results of operations, or cashflows in conformity with GAAP,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> management's discussion and analysis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 630.3(c) provides that ``All items of essentially the same character as items required to be reported in the reports of condition and performance pursuant to part 621 of this chapter shall be prepared in accordance with the rules set forth in part 621 of this chapter.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

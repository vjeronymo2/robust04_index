			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> A CHILLING LOOK AT THE KING OF THE ARCTIC;  </P> <P> WHITE BEAR; ENCOUNTERS WITH THE MASTER OF THE ARCTIC ICE BY CHARLES T. FEAZEL  HENRY HOLT$22.50, 240 PAGES  </P> <P> "When the watchdog growls at the door, someone's coming," goes the conventional  wisdom of the Arctic. "When it hides under the table, look out for bears!"  </P> <P> We are offered this ominous advice by Charles T. Feazel in "White Bear," an  intimate account of Ursus maritimus, a creature that most of us encounter only  in the sterile confines of a zoo.  </P> <P> The book is an irresistible armchair adventure, a natural history of the  Arctic, an anthropological study of its native peoples, and -- above all -- a  fascinating collection of the lore and legend of the polar bear.  </P> <P> "Always, it seems, the bear is waiting," Feazel writes. "Throughout the  centuries there have been only three constants in the Arctic: the white and the  cold and the bears."  </P> <P> Feazel, a geologist by training and an adventurer at heart, encountered the  polar bear during various expeditions in the polar region.  </P> <P> At an average weight of 1,000 pounds, he tells us, the polar bear is the  largest predator on earth. A polar bear may stand taller than 10 feet, with a  reach of 14 feet, and it can easily outrun a person through ice and snow.  </P> <P> And a polar bear, so cuddly in appearance, will eat almost anything, from  rodents to stranded whales -- even its own young:  </P> <P> "In mute testimony to this natural process," Feazel writes, "tiny claws of cubs  are sometimes found in polar bear droppings."  </P> <P> The great beast is both a living creature and a totem of immense potency to the  native dwellers of the Arctic.  </P> <P> "Nanook," as the bear is known, "was clearly the most powerful element in the  lives of such people," Feazel explains. "He determined the patterns of their  lives and often the circumstances of their death. Awesome and awful, he  possessed a majesty innately worthy of worship."  </P> <P> What impresses Feazel most, however, is the marvelously utilitarian design and  function of the polar bear's anatomy. Tooth, bone, fur and blubber have evolved  into an ideal technology for survival in the Arctic.  </P> <P> In fact, the polar bear is so well-suited to the frigid temperatures of the  polar winter that its greatest peril is heat and hunger in summertime: "A polar  bear may have to live for half a year without a meal during the ice-free  season," Feazel explains, "when he can't hunt effectively."  </P> <P> The polar bear is still hunted by the native peoples of the Arctic, but -- as  Feazel warns -- the real enemies of "Nanook" are the intrusions of the modern  world into the once-pristine environment of the Arctic.  </P> <P> Today, the polar bear is at risk from chemicals and heavy metals in the food  chain, the detritus of oil drilling (and oil spills), and even the threat of  global warming.  </P> <P> Still, Feazel reminds us that the most urgent threat of all are poachers and  pampered tourists armed with high-powered rifles: Shooting is still the most  frequent cause of death among polar bears.  </P> <P> Feazel never strays far from hard science, and his prose is only rarely lyrical  or rhapsodic. But he cannot resist the temptation to anthropomorphize the polar  bear.  </P> <P> He repeatedly depicts "Nanook" in human-like postures: "Picture a flamboyant  prizefighter, arrogant in his heavy fur coat, mugging for the camera." He  speculates that bears kill more prey than they can eat for "the sheer pleasure  of the kill."  </P> <P> And Feazel, an earnest and good-natured storyteller, is not above a pun. "The  end of this tale," he quips, after a top-to-bottom inventory of the polar  bear's anatomy, "is the end of the tail."  </P> <P> Next: Judith Freeman reviews "Sirens" by Stephen Pett (Vintage).  </P></p>

Thai Government sources said the new deadline was discussed  at a joint meeting of representatives of the Interior and the  Foreign ministries, the National Security Council, the Army the  Customs and Forestry departments and the Immigration Police.    The Foreign Ministry told the meeting that Cambodian Finance  Minister Sam Rangsi had informed them that Phnom Penh had  extended the deadline from December 31 to March 31.    The Interior Ministry asked the Foreign Ministry to confirm  the new deadline to enable it to extend the opening of temporary  border passes to allow importation of the wood.    The meeting agreed it would help Thailand if agencies  involved were able to negotiate with Phnom Penh to extend new  logging concessions to Thai businessmen after the deadline.    Thailand now needs 9.4 million cubic metres of wood  annually.  It has been importing three million cubic metres each year.  [passage omitted]</p>

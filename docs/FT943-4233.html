			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: BTR Nylex shares drop 10% as result disappoints market Shares in BTR Nylex, the Australian-based industrial group which is controlled by BTR of the UK, fell more than 10 per cent yesterday after the company announced profits which disappointed the market. The company made a profit after tax and minorities of ADollars 207m (USDollars 153m) in the half-year to June 30, a 6 per cent improvement on the comparable 1993 figure of ADollars 195.3m. Many analysts, however, had been expecting profits of around ADollars 240m. The share price closed on the Australian Exchange at ADollars 2.88, down 30 cents on the day and close to the 52-week low of ADollars 2.76. The stock's 52-week high was ADollars 3.58. Sales were up by 9.5 per cent at ADollars 3.15bn, while earnings per share advanced by 2.7 per cent, to 7.7 cents. The interim dividend goes up to 5.25 cents from 5 cents. Progress looked more significant at the pre-tax level, with profits rising by 14.4 per cent to ADollars 354.1m, although this was partly due to slightly lower finance charges of ADollars 74.5m. The company said that there had been a 'significant upturn in results for the Australasian business', helped by productivity gains and the improving economy. North America 'produced outstanding results' and in Europe, Rockware Glass began to benefit from recent reorganisation and capital investment programmes. There was an improved performance from the Taiwan Polymer business, while investments in China contributed 'positively'. BTR Nylex added that order inflow in recent months had appeared to be 'strengthening and sustainable', and suggested that the 'momentum for improvement' should continue.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 11 May -- The Black Sea Fleet problem has  moved beyond the departmental framework and assumed state  importance. A system of radical proposals on the future of the  fleet is now being prepared by the Ministries of Foreign  Affairs, Defense, Economy, and others. The proposals will be  examined at the highest level, Lieutenant General Valeriy  Manilov, deputy secretary of the Russian Federation Security  Council, said in an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent.    According to him, it is also impossible to resolve the  question of conducting the joint Russian-U.S. command and staff  exercises on a departmental level. We need to analyze the  political, economic, military-technical, and financial aspects  of the exercises, the general said.    Conclusions and suggestions that should also give  consideration to the general public opinion should form the  basis of decisions on the future of the Black Sea Fleet and on  holding the Russian-U.S. military exercises, Manilov stressed.  He said that the Security Council has already made its position  clear to the Russian president, but at the same time, did not  reveal the essence of this position.</p>

			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROSTENKOWSKI TELLS MAYORS THEY WON'T SHARE IN 'PEACE DIVIDEND'  </P> <P> A leading congressional Democrat bluntly told the nation's mayors Monday that  they stood no chance of getting billions -- or even millions -- more for urban  programs from expected federal defense savings.  </P> <P> "There's no money for such programs until the budget blockade is broken," House  Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski told the U.S. Conference of  Mayors. "The 'peace dividend' is already going to be swallowed."  </P> <P> Rostenkowski's address to the more than 200 mayors discouraged a group that for  three days had been making the case that cities need a multibillion-dollar  infusion from the federal government to fight drugs, poverty, housing,  education and other problems.  </P> <P> Rostenkowski came home to Chicago to tell the mayors they would be going it  alone.  </P> <P> "Yours is not an easy task," the congressman said in a speech blaming the  Ronald Reagan Administration for most festering urban problems. He said also  that Congress was far from ready to come to the aid of mayors and that  taxpayers were unlikely to support higher taxes to help cities.  </P> <P> "He devastated everybody," Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn said.  </P> <P> Later, the mayors heard a somewhat more encouraging talk from Sen. Bob Kerrey  (D-Neb.). Still, even Kerrey said that "peace dividend" money will not "fall  like manna from heaven" to cities. The mayors' best hope is to sell their ideas  to voters, much like Reagan sold his military buildup in the early 1980s,  Kerrey said.  </P> <P> During the weekend, the mayors crafted an ambitious, costly plan for attacking  urban problems.  </P> <P> The centerpiece of the plan was a demand that money from the programs come from  expected defense cuts, with the mayors seeking half of whatever savings  materialize. Rostenkowski's speech, in effect, made much of the mayors' new  lobbying agenda appear moot even before it gets final approval Wednesday.  </P> <P> Rostenkowski said that he personally would support most of the mayors' causes  but he decided in advance of the speech not to offer an upbeat prognosis.  </P></p>

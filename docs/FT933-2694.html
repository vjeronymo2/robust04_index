			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / People: Crabtree Colin McAusland has moved from the FKI group, where he has spent the past five years as managing director of Huwood International, to become managing director of CRABTREE of Gateshead, producers of metal decorating equipment. McAusland's move is, at least geographically, a small step; Huwood, suppliers of equipment to the mining industry, and Crabtree are barely a mile apart on the Team Valley estate in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear. During his time at Huwood he turned the business from a heavy lossmaker to a profitmaker for FKI. The Crabtree Group, which floated in June, is now seeking a substantial acquisition. McAusland, 48, is succeeded at Huwood by Alan Davidson, formerly financial director.</p>

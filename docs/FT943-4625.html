			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / India broadens investment access The Indian government yesterday approved 32 proposals for foreign direct investment worth Rs3bn (Pounds 62m), bringing the total since the introduction of its reform programme in 1991 to more than Rs164bn, Shiraz Sidhva reports from New Delhi. A Finance Ministry committee, which had cleared the proposals, said in a statement that some of the investments had projected export earnings of nearly Rs7bn over a period of five years. Projects include the establishment of a holding company, BPL Finance, by Sanyo Electric of Japan and its Indian partner, BPL Electronics. Sanyo's clearance comes two weeks after a fully owned manufacturing and marketing venture by another Japanese electronic giant, Sony, was approved.</p>

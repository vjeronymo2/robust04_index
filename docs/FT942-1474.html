			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / All things not being equal in Canada . . . : . . . . means that a country with negative inflation has had to raise interest rates Canada has notched up two very different records in economic performance over the past few days. Statistics Canada announced late last week that, alone among industrial countries, inflation had disappeared. The Bank of Canada's dogged six-year battle against inflation, reinforced by cuts in tobacco taxes, was rewarded with a 0.2 per cent drop in consumer prices in the year to May. At the same time however, Canadians are reeling from some of the industrial world's steepest jumps in interest rates. The Bank of Canada's trend-setting Bank rate has climbed from a 30-year low of 3.87 per cent in early February to 7.09 per cent this week. Commercial banks this week lifted their prime lending rate to 8 per cent. Towering real interest rates have raised fears that the economic recovery, which seemed to be gaining strength from a fragile start, could be in jeopardy. The Toronto stock exchange's TSE-300 index hit its lowest level of the year on Tuesday, 22 per cent below its peak last March. The prospect of sharply higher debt-service payments also risks undermining a recent drive by the federal government and the 10 provinces to contain their budget deficits. The federal government last February projected a drop in its deficit to CDollars 39.7bn (Pounds 18.8bn) in the year to March 31 1995 from CDollars 45.7bn last year. But the estimate was based on a long-term bond rate of 6.1 per cent, far below the current yield of 9.5 per cent. Finance department officials have warned their minister Mr Paul Martin that his budget projections are being derailed. But Mr Martin, whose relationship with his senior civil servants is said to be cool, is confident that the aberration will turn out to be temporary. 'As economists are wont to put it: if everything else is unchanged, lower inflation will bring about lower interest rates,' says Bank of Montreal chief economist Mr Lloyd Atkinson. 'But not everything remained unchanged.' Canada has been side-swiped by the upheaval in global markets since the US Federal Reserve began tightening monetary policy in February. The bond market, like that in the US, has suffered from the scare caused by higher oil, wheat, copper and other commodity prices. But Canada is also paying an extra price for fiscal laxity and political uncertainty. As one commentator noted in yesterday's Globe and Mail newspaper: 'If high rates are justified in Germany and higher rates are justified in the US, then especially high rates are going to be visited upon profligate, politically divided Canada.' The federal government and the 10 provinces have amassed a mountain of public sector debt over the past decade. Their combined debt burden has ballooned in the past 12 years from 43 per cent to 97 per cent of gross domestic product. The ratio is set to rise to 108 per cent in 1997, even if governments achieve the deficit-cutting targets they have set themselves. The jitters are reflected in a widening spread between yields on Canadian and US government long bonds. The gap has grown from less than 1 percentage point in February, when it looked as if Ottawa's success in curbing inflation might bring Canadian interest rates down to US levels, to 2.1 percentage points. On the political front, nervousness is again rising as the debate over Quebec's future moves to centre stage before elections in the francophone province this autumn. The uncertainty is reflected in the gap between yields on long-term bonds issued by Quebec and neighbouring Ontario, which has widened by one-fifth of a percentage point since the end of April. The separatist Parti Quebecois, which has pledged to call an independence referendum within a year of taking office, is well ahead in public opinion polls. PQ leader Mr Jacques Parizeau did not endear himself to the investment community with threats earlier this month that a PQ government might cut off business with banks and securities dealers that publicise the potential costs of independence. But the turmoil in financial markets has given the federalist side some badly-needed ammunition. Mr Jean Chretien, the prime minister, assured parliament on Tuesday that interest rates would drop if the ruling Liberals were re-elected. Few economists would disagree. Another consolation for the Liberals is that their leader Mr Daniel Johnson remains personally more popular than Mr Parizeau. For the time being however, in Mr Atkinson's words, 'there is ample reason to believe that the air will be filled with uncertainty for months to come - an outcome that is likely to produce not only a lot of volatility potentially, but much higher interest rates on average than would otherwise be the case.' The ups and downs have been amplified by the rising involvement of foreign investors, estimated to hold almost half Canada's total debt. Their view that Canada is a potentially high-yielding but fickle investment is likely to make for roller-coaster markets.</p>

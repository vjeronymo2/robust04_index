			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: CLAREMONT;  </P> <P> SEWER FEES TO INCREASE  </P> <P> The annual sewer service fees for single-family dwellings and apartments will  jump from $6 to $37.48 as a result of a 4-1 vote by the City Council Tuesday.  </P> <P> The new revenue would be used to establish a fund for maintenance of the city  sewer system and sewer-line repair and replacement.  </P> <P> Algird G. Leiga was the only council member to oppose the higher rates, which  are effective April 1. He said an increase of more than 600% could not be  justified in a time of rising federal and state taxes.  </P> <P> But other council members argued that the move would be fiscally responsible in  the long run because regular upkeep of the sewer system would prevent costly  repairs.  </P> <P> Last fiscal year, the city's sewer service fees generated $89,384 in revenue,  but $118,864 was spent for minimal cleaning and emergency repairs. The  additional money came from the city's general fund, according to city staff  members.  </P> <P> The ordinance approved Tuesday increases the average annual fee for industrial  plants from $154 to about $1,500. Fees for restaurants would range from $100 to  more than $500, depending on size; currently all restaurants are assessed an  annual fee of $6.  </P></p>

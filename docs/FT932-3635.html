			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Private View: When every citizen has his shout - Democracy was invented 2,500 years ago in Athens. Scholar and diplomat Sir David Hunt discusses whether we have improved on it LONDON will be treated next week to the spectacle of an Athenian trireme of the Fifth Century BC - the fastest, sleekest wooden warship in history - paddling down the river Thames to call on the mother of parliaments at Westminster. The trireme Olympias has been freighted from Piraeus to provide the climax to a little-remarked anniversary: the invention of democracy 2,500 years ago in Athens, by Cleisthenes the Alcmaeonid. As it happens, Olympias is more than a symbol of the technological cunning and maritime imperialism of ancient Attica, more than a symbol of the Greeks' political legacy. She is also a product of British philhellenism. Until a few years ago most experts said the trireme, a two-masted ramming machine powered by 170 citizen oarsmen arranged in three tiers, was a mechanical impossibility. Then two British scholars, John Morrison, a classics professor, and John Coates, a former chief naval architect at the Ministry of Defence, assembled the evidence, reconstructed the design and persuaded the Greek navy to build it. The Athenian trireme turned out to be real. But how real was Athenian democracy? I took the question to Sir David Hunt, a classical scholar and diplomat, a 79-year-old polymath and polyglot who is married, as it happens, to a Greek-Cypriot wife. Sir David trained as an archaeologist and has what is usually called a first-class mind. His retirement hobbies, when he is not devouring books (at present the essays of A E Housman and the plays of Aphra Behn), include reaching the finals of The Times crossword championship and winning - twice  -the Mastermind challenge on television. He got a First at Oxford, naturally, and became a Fellow of Magdalen College. During the second world war he served on General Alexander's staff. Later he was seconded as private secretary to both Clement Attlee and Winston Churchill before becoming high commissioner to Nigeria (during the Biafra War), Uganda, Cyprus and ambassador to Brazil. His discourse is encyclopaedic and interjected with phrases I had thought extinct, such as 'Bless my soul]' and 'Capital]'. But the old-buffer act is a ploy. As they say in clubland, Sir David knows his stuff. He explained how in 508-7 BC Cleisthenes the Alcmaeonid proclaimed the doctrine of 'isonomia', or equality under the law, and reorganised the voters into 139 constituencies to elect the Committee of Five Hundred (equivalent to the British House of Commons). He left intact the Council of the Areopagus, consisting of former magistrates (like the House of Lords) but all laws proposed by the 'parliament' were to be submitted to the ekklesia, the mass meeting of citizens (no women, no slaves) in the market place. 'This is the vital difference between Greek and present-day democracy (I shall treat Britain as a perfect democracy),' he said. 'One is participatory and the other is representational.' I mentioned the row over Maastricht and public demands for a referendum. Should we bring back the ekklesia? We would not have to go to the market place. With television we could vote at the touch of a button . . . 'The danger is, first, that you put perhaps an oversimplified question to the electorate. Second, if people as a whole are consulted you are very liable to get false reactions. If I may refer to Thucydides, that was illustrated by the debate about the revolt of Mytilene in which the demagogue Cleon incited the assembly (in 427 BC) to decide to execute all the males and sell the women into slavery. The next day another demagogue reversed it and a 'fast trireme' was sent to overtake the first. Voters may be swayed by oversentimental arguments.' Is that worse than being swayed by slogans got up by an advertising agency for the purposes of winning a general election? 'Don't forget that for the purposes of winning a plebiscite advertising agencies on both sides will also be inventing slogans,' he replied. Sir David regrets the decline of the classical art of rhetoric, which in Britain he associates with Stanley Baldwin's hatred of the flowery-tongued David Lloyd George. On top of that, television required that a speaker should look good. 'In the days of Abraham Lincoln you had to have something, some ideas. Now you make a few cracks thought up by your staff, to last not more than 40 seconds.' In ancient Athens, political participation was seen as a civic duty. The problem of backsliders was simply dealt with. On voting days a couple of slaves would be sent through the agora carrying a rope dyed red and herding the people towards the assembly place. Any citizen found with red on his clothes was fined. Because modern citizens are not permitted to vote between elections, I suggested, their participation was feeble. Should we bring back the red rope? 'I think you're exaggerating there,' Sir David said. 'In Britain you do get a turnout of about 80 per cent, whereas in the US 51 per cent is considered pretty good. Of course in some countries voting is compulsory. I don't think we do too badly.' Another feature of ancient democracies was that certain public officials were chosen by lot. Any merit in that? 'No. It may give you someone hopeless. Balloting may do too, of course, but at least there is some kind of reason why you've got that one. More often than not it produces outstandingly good results . . . think of the way the parliamentary system won the last war. We were told so many times by Hitler and Mussolini that democracies were inefficient talking shops and what was wanted was firm leadership.' And we gave Hitler half of Europe . . . ' . . . before we beat him. Yes, I agree with you there. But in the end, when it came to the real crunch, the athletic, 'scientific' dictatorships lost.' What about ostracism? Is that a good device? 'Alas, no. They discovered a method of defeating it.' In a political trial of strength the two antagonists learnt to collaborate and instructed their supporters to mark their potsherds (ostraka) with the name of a third party. Thus the pro-war demagogue Hyperbolus in 417 BC found himself sandwiched between Alcibiades and Nicias. He was sent to Samos where he was later murdered. Was Norman Lamont ostracised? 'Yes, I think he was.' Sir David meant that the former chancellor could be seen as the proxy victim of an internal party contest, sacrificed to public (that is, press) opinion. The Athenians had factions but no real political parties. Was that preferable? 'I believe the development of parties to be the most important thing in the whole democratic process,' Sir David said. 'You cannot really carry on a proper discussion of public affairs unless you can get up a debate and you can't get up a debate if everybody is a man of goodwill and agrees with each other. You must get 'em going, you must have debate, and therefore you must have parties.' I asked: doesn't history show that democracy is a rather rare and unnatural thing? 'Certainly if you take the whole of history from 800 BC to 330 AD, the period occupied by democracy was pretty short, I agree. But on the whole it was the best time. They did best under democracy. It is what they chose when they were free, independent and powerful. And I think the same is true of modern times.' Due partly to the influence of Plato and Aristotle (neither of them keen democrats) there was a long hiatus, through the Middle Ages and up to the modern age, when democracy languished except in places such as Iceland and Switzerland. 'And maybe Andorra', he added, 'though I'm not all that strong on the medieval history of Andorra'. Developing countries today - in Africa for example - though they did not practise democracy at least claimed to do so. 'Usually they are gangs of crooks, murderers and thieves who are there simply for the purpose of taking money from every source they can find and putting it into Swiss bank accounts - and they still call themselves the People's Democracy of Whatever-it-may-be. It's the tribute vice pays to virtue.' Is our idea of democracy really the same as the Athenians'? Isn't ours much less mechanical, much more about individual liberty? 'I really do believe ancient Greek democracy was libertarian in its ideals. I really do think the motive behind democracy was that one man was as good as another. 'Alright, I can think of plenty of exceptions - add in women, and you've got a very large exception. Nevertheless, it is a fact that Greeks - the Greeks I'm talking about now, Athenians in the sixth century - really did think that one man ought to be as good as another, at any rate in the way he was treated. They knew people are not really equal: they must be treated as if they were. This is a political fiction, if you like, but an exceptionally useful fiction.' Was this idealism, or rather the suspicion that if you did not pretend to treat people equally eventually they would come with pitchforks and tip you out? 'I think the former. It was partly religious, partly the rationalising of Ionians who liked to treat men as atoms - different in terms of individuality but important in the mass.' I was not quite ready to let go: nevertheless, aren't we guilty of taking too sentimental a view of ancient Greece? 'Yes is the answer to that - and a jolly good thing too,' harrumphed Sir David. 'But I see what you mean and I will now reply properly to your question: 'The Greek democracies had many abhorrent tendencies. This was pointed out, I may say, by Greek observers at the time. The extreme democrats of Athens were at the same time the most brutal imperialists. They were not sentimentalists - they never had an 18th century. 'But, they did have an ideology in favour of freedom. It was a fact you could always get a majority in the assembly in favour of saying all Greeks everywhere ought to be free. You didn't give a damn about barbarians, but Greeks ought to govern themselves, dammit] 'Although I've been condemning 'em, they had their bright side. And it was this side that has the hope for the future. Because in the world as a whole it is a good idea that people everywhere should be free to govern themselves. It's quite likely they will govern themselves better than other people will govern them.'</p>

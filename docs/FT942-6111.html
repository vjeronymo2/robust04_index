			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / The strange myth of the panicking small investor Take away the liquidity of mutual funds and what do you have left? Not surprisingly the mutual fund industry has reacted negatively to the recent suggestion of Henry Kaufman that curbs should be placed on mutual fund dealing, notably a 60-day or 90-day waiting period before investors could sell their shares in stock or bond funds. The practicalities of such a proposal are certainly suspect. The aim would be to protect the securities markets from the destabilising waves of selling by panicking small investors. Holdings of equities through mutual funds have grown from Dollars 180bn to Dollars 700bn since the Wall Street crash of October 1987. In theory the US stock market is that much more exposed to a wave of fund liquidation. But a mutual fund curb might backfire. Piles of selling orders would accumulate at investment company offices. The exact total volume might not be generally known, but the fund managers would immediately begin to build up liquidity in anticipation of the eventual redemptions. Elsewhere, traders would front-run the anticipated wave of transactions. The markets would prove to be just as volatile, but in the event of a crash mutual fund investors would be the last to get out. So why pick on mutual fund investors? There is evidence that they are relatively stable in their behaviour, and that some kinds of institutional investor are more prone to fickle attitudes. Hedge funds are obvious examples. It is true that anxieties are being expressed at present about the low cash positions of some US mutual funds. The more volatile and aggressive small cap funds, for example, have seen some cash outflows recently. On the other hand, managers can point to the relative steadiness of investors' nerves in past crises. In modern mutual fund history, monthly outflows have never come close to exceeding the industry's aggregate cash position (though individual funds may have encountered problems). In the UK, too, general panic withdrawals from unit trusts are unknown. It is true that inflows can be very sensitive to financial conditions, notably the level of interest rates available on savings deposits, but once invested the money stays put for a relatively long time. Even after the 1987 crash, the unit trust industry only suffered net redemptions in two individual months, and then on a trivial scale. So why single out mutual fund investors for restriction? The Kaufman theory appears to be that the big expansion in holdings has reflected the participation of inexperienced investors shifting out of deposits and unaccustomed to the idea of price volatility. However, much of the growth may reflect a tendency for households to own mutual funds rather than stocks directly - though direct personal holdings still account for 50 per cent of corporate equities in the US. Another important trend is for investors to own mutual funds through long-term savings plans such as IRAs (individual retirement accounts). At the end of last year nearly Dollars 450bn of mutual fund holdings were tied up in various types of personal and corporate retirement plans. Mutual funds hold just 11 per cent of US equities, less than a quarter of the direct holdings of households, so to single out mutual funds for trading curbs would put them at a disadvantage. In practice, money would move into directly invested portfolios and into other institutionalised accounts which managed to escape trading limitations. If there is a volatility problem with open-ended funds it may be different to the one that Henry Kaufman perceives: it is not that investors rush in a dangerous way for the exit but that they plunge into the market at the wrong time. We have just seen this in the UK, where a record for net sales was set in March. Mutual fund sales have, of course, long been a key indicator for contrarian investors. Amateur money pushes the markets to unsustainable peaks, and the commercial reputation of the industry suffers because so many customers lured in at the top lose money quickly. Perhaps it would be better, for their own protection, though not for any systemic reasons, if investors were required to wait 90 days before putting their money in. They could safely be allowed to take it out again any time they liked.</p>

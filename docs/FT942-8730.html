			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / MPs renew attack on Welsh Office A committee of MPs today attacked 'unacceptable' standards in the Welsh Office, alleging incorrect payments and missing audits covering millions of pounds. In the latest of a series of investigations in Wales by the public accounts committee, the MPs said that records involving Pounds 120m were missing while audited claims for Pounds 37m 'could not be located'. Last week, the chairman of The Development Board for Rural Wales, Mr Glyn Davies, resigned in the wake of a critical report by the committee on housing policy and a staff car scheme. There was also a damning report on the Welsh Development Agency last year. In its report today, the committee notes with 'dismay' that accounts on road spending at the Welsh Office could not be approved for five successive years because they were not in proper order.</p>

The party had  been unable to survive for four years before the serious  incidents recently seen within its ranks took place; because of  the impossibility of finding a consensus between the factions,  these events led to a final division, which will no doubt not  have a good influence on the unity of the Albanians in this  former Yugoslav republic.    The early second congress held a few days ago in Tetovo  could  not achieve its own objective. After initial disagreements over  what were called unimportant issues, but which were in fact not  insignificant, a number of delegates, deputies, and government  members left the hall and held their own congress in another  hall in Tetovo. Thus, two parallel congresses were held. It is  worth mentioning that, after the walkout, Dr. Ali Aliu, Dr.  Rexhep Gjergji, and Edita Tahiri, the representatives of the  Kosova Democratic Alliance [LDK], also left the congress where  Menduh Thaci's supporters remained.    The origins of the division, like those of every split, go  back a long way. One of the main factors was the weapons  affairs, which Menduh Thaci's wing used to strike hard at the  party leadership. The Albanian Democratic Party [PD] helped him  in this attack, as did in particular the Albanian state media,  which used the basest epithets for the PDP leadership, including  even "quislings," "bootlickers," and "agents of Belgrade."  Besides this, PD officials have several times taken part in  events organized by Menduh Thaci's wing, to the extent that the  Macedonian prime minister himself called this "interference in  the Macedonian state's internal affairs." The more careful  policy of the LDK contrasts with that of the Tirana PD. The LDK  has tried to find ways to smooth over and settle the  disagreements within the PDP. It is not significant that,  whereas the LDK representatives not only did not greet the  congress but left the hall, the PD representative Tritan Shehu  remained to greet the congress of Menduh Thaci's wing.    In relation to the internal concerns of this party, Albanian  Television has been unable to overcome its now familiar and  persistent bias and objectively inform the public in Albania and  via satellite in the diaspora about what is happening. This  shows both its lack of independence and its total subordination  to the ruling party in Albania. This was best shown by the  introduction to the interview given by Tritan Shehu, PD delegate  to the congress, in which the television journalist was not only  unable to describe what had happened at the congress, but put  himself in the position of a lackey, thus confusing the public  even further. This is because media such as the newspaper  RILINDJA reported that two congresses were held in Tetovo and  two presidiums were elected, while Mr. Shehu asserted the  opposite. In fact, one congress elected Arber Xhaferi as  chairman, while that opposing Menduh Thaci's line, at which  ministers and deputies were present, elected as chairman  Xheladin Murati, deputy chairman of the Macedonian Parliament.    The split in the PDP and the two parallel congresses have  taken place at a time when the Albanians in Macedonia are facing  two important events: First, the census, and second, next  autumn's general elections. One asks whether the Albanians are  better placed to cope with these events divided or united. How  will the Albanians appear at the coming elections, and how many  parties will represent them in solving their problems? Will  they succeed in achieving as good a representation as hitherto  in the Macedonian state authorities, or better? These questions  arise because the political forces that hitherto produced most  results in this field are now divided. However, there is  another worry: What will be the future strategy of the  Albanians in Macedonia? Will they participate in the Macedonian  state as before or abandon all its structures? A seed sown  today will of course bear fruit later, and this fruit may be to  the benefit of the Albanians in Macedonia. In conclusion, we  note that Mr. Arber Xhaferi, PDP chairman according to Menduh  Thaci's line, began work immediately after his election by  meeting journalists and the CSCE representative in Skopje. At  his meeting with journalists immediately after the congress, he  said, "I am assuming this post with great anxiety, because many  political processes have been carried through in Macedonia, and  they must now be reversed." One asks what political processes  must be reversed, to what extent, and by when....</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec ministers gather for a tough bargaining session MINISTERS OF the Organisation of Oil Exporting Countries gather in Geneva today to negotiate a new production quota for the third quarter of this year. The indications are that bargaining will be tough and oil prices have weakened in the run-up to the meeting in the expectation that the oil producing cartel will continue to exceed its self-imposed production ceiling. Analysts say that Opec production has recently amounted to about 600,000 barrels a day more than the official 23.6m b/d total, with Iran, Kuwait and Nigeria the main culprits. Given the uncertainty in the market, a roll-over of the present arrangements might seem the most logical outcome. However Opec will have to consider Kuwait's demand for an increase in its quota from 1.6m b/d to over 2m b/d now that its oil industry is getting back into shape. Kuwaiti officials have touring other Opec members ahead of the meeting to lobby for a bigger share. The outlook for oil demand shows only a small growth, but the coming period will be influenced by stock building ahead of the winter months, and this extra demand could provide Opec with the leeway it needs. Estimates of the likely stock build vary between 600,000 and 800,000 b/d, meaning that total demand for Opec oil could rise above 25m b/d in the period ahead. If Opec ministers decide the raise the ceiling they will have to choose whether to share out the additional production on a pro rata basis, or on the basis of capacity. Analysts at the London-based Centre for Global Energy Studies say that a pro rata agreement would principally benefit Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, but a capacity-based deal would mainly benefit Iran. In both cases, Nigeria would have to cut output. The centre says Opec is in a difficult position, but will probably be forced into a compromise based on a combination of the two approaches.</p>

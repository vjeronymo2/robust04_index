			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> CAMPUS ACTS TO CUT DRINKING  </P> <P> Administrators at what Playboy magazine once labeled the nation's top party  college are considering policies aimed at reducing students' alcohol intake. If  the new policies take effect at 16,000-student Cal State Chico this fall, there  no longer will be beer company-sponsored keg rolls for charity, advertisements  for alcohol in the student newspaper or drinking mugs in the bookstore.  University President Robin Wilson suggests that such actions would "meliorate  the effects of Chico State's sad reputation as a bibulous institution." He was  referring to publicity about a riot by drunken students at the university's  annual Pioneer Days celebration in the spring of 1987, which was preceded by  Playboy's designation of CSUC as the nation's top party school. Wilson, a  former CIA agent, later canceled further celebrations of Pioneer Days in the  interest of improving the university's tarnished reputation.  </P></p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Philby widow to auction his hat The Russian widow of Soviet spy Kim Philby hopes to raise money to supplement her KGB pension by selling his books, papers, homburg hat, Cuban cigars and cocktail shaker. Mrs Rufina Philby, 61, the British-born spy's fourth wife, has put the contents of his library and other items found in his Moscow flat after his death in 1988 into an auction at Sotheby's on July 18. Philby defected to the Soviet Union in 1963 after passing information from British intelligence to the KGB for 24 years. It emerged that he was the 'third man' after Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean to penetrate western intelligence. Philby's hat is expected to fetch up to Pounds 3,000, his camera Pounds 1,000, his Russian watch Pounds 700 and his cocktail shaker Pounds 500.</p>

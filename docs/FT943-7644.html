			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Opponents of Clinton crime bill make last assault Conservative Republicans and gun lobbyists yesterday mounted a final effort to defeat a crime bill with a provision banning assault weapons and to deny President Bill Clinton a victory he desperately needs to rescue his wobbling presidency. Mr Leon Panetta, the White House chief of staff, was unable to predict victory in a vote scheduled for late afternoon. House Democrats and moderate Republicans negotiated frantically through Saturday night, the result being a bill that Mr Panetta contended was an improvement on the one which failed on August 11, angering Mr Clinton. To meet the demands of Republic moderates, the Democrats agreed to a compromise which would cut Dollars 3.3bn from a Dollars 33.5bn bill and eliminate or consolidate many of the 'crime prevention' social programmes favoured by Mr Clinton. The proposed legislation retained the tougher sentencing components, which the administration had hoped would attract conservatives. Funds to provide incentives so that local governments can hire 100,000 local police - a Clinton campaign promise - were kept, and local governments were given a greater say on how the funds would be spent. Negotiators agreed to drop a youth jobs training programme which had been favoured by the president. Democrats and Republican negotiators laboured on through the weekend as two threats to the legislation emerged. A rival bill was introduced by the conservatives and gun lobby. It contained no social programmes and excluded the ban on assault weapons. Mr Newt Gingrich, the combative conservative Republican leader, supported this alternative, saying he liked its stronger capital punishment provisions. The Clinton compromise, supported by Republican moderates, was also threatened by loss of support by House liberals - members of the Black caucus in particular - who were unhappy about the dropping of the social programmes, which had initially attracted their support. Congress has been trying to pass a major crime bill for six years.</p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Summer Festivals: Adventurous opera, classical dance FELDKIRCH June 16 - July 3 Schubertiade Feldkirch, Schubertplatz 1, Postfach 625, A-6803 Feldkirch, Austria. Tel: 5522-38001. Fax: 5522-38005 Now transposed permanently from Hohenems to nearby Feldkirch, this rarefied Schubert festival is mourning the recent retirement of Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau. But this year's programme still offers ample goodies. Andras Schiff gives two recitals and accompanies Peter Schreier in a selection of Goethe settings. Schreier also conducts concert performances of uncompleted Schubert operas. Tokyo String Quartet gives a complete cycle of Beethoven quartets. Recitalists include Christa Ludwig, Brigitte Fassbaender, Boje Skovhus, Robert Holl, Anatol Ugorski and Cyprien Katsaris. HOLLAND June 1 - 30 Holland Festival, Kleine-Gartmanplantsoen 21, NL1017 RP Amsterdam. Tel: 31-020-627-6566 Adventurous opera choice forms the core of this year's Holland programme. Ton de Leeuw's Antigone (world premiere); Steve Reich's music-theatre piece The Cave (local premiere); a new Netherlands Opera staging of Pelleas et Melisande by Peter Sellars, conducted by Simon Rattle; and concert performances of Les Troyens (conductor: Edo de Waart) and Le nozze di Figaro (conductor: John Eliot Gardiner) make up the shortlist of attractions, along with a conspectus of the works of Henryk Gorecki, the classical world's flavour-of-the-year. Dance: There is a season by the Belgian choreographer Anna Teresa de Keersmaaker at Beurs van Berlage, between June 10 and June 27, and there are also performances scheduled by Nederlands Dans Theater on June 2, 3 and5 with a new work by Jiri Kylian; and by the Dutch National Ballet on June 17, 19, 21, 22 and24 at the Muziektheatre with a new piece commissioned from Laurie Booth. KUHMO CHAMBER MUSIC FESTIVAL July 16 - August 1 Information from Kuhmo, Tel: 010-358-86/520-936, fax /521-961; or Helsinki Tel: 010-358-0/493-867, fax /493-956. There is really nothing like the annual orgy of chamber music at Kuhmo. To this tiny Finnish town below the Arctic Circle and just west of the Russian border, distinguished and newly acclaimed European and American ensembles and soloists come to provide some five concerts daily, besides giving master classes. (The marathon concerts on the last two Saturday evenings may go on until the sun has slipped briefly below the horizon and reappeared.) What makes the festival continually exciting is that so much of it consists of music-making by fine performers who have had just a few days to rehearse together. Chances are taken, spur-of-the-moment insights flashed: marvellous things happen. The atmosphere is blessedly informal, amid all those lakes and pines. This year as usual several leading British players figure, and there are Lieder, Japanese concerts, a great Argentinian tango ensemble, the Maly Ballet and chamber opera too. KYBURGIADE August 12 - 17 Internationales Kammermusik-Festival auf Schloss Kyburg, Postfach 408, CH-8400 Winterthur, Switzerland Last year's inaugural event was so successful that the Kyburgiade seems certain to become a fixture on the map of chamber music festivals. It owes its unique atmosphere to the open-air setting of Kyburg Castle near the Swiss town of Winterthur, and to the participation of one of Europe's leading young string quartets, the Carmina Quartet. They are joined this year by the Vienna String Sextet, the Orlando and Cherubini Quartets and Basle Madrigal Soloists. The programme ranges from quartets by Beethoven, Brahms and Dvorak, to less familiar music by Bruckner and Fanny Hensel-Mendelssohn. LA ROQUE D'ANTHERON July 31 - August 22 Festival de Piano, Chateau de Florans, 13640 La Roque d'Antheron, France. Tel: 16-4250 5115. Fax: 16-4250 4889 The castle grounds of La Roque d'Antheron, equidistant from Avignon and Marseille, are the peaceful setting for a piano festival which has been gathering international renown since it was founded eight years ago. Among this year's 33 concerts are programmes celebrating anniversaries of Grieg, Tchaikovsky and Rakhmaninov; a cycle of Schubert sonatas on a modern concert grand and on pianoforte; a Debussy series using instruments of the period; plus introductions to Medtner and Corigliano. The line-up of artists includes Christian Zacharias, Nikolai Demidenko, Maria Joao Pires, Moura Lympany, Michel Dalberto, Stephen Hough and the Novosibirsk Philharmonic Orchestra from Siberia. LONDON, THE PROMS July 16 - September 11 Promenade Concerts Ticket Shop, Royal Albert Hall, London SW7 2AP. Tel:071-823-9998 No binding theme for the Proms in its 99th season, and no visit from Glyndebourne (closed for re-building): but otherwise the usual wide range of fare, imaginative distinction of performer choice, enticing premieres and rediscoveries and jolly popular celebrations. As ever the BBC Symphony Orchestra takes the lion's share of concerts - such as the opening-evening account of Strauss's opera Elektra, conducted by Andrew Davis. This year's foreign-orchestra visitors include the Austro-Hungarian Haydn Orchestra, European Community and Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestras (under Kurt Sanderling and Claudio Abbado respectively); the Leipzig Gewandhaus under Masur and Oslo Philharmonic under Janssons. Among the out-of-the-ordinary events are the late-evening visit from the Wynton Marsalis Band and the midday concert of Henze's Requiem (UK premiere); other new works can be expected from John Buller, Thomas Wilson and Nicholas Sackman. LUCERNE August 14 - September 8 Internationale Musikfestwochen Luzern, Hirschmattstrasse 13, Postfach, CH-6002 Lucerne, Switzerland. Tel: 41-235272 This year's programme focuses on anniversary celebrations of Tchaikovsky and Rakhmaninov, with Alfred Schnittke as the festival's first-ever composer in residence. Visitors from Russia include the Bolshoy Opera Orchestra and Chorus, the St Petersburg Capella Choir and Orchestra and the Russian National Orchestra. There will be a Rakhmaninov piano marathon with Barry Douglas and others, the world premiere of a new work by Edison Denisov and a Schnittke ballet programme. Visiting orchestras include the Berlin, Vienna and Oslo Philharmonics, and the line-up of artists ranges from Jessye Norman and Yuri Bashmet to Abbado, Barenboim, Jarvi and Sawallisch. MONTPELLIER July 13 - August 6 Le Corun BP 9214, 34043 Montpellier Cedex 01. Tel: 6702-0201 Radio France's annual festival continues to promote off-the-beaten-track operas in concert formats. This year, these include Morlacchi's Barber of Seville; Wagner's Rienzi; Zemlinsky's Birthday of the Infanta; Puccini's Le Villi; and - best of all - Reyer's grand, unjustly neglected Sigurd, with a fine cast headed by Chris Merritt, Michele Lagrange and Valerie Millot. MONTPELLIER DANSE 93 June 22 - July 6 Festival Internaitonal Montpellier Danse, Hotel d'Assas, 6 rue Vieille Aiguillerie, 34000 Montpellier. Box office: 67-60-80-08. Info: 67-60-83-60. Fax: 67-60-83-06 There will be a certain amount of French new dance at Montepellier 93, but of more general interest are the performance of Jason et Medee on June 27 - a 'reconstruction' of a celebrated 18th century ballet by the Ballet du Rhin; and a reconstruction of Filippo Taglioni's famous L'Ombre by Pierre Lacotte for his Ballet National de Nancy on June 29 and 30. MONTREUX August 20 - September 24 Festival de Musique Montreux-Vevey, Rue du Theatre, Case postale 162, CH-1820 Montreux, Switzerland. Tel: 21-963-5450. Fax: 21-963-2506 The festival can finally boast a purpose-built concert hall - the newly-opened Auditorium Stravinsky on the shore of Lake Geneva. Montreux has never prided itself on thematic content, but this year includes a series devoted to French chamber music, including rare works by Reynaldo Hahn, Vincent d'Indy and Charles-Valentin Alkan. The line-up of artists includes Alicia de Larrocha, Teresa Berganza, Barbara Hendricks, Pinchas Zukerman, and the Royal Concertgebouw and St Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestras. NEW YORK CITY BALLET Balanchine Festival Until June 27 State Theatre, Lincoln Centre New York. Tel: (212)-870-5570. Fax: (212)-870-5693. Ticketmaster (212)-307-4100 The work of its master choreographer, George Balanchine, dominates the New York City Ballet progamme this summer. To mark the tenth anniversary of his death, the company will stage an eight week season of Balanchine choreography - a miraculous 73 ballets on view - at the State Theatre, Lincoln Centre, New York, from May 4 until June 27. Essential viewing. PARIS Nouveau Festival International de Danse June 15 - 27 15 Avenue Montaigne, 75008 Paris. Tel: (1)-49-52-50-50 The prestigious Nouveau Festival International de Danse de Paris has pulled off a coup by bringing our Royal Ballet to Paris for the first time in 40 years. The company will appear at the Theatre des Champs Elysees between June 15 and June 27 with five programmes, which inclued Mayerling, Swan Lake and Ballet Imperial, The Judas Tree, Still Life at the Penguin Cafe, A Month in the Country, Gloria. ST LOUIS May 21 - June 20 PO Box 191910, St Louis Missouri, 63119. Tel: 314-961-0171 Opera Theater of St Louis, one of the world's most pleasurable and also most adventurous opera festivals, this year offers a world premiere - Carlson's The Midnight Angel - alongside Massenet's Cendrillon, Don Giovanni, and Britten's Billy Budd (in its rare original version). All are sung in English; theatre conditions are intimate; and picknicking on the lawns of the Loretto-Hilton Center helps create the amiable atmosphere. SALZBURG July 23 - August 31 5010 Salzburg, PO Box 140. Tel: 043-662-8045 The renewal of Salzburg as a place of festival excitement continues apace under Gerard Mortier's inventive direction. A Shakespeare staging of extraordinary interest can be expected from Deborah Warner (Coriolanus, European debut), alongside the revival of Peter Stein's Julius Caesar. This year's new opera productions are Cos fan tutte (with Cecilia Bartoli and Jennifer Larmore), Lucio Silla (with Ann Murray and Luba Orgonasova), and Monteverdi's Poppea (with Sylvia McNair and Philip Langridge) and Orfeo; revivals include Salome and Falstaff; and there are concert performances of Dallapiccola's Ulisse and Nono's Prometeo. Concerts of contemporary music may have been increased, but the luxus elements of Salzburg - the parade of top-class international orchestras, conductors, soloists and recitalists - have by no means been eradicated. A notable occasion will be the farewell concert of Christa Ludwig, one of the best-loved of Salzburg veterans. SANTA FE July 2 - August 28 PO Box 2408 Santa Fe, New Mexico 87504. Tel: 0101-505982-3855 This year's productions are a diverse, attractive mixture: La Boheme (with Cynthia Haymon); The Magic Flute; Handel's Xerxes (in English, with Frederica von Stade and Dawn Upshaw); Strauss's Capriccio (with Sheri Greenawald) and a double bill of Kurt Weill rarities - Der Protagonist and Der Zar lasst zich photographieren. And the pleasures of the place itself never pall. SCHLESWIG-HOLSTEIN June 27 - August 22 Kartenzentrale des SHMF, Postfach 3840, D-2300 Kiel 1, Germany. Tel: 431-567080. Fax: 431-569152 Like a musical mosaic, this festival spreads out from Hamburg, Lubeck and Kiel to some of the most attractive towns in northern Germany, in venues which give a more local atmosphere than most. There is a strong Polish influence this year, with three Polish orchestras touring the region and performances of Szymanowski, Penderecki and several of their less familiar compatriots. The Festival Orchestra will give concerts under Georg Solti, Semyon Bychkov and Valery Gergiev, and the line-up of recitalists includes Shura Cherkassky, Jessye Norman and Anne-Sophie Mutter. SPOLETO June 29 - July 18 Associazione Festival dei Due Mondi, Via Cesare Beccaria 18, 00196 Rome, Italy. Tel: 6-3210 288. Fax: 6-3200 747 Spoleto offers a hot, hectic round-the-clock collage of events, spearheaded by two opera productions - Puccini's Trittico staged by Spoleto's ageless festival supremo Gian Carlo Menotti in the Teatro Nuovo and The Rake's Progress at Teatro Caio Melisso. The dance programme features the American company Garth Fagan Dance and the Ballet of the Deutsche Oper, Berlin, with Peter Schaufuss. Steve Berkoff directs Oscar Wilde's Salome, and there is an Italian-language production of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire. STRASBOURG June 4 - July 3 Festival de Musique de Strasbourg, 24 rue de la Mesange, 67081 Strasbourg Cedex, France. Tel: 8832-4310. Fax: 8832-4238 Despite its attractive setting on the Rhine and its proximity to the Alsatian countryside, Strasbourg has never really capitalised on its potential as a festival centre. But this year's programme offers some worthwhile events, including a series of concerts by the Kiev Opera Orchestra and staged productions of Nabucco and Cosi fan tutte. There are also concerts conducted by Pierre Boulez and Michael Gielen. TANGLEWOOD July 9 - August 31 Until June 14: Tanglewood Ticket Office, Symphony Hall, Boston, MA 02115. After June 14: Tanglewood Ticket Office, Tanglewood, Lenox, MA 01240. Tel: 617-931-2000 For more than 50 years, the Boston Symphony Orchestra's summer home has provided a relaxed setting for concerts in the heart of the Massachusetts countryside. The Tchaikovsky and Rakhmaninov anniversaries provide the connecting thread of this year's programme, with a roster of artists including Evgeny Kissin, Yuri Bashmet, Galina Gorchakova and Sergei Leiferkus. Seiji Ozawa conducts a Bernstein memorial concert and a new work by Alexander Goehr. Roger Norrington conducts two concerts, John Eliot Gardiner makes his Tanglewood debut and William Christie directs Les Arts Florissants in Purcell and Charpentier. TEGERNSEE July 3 - 14 Internationales Oleg-Kagan-Musikfest am Tegernsee, Kurverwaltung Kreuth, Nodliche Haupstrasse 3, D-8185 Kreuth, Germany. Tel: 8029-1819. Fax: 8029-1828 The picturesque setting of Kreuth, a former court spa at the foot of the Bavarian Alps, makes this one of Europe's most peaceful and intimate festivals. It was founded four years ago by the late Russian violinist Oleg Kagan and his cellist wife Natalia Gutman, and is notable for attracting high-powered Russian virtuosi, some of them little-known in the West. WARSAW September 17 - 25 Warsaw Autumn, Rynek Starego Miasta 27, 00272 Warsaw. Tel/Fax: 22-310607 Despite the presence of chamber ensembles from Lithuania, Czechoslovakia and the Netherlands, the programme of this year's Warsaw Autumn contemporary music festival is less international than in the past two years, apparently because of economic problems. Nevertheless, the festival continues to provide a worthwhile international platform for Poland's lively contemporary music scene, with prominent contributions this year from Lutoslawski (Fourth Symphony), Penderecki (Flute Concerto) and Gorecki (Concerto-Cantata). WEXFORD October 14 - 31 Theatre Royal, High Street, Wexford, Ireland. Tel: 0353-53-2214 A classic Wexford trio of unjustly neglected or forgotten operas this year: Tchaikovsky's beautiful Cherivichki (The Tsarina's Slippers); Paisiello's Barber of Seville; and Zampa, Herold's once-popular 19th-century opera-comique. A typically full concert schedule gives prominence to Wexford's young singers.</p>

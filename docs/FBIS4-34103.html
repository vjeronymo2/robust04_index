			<p>BFN     [Text] Almost half of the 9 million destitute Brazilian  families live in the northeastern region: 48.67 percent of the  region's inhabitants make hardly enough money to buy basic  foodstuffs. These figures were released by the IBGE [Brazilian  Institute of Geography and Statistics]. A diagram of Brazilian  poverty levels and concentration prepared by the IBGE will be  exhibited at the entrance hall of the Petrobras [Brazilian  Petroleum Corporation] building until 10 June. The IBGE has  also verified that misery exists everywhere in the country. The  most developed Brazilian region -- the southeast -- has the  second largest number of destitute people in the country, with a  total of 2.6 million destitute families, i.e., almost 29 percent  of the overall number.    According to IBGE, there is great social imbalance in the  southeast region. The highest levels of poverty in this region  are concentrated in the states of Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo,  and Rio de Janeiro, while the lowest levels are in Sao Paulo  State. In absolute figures, however, the largest number of  shantytowns in the country are located in Sao Paulo State -- 594  -- but only 6.8 percent of the state's population live in them.    Recife, Pernambuco State, is the great champion in this sad  race. Almost half of its inhabitants -- 48.8 percent -- live in  shantytowns. Among the state capitals, Salvador has the lowest  number of inhabitants living in shantytowns: only 4 percent.  Twenty-five percent of the northeastern region destitute, or 1.2  million poor people, however, live in Bahia State. In Rio de  Janeiro County, for example, 16.5 percent of the inhabitants are  destitute. In Rio de Janeiro State, however, there are 661  shantytowns. In Minas Gerais State, the city with the largest  number of destitute people is not Belo Horizonte but Betim,  where 15.5 percent of the people live in shantytowns.    According to Dora Hees, an IBGE geographer, the figures for  the southern region have surprised IBGE experts: 14 percent of  the overall destitute people in the country live in the region,  most of them in the states of Parana and Rio Grande do Sul.  Hees said: "The southern region has been revealing unexpected  poverty conditions." She explained that the land distribution  and modernization of agricultural production have been  contributing to expelling the people from the countryside.    Surprisingly, the IBGE figures show that the urban zones of  the northern region have the best standard of living in the  country. The largest number of destitute families in the region  -- 39,638 -- live in Belem, Para State. Six and one-half  percent of the Brazilian poor live in the central-western  region, most of them -- 55,610 families -- in the Federal  District.</p>

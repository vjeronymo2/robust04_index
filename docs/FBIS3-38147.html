The new member  countries do not perhaps have a real understanding of us in the  south. But on the other hand we will have access to your  market."    The EU's [European Union] current president, Greek European  Affairs Minister Theodhoros Pangalos, was careful when he gave a  short press conference in Stockholm yesterday.    To give the appearance of concern over the fears of northern  dominance during his first visit to one of the Nordic applicant  countries would hardly have been fitting.    "We have had political discussions, but no negotiations,"  Pangalos said, referring to his Swedish counterpart, Ulf  Dinkelspiel.    On Thursday [20 January] Pangalos visited Helsinki. The same  evening it was time for Stockholm, prior to traveling on to Oslo  yesterday afternoon. A lightning Arctic tour, intended to sound  out the political terrain.    In the last week a controversial Greek proposal has leaked  out to the international press. According to this proposal,  Norrbotten would no longer be given the status of an objective 1  region -- something that the EU Commission has proposed.  Instead Norrbotten, like three Finnish and Norwegian regions,  would receive financial support from a new fund which would take  account of what are for the EU new criteria, such as sparse  population and cold climate.    This could seem generous. At a press conference with Ulf  Dinkelspiel on Thursday, Dinkelspiel said that he thought that  "the Greeks understand and recognize our subdivisions."    The problem is simply that the proposal seems to be that the  new fund will chiefly be financed by Sweden, Norway, and  Finland. So far the Greeks have neglected to give any more  detailed description.    At yesterday's press conference Pangalos merely said:    "It will be financed from the EU budget."    He was unwilling to say more. Since Sweden as a member would  be covered by the EU budget, it remains unclear what the net  effect of the Greek proposal would be.    The Greek EU president admitted that "there are problems" in  the ongoing negotiations.    "Sometimes they are of importance. Like this one about the  regions. But it can be solved. We will have success, and have  it now."    This success must therefore be achieved in the days around  10  to 14 March. This is the deadline for the negotiations which  are already in time trouble.    As well as regional support the main things left on the  Swedish negotiating agenda are the budget question and  agriculture. As far as the budget is concerned there are two  Swedish considerations -- a phasing-in of the Swedish  contribution, and the position that the GNP criterion "does not  properly reflect our purchasing power."    "On this latter point we have met with a complete lack of  understanding," Ulf Dinkelspiel said on Thursday.    On the central issue of agriculture there is as yet no  official EU position paper.    "We must have such a paper within a few days or a week at  the  latest," Dinkelspiel said.    Theodhoros Pangalos has so far only promised position papers  on agriculture and regional support for the meeting with EU  ministers on 7 and 8 February. This meeting will not take place  for two weeks.</p>

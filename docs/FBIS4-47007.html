			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladislav Borodulin, Vadim Bardin, and Sergey </F> Viktorov: "Economic Policy: "Attack in Waves"]    [Text] The Russian political Olympus has already  adapted itself fully to Boris Yeltsin's decisive steps following  long pauses. An analysis of the package of presidential edicts,  which was received for official distribution yesterday, shows  that during the latest splash of the president's interest in  economic policy his advisers demonstrated maximum inventiveness  in the manipulation of the meager arsenal of economic regulation  measures. Tax rates, quotas, export duties, and the infamous  "restoration of the controllability of the state sector"--what  else can be applied to the Russian economy without its lethal  outcome?    "On the other hand, what variations!" presidential  experts will answer us. And they will be right here.  <H5>  New Stage: What To Do if There Is no Money in the Budget </H5>   Despite the apparent heterogeneity, upon closer examination  the new presidential edicts fully fit into a single logical  scheme, which makes it possible to talk about a new stage in  Russian macroeconomic policy. Recently, the need for innovations  in this policy has been quite obvious, even if in connection  with the debates on the annual budget and forthcoming  negotiations with Western creditors. To put it bluntly, it was  necessary to demonstrate new methods of budget stimulation of  the economy under conditions of the financial crisis.    These methods suggest themselves. If there is a shortage of  money for direct budget support, the only thing left is "to  help" enterprises through a reduction in the profit and  added-value tax rate, at the same time, liberalizing  raw-material export through an abolition of quotas. Despite the  fact that individual elements of such a "new policy" also  occurred earlier, essentially, in pure form they are first  encountered in the new edicts "On Some Questions of Tax Policy"  and "On the Abolition of Quotas and Licenses for Deliveries of  Goods and Services for Export." The similarity of production  stimulation through a tax cut with "Reaganomics" is evident  immediately. Aleksandr Livshits, director of the group of  economic advisers to the president, who was the ideologist of  the new edicts, also drew these analogies with satisfaction.  True, Russian state enterprises have some specific features.  Most of them are so inefficient that tax indulgences and export  liberalization are of purely symbolic significance for them.  Therefore, some differentiation of state enterprises is quite  logical. Public enterprises, which are not capable of managing  state property independently and will be completely dependent on  the government for support, are singled out among them in a  separate edict.    [Begin box]  <H5>  System of Criteria for Evaluating the Structure of the </H5> Balance of Insolvent Enterprises:    --the coefficient of current liquidity: It characterizes the  enterprise's general provision with circulating capital for the  management of economic activity;    --the coefficient of provision with internal capital: It  characterizes the availability of the enterprise's own  circulating capital necessary for its financial stability;    --the coefficient of restoration (loss) of solvency: It  characterizes the enterprise's real capability to restore or  lose its solvency during a specific period.    [End Box]    Having announced the possibility of reducing some tax rates,  authorities should find alternative sources of budget  replenishment. Therefore, emphatic concern for a fuller  collection of existing taxes contained in the new edicts is  fully legitimate. In particular, such a measure is specified by  the mentioned edict on the abolition of quotas, which, at the  same time, presupposes the complete elimination of privileges  with respect to the payment of export duties (according to  Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, another edict on the  complete elimination, in general, of all foreign economic  privileges is already ready for signing). Two edicts at once--on  ensuring a full payment of taxes into the budget and on measures  to strengthen payment discipline--presuppose the toughening of  control over tax collection. Generally speaking, such measures  do not contradict the idea of tax stimulation of production. For  example, in the United States in the 1980's the policy of tax  rate cuts completely agreed with the exceptionally tough control  over a prompt tax payment. Finally, the consolidation of  extrabudgetary funds in the budget--to which, in particular, the  edict on the inclusion of the federal road fund in the budget  attests--is a fully expected measure.    [Begin box]  <H5>  What Will the Abolition of Customs Privileges Give the Budget </H5>   --Existing legislation exempts main exporters--oil and  natural gas producers--from the payment of export duties.    --The share of oil and natural gas in the value volume of  Russian export outside the former USSR makes up 35.7 percent.    --The abolition of customs privileges will enable the  federal  budget to obtain 2.5 billion dollars from the export of oil and  gas in the form of customs duties in the second half of 1994.    --If customs duties on the export of oil and gas (as the  government plans) are reduced to one-half before 1 July,  currency budget revenues will total 1.25 billion dollars.    [End box]    Despite the fact that the scheme embodied in edicts is quite  logical, it remains no more than a symbolic redistribution of  budget indicators on paper. It is characteristic that Mr.  Livshits, discussing real prospects for changes in tax policy,  confined himself to the significant word "we will see." It is  clear that attempts to develop a new economic policy under  conditions of the budget crisis will continue in the very near  future, as long as, in particular, the problem of finding funds  for expanded budget support for the military-industrial complex  is not solved. The issue of special "defense" bonds is the most  obvious way out here. Livshits tends precisely toward this  option. He is confident that banks will buy these bonds  willingly.  <H5>  Quotas, Licenses, and Privileges, But Not Special Exporters, </H5> Are Eliminated    With his edict "On the Abolition of Quotas and Licenses for  Deliveries of Goods and Services for Export" the president  renews the liberalization of foreign economic activity. At the  same time, the president's decision, despite the sufficiently  long preparation, clearly stunned government structures with its  radicality.    In accordance with the presidential edict the existing  system  of quotas and licenses for the export of goods is abolished as  of 1 July. An exception was made only for export deliveries  carried out in accordance with Russia's international  obligations. In addition to quotas and licenses, the government  is ordered to abolish as of 1 July 1994 all privileges with  regard to the imposition of export customs duties on exported  goods. This measure does not concern privileges granted by the  laws "On Customs Tariff," "On the Added-Value Tax," and "On  Excises," as well as by the Customs Code.    According to the version of authors of the presidential  edict, all the privileges directly named in the mentioned laws  are abolished. However, the law "On Customs Tariff" also gives  grounds for a less revolutionary interpretation. It specifies  that the government has the right to grant tariff privileges.  Consequently, the pause in the labor biography of privileges,  most probably, will not be long.    Nor are there grounds for putting the equality sign between  the abolition of export quotas and the demise of nontariff  regulation of export as such. As is well known, in the  government decree "On Measures for the Liberalization of Foreign  Economic Activity" of 2 November 1993 special exporters received  a strong safety net, of which they can fully take advantage now.  The November decree added another list to the list of goods, for  which quotas were established: A list of goods, the export of  which was monopolized by special exporters. The second list,  having absorbed the first, naturally, was not limited to it and  was longer. Thus, the abolition of quotas only strengthens the  positions of special exporters.    The results of the meeting held by the board of the Ministry  of Foreign Economic Relations yesterday, following the  publication of the presidential edict, which abolished export  quotas and licenses, fully confirm this conclusion. In  particular, the development of the currency control system as  applied to special exporters was examined. In this sphere the  ministry continues to increase its own activity. It would seem  that special exporters have been tamed strongly by the ministry  for a long time. They "voluntarily" undertake to give the  ministry information on the movement of currency funds. In  addition, the ministry's attempt to outline the range of  authorized banks allowed to service special exporters has  received wide publicity. New proposals are being put forward  now, confirming the forecast expressed by KOMMERSANT-DAILY  yesterday.    First, the ministry tries to increase the gap between the  two  mentioned supplements to the November government decree on the  liberalization of foreign economic activity. The list of goods  assigned to special exporters is to be expanded. It can include  not only individual commodity items, but also types of  operations; in particular, the export of customer-supplied raw  materials. Second, barter operations with energy carriers and a  barter with the remaining goods falling under quotas, which  provides for the import of goods subject to excise, are to be  prohibited as a category. Third, instead of the deceased quotas,  there is to be a mandatory registration of export transactions  involving goods formerly subject to quotas, without which export  is impossible. Thus, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations  again aspires to the first role in the currency control system.  The justification boils down to the fact that the version of  control of the Central Bank of Russia-the State Tariff Committee  does not ensure price control. This argument is not very  impressive if we take into account that the law reserves to the  customhouse the right to determine the customs value. In  essence, however, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations  clearly seeks to take a departmental revenge and to become  firmly established under new conditions. Although the  innovations of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations  received the support of Sergey Tsyplakov, director of the  government's Department for Foreign Economic Relations, who was  present at the meeting, observers consider their realization in  a full volume improbable.    The quota-abolishing edict should have also had a point  concerning tariff regulation. As Vice-Premier Aleksandr Shokhin  announced yesterday, it was expected that the edict,  simultaneously with the abolition of privileges, would also  reduce to one-half the rates of export tariff on raw-material  goods. At the last stage, however, it was removed. Nevertheless,  Mr. Shokhin believes that this decision will take place. And so,  following the abolition of quotas exporters may also expect  other pleasant surprises.  <H5>  State and Enterprises: New Relations </H5>   The edict "On Some Questions of Tax Policy" points to a  change in the relations between the state and enterprises.  Previously, Russian authorities quite consistently denied the  possibility of a significant reduction in the general level of  taxes on enterprises, confining themselves to the granting of  individual tax privileges. The new document, on the contrary,  specifies the submission of proposals for a 10- to 20-percent  reduction in the level of profit and value-added tax rates by  the government to the State Duma before 15 September of this  year. At the same time, the government is instructed to  introduce the mechanism of accelerated depreciation of fixed  capital in "high technology sectors" within a 2-month period.  Such indulgences officially are attributed to the need to weaken  the tax pressure on commodity producers. Moreover, the edict  provides for the exemption of the profit tax payment during 2  years by enterprises, in whose charter fund foreign investments  make up no less than 30 percent (and no less than 10 million  dollars).    However, whereas for now a significant reduction in tax  rates  for Russian enterprises is postponed until the fall, the  toughening of control over tax payment is being introduced right  now. In accordance with the edicts "On the Implementation of  Overall Measures for a Prompt and Full Payment of Taxes and  Other Obligatory Payments Into the Budget" and "On Additional  Measures for the Normalization of Settlements and Strengthening  of Payment Discipline in the National Economy" every enterprise  can have only one current and budget account in banks. Banks do  not have the right to open accounts for enterprises if they are  not registered in tax bodies. If within 10 calendar days an  enterprise does not have ruble funds in its account, tax bodies  are granted the right to collect by nonadversary procedure  arrears in taxes and other obligatory payments from current  currency accounts of enterprises.    For state enterprises the change in mutual relations with  the  state is not confined to taxes alone. The edict "On Reform of  State Enterprises" provides for a complete suspension of the  establishment of new federal state enterprises, that is,  formally independent enterprises, to which state property is  transferred for complete economic management. Part of existing  state enterprises are liquidated and public plants, factories,  and farms fully subordinate in their activity to the government  are established on their basis. A use of allocated federal funds  not according to the specific purpose, a lack of profit on the  basis of results in the last 2 years, or a violation of the  rules of use of state real estate (for example, its lease or  sale) can be the basis for the transformation of state  enterprises into public ones.    According to the intention of the edict's drafters, the  transformation of enterprises into public ones should hinder the  uncontrolled receipt of credits and machination with state real  estate. From comments on the edict given by Mr. Livshits it  follows that he considers such a transformation of enterprises  unusual punishment. However, real sentiments among  representatives of enterprises, as Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin's  recent meeting with them indicates, are somewhat different. They  rather tend to view the acquisition of the status of a public  enterprise as the reason to obtain access to such desired budget  support.  <H5>  President Said "b," Not Uttering "a" </H5>   The loud public response, which Boris Yeltsin's signing of  six "economic" edicts received, somewhat overshadowed the fact  that this package was published in truncated form. Two announced  edicts--"On the Sale of State Debtor Enterprises" and "On the  Regulation of Funds Assigned for Consumption"--did not come out  from the presidential office. The first, perhaps the most  important of all the documents scheduled for signing, should  determine the government strategy with regard to the fate of  bankrupt enterprises. However, right now it can be said that,  for all practical purposes, national industrial giants have  nothing to worry about.    By yesterday the government has already formulated the  slogan, under which the fight against unpromising production  facilities will be waged. As First Vice-Premier Oleg Soskovets  thinks, "the prevention of bankruptcies themselves, not a mass  conduct of bankruptcy show trials, is the chief thing." There is  logic in such a maxim: The prospects for facing thousands of  simultaneously conducted trials (by today only 70 such cases,  including against state enterprises, have passed through the  Russian court system), dozens of millions of unemployed workers,  and, above all, hundreds of idle directors can frighten not only  the Russian Government. The document prepared by the Federal  Administration for Cases of Insolvency under the State Committee  on the Administration of State Property indicates that such  prospects are more than real.    The government decree published yesterday establishes a  system of criteria, by which this department will be guided when  declaring a state enterprise insolvent (it is also a matter of  joint-stock companies, the share of the state in which is more  than 25 percent). When only one criterion--the coefficient of  current liquidity--was used, 601 production associations got on  the black list. The total number of enterprises with more than  1,000 workers is about 1,200. It is remarkable that 36 percent  of them are enterprises of the military-industrial complex a  priori considered high technology ones. More generalized  indicators show that from 78 to 90 percent of the machine  building enterprises are insolvent.    At the same time, the government realizes that it does not  have real resources--primarily financial--for the "prevention of  bankruptcy." According to Igor Shurchkov, chairman of the State  Committee on Industrial Production, all bankruptcy prevention  procedures can be carried out in full volume only at 100  enterprises. In this connection the attempt to somehow divide  all insolvent enterprises seems fully justified. In this case  the watershed is a 25-percent share of the state in an  enterprise. In other words, it objectively becomes profitable  for enterprises to invite the state as a partner. Only in this  case can they hope for state assistance (true, determined by  formally tough criteria). However, a literal execution of  legislation on bankruptcies awaits others.</p>

			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Finance Week BUSINESS Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, whose seven-month-old government was toppled after a revolt by his Northern League coalition partner, resigned rather than face defeat in a no-confidence drive in parliament.

London Life Association, part of London Life Group, has been fined Pounds 50,000 by Imro, the self-regulatory body for the fund management industry, for rule breaches that left client money at risk.

COMPANIES The first contested take-over bid in the UK utility sector got under way as Northern Electric, the regional power company for the north-east of England, rejected a Pounds 1.2bn offer from Trafalgar House. Trafalgar House decided to offer a Pounds 20 rebate to each of Northern Electric's 1.3m customers. This, it claimed, was at the prompting of the electricity industry regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild. Labour questioned whether Littlechild had shown 'proper conduct' in asking Trafalgar representatives what customers would gain from the bid.

Shares in East Midlands Electricity rose by 5 per cent after the group announced substantially better than expected interim results and a surprisingly large dividend increase. Peter Ward is to quit as chief executive of Rolls-Royce Motors, which has signed a collaboration agreement with BMW of Germany.

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: British Alcan loss jumps to Pounds 22.7m Another 588 jobs were lost at British Alcan Aluminium and capital expenditure was cut to the bone last year as the company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Alcan of Canada, struggled with the worst known aluminium industry conditions. The company's pre-tax loss jumped from Pounds 15.9m to Pounds 22.7m after another surge in reorganisation and rationalisation costs, up from Pounds 4.6m to Pounds 11.2m. Nevertheless, British Alcan remained cash positive during the year 'through careful management of working capital and limited capital expenditure,' said Mr John Bridgeman, managing director. It repaid Pounds 18m of debt, despite re-instituting Pounds 6m cash contributions to the UK pension fund, after a three-year 'holiday'. Mr Bridgeman added: 'Some signs of recovery are now apparent in the UK economy and it is noticeable that many of our major customers are showing more confidence and more inclination to spend on capital goods. It remains to be seen whether these signs of recovery can be sustained.' However, since the year-end the serious world over-supply of primary aluminium had led Alcan to announce the temporary closure of 156,000 tonnes of smelting capacity, 18,000 tonnes of it at the three UK smelters. British Alcan's workforce fell from 7,938 to 7,350 last year. Jobs went throughout the company but the biggest shake-out was at the Rogerstone rolling mill operations where 250 jobs went and reorganisation costs came to Pounds 6m. When the company was formed from the merger of British Aluminium and Alcan in 1982 it employed 14,000. Capital expenditure, already at a rock-bottom Pounds 22.5m in 1992, was cut to Pounds 18.3m. Turnover slipped from Pounds 756m to Pounds 748m and exports from the UK fell from Pounds 275m to Pounds 272m. Losses per share were 54p (42p).</p>

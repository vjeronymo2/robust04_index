			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FULLERTON PROPOSES CUTTING THREE SPORTS  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton's efforts to resolve a budget crisis and correct inequities  in the funding of women's sports have resulted in a plan to drop three sports,  including men's gymnastics, a program that won three national championships in  the 1970s.  </P> <P> A 1990-91 budget proposal that eliminates men's gymnastics and men's and  women's fencing was passed unanimously by the university's Athletics Council  Thursday. The budget requires the approval of University President Jewel  Plummer Cobb.  </P> <P> "I accept that budget changes have to be made," said Dick Wolfe, who has  coached the men's gymnastics team for the past 22 years. "What I don't accept  is that my program has to be cut. Why cut my guys so other programs can thrive  and exist? I'm shocked that men's gymnastics was chosen."  </P> <P> Valerie Berg, a senior on the women's fencing team that went 16-0 this season,  said the team was "demoralized" as it prepares for NCAA regional championships  this weekend at Stanford.  </P> <P> "Everyone is obviously really upset and disappointed because we always received  less money than other sports anyway," said Berg, adding that team members hoped  to continue as a club sport next season.  </P> <P> Cobb was unavailable for comment Thursday, but an aide said she is aware of the  proposal. Athletic Director Ed Carroll declined to comment, apparently at  Cobb's request.  </P> <P> The proposed $4.9-million budget includes substantial increases for women's  sports, the result of a department study that showed that Fullerton was not in  compliance with Title IX, a federal law that requires women's sports to be  funded in proportion to the number of women competing on a school's teams.  Fullerton needed to allocate 31% of its athletic budget to women's teams,  according to the study.  </P> <P> The proposed budget, which is balanced, includes:  </P> <P>  -- A 48% increase for women's volleyball, from $113,295 to $167,337.  </P> <P>  -- A 28% increase for women's gymnastics, from $190,698 to $244,226.  </P> <P>  -- A 20% increase for women's basketball, from $188,453 to $226,726.  </P> <P>  -- A 14% increase for women's softball, from $193,613 to $220,476.  </P> <P> The three sports that are proposed to be cut have a combined budget of $130,639  in Fullerton's current budget of $4.28 million.  </P> <P> If the proposal is approved, Fullerton's athletic program will be reduced to 14  sports, the minimum required for schools with football programs to compete in  the NCAA's Division I-A. Men's gymnastics apparently was chosen to be  discontinued because it was part of only two combinations that would keep  Fullerton in compliance with NCAA and Big West Conference requirements.  </P> <P> The proposed budget responds not only to the inequities in funding women's  sports but also to ongoing financial problems in a minimally funded program.  </P> <P> The budget also proposes $42,000 more in scholarship funds for football, the  result of a pledge of support from Cobb. But football would lose $46,800 in  coaching salaries.  </P> <P> Preston Dennard, a former Ram receiver who coached at Fullerton last season,  recently said he lost his position because of budget cuts.  </P> <P> Gene Murphy said the cuts would affect his program, but not its  competitiveness.  </P> <P> "We're going to carry on," he said. "We can't complain. We have to figure out  other ways to get around it."  </P> <P> Fullerton's response to the Title IX study puts the university "on the cutting  edge," said Bill Puzo, a professor of geography and a member of the Athletics  Council.  </P> <P> Fullerton applied more stringent criteria than legally required by Title IX,  and many athletic programs around the country are widely acknowledged not to be  in compliance with the law.  </P> <P> "We have been supporting more than the number of sports required, and perhaps  more than appropriate to our budget," said Puzo, the chairman of the budget  committee.  </P> <P> Fullerton is making cuts to respond to an $81,000 revenue shortfall that is  contributing to a current deficit of $236,000, the bulk of which is the result  of a change in accounting procedures.  </P> <P> Fullerton's effort to correct funding inequities was prompted by a movement  started by several women's coaches last spring. The coaches praised the  athletic department's response, and said they had never considered a lawsuit.  </P> <P> "It's a relief that it's finally a reality," said Judi Garman, softball coach.  "I don't feel good to know that somebody else is being dropped to do it, but  each of us, like any coach, feels our primary responsibility is to our  athletes.  </P></p>

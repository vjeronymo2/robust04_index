			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Sears Sears is no longer a recovery story but a growth story, according to its chief executive, Mr Liam Strong. The snag is that, while cutting costs was fairly easy, increasing sales will not be. Like-for-like sales growth of 3.8 per cent in the year to end-January and 3.6 per cent-plus since then is not especially exciting. Equally, though headline pre-tax profits of Pounds 138m look good, the figure is somewhat nearer Pounds 125m once non-recurring items are stripped out. The share price, which had been ramped ahead of yesterday's results, took an understandable 7 per cent tumble. Mr Strong's growth story centres on the group's plan to step up capital expenditure to an annual average of Pounds 100m over the next three years, compared with Pounds 78m in the most recent year. The money will be invested in two main ways: revitalising flagging old stores such as Adams and building new out-of-town stores such as Sportsworld. Each scheme looks plausible enough on its own but, given Sears' poor investment record, it is questionable whether a steep increase in capital expenditure is in shareholders' interests. Even if it is, there is little shareholder benefit in Sears' accumulating a cash pile. Despite the higher investment rate, net cash is expected to rise in coming years from the year-end figure of Pounds 157m. Mr Strong rightly argues it would be foolish to raise dividends to unsustainable levels. But that should not stop Sears returning cash to shareholders through a special dividend or share buy-back.</p>

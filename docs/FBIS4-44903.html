			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Takaki Yamada, president of Rocket System, a </F> launch-services company; first paragraph is source introduction]    [Text] With the success of the H-2 launch, Japan is finally  joining the advanced countries of the world in space  development. Amidst the expectations for Japan's contribution  and with the vistas of space transportation in the coming 21st  century, Rocket System, a company whose main business is launch  services, is getting ready to function at the full capacity at  which it was designed to function. The following is our  interview with Mr. Takaki Yamada, the president of Rocket System.    NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: It has been a long time  since you were involved in rocket development as a civilian,  when you were still with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. How do you  feel now that the H-2 is successfully launched?    Yamada: I was thrilled with it. Ever since the  project started some dozens of years ago, we have been  determined to produce the best in the world. Everyone from NASDA  and the private companies involved in the project faced  challenges in every area of cost, manufacturing technology,  quality, and product performance, and we had to remove  difficulties one by one to get to this point. The rocket prior  to the H-2 included American designs, but the H-2 is exclusively  made in Japan, all the way from design and manufacture to  various tests. I am sure everyone must have felt a great relief  with the success this time. It is impossible for me to express  my feelings and emotions with words. Practically speaking, the  launch not only marks this year as the year of birth for our  company, but, I think it also marks the beginning of the space  age for Japan.    NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: The advanced countries of  the world in terms of space development are already actively  involved in the commercialization of the space activities. Can  we expect the same thing to happen in Japan?    Yamada: Satellites are closely tied to our daily  lives in the areas of communications, broadcasting,  meteorological observation, etc. Earth observation satellites  play a major role in global environmental protection as well.  Geodetic satellites, maritime navigational satellites, global  position sensing satellites, etc., are ready to be used in many  fields. Also, the manufacture of new industrial materials and  medicines in the high-vacuum microgravity environment is  attracting people's attention, so that these fields will  increasingly create a need for launch vehicles.    The two major fields of commercial utilization of space are  communications and broadcasting. In addition, space stations  will be operational by the end of this century. I believe that  launch services will be more and more active in the future.    NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Japan's presence in the  space field will grow bigger, won't it?    Yamada: The global point of view is necessary for  us, since what Japan seeks in space exploration -- which carries  the immense dreams of mankind and holds boundless potential --  is the happiness of mankind as a whole. Thus, it is important  for us to cooperate with all the advanced countries of the world  in space development -- i.e., with the United States, Europe,  Russia and China -- in advancing the horizons of space.    What comes to our mind first when we talk about the space  business is the competition between countries, but the important  thing for us to do is to cooperate first; the competition may  come in the next phase. We have to look at space from the  standpoint of how we can efficiently utilize it for the  happiness of mankind, and how to make it contribute to earth's  environment.    NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: We understand that many  launches are scheduled, but what are the pending issues?    Yamada: Launching requires a huge investment; it  involves a big risk as well. Therefore, it is practically  impossible to redo it; an extremely high degree of reliability  is a must. A continuous effort to improve technology is  indispensable. Another thing is the cost. For the time being,  launches are supported by the national budget, and because of  that, we cannot afford to launch more than a few times a year.  However, the cost will not come down unless we increase the  frequency. Therefore, participation in the space market is quite  important.    NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Any other issues you wish to  discuss?    Yamada: We launch once in the spring and once in  the autumn, with the cooperation of local people. In order to  increase the frequency of the launches, we must have a more  extensive negotiation with the local people in order to improve  the launch environment. There is no question that we, the local  people, have to buy in, but we must also discuss the issue from  a broader point of view -- how to utilize space for the benefit  of mankind and how Japan should contribute to it in the  international sense.    A serious issue for our company itself is how to achieve a  cost reduction. A cost reduction is essential in improving the  usage rate. If we can lower the cost 30 percent from the current  level, or even 50 percent, we can increase the demand  substantially. I believe that we can reduce the cost if we  combine everyone's wisdom. We will seek the means of cost  reduction in both hardware and software areas, including  production control, quality control, and technology control. The  company has a great responsibility in getting access to the  world, the future, and space, and we wish to play an important  role in the great progress of the space industry.  <H5>  [Boxed item] </H5> <H5>  Sketch of Rocket System </H5>   Rocket System is a private company that provides launch  services for commercial satellites with the H-2 launch vehicle,  developed by NASDA. It was established in July 1990 with  investments from major space-related companies, including  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy  Industries, Nissan Motor, and NEC. Its paid-in capital is  &yen;484 million, and it employs about 40 people.    Its principal function is to take the technological assets  created by the R&amp;D activities of NASDA and the companies  involved in the development of the H-2 launch vehicle and  develop them into a commercial business. Rocket System will  provide a complete set of services that are based on the H-2 and  the TR-1 test rocket and that range from quality assurance,  production control, and sales to the launch services themselves.  As for the launch itself, Rocket System subcontracts NASDA,  which has a lot of experience. Launch services in other  countries consist essentially of the commercial launches of  satellites, and Japan intends to enter that business market,  knowing that it is a late-comer.

			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> LEON FLEISHER CLOSES PACIFIC SYMPHONY SEASON  </P> <P> For nearly 25 years, Leon Fleisher has made what seemed a career detour into a  mainstream occupation.  </P> <P> As a left-handed pianist -- when Fleisher was 37, his right hand was made  inoperative by a disorder later diagnosed as carpal tunnel syndrome -- the  American musician has successfully specialized in and expanded that repertory.  At the same time, his pursuit of a conducting career has borne fruit; actually,  Fleisher was, long before being struck by the hand-disorder, a conducting  protege of Pierre Monteux, who saw the breadth of his talents.  </P> <P> Now 61, Fleisher seems in his prime as both pianist and conductor. His first  appearance in Orange County, Wednesday night, when he led the Pacific Symphony  in a Beethoven/Ravel/Rachmaninoff program at Segerstrom Hall in Costa Mesa,  displayed his mastery impressively.  </P> <P> Ending its fourth season in the Orange County Performing Arts Center, the  ensemble played both splendidly and lethargically, by turns. No doubt the most  inconsistent of the more visible symphonic bands in Southern California, the  Pacific Symphony can soar or crawl, depending on the occasion, the conductor  and a number of other variables.  </P> <P> Wednesday, the orchestra gave its deepest attention and best efforts to  Fleisher -- in the final movements of Rachmaninoff's Second Symphony.  </P> <P> Here, players and conductor achieved a wondrous combination of immaculate  execution, emotional expansion and artistic reserve. The pathos of the Adagio,  which under some leaders can grow excessive, emerged at once pristine and  seductive. The finale proved, as it can, cathartic, authoritative and moving --  a conclusive statement summing up all that precedes it.  </P> <P> Earlier, however, in the opening movements of the symphony, but particularly in  Beethoven's "Coriolan" Overture, the orchestra vacillated between crystalline  transparency and vague and muddy textures, between stunning, mellow wind  playing and less-than-clean blasts, between perfectly aligned attacks and  flabby entrances.  </P> <P> At mid-program, Fleisher, conducting Ravel's Left-Hand Concerto from the  keyboard, seemed to give the players no choices.  </P> <P> With a hair-raising, definitive reading of Ravel's masterpiece emerging from  the grand piano, and commanding, irresistible gestures from the leader, the  orchestra responded in kind.  </P> <P> The performance moved ineluctably from its threatening beginning to its  climactic resolution, in a straight line. For once, the subsequent standing  ovation seemed appropriate. DANIEL CARIAGA  </P></p>

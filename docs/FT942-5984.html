			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / OECD pressed on Pergau Dam The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development was yesterday coming under pressure to publish a long-delayed report thought to be critical of the controversial Pergau Dam project. Mr Bernard Wood, director of the OECD's Development Corporate Directorate, justified the delay on 'production difficulties' and said there were no 'sinister' or 'political' reasons behind it. But the World Development Movement, a lobby group for the Third World which has strong parliamentary backing, described the delay as 'extraordinary'. The OECD has been reluctant to fuel the trade row between the UK and Malaysia by being drawn publicly into the Pergau project. But privately some senior OECD aid officials are believed to be sympathetic with UK criticism of the Pergau project, which involved a link between aid and military contracts. Kieran Cooke adds from Kuala Lumpur: Malaysia says it is ready to sign an agreement with Russia on the sale of 18 MiG-29s for use by the Malaysian air force. It is believed a quarter of the Dollars 615m (Pounds 410m) cost will be covered by Malaysian palm oil exports to Russia. Malaysian companies will be involved in some parts manufacturing for the fighters.</p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: MEPC The UK's second largest property company yesterday oozed caution after its 24 per cent pre-tax profits fall. Given that property is one of the lagging sectors of the economy, MEPC suggested any recovery might be deferred until at least late 1993. That looks at odds with the 54 per cent surge in its share price since Black Wednesday. The conventional explanation is that falling interest rates mean many property companies now yield more than cash, so investors are prepared to return to the better-managed stocks. Although MEPC sailed into the recession with a dangerously over-extended portfolio, its management has steered away from the shoals. Its development programme is now complete. It is raising useful funds from asset disposals - witness yesterday's Finsbury Circus sale  -and aggressive progress has been made on lettings. It would, however, be dangerous to get carried away. Gearing has risen to 82 per cent and profits were flattered by capitalised interest of Pounds 31m. That practice may soon have to end. At 1.2 times, dividend cover looks tight. MEPC hopes that property company shares will again become a safe haven for those desiring exposure to bricks and mortar and argues that investors will do better with shares than with real estate. But that would have its downside too. If fund managers switched to buying property companies on that basis, who would end up buying their developed sites?</p>

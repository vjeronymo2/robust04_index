			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / The Long View: The profits of boom Most British investors grew effortlessly richer during their holidays. Events in August confirmed the broadening strength of the international economy, with the US and the UK growing at 3 1/2 to 4 per cent and even troubled Germany staging a convincing rebound. Stock markets have gained in confidence. Clearly, though, short-term interest rates are on the turn. During August, key rates rose in the US, Italy and Sweden while French commercial lending rates edged up this week, too. The British authorities may yet come to regret their failure to raise UK rates at the beginning of last month. At this stage of the cycle, stock markets are, classically, subjected to a particular kind of two-way pull. Strong growth in profits and dividends is dragging them up, while rising interest rates are pulling them down. This particular cycle has been distorted by last winter's bond market crash, but I pointed out two months ago that UK share prices had drifted back into a buying range. It is not yet clear whether the main UK indices will get back to their January/February highs, as Wall Street very nearly has; but the next market peak will be determined by the point at which bullishness over corporate prospects begins to be overwhelmed by concern over rising short-term interest rates. Daily headlines tell us of the surge in corporate confidence on both sides of the Atlantic. Big deals are back in fashion, and mega-mergers are seen once again as a triumph of vision in the executive suite rather than a symptom of dangerous empire-building. This week's purchase of Sterling Health by SmithKline Beecham for Dollars 2.9bn was presented as a triumphant strategic move by SB. Perhaps it should rather be seen as a welcome move by Kodak, the seller, to extricate itself from the disastrous consequences of its own ill-judged expansion in the 1980s. We can simply note that macho corporate buyers are, once again, beginning to out-bid the stock market when it comes to putting a price on companies. Certainly, there is nothing like a healthy stream of profits to add a gleam to a chief executive's eye. In the UK, earnings per share - on the basis of the constituents of the All-Share index - have risen by 22 per cent over the past year, and dividends by 7 1/2 per cent. Investors appear to expect that growth rates will be nearly as good over the next year, too (perhaps still faster, for dividends). Curiously, big companies have outperformed the rest. The top 100, the Footsie index constituents, have raised earnings per share by 27 per cent in 12 months, and dividends by 9.7 per cent. Small companies, which were supposed to have greater recovery potential after the recession, have increased their earnings by only 13 per cent over the same period (I have calculated this from the SmallCap index, excluding investment trusts). Their dividends have not yet gone up at all, on balance. Perhaps the big companies have benefited more from restructuring, and perhaps the recovery is taking longer to percolate down to the smaller company sector. It had better do so soon: the tiddlers are valued more highly by investors because of their assumed higher growth. These 20 per cent growth rates in company earnings contrast strongly with the muted and stable 3 3/4 per cent growth in personal incomes. There has been a marked shift in the balance of power between capital and labour. The important question now is whether this is just a temporary cyclical effect. Already, company trading profits have moved above 15 per cent of national income (against only 12 per cent in 1992) and, on present trends, the proportion will reach an exceptional 17 per cent in 1995 (against previous peaks of just under 16 per cent in 1960 and 1985). History tells us, however, that profit booms tend to finish in inflationary surges as companies bid up the prices of labour, property and raw materials. This week's purchasing managers' survey showed, sure enough, that manufacturers' costs are rising - but this has yet to show in a significant acceleration of output prices. Judged by past cycles, pay rates will now begin to rise sharply. But unemployment still remains relatively high, at 9.3 per cent of the labour force. It is worth thinking about the theory of long cycles; according to this, at the start of a new long-term upturn (in a cycle which may run for 50 or 60 years), big new industrial growth sectors can generate high rates of return on capital for extended periods. Western countries have been through a phase of widespread recession and industrial rationalisation. Now, though, new industrial processes based on information technology are bringing about radical improvements in productivity. The result could be a protracted corporate boom at the same time as the labour markets remain relatively subdued (except for certain categories of skilled workers). It sounds like a capitalist's improbable Shangri-La - but, certainly, the present upturn is strikingly less inflationary so far than any seen in the UK in the past 25 years. Whatever the mysterious message of the long cycle, however, attention now switches to short-term interest rates. After the Bundesbank council meeting on Thursday, and the evidence of a quite vigorous German economic recovery, led by exports, the question is whether we have now reached the bottom, even for D-Mark rates. With the recession clearly over, the Buba must now focus on getting the German money supply back under control. As for the UK, there is a let's-get-it-over-with mood as the market looks for 5 3/4 per cent sterling rates soon, with the implied hope that the move might release tensions as effectively as the jump to 4 3/4 per cent in the US last month. But then, London has had the unearned benefit of that already. And we can't go on holiday again.</p>

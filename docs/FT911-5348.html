			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Publishing directors quit in row with parent THE managing and editorial directors of Mitchell Beazley, the specialist publisher, have resigned in a row with its parent company Octopus Books, part of Reed International. The resignation of Mr Duncan Baird, managing director, and Mr Jack Tressidor, editorial director, came after an insistence that Mitchell Beazley give up its separate premises and move into the Octopus headquarters in London. Mitchell Beazley was one of the leading niche publishers of the 1970s and 1980s, famous for its Hugh Johnson books on wine and The Joy of Sex. Mrs Janice Mitchell, widow of Mr James Mitchell, a co-founder, is expected to resign as a non-executive director. When Mrs Mitchell sold the publishing company to Paul Hamlyn's Octopus four years ago - just before it in turn was taken over by Reed - undertakings were given on both autonomy and an independent location. When Mitchell Beazley moves to Octopus headquarters in Michelin House, Fulham, redundancies are feared in areas such as sales which could be served centrally. Mitchell Beazley is believed to have pre-tax profits of about Pounds 900,000 on a turnover of Pounds 10m. It is not clear whether the top-level resignations will endanger relationships between the publisher and its authors.</p>

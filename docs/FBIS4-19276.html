			<p>BFN     [Text] UN mediator Cyrus Vance is trying to achieve a  compromise between Greece and Skopje [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] through goodwill moves. This was  evident after Vance's meeting with Ambassador Khristos  Zakharakis, who repeated that the embargo against Skopje will be  lifted only when Greece's conditions are accepted.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Athanasios Ellis from New  York] Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis, Foreign Ministry director  general, and UN mediator Cyrus Vance had a substantive meeting  just a short while ago. During the meeting, Zakharakis repeated  Athens' position on lifting the measures against Skopje if  Greece's three conditions are accepted. Vance, who appears  determined to achieve an end to the current stalemate, appears  to be trying to achieve some kind of compromise in the framework  of which the two sides will proceed simultaneously with goodwill  moves. As to such moves, diplomatic circles think that Greece  should lift the economic measures and Skopje should declare its  intention to abolish the star of Veryina from its flag and  change the disputed articles in its Constitution. The  international mediator is also trying to get the positions of  the two countries to agree on the other point of dispute  regarding whether the talks should include the issue of the  name, as Skopje demands, or whether we should remain with the  confidence-building measures at the current phase, as Athens  demands. Following the meeting, Zakharakis said that he will  brief the Greek Government and return on Monday. He also  stressed that during the meeting with Vance, they discussed all  the details of the problem.    Zakharakis, who met yesterday with U.S. Special Envoy  Matthew  Nimetz, also referred to the meeting scheduled between Greek  Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and Vance during Prime  Minister Andreas Papandreou's visit to the United States.  Consequently, Vance will continue his contacts with the two  side on Monday. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Lords' day IN THE last century, Parliament's House of Lords was described by Bagehot as a dignified rather than an efficient part of the UK constitution. Widening the suffrage had led to the triumph of the democratic Commons over the aristocratic Lords. But yesterday their lordships again found themselves at the centre of the political debate as anti-Maastricht campaigners urged them to overturn the Commons by voting for a referendum on the treaty. Both sides in the debate assiduously courted the 'backwoodsmen', the hereditary lords who rarely attend debates. Last time they turned out in force was in 1988, to defeat moves to introduce an element of progressivity in the poll tax. Their pivotal role in so doing was equally controversial, because many of these wealthy but unelected legislators gained hugely from the abolition of rates. Attempts to reform the House of Lords have been fraught with difficulty, however. It may be anachronistic that the UK's upper house is largely composed of peers who have either inherited their titles or received them as beneficiaries of the prime minister's patronage. It may be absurd that this large and unwieldy body which meets more frequently than almost any other legislature in the world in practice wields very little power. But finding cross-party agreement on how to reform the Lords has repeatedly foundered, not least because many MPs prefer a toothless second chamber that is unable to challenge the Commons' democratic credentials. Yet a second chamber that enjoyed greater legitimacy could do much to improve the quality of Britain's governance, as a pamphlet published today by the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research points out. It would be better able to amend and improve bad legislation. Its authority would be strengthened in scrutinising the work of the European Community. It could vet appointments to quangos, providing checks on the exercise of ministerial patronage. And it could be given special powers to veto constitutional changes which would therefore require the endorsement of both houses. But it can do none of these things well without the legitimacy conferred by democracy. That means elections for most or all of its members, though there is a case for some appointees to represent special interest groups such as business, religious organisations and ethnic minorities. Dignity should give way to legitimacy in the UK's upper house.</p>

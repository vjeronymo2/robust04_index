			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, "leader of the </F> Russian Liberal Democratic Party," by Vasil Popov; place and  date not given: "Economy Reshapes State Borders"]    [Text] [Popov] In several places in Europe, you made  statements about reshaping the existing state borders. How do  you envisage this, if you do not intend to use military power?    [Zhirinovskiy] Through economy. If the Yugoslav economy had  not been destroyed, there would not have been any change of the  borders and no new states would have emerged. Peace and calm  would have continued to reign in Serbia and all of Yugoslavia.  However, the economy was destroyed and we facilitated this by  participating in the embargo. The embargo paralyzed every  attempt to revive the economy and now a war rages and borders  are being reshaped. The same applies to Iraq and Libya.    Let us look at Ukraine. It owes us a few zillions. Why  should we forget this money? Kiev steals our gas, which is  intended for Germany. The Germans are imposing fines on us, and  thus we are being hit from both directions. This is economy?  This is only friendship that still exists between certain  leaders.    [Popov] During your visit to Bulgaria you spoke about  returning certain territories to Bulgaria.    [Zhirinovskiy] Bulgaria could take its territories back. We  will not give them to you -- they are not ours. However, if  Dobrudzha is Bulgarian, why is it in Romania? And if Thrace is  Bulgarian, why is it in Turkey? I mean the return of your own  territories, not the conquest of new territories by force.    [Popov] How could this happen?    [Zhirinovskiy] The Bulgarians alone should resolve this  issue. Naturally, through economic means. However, your economy  stagnates. Your chemical plants have been closed. Your resorts  are empty. The workers of Vorkuta for example, could rest very  well there. You owe Russia $70 million. Why do you not allow  our workers to rest in Bulgaria in exchange of your debt? Our  people will rest and you will pay your debt.    [Popov] There was a lot of noise about the political  amnesty. The Liberal Democratic Party was one of the parties  that initiated this amnesty.    [Zhirinovskiy] Our program included an amnesty for all those  arrested since 1986, and thus ending the perestroyka. Both  sides made mistakes, and now the deputies, the government, and  the people forgive. Let all those who are guilty begin by zero.  The amnesty could only have a positive effect. Starting from  the zero point we will seek ways of joint activity. The people  have been freed and this is good.    [Popov] Do the former defendants have a political future?    [Zhirinovskiy] They should not have a political future. The  victims who fell in vain in October, the destroyed families, and  the emigrants should remind them of this. Khasbulatov went  home. Makashov did the same. Dunayev said that he will devote  himself to his wife, children, and motherland. This is good  advice for all of them. However, everyone can participate in  political life when it is based on the Constitution, i.e. to  take part in the elections. Let them compete -- anyone could  have a chance if he does not build barricades and does not  accumulate weapons. They will begin now, while we already have  an advantage. Let them try to reach and surpass us, as it  happens in sports.    [Popov] People are talking about a crisis in the Liberal  Democratic Party.    [Zhirinovskiy] This is disinformation. The entire country  is in a crisis, and this affects all parties. It is like a car  -- it moves, but releases gases and makes noises. The army also  is in a crisis, but if necessary it will stop any eventual  aggression.    [Popov] The budget was discussed recently. Will its  adoption help Russia?    [Zhirinovskiy] The budget will not help Russia. Only a  change of the political leadership will help Russia. In the  summer or in the fall we will change the government and will  begin a new policy in the country.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Ion Cristoiu: "The Involvement of the </F> Romanian National Unity Party in the Caritas Game"]    [Text] For some time now the leaders of the Romanian  National Unity Party [PUNR] have been making desperate efforts  to prove that their party has nothing to do with Caritas.  Moreover, in their efforts to dissociate themselves from  [Caritas Director] Ioan Stoica, they went so far as to claim  that it was not the PUNR, but rather another party, the  Democratic Party (National Salvation Front) [PD(FSN)] that had  been the protector of the great nationwide con. Why the PD(FSN)  and not another political grouping? Because [PD(FSN) President]  Petre Roman's party is being used by the current government  coalition worse than the kulak subject was exploited in  proletarian literature. Whenever a post-December 1989 disaster  occurs, it is immediately blamed on the Roman government. The  proletarian writers were always blaming the fat kulak for all  the mishaps in the village: for the threshing machine being  offbeat, for the wheat failing to sprout, and even for the lack  of rain. For the propaganda machine of the current left-wing  coalition, Petre Roman's party is responsible for all past,  present, and future evils. The PD(FSN) is to be blamed for the  scope of corruption, for the huge number of unemployed, and for  the holes in the pavement. Therefore, in blaming the PD(FSN)  for Caritas, the PUNR leaders cannot boast that they have shown  a great amount of originality. At best, they have showed a bit  of cowardice.    The whole country was and is aware of the fact that the  responsibility for the setting up and expansion of Caritas  belongs to the PUNR. As shown by the group of items published  on page 3 of today's issue of our newspaper, Ioan Stoica enjoyed  the unconditional and direct support of PUNR President Gheorghe  Funar. Without his decisive support, Caritas would have never  reached such fame, which went even beyond Romania's borders.  The Caritas kind of game relies on the constant difference  between the number of people who deposit their money and those  who cash it. The more the number of depositors exceeds the  number of receivers, the better the game can ensure the  multiplication of the sum of money due to be cashed. This vital  difference requires that increasingly more citizens take the  company's cashier desks by assault to deposit their money.  However, this requires that the citizens must have trust in the  seriousness of the game. Consequently, the explosion of Caritas  was made possible by the much greater trust put in this game,  than in other similar games throughout the country. This was  due both to Ioan Stoica's ability to project himself as a  messiah and to the categorical support lent to Caritas by a man  of Gheorghe Funar's caliber: PUNR president and Cluj mayor.  Therefore, no matter how hard the other PUNR leaders tried to  prove to the contrary, Gheorghe Funar's responsibility stands  beyond any doubt. As a matter of fact, since he is a correct  man, the PUNR president reiterated his public support for  CARITAS at the end of last week. What else can his eulogy of  the bankrupt Cluj game be -- at a time when everybody has  realized that it is a swindle -- other than a declaration of  public support for it? Even though it was done pretty much  indiscreetly, the PUNR leaders have tried to distance the party  from Gheorghe Funar in the matter of the Caritas affair. For  instance, they said that the PUNR president's support for  Caritas does not mean that the party also supported it. They  also maintain that the Cluj mayor's involvement in this affair  has nothing to do with his capacity as PUNR president, but that  he did it as a private person. However, these are but sophisms  of people with their backs to the wall! The trust of the  Caritas depositors relied on the fact that the game was  supported not by just anybody, but by a prominent political  figure. If the party had dissociated itself from CARITAS and  Gheorghe Funar at the appropriate time, by publicly condemning  not only the game, but also the Cluj mayor's involvement, the  people would have been more prudent before giving away their  shirts to enrich Ioan Stoica. But then, the PUNR was quiet at  the time, thus conveying the impression that all of it supports  the Caritas scheme. The current gesture comes too late.  Gheorghe Funar's involvement throws the burden of  responsibility onto the whole party. Any public trial of the  disaster called Caritas will have to examine the PUNR's  involvement in the affair, as it will also be unable to avoid  examining the dubious role played by certain journalists in the  dissemination of the swindle.    Nevertheless, there is still a salvation for the PUNR,  namely  to publicly condemn, in particularly firm terms, Gheorghe  Funar's guilt in the Caritas affair. Likewise, it should rid  itself of its president, by invoking the legal proceedings  against Caritas. But this is a difficult, if not impossible,  thing to do, without risking a major convulsion within the PUNR.</p>

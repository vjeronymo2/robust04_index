			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / The Japanese Election: Nobuteru Ishihara - Japan says yes / How candidates fared After an uphill struggle Mr Nobuteru Ishihara, the LDP's youngest candidate, was re-elected in one of the country's most hotly contested constituencies. Mr Ishihara is the son of Mr Shintaro Ishihara, former transport minister and co-author of A Japan That Can Say No. Mr Ishihara junior was one of the 12 candidates competing for five seats. The constituency in central Tokyo has a youthful and shifting population and is fickle in its political choices. However, using the celebrity links of his uncle, Mr Yujiro Ishihara, a movie star who passed away seven years ago, he has managed to capture the electorate. Nonetheless, the district's tendency to vote in line with overall trends has hurt the Social Democrats, who lost two seats. His outspoken father was also re-elected, coming in first in his constituency.</p>

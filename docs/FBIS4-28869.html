			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a report from XINHUA News Agency,  China conducted an underground nuclear test on the morning of 10  June. While making an announcement on this, the spokesman of the  Chinese Foreign Ministry said that China will completely ban and  thoroughly destroy nuclear weapons, and that in this connection,  it consistently supports the realization of a comprehensive  nuclear test ban.    He said that stemming from this fundamental position, China  has been manifesting great self-restraint from the beginning in  conducting nuclear tests, and that the number of nuclear tests  conducted by China is very limited.    He said that China completely respects and understands the  position and worry of many nonnuclear countries in connection  with the issue of nuclear tests. The spokesman said that  currently China is actively taking part in the negotiations on  the comprehensive test ban treaty, and through this kind of  negotiations, China supports the conclusion of such a treaty  before 1996. He said that such a treaty must be a measure for a  complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons.    He said that China demands that other countries that possess  nuclear weapons must give up their policy on restraining nuclear  weapons and clearly promise the complete prohibition and  thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. The spokesman said  that to quickly realize this ultimate goal, China is willing to  continue to persistently make efforts with the international  community.</p>

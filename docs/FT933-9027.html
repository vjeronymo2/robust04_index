			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Technology: Phones ring higher - The take-off of in-flight satellite communications The mobile telephone, indispensable tool of business life or scourge of privacy, is about to take to Europe's air routes. Air-to-ground telephones, using 1980s analogue technology, have been available on aircraft in the US for a decade, but now a new range of digital systems that improve reception and keeps costs low is being marketed in Europe and the US. Airlines are always looking for new ways with which to distinguish themselves from their competitors. Telephones have long been of interest because, unlike frequent flyer programmes and seat-back televisions, they can generate revenue for the airline directly as passengers pay for their calls. Most big airlines have already experimented with satellite telephones. The trials were, at best, a partial success because sound quality is variable and the cost of the equipment and satellite time means the charge to passengers is an uncomfortable Dollars 10 (Pounds 7) a minute. Some airlines are, nevertheless, going ahead with full-scale services, especially where flights are across oceans or polar regions where no ground-based system is ever likely to be established. Air France, for example, has satellite telephones on its Paris-Tokyo flights and has an average of 15 short telephone calls on each trip. Singapore Airlines is in the process of installing satellite telephones in all its aircraft. On the other hand, British Airways decided it would wait until the next generation of technology arrived. But the waiting may almost be over. Next month Air France begins trials of a new system for flights within Europe that will be shared with BA and SAS. Ground stations are being built by French electronics company Alcatel at Paris and Lyons in France, Malmo in Sweden, Milan in Italy and London and Glasgow in the UK. The airlines have yet to decide which telecommunications company will supply the service. One candidate is a US company, In-Flight Phone International (IFPI). Last month it demonstrated its wares in Europe, announcing a deal with Mercury, the UK operation of Cable and Wireless, and it is constructing networks in Greenland, Iceland and the United Arab Emirates. IFPI has already built a system for USAir, one of the biggest domestic carriers in the US in which BA has a large stake. The Mercury/IFPI service will use more than 60 terrestrial base stations to provide a pan-European digital phone service for upwards of Pounds 2 a minute for international calls. British Telecom is launching a rival digital service - called Jetphone  - with France Telecom in the autumn. BT already offers a digital satellite Skyphone service; its terrestrial service will operate to the same draft pan-European standards as Mercury's, on frequencies in the 1800 MHz band. The two rivals are even likely to use many of the same base stations, operated by the state monopoly in countries which do not permit competition in voice telephony. Whoever wins contracts with the airlines will be offering more than simple telephone calls. The new equipment will allow services such as fax machines, in-flight shopping and even videos and computer games controlled from a keypad. USAir and an even larger US carrier, United Airlines, are already equipping their fleets with systems that allow passengers to make calls and transmit computer data to the ground. Both also allow passengers to be contacted in the air by paging. GTE, the largest local network operator in the US, is providing the system for United Airlines. Its GenStar system will use 109 terrestrial base stations to provide a telephone service over the US at Dollars 2 a minute, plus a Dollars 2 set-up fee. In alliance with Comsat, the US satellite agency, it will provide a satellite service at Dollars 8 a minute (plus an Dollars 8 set-up fee) for calls made beyond the reach of the base stations. Using seat-back screens or liquid crystal displays, GenStar will also provide passengers with multi-language video, video-games, entertainment channels and flight information. Although telecoms services will be billed direct to passengers through credit cards, some airlines may want to pay for many of the value-added services especially for first and business-class passengers. The upfront cost of providing these services is heavy. Air France plans to re-equip its entire European short-haul fleet of more than 50 aircraft with the new air-to-ground telephones. The work will cost Dollars 200,000 (Pounds 135,000) per aircraft but will be worth it, says Marc Dubois, Air France brand manager in charge of the telephones project. 'On short flights we must offer the chance of a call to everyone,' he says. 'We expect to offer at least one handset per three passengers and would prefer to have one handset per seat because of the short flights.' Air France hopes the pan-European network it plans to build with BA and SAS will start operating next year. For electronics companies, such plans could prove lucrative. The market for the long-haul satellite linking equipment appears to have potential for sales approaching Pounds 700m by the middle of the next decade. According to Ron Keens, managing director of Racal Avionics, some 5,000 avionic communication systems will have been installed by the year 2005, linking wide-bodied aircraft and business jets via the Inmarsat satellite to the ground. Looking at the long-haul satellite-based market, Racal appears to have a six-month lead on the only other competitor, Rockwell Collins of the US. Keens expects Racal to take about 60 per cent of the market and achieve sales of about Pounds 350m by the year 2005.</p>

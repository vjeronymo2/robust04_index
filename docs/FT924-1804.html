			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Buoyant exports help Halmajump 21% A STRONG export sales performance helped Halma, the safety and environmental control group, increase pre-tax profits 21 per cent to Pounds 8.12m. Turnover rose 15 per cent to Pounds 50.9m in the 27 weeks to October 3. Direct exports increased 24 per cent to Pounds 13.5m and overseas sales rose 19 per cent to Pounds 24.5m. The group said the results reflected a good performance across the board from almost all its 38 subsidiaries. Mr David Barber, chairman, said UK activities in themselves had a strongly positive balance of payments, so the devaluation of sterling would benefit profitability. Many of the group's products were firmly established in their overseas markets, so the currency change would lead to either increased sales or higher profit margins. Halma spent Pounds 1.8m on acquisitions, including Pounds 800,000 for IPC Resistors in Canada and its sister company in Kentucky, which should improve its position in the US market for heavy-duty resistors. Cashflow remained buoyant and the group had no net borrowings. Earnings per share increased to 3.77p (3.25p) and the interim dividend is lifted to 1.036p (0.863p). COMMENT Halma's shares jumped 8p to close at 208p, partly because the shares are tightly held and marketmakers had to scramble to cover their positions. There can be little quibbling about the 21 per cent jump in pre-tax profits, more than half of which came from acquisitions. Sales to continental Europe rose 32 per cent, and the group is confident it can survive any looming downturn there - mainly because its niche products are often driven by environmental and safety legislation. The only catch is that forecast full-year profits of Pounds 19m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 23, a 40 per cent premium to the market. Longer-term, analysts wonder whether the company's consistent growth record can be maintained as it grows in size. Existing shareholders have done well by sitting tight, but prospective buyers at this level should consider how much further the shares can advance.</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Ukraine to keep Chernobyl plant open THE UKRAINIAN Parliament decided to continue nuclear energy production at the Chernobyl power plant yesterday, reversing its order to shut down the power station by the end of this year. Chernobyl is the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986, which was responsible for 8,000 deaths and radioactive contamination in Ukraine, Russia and Belorussia. The decision to keep Chernobyl open is part of Ukraine's policy to develop domestic energy production and reduce reliance on its main energy supplier, Russia, with whom Ukraine has had difficult relations since the break-up of the Soviet Union. Cash-strapped Ukraine is plagued with energy shortages and has a Dollars 2.5bn oil and gas debt to Russia. Atomic energy currently accounts for 35 per cent of the nation's electricity consumption. Although public opinion is strongly against nuclear power, Ukraine's energy crisis has swayed the parliament into overturning the popular 1991 order to close Chernobyl. However, many western and Ukrainian scientists have questioned the long-term safety of the Soviet-designed RBMK reactors, which are not used in the west. More than 115 nuclear safety violations have occurred at Ukraine's five power stations since the beginning of this year. Only two of Chernobyl's four reactors are in operation. A third reactor was shut down two years ago after a fire. The fourth reactor, where the Chernobyl explosion took place, is encased in a cracking concrete shell. A replacement shell is to be constructed.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas told  journalists at his news conference today about his visit to the  Netherlands and Belgium as well as the Partnership for Peace  [PFP] agreement, which he signed at NATO headquarters.    Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the Seimas opposition also  gave his view on the signing of the agreement.    Here is Audrius Baciulis with the details:    [Baciulis] Brazauskas stressed that in the process of  carrying out the Partnership for Peace program, the Lithuanian  Armed Forces would grow stronger and come closer to NATO  standards. The important point here is that the quality of the  Armed Forces and not the quantity will change. At the moment it  is too early to tell how much this will cost. Lithuania is  receiving significant help from the Scandinavian countries.  Britain has already undertaken the training of the  peace-keeping unit. Of course, this is not a matter of one day  but of a long period of time, Brazauskas said. It would not be  serious to give you figures out of a hat, the president said,  however, one must not forget that peace and stability involves  considerable expense.    Brazauskas stressed that finances for the formation of the  peace- keeping battalion would not be taken from the education,  culture, or social security budgets. Already this week experts  from Denmark and Germany will arrive in Lithuania to discuss  possibilities for Lithuania to practically participate in the  Partnership for Peace program. Some NATO states will help to  set up the Lithuanian national security doctrine. Apart from  this, NATO countries will send their experts [to advise] in the  negotiations on military transit to Kaliningrad.    The possibility of signing a free trade agreement between  Lithuania and the European Union this year and also the  possibility of receiving the status of associated member of the  European Union was discussed by Brazauskas during the meeting  with Jacques Delors, chairman of the European Commission, in  Brussels. Delors was in favor of such a possibility.    During the president's visit to the Netherlands, agreements  on maritime transport and investment inducements were signed.  During talks with Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene  agreement was reached to accelerate the signing of such  agreements between Lithuania and Belgium.    Answering a question on whether the Partnership for Peace  program guaranteed Lithuanian security, Brazauskas remarked that  for some reason everyone wants security guarantees at once. Of  course there are no specific security guarantees in the  Partnership for Peace program as it would be in the NATO treaty.  However, many important articles have been included in the  program, for example, the possibility of inviting NATO  consultants in the event of a threat, then there is joint  military planning with NATO, and so on. When all this is put  together you can see that the guarantees are given, Brazauskas  said.    Landsbergis also gave his comments on the Partnership for  Peace documents at his news conference today. He noted that the  Partnership for Peace program was a framework for all the states  and not just Lithuania alone. It is important how this  framework will be filled, he said.    Because the agreement gives the right to hold consultations  with NATO if danger arises, Landsbergis proposed that such  consultants should be invited to Lithuania now. According to  Landsbergis, Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev's latest  statements, the events in Belarus and her statements with regard  to Lithuania, already enables Lithuania to speak about a threat  to the integrity of her territory.    Landsbergis drew attention to the fact that Brazauskas spoke  very cautiously in Brussels and that his statements there were  very cautious and reassuring for Russia. He expressed concern  about the protracted negotiations on military transit to  Kaliningrad. Such military transit may involve Lithuania into  the structures of CIS military interaction, Landsbergis said.  At the same time he did not reject the possibility that  military transit to Kaliningrad through the territory of  Lithuania could exist, however, this should be carried out on  one-off agreements only and not on agreements.    The possibility of inviting international experts for the  preparation of this agreement was regarded by Landsbergis as a  shield and means for making the international community used to  the idea of such an agreement.</p>

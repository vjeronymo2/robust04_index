			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By UKRINFORM correspondent Valentin Vernodubenko] </F>   [Text] Kiev December 14 TASS -- A team of IAEA experts  headed by Deputy IAEA General Director Morris Rosen has spent  two days at the Chernobyl power plant.    Rosen told UKRINFORM they came to the plant as the  international community is concerned with its work, including  the functioning of the fourth power unit under sarcophagus.  Another reason is international assistance to Chernobyl. In  his words, the team was given all information about the plant  operation.    Asked about the IAEA attitude to the on-going operation of  RBMK reactors at Russian and Lithuanian nuclear power plants,  Rosen said there is certain concern. However, they know about  the situation at plants with RBMK reactors and did not have  enough information about Chernobyl after the Ukrainian  parliament decided to halt the plant.    ``We are interested in enhanced safety of the Chernobyl  nuclear power plant and in giving the international public  objective information on its current state. In February a new  IAEA team will come to the plant to fully estimate the  situation,'' Chernobyl nuclear power plant's general director  Nikolay Sorokin told UKRINFORM.</p>

			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABBIE HOFFMAN: THE YIPPIE WHO STAYED IN TUNE WITH '60S  </P> <P> John Froines hadn't seen much of Abbie Hoffman over the last few years. But  they were thrown together nearly 20 years ago as members of the famous Chicago  Seven who underwent a raucous 4 1/2-month trial stemming from street protests  at the 1968 Democratic convention. And that often hard and bitter courtroom  drama left Froines with an enduring fondness for the wild-haired counterculture  guerrilla and Yippie leader who died Wednesday at age 52.  </P> <P> "You talk about great people and you think of John Kennedy or Winston  Churchill," Froines, now a member of the public health faculty at UCLA, said  Thursday. "But I think that with Abbie we've lost somebody who's very  precious."  </P> <P> Froines feelings were echoed by other Hoffman friends as they reminisced about  the life of a man who delighted in questioning authority -- and making fun of  it.  </P> <P> Paul Krassner, who now lives in Venice but helped Hoffman found the Youth  International Party in New York in late 1967, said he hoped that Hoffman will  be remembered for his commitment to justice and reform.  </P> <P> "I think it's important for young people to know that there are creative ways  of fighting city hall, which is what Abbie stood for," said Krassner, perhaps  best known for the alternative magazine and newsletter -- The Realist -- that  he has published since 1958. Krassner was not arrested or tried following the  1968 demonstrations in Chicago.  </P> <P> Krassner said the enduring lesson he learned from Hoffman was about the  pervasive nature of politics. "Politics and culture are the same," he  explained. "Our culture was our politics; you couldn't separate them."  </P> <P> California Assemblyman Tom Hayden, another of the defendants in the Chicago  Seven case, issued a statement through his office about Hoffman's passing.  </P> <P> "I am shocked and profoundly saddened by Abbie Hoffman's death. He was an  important person of my generation and he will be dearly missed," Hayden's  statement said.  </P> <P> But not everyone was so effusive about Hoffman's often controversial political  activism, especially those who were in positions to put his career in  perspective. Said Mark Kann, a professor of political science at USC who was  active in the anti-war movement but not a member of the Chicago Seven, "I think  the '60s had some real impact on our society. Whether Abbie Hoffman had much  impact I think is questionable. To me he represented this relatively small  group that was terrific at getting publicity."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Serious Doubts'  </P> <P> By doing "outrageous things," Kann said, Hoffman was "effective for a short  while" at raising questions that needed to be raised. Did Hoffman and the  Yippies provide answers to those questions? "I have serious doubts about that."  </P> <P> Others who were on trial with Hoffman could not be reached for comment. At last  report, former Yippie leader Jerry Rubin was running a New York company that  produces parties for yuppies at Manhattan nightclubs. Lee Weiner is a  consultant who operates a direct mail firm for nonprofit organizations and  political clients from Washington, D.C. Rennie Davis reportedly still lives in  the Denver area where he once sold life insurance. David Dellinger, a lifelong  peace activist, is in his early 70s and lives in Peacham, Vt. Black Panther  Bobby Seale, whose case was severed from the others and tried separately, works  at Temple University in Philadelphia where he is doing graduate study in  political science and African-American studies.  </P> <P> Psychedelic drug guru Timothy Leary, who helped set the tone for the 1960s,  offered a comment that placed Hoffman in a pantheon of heroes and anti-heroes.  </P> <P> "Abbie Hoffman was an American legend. He was up there in the hall of fame with  rebel Huck Finn, rowdy Babe Ruth, crazy Lenny Bruce," Leary told the Associated  Press. "He was the Pete Rose of the '60s counterculture, a hustler, a base  stealer, a wild free spirit and a gambler. He is a historic figure and a great  American and I loved the guy."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A 'Serious Social Critic'  </P> <P> Paul Von Blum, a lecturer at UCLA since 1980 and a friend of Krassner who was  involved early on in the nonviolent civil rights movement, said, "For all his  image as a kind of buffoon and clown, I think Abbie Hoffman was a very serious  social critic in the historical grain of American social critics. There is an  entire generation of academics and others who are his moral legacy."  </P> <P> Hoffman gained national attention as a member of the Chicago Seven, a group of  radicals who led hundreds of protesters at the 1968 Democratic National  Convention in Chicago. They were later charged with conspiracy to incite  violence at the convention. The defendants, particularly Hoffman and Rubin,  turned the court into a theater with antics that included wearing judicial  robes to court, taking them off and stomping on them.  </P> <P> Krassner said that though Hoffman's fortunes waxed and waned he remained  committed to his brand of politics, which mixed activism with humor. "Abbie, if  he had chose to, could have been a very successful political satirist," he  said.  </P> <P> Hoffman was reported to be suffering lingering pain from an automobile accident  and to have been depressed just before he was found dead by his landlord in his  Pennsylvania apartment. One report described Hoffman's residence as a converted  chicken coop.  </P> <P> At the time of his death, Krassner said, Hoffman was working with a co-author  on a book about political campaigns as well as continuing to speak on the  lecture circuit.  </P> <P> As recently as last week, Hoffman traveled to Vanderbilt University in  Nashville, Tenn., where he participated in a panel discussion with other '60s  activists.  </P> <P> There Hoffman criticized today's campuses as "bastions of rest," and said the  interest young people have in the '60s disturbed him.  </P> <P> "Nostalgia is a sign of middle-age," he said before his Vanderbilt appearance.  "We're reminiscing about our youth. When you see young people nostalgic for a  youth they didn't even experience, it's a little sad. They're supposed to be  out making one for themselves."  </P> <P>  Times Staff Writer Beverly Beyette contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P></p>

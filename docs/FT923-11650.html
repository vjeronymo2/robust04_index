			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Observer: Ae fareweel There's no doubt many a 'right gude-willie waught' being taken for auld lang syne at farewell parties in Scotland at the moment. Moreover, the departing guest is probably one of the minority of folk even north of the Border who knows what Burns's phrase means. He is Seiichiro Otsuka, Japan's consul-general in Edinburgh since the consulate opened there last year, who's away next week to a senior post in Bangkok. Known to all around as Ichi, he has been a diplomatic triumph in Scotland, not least because of his consummate knowledge of its national poet. Indeed, until his transfer came, he was aiming to cap his acclaimed performances at Burns Night suppers by winning September's contest in Dumfries for the best recitation of Tam o' Shanter. So translating 'gude-willie waught' as goodwill drink should be child's play for him, whereas half of the FT's resident Scots available yesterday failed the test. Never mind, though. He says he'll be looking for a Burns club in Thailand and if he can't find one, he'll found it.</p>

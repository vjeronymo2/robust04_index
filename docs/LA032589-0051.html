			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 6 CONTRAS EXPELLED IN SLAYING OF SUSPECTED SPY; 1 CONVICTED OF RAPE  </P> <P> The Nicaraguan rebels announced Friday that they have expelled six officers and  men, including their chief of intelligence and the head of one of their  regional commands, for complicity in the torture and murder of a suspected  Sandinista infiltrator.  </P> <P> The chief of the regional command, a guerrilla who went by the nom de guerre  "Commander Nolan," was also found guilty of raping two female members of his  own command.  </P> <P> The case grew out of the torture and murder last year of a rebel named  "Managua," who was suspected of being a secret agent for the Sandinistas.  </P> <P> U.S. officials learned of the unexplained murder last December and pressed the  Contras to investigate. The ensuing inquiry turned up evidence of torture of  several prisoners and mistreatment of Contra troops by the officers of the  Quilali Regional Command.  </P> <P> Two Contras, code-named "Israelita" and "Pandillero," were found guilty of the  murder. Another, "Rambo," was found guilty of torture.  </P> <P> The chief of Contra military intelligence, "Commander Mack," was found guilty  of complicity in covering up the murder, along with an aide, "Ali."  </P> <P> "This was a tragic case, but we have investigated it properly and held a fair  trial," said Bosco Matamoros, the Contras' Washington spokesman.  </P> <P> A U.S. official noted, however, that some Contra officers had known of the case  but apparently took no steps to investigate until American officials pressed  for action.  </P></p>

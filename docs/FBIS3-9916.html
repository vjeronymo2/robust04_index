			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem begins a  three-day official visit to Spain today. He had to postpone the  visit twice: first because of the death of Don Juan de Borbon  [King Juan Carlos's father] and then because of the heart attack  he suffered. [passage omitted]    Jose Manuel Martin Meden reports on this visit:    [Martin Meden] [Passage omitted] Menem arrives in Madrid  with  his political horizon clear after the agreement with the  opposition for a constitutional reform that will enable him to  be re-elected and to govern until the year 2000 if he wins a  majority in 1995. In statements for Radiotelevision Espanola,  the president of Argentina confirms his good health and his  readiness to continue as president.    [Begin Menem recording] I am much better than before the  operation. I shall face it with the same passion, the same  enthusiasm, the same spirit with which I have done everything in  my life and, of course, with a small quantity of ability. [end  recording]    [Martin Meden] [Passage omitted] President Menem says that  he  is convinced that, through negotiation, in the year 2000 the  Malvinas [Falkland] Islands will be Argentine again.    [Begin Menem recording] I have the intuition -- and in  intuition there is also some share of of intelligence, of wisdom  -- that in the year 2000 the Malvinas Islands will be in the  possession of Argentina again. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

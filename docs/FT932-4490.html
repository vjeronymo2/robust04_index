			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Crossrail bill wins second reading THE GOVERNMENT wants the private sector to be 'fundamentally' involved in the Crossrail project, Mr Steven Norris, transport minister, said last night as the bill clearing the way for the Pounds 2bn scheme received its second Commons reading, David Owen writes. Mr Norris sidestepped repeated requests to outline what proportion of funding for the scheme to build a pair of rail tunnels under central London ministers were hoping to raise from private sources. But he emphasised the government was not contemplating a project to which the private sector 'might merely make a small contribution.' Mr Brian Wilson, a shadow transport spokesman, said Labour supported the bill 'above all' because the economy needed the sort of kick start that projects such as Crossrail could generate.</p>

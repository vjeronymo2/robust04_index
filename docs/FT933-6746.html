			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / China acts to curb corruption THE Chinese Communist Party's top disciplinary commission yesterday formally banned party officials from trading on the stock market and holding private business interests. In a nationwide drive to achieve 'clean government', the commission unveiled a new code of conduct imposing severe limitations on tens of thousands of officials. Warning that corruption was 'still growing and spreading', the commission said, 'the negative and corruptive manifestations, if not overcome resolutely, will ruin the party, the people's political power, and the great cause of socialist modernisation.' The new rules are set to strike at the heart of the patronage system so precious to Chinese officialdom, and for that reason are certain to prove extremely difficult to enforce. The new code of conduct bars officials from: Engaging in business on their own account or using their influence to assist relatives and friends profit from their activities. Trading in securities. Accepting gifts of money or negotiable securities, or credit cards. Using public funds to acquire membership of clubs or to participate in any high-cost recreational activity. The measures reflect intense concern at senior levels of the Communist party over the continuing erosion of the party's reputation and authority caused by corruption fuelled by China's economic boom. It also coincides with deepening worries in Beijing over a weakening of the central authorities' control over the regions. Officials face enormous obstacles in their corruption drive, however, since the problem reaches high into the ruling party itself. Top officials and their relatives are among those most deeply engaged in private business. The anti-corruption communique was issued at the end of a six-day conference attended by more than 100 senior officials, and addressed by Mr Jiang Zemin, the Party boss. 'Corruption is a virus that has infected the healthy bodies of our Party and State,' Mr Jiang told delegates at the weekend.</p>

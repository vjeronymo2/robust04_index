The center will offer peaceful research projects to  scientists and technicians of the former Soviet Union who have  expertise in weapons of mass destruction and missile guidance  systems.    Aside from its other role as a source of funds, the center  will monitor the various assigned projects to ensure their  peaceful objectives.    Officials said the idea is to keep economically troubled  former Soviet scientists and technicians from selling their  expertise to the highest bidder, including such states as North  Korea and Iraq.    The center was established by agreement among Russia, the  United States, the European Union and Japan.</p>

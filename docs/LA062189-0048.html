			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRMS, LOBBIES HELPED PROVIDE FUNDS FOR SEN. WILSON'S TRAVELS  </P> <P> On March 4, 1988, Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) flew home to San Diego to take  one of the biggest steps of his political career: opening his campaign for  reelection.  </P> <P> By all appearances, it was the usual campaign kickoff extravaganza. Beginning  in San Diego, Wilson barnstormed seven California cities, making speeches at  every stop.  </P> <P> But what did not come to light until Wilson recently filed his personal  financial disclosure report for 1988 was that the first-class fare for the  cross-country legs of his trip was paid for by neither his campaign treasury  nor his Senate travel account. Instead, it was picked up by General Electric  Credit Corp., a GE subsidiary headquartered in Stamford, Conn.  </P> <P> Wilson's March campaign journey was one of a dozen trips the senator made  between Washington and California last year at the expense of various  corporations and lobbying groups. In fact, the records show that California's  junior senator clearly has become a leader in a practice employed by some  Western-state members of Congress -- relying on special interest groups to pay  the costs of their routine travel.  </P> <P> What makes the phenomenon so surprising is that the American taxpayers already  provide Wilson and other members of Congress with money to travel between the  nation's capital and their home state. Moreover, campaign trips paid for by  special interests tread dangerously close to federal laws that forbid  congressional candidates from receiving free services from corporations.  </P> <P> In order to prevent rich corporations from buying elections, federal law  prohibits candidates from accepting corporate money, either directly or  indirectly. But members of Congress seeking reelection can take corporate money  or services for specific appearances as long as they can demonstrate that the  event was separate from their campaign. Thus Wilson's GE-paid air fare was  legal because he delivered a speech to the group during his 10-day trip to  California.  </P> <P> According to Wilson's aides, the senator often prefers to travel back and forth  between Washington and California at the expense of special interest groups  when possible because it permits him to use his $95,000-a-year official  congressional expense account for other purposes -- such as paying the expenses  of aides who want to accompany him on these trips.  </P> <P> "It's an opportunity not to use taxpayers' money," said Bill Livingston,  Wilson's press secretary. "It's an opportunity to stretch the funds so he can  go out to the state more often. If we had unlimited amounts of tax money, we'd  never have to worry about this."  </P> <P> But critics view this practice as another way that special interests have found  to ingratiate themselves to members of Congress by picking up the tab for  everything from a meal to exotic foreign trips -- a system that Common Cause  President Fred Wertheimer describes as "legalized corruption."  </P> <P> Privately, Washington lobbyists for big special interest groups and major  corporations report that they often receive telephone calls from congressional  staffers who are soliciting free transportation for their bosses to the home  district or other locations. Congressional aides refer to this practice as  "prospecting." In exchange for free transportation, members of Congress are  usually willing to make a brief speech or take a plant tour.  </P> <P> It is not clear whether Wilson or his staff actively solicited any of his free  trips during 1988. Linda Royster, Wilson's assistant press secretary, said the  senator now has a policy against soliciting such trips, but she acknowledged  that "it has not always been the policy," and she was unable to say exactly  when the change occurred.  </P> <P> Several companies or groups that funded Wilson's travel said they offered to  pay the air fare or could not remember how it was agreed to. A representative  of General Electric Credit Corp. declined to discuss how the March 4-14 trip  was arranged.  </P> <P> Many members of Congress accept invitations from special interests to make  speeches in such popular vacation spots as Jamaica, Boca Raton, Fla., and Palm  Springs. Usually, these trips are nothing more than thinly disguised vacations  for members of Congress and their spouses.  </P> <P> But most members of Congress do not regularly accept free trips to their home  districts, not only because the government provides the funding for those trips  but also because they do not believe that businesses in their home states  should be forced to pay for such appearances.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Opposite View  </P> <P> But Wilson takes the opposite view from many of his colleagues.  </P> <P> Wilson and his wife spurn free trips to exotic places as unseemly. At the same  time, Wilson sees nothing wrong with accepting travel expenses and honorariums  from well-heeled, California-based groups as well as others that have chosen to  gather in California, because he believes that they can afford it. Livingston  noted that Wilson does not demand reimbursement from Californians who cannot.  </P> <P> "California is different from most states," he added. "California has many  Fortune 500 companies, and it doesn't make a bit of difference to them whether  they pay for a speech."  </P> <P> Among the groups that paid for Wilson to fly to home last year were the  California Winegrape Growers, the California Independent Oil Producers, William  Lyon University of San Diego, the Merchants and Manufacturers of California and  the Oakland-based Western States Meat Assn.  </P> <P> Although other Californians, such as Reps. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), Norman D.  Shumway (R-Stockton), Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale) and Howard Berman (D-Los  Angeles), also reported making trips home to California at the expense of  special interests during 1988, none of them did it nearly as often as Wilson.  </P> <P> Corporations or lobbying groups paid for more than a third of Wilson's 32  round-trips between Washington and California in 1988. By comparison, Sen. Alan  Cranston (D-Calif.) made three such round trips in 1988 -- one financed by the  United Food and Commercial Workers, another by the Center for Participation in  Democracy and one by a voter-registration organization that Cranston leads.  </P> <P> In most cases, Wilson delivered a speech in exchange for his air fare. But  Wilson's aides said he did not make a speech in exchange for taking a free  flight, along with his wife, back to California aboard a private Beech Aircraft  plane after the couple attended the Republican National Convention in New  Orleans last August.  </P> <P> Wilson's aides said the plane stopped briefly at Wichita, Kan., where Beech is  headquartered, to allow the senator and his wife to tour the aircraft plant and  have lunch with a high-ranking company officials.  </P> <P> Wilson, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, refused to accept the  offer of a $2,000 honorarium from Beech for the stop. It is not unusual for  members of Congress to be offered honorariums for simply touring a plant.  </P> <P> Livingston said the senator does not take honorariums from defense contractors  because it would create "a perception" that they are buying his vote on the  committee. Nevertheless, he acknowledged, Wilson has no policy against  accepting air fare from defense contractors because the cost otherwise would  fall on the taxpayers.  </P> <P> In a letter written to Beech after Wilson's visit to Wichita, Ira H. Goldman,  the senator's counsel, explained to company officials that the air fare for the  senator and his wife did not constitute an illegal campaign contribution  because it was not undertaken -- in the language of the law -- "in connection  with a federal election." Instead, he said, even though Wilson was a candidate  for reelection, the trip was intended only "to familiarize himself with your  company's operations and engage in discussions with a group of corporate  employees."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Exemption Would Apply  </P> <P> In addition, Goldman noted that the law exempts travel expenses paid in  connection with an appearance for which a senator receives an honorarium. He  said this exemption would apply to Wilson's trip, even though he declined the  honorarium.  </P> <P> Whenever corporations are involved in financing portions of a campaign trip for  Wilson, as General Electric Credit Corp. did in March, 1988, the senator's  staff takes special precautions not to violate the law prohibiting corporations  from making in-kind contributions to congressional candidates. Such payments  are legal as long as the corporation or lobbying group does not pay for any leg  of the trip immediately preceding a campaign stop.  </P> <P> On March 4, 1988, for example, General Electric Credit Corp. paid for Wilson to  fly only as far as Reno, Nev. -- where he stopped to give a speech to the  California Medical Assn. -- but his campaign treasury picked up the air fare  for the final leg of the journey into San Diego, where he kicked off his  reelection campaign. Wilson's wife preceded him to California on March 3, also  at the expense of GE.  </P> <P> Then, as Wilson barnstormed the state beginning on Sunday, March 7, each of  those flights was charged either to the campaign or to Wilson's Senate expense  account. In fact, it was not until March 9, when Wilson arrived in Los Angeles,  that he met with the group that paid for his round-trip air fare from  Washington to California, the General Electric Credit Corp.  </P> <P> Wilson and his wife returned to Washington together on March 14.  </P> <P> Clearly, this complex system for allocating the costs of Wilson's many trips  creates an accounting nightmare for his staff, and mistakes are possible.  </P> <P> In fact, Wilson's staff reported that he had received a $1,039 government  reimbursement for one Washington-to-California round-trip in January, 1988, for  which he also reported receiving an honorarium and reimbursement from a Los  Angeles-based investment firm, Capitol Group Inc.  </P> <P> But Livingston said that Wilson's accountant mistakenly credited the government  reimbursement to that trip -- a mistake he said would be corrected.  Furthermore, he said the check that Wilson received for $1,039 represents an  automatic travel payment that every senator receives from the government at the  beginning of every session of Congress, even if the senator never left  Washington.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Government Expense  </P> <P> According to Livingston, Wilson's reliance on special-interest money for travel  to California enables him to return to the state more frequently and to take  his aides with him whenever necessary. Records show at least three employees of  Wilson's Washington office were traveling in California at government expense  during the senator's March campaign swing.  </P> <P> In 1988, Wilson received a total of $1.9 million from the government to run his  offices in Washington and California -- all but $95,000 of it earmarked for  staff salaries. In addition, the National Republican Campaign Committee  provided him with $20,597 for media, publications and support services.  </P> <P> The amount of government money available to members of Congress for travel and  other expenses is based on the distance between Washington and their home  states. The sum of $95,000 a year allocated for California's senators compares  to $137,000 set aside for those from Alaska and $36,000 for those from  Delaware.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FARES PAID BY LOBBYING GROUPS  </P> <P>  Here is a list of Sen.

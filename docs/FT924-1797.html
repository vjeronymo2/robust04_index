			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Triplex Lloyd rises to Pounds 3.3m - Building products remains weakest division TRIPLEX LLOYD, the industrial engineering group, increased interim pre-tax profits by 6 per cent to Pounds 3.31m despite a deteriorating performance by its building products division. Turnover for the six months to end-September slipped to Pounds 81.1m. The comparative figure of Pounds 83.8m included Pounds 8.8m from discontinued operations. Earnings per share declined to 4.8p (5p) on capital enlarged via the acquisition last January of Paralloy. The interim dividend is maintained at 2.5p. Building products, where operating profits declined to Pounds 621,000 (Pounds 673,000), remained the group's weakest division. However, both the automotive and engineering and power divisions increased operating profits to over Pounds 2.04m compared with Pounds 1.69m and Pounds 1.65m respectively. Mr Colin Cooke, chairman, said there was no sign of any market upturn for building products and that the outlook for automotive sales was 'cautious'. He noted, however, that for the power division there were 'substantial opportunities for growth even in the absence of a general improvement either in the UK or world economy.' Against the trend among other engineering companies, gearing increased by over 15 per cent to 60 per cent. That, according to Mr John Foley, the finance director soon to become managing director, was the result of the provision of Pounds 4m of working capital for Paralloy. Interest charges accounted for Pounds 1.29m (Pounds 1.24m). However, the company refinanced its short term debt by using the US private placement market to raise Dollars 35m (Pounds 23m) which swaps into fixed rate sterling borrowing at rates under 9 per cent for terms of between seven and ten years. COMMENT Triplex Lloyd's power division will carry it through the second half. Paralloy is now making money; investment at Deritend Precision Castings, another power subsidiary, is paying off. The markets for the other divisions are too uncertain to offer any guarantee of increased profits, but by the time a lower interest rate bill and the proceeds of property sales are factored in to the immediate outlook, Triplex Lloyd should be looking at 1992-93 pre-tax profits in excess of Pounds 7.5m. That would translate into earnings of 10.2p and put the shares at yesterday's unchanged price of 140p on a prospective p/e of 13.7, cheap at the price given a sector average of over 25.</p>

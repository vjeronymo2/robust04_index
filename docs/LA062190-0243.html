			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RIDING HIGH ON U.S. OPEN WIN, IRWIN SCORES ACE IN BUICK CLASSIC  </P> <P> Hale Irwin picked up where he left off at the U.S. Open and scored a hole in  one en route to a 5-under-par 66 in today's first round of the Buick Classic.  </P> <P> "Obviously there's a very positive carry-over from last week," said Irwin, who  trailed early leader Kirk Triplett by one shot.  </P> <P> The 45-year-old Irwin became the oldest man to win the U.S. Open when he  defeated Mike Donald on Monday in the first sudden-death hole after an 18-hole  playoff left them still tied.  </P> <P> Irwin's ace came at the 112-yard sixth hole at the Westchester Country Club. He  started his round from the 10th tee and was 2 under par when he hit a pitching  wedge a few feet behind the pin on his 15th hole of the round.  </P> <P> The ball spun back into the cup and Irwin -- just as he did after a dramatic  birdie on the 72nd hole of the Open -- went to the gallery ropes to slap  high-fives with spectators.  </P> <P> "This is the Big Apple. You've got to play to the gallery," said Irwin, who  capped his round with an 8-foot birdie on the final hole.  </P></p>

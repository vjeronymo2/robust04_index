			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In conjunction with the start-up of the Service in 1990, the NASD implemented a filing requirement (under section 4 of Schedule H to the NASD By-Laws) and review procedures to verify member firms' compliance with Rule 15c2&hyph;11 under the Act. During the proposed extension, this review process will continue to be an important component of the NASD's oversight of broker-dealers' market making in OTC Equities. The NASD also expects to work closely with the Commission staff in developing further enhancements to the Service to fulfill the market structure requirements mandated by the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990, particularly section 17B of the Act. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  The NASD notes that implementation of the Reform Act entails Commission rulemaking in several areas, including the development of mechanisms for gathering and disseminating reliable quotation/transaction information for ``penny stocks.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> On November 24, 1992, the NASD filed an application with the Commission for interim designation of the Service as an automated quotation system pursuant to Section 17B(b) of the Act. On December 30, 1992, the Commission granted Qualifying Electronic Quotation System (``QEQS'') status for the Service for purposes of certain penny stock rules that became effective on January 1, 1993. On August 26, 1993, the Commission granted the NASD's request for an extension of QEQS status until such time as the OTCBB meets the statutory requirements of section 17B(b)(2). Finally, on May 13, 1994, the NASD filed an application with the Commission for permanent designation of the Service as an automated quotations system for penny stocks pursuant to section 17B(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Statutory Basis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with sections 11A(a)(1), 15A(b) (6) and (11), and section 17B of the Act. Section 11A(a)(1) sets forth the Congressional findings and policy goals respecting operational enhancements to the securities markets. Basically, the Congress found that new data processing and communications techniques should be applied to improve the efficiency of market operations, broaden the distribution of market information, and foster competition among market participants. Section 15A(b)(6) requires, among other things, that the NASD's rules promote just and equitable principles of trade, facilitate securities transactions, and protect public investors. Subsection (11) thereunder authorizes the NASD to adopt rules governing the form and content of quotations for securities traded over-the-counter for the purposes of producing fair and informative quotations, preventing misleading quotations, and promoting orderly procedures for collecting and disseminating quotations. Finally, Section 17B contains Congressional findings and directives respecting the collection and distribution of quotation information on low-priced equity securities that are neither Nasdaq nor exchange-listed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NASD believes that extension of the Service through December 31, 1994, is fully consistent with the foregoing provisions of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD believes that the rule change will not result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments were neither solicited nor received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

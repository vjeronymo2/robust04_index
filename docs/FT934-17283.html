			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Fenner launches Pounds 17.4m rights - Proposals include possible disposal of power transmission business FENNER, the Hull-based industrial products group, yesterday announced plans to raise about Pounds 17.4m through a 1-for-2 rights issue at 80p, and revealed it was discussing the possible sale of its principle power transmission components business. The announcement marks the first significant move by the new management team at Fenner, following the retirement of Mr Peter Barker earlier this year after 11 years as chairman. Mr Colin Cooke, chairman of Triplex Lloyd, was appointed non-executive chairman in June, and Mr Julian Bigden became group managing director in February. Now Fenner is joining the long list of UK engineering companies to consider severing links with its past by withdrawing from a relatively low-margin business so that it can invest in its higher-margin products and become, like TI Group, an international 'specialist engineering' concern. Shares in Fenner jumped 14p to 100p as the market responded warmly to a lengthy statement from the company detailing the proposed changes and recent financial performance. The main points are: Following an approach, Fenner is holding discussions with a potential purchaser for the power transmission business. These are at a preliminary stage, and the outcome is unlikely to be known until the end of this calendar year. The division will report an operating loss of about Pounds 1.8m for the year ended August 31, but was trading profitably in the second half. A rights issue is proposed of up to 23.2m new shares at a price of 80p each. This is underwritten by Morgan Grenfell and European Strategic Investors Holding. ESIH, which is advised by Arlington Capital Management, will assist in the formulation of group strategy and subscribe for 2.18m ordinary shares at a 5 per cent premium to the average of the middle market closing prices from yesterday until October 18. The subscription price will not be less than 86.3p and will raise a further Pounds 1.88m at least. Operating profit (before exceptional items) was about Pounds 9.6m in the year ended August 31, down from Pounds 11.3m. Turnover edged up from Pounds 197m to Pounds 202m and pre-tax profit dropped from Pounds 5.5m to about Pounds 300,000. The board has concluded that the payment of dividends is 'inappropriate at this stage.' In the absence of unforeseen circumstances, a resumed pay-out is expected for the current year to August 31 1994. Mr Cooke said the power transmission business - which had sales of Pounds 71m in the year ended August and 1,200 employees - was too dependent on the UK's shrinking engineering and manufacturing base. Attempts to increase continental European sales had been hampered by the recession. The Pounds 19.3m raised from the proposed rights issue and share subscription would give Fenner the opportunity to extend its fluid power and polymers product ranges; develop export markets and new products in the conveyor belting division; reduce debt; take further management action in the power transmission business, and 'assess any offer received against a background of financial strength.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Executive Deputy President F.W. de </F> Klerk by Ivan Fallon in Pretoria; date not given; from the  SUNDAY TIMES News Review]    [Text] Two weeks out of his job as South Africa's state  president have done nothing to dim the political ambitions of F  W de Klerk, now the country's executive deputy president. He  may only have got 20.5 per cent of the 19m votes cast in last  month's elections, but for a party that carries the stigma and  apartheid burden of the National party, it was an astonishingly  high figure.    Far from consigning himself to the political graveyard and a  life of retirement in his Cape Town cottage, de Klerk is already  planning a political comeback. "I believe my party is poised as  the party with the greatest growth potential," he says, without  a flicker of a smile. "We look at the future and in the party  political sense -- while fully co-operating with the government  of national unity -- we will be looking for a win in the next  election."    It is a statement which, coming lrom the leader of the  National party, the same internationally reviled party that for  more than 40 years deprived blacks of their civil rights and  stripped the coloureds (mixed-race people) of their right to  vote, seems bizarre, even absurd. Yet is it? In last month's  election de Klerk's party won almost 4m votes, possibly as many  as 1m of them black votes. Fewer than 60 per cent of whites  voted for him, but probably as many as 70 per cent of coloureds  and 63 per cent of Indians preferred the new, apartheid cleansed  National party to any of the other 18 parties that sought their  vote.    I last interviewed de Klerk in his office in Pretoria a week  before the election when his staff were hoping to achieve  between 25 per cent and 30 per cent of the vote, and some even  talked about 35 per cent. Against that, his party's showing  might be viewed as a disappointment. But it was still, he  points out, the highest figure any opinion poll ever accorded  them -- and with the national party machine he is now building,  it can do better next time.    "The National party has become the leading non-racial party  in South Africa," he says, and it is true: the African National  Congress's support was almost entire black, and Chief Mangosuthu  Buthelezi's support came from the Zulus of Natal and a number of  disaffected whites.    As such, insists de Klerk, the "Nats" should regain not only  the white votes that went to the Democratic party as well as to  Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party, keep control of the coloureds  and Indians who are mostly Afrikaans speakers (and more  anti-black than they were ever anti-white), and attract a  growing number of aspiring middle-class blacks. For the moment,  however, de Klerk, in London last week to deliver The Sunday  Times Nobel Laureate Peace lecture to nearly 3,000 people at the  Albert Hall, has the more immediate task of making the new  government of national unity work. In the past fortnight he has  handed over officially to Nelson Mandela and moved out of the  state president's office suite once occupied by Smuts, Malan,  Verwoerd and Botha.    His new office will be a mirror suite on the other side of  the same building, on the same floor as Mandela and only a short  walk to the office of his fellow "executive" deputy president,  Thabo Mbeki.    The "executive" bit of the title, he says, has been recently  added to emphasise the fact that the two deputies will play key  roles in managing the new government. After the election  Mandela took a brief holiday, leaving de Klerk and Mbeki in  joint charge, and so far they have not come to blows.    "We've already struck a very good working relationship,"  says  de Klerk, and most observers believe that to be true, the two  men forming a respect for each other in the months of tough  negotiation that led up to the election. The two deputy  presidents are now effectively the joint chief executives of  South Africa, with Mandela assuming the role of non-executive  chairman. They have not yet settled into a work routine, but  have spent the hours and days since the election trying to  thrash out a system of cabinet committees through which their  powers will be exercised.    Mbeki, like all the ANC, has no experience of government and  seems prepared to be guided by his more seasoned partner. How  long the smooth partnership will last under the strains that lie  just around the corner is another matter, but de Klerk is  putting an optimistic gloss on it.    One of the key points, he insists, is that he is not a  Mandela appointee. "I'm not there because I've been invited to  be there. I'm there because the constitution says I've a right  to be there. because 4m voters said they wanted me there. Even  if President Mandela disliked me intensely, he would have had to  accept me." Mandela, in fact, seems to hold him in even greater  respect than Mbeki does, and although there have been some signs  of friction between them over several of the cabinet  appointments, all three of them seem determined to work together.    The constitution, says de Klerk, insists that the president  must consult his deputies on a whole series of important issues,  notably appointments, and he will make sure that happens to the  letter. "I see us being involved in the totality."    The first real cabinet session takes place tomorrow with  Mandela in the chair, flanked by his two deputies, and down the  table the brooding figure of Buthelezi, who has been seen  striding the floors of the Ministry of Home Affairs where he is  in charge. This is where the first real tensions could surface.    De Klerk has gone out of his way to keep Buthelezi informed  about the way in which the cabinet committees are developing,  seeking his support not as a minister but as the head of one of  the three political parties that make up the government.  Mandela, he indicates, has done the same and so far Buthelezi  seems to be settling down to his life as a national minister, as  opposed to his years of being chief minister in his own little  fiefdom of KwaZulu.    If Buthelezi, says de Klerk, is not drawn into the process  of  government, there would be a real danger that the cooperation of  the parties within the cabinet would falter. "There is a  commitment from me and from Mandela to make that work." On the  other hand, de Klerk and Buthelezi are allies against what could  be the overpowering might of the ANC. "We are not there, and  Buthelezi isn't there, to implement to the letter ANC policy,"  he says. "That would make a farce of the concept of a  government of national unity."</p>

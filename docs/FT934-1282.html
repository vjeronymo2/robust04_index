			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Observer: Rotting boroughs Those of you who imagine the European parliament to be a dull old place, stuffed with humourless Eurocrats - think again. At least one Euro MP - Caroline Jackson, a Tory from Wiltshire - is showing distinct signs of wit. She has just written to Egon Klepsch, president of the parliament, to see how many of her fellow 515 deputies are still alive. She says: 'For a year I have been sitting next to an empty chair assigned to an MEP from Naples. He has not turned up for any debate or any vote for a year. Is he possibly dead? In which case I am very sorry, but maybe he should not be being paid his salary, not to mention half his office allowances.' Jackson adds that 'some MEPs have not been seen for years. How many other dead souls might there be?' Of course there is always another side to an argument. Perhaps Jackson's Neapolitan neighbour has got the full measure of the place and is engaged in a lengthy, though silent, boycott?</p>

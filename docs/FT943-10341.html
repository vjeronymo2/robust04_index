			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / BA pilots may seek bigger stake British Airways pilots are considering asking the management to increase employee share ownership in the UK carrier. The move coincides with proposals by pilots at USAir for employees to take a 25 per cent stake in the sixth largest US carrier, in which BA holds a 24.6 per cent stake. The staff stake would be part of a restructuring programme involving Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn) in wage cuts and other concessions to return the airline to profitability. In contrast to the USAir pilots' proposal, BA pilots are seeking to participate more actively in the success of the UK carrier. BA, which has kept seeking cost-cutting and efficiency improvements from staff, has just reported an 8.1 per cent increase in July traffic figures and is expected to announce first-quarter pre-tax profits of Pounds 80m-Pounds 100m on Monday. Mr Chris Darke, secretary general of the British Airlines Pilots Association (Balpa), the UK pilots' union, confirmed yesterday that Balpa was preparing a feasibility study on increased employee share ownership in BA. At present, employees own about 4 per cent of BA's shares. Balpa is also interested in sharing in the benefits of BA's alliances with other carriers. It has held discussions with pilot representatives from Qantas, the Australian carrier, the French TAT and Deutsche BA. This weekend Balpa will hold talks in London with representatives from USAir. Yesterday the US pilots outlined their restructuring proposals at a meeting with Mr Roger Maynard, BA's director of corporate strategy. Both USAir and BA managements have responded coolly. One of the pilots' requests is for BA to invest a further Dollars 450m in USAir. BA, which has already invested Dollars 400m, has made it clear it will make no further investment until it is satisfied that USAir is on the road to long-term recovery. It has raised the possibility of writing off its USAir investment. The managements of USAir and BA are now waiting for a detailed package of proposals from all USAir unions. However, any agreement on an employee ownership scheme at USAir is likely to require lengthy negotiations, not just between the airline and unions, but between the unions themselves. At issue is how much each group of workers is prepared to sacrifice to produce the cost savings the airline needs to survive. The pilots' union has suggested that employees get 25 per cent of the airline's shares and Dollars 700m in preferred stock in return for labour concessions worth Dollars 2.5bn over five years. But it wants its own members to contribute only Dollars 750m worth of the concessions, while other workers contribute Dollars 1.75bn. Yesterday the Association of Flight Attendants agreed with the concessions-for-equity concept, but disagreed with the proposed allocation of concessions. The International Association of Machinists has also expressed strong reservations.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary prepared by the News Research and Commentaries </F> Group]    [Text] Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President  Bill Clinton are to meet in Geneva today to discuss the process  of compromise and the so-called Middle East peace talks. This  meeting was arranged during a visit by U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher to Syria two months ago. After the U.S.  guaranteed that the peace process would continue within the  framework of the Madrid Conference principles, Syria agreed to  the al-Asad-Clinton meeting in Geneva and to resume talks with  the Zionist regime in Washington.    America's agreement with the principles of the Madrid  conference means the acceptance of the joint U.S.-Syrian pattern  and the rejection of the Israeli pattern. Actually, the joint  U.S.-Syrian pattern is manifested in the Madrid conference,  which stipulates two points: peace for land and the  implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. The  Israeli pattern, however, emphasizes bilateral and separate  talks and secret diplomacy, a good example of which is the  Gaza-Jericho accord.    The Syrians believe that with the non-implementation of the  accord between 'Arafat and the Zionist regime, the Israeli  pattern has been somewhat discredited; and the emergence of  differences between representatives of the PLO and of the  Zionist regime on the interpretation of each article in the pact  has laid favorable groundwork for Syria to move the talks once  again into the framework of the United Nations.    Syria has strengthened its position prior to the talks. By  hosting the conference of the foreign ministers of the six plus  two countries [six Persian Gulf countries, plus Syria and Egypt]  in Damascus, Syria mustered their support for its stances; and  with its important role in Lebanon and in mobilizing those  Palestinians who oppose the Gaza-Jericho accord, it can claim  that it is playing a significant regional role in solving the  Middle East crisis.    Political observers believe that even though the United  States agrees with the Syrian pattern and supports the  implementation of the Security Council resolutions, nevertheless  as long as Washington does not want to put pressure on Tel Aviv,  the current talks in Geneva will yield no results. So far the  Zionist regime has not agreed to implement Resolution 242 and to  immediately and unconditionally withdraw from Syria's Golan  Heights. Thus, political analysts are not optimistic about the  outcome of the meeting of the Syrian and U.S. heads of state in  Geneva. But of course, a change in the U.S. stances on Syria at  the Geneva talks could yield a different result.</p>

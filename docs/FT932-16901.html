			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Bosnian Serbs in peace wrangle MR Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, yesterday proposed direct negotiations between the three warring factions in Bosnia as a way to break the impasse in the Bosnian peace talks. In a speech to the self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament in Bileca, called to decide whether to accept the international mediators' peace plan, Mr Karadzic poured scorn on the proposed map dividing Bosnia-Hercegovina into 10 semi-autonomous provinces. The plan, drawn up by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, and already endorsed by the Bosnian Moslems and Croats, would confine Serbs 'to live in islands surrounded by enemies,' he said. 'Accepting the maps, just as they are now, would amount to unprecedented ethnic cleansing.' Yet it is the Serb forces, who currently occupy 70 per cent of Bosnian territory, who have been accused by the international community of killing or expelling hundreds of thousands of Moslems from their homes. At the same time, Mr Karadzic did not minimise the probable consequences of a negative vote by the Bosnian Serb parliament on the Vance-Owen plan. He warned it was likely to lead to stepped up sanctions, arming the outgunned Moslem forces or even foreign military intervention. In a move to put pressure on the Serbs to sign the plan, the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday approved a resolution allowing Nato war planes to shoot down aircraft flouting a five-month-old ban on flights in Bosnian airspace. Nato permanent representatives agreed yesterday in Brussels to send US, British, French and Dutch fighters to enforce the no-fly zone. Mr Manfred Worner, the Nato secretary-general said the plans to send the aircraft would be ready less than two weeks from now. Mr Karadzic said the UN resolution would only increase opposition to the peace plan. But he nevertheless warned the 69 deputies of the parliament not to delude themselves that the international community would fail to carry out its threats. In an attempt to soften his hardline approach, the Bosnian Serb leader said the map boundaries proposed by the mediators were 70-80 per cent acceptable. Direct talks between the warring parties could reduce the disputed territory to 10 per cent and it was not worth 'killing each other' over such a small area. Though there appears to be little prospect of the parliament endorsing the map as it stands, deputies may accept a proposal by Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's special envoy to the peace talks, who has suggested the Bosnian Serbs sign the uncontested part of the map and negotiate the rest. Mr Churkin's compromise proposal has reportedly been approved by Mr Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's president, and Mr Dobrica Cosic, president of the rump Yugoslav federation, Russian sources said. Meanwhile, Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the Norwegian Foreign Minister, announced in Oslo he had agreed to take over from Mr Vance as the UN peace mediator on the former Yugoslavia, joining Lord Owen, the European Community's representative.</p>

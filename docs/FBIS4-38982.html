			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Jun 01, BNS -- The Latvian National  Independence Movement faction refuses to participate in the  expression of confidence or no confidence to Foreign Minister  Georgs Andrejevs, faction head Alexander Kirsteins told  reporters Wednesday. The faction believes that Andrejevs cannot  occupy the ministerial post after having confessed to ties with  the notorious Soviet security police, KGB.    Kirsteins also approached the issue from the ethical  viewpoint saying that Andrejevs cheated the parliament since  deputy candidates vowed non-collaboration with foreign security  structures before the 5th Saeima [parliament] elections.    The Homeland and Freedom faction will give a vote of no  confidence to Andrejevs because he formally violated the  election law, its head Maris Grinblats said. Grinblats,  however, praised Andrejevs for his confession and said that  Andrejevs may be telling the truth when he claims his KGB ties  were limited.    The Equality of Rights faction will also vote to express no  confidence to Andrejevs because his infringement of the election  law could become a precedent for further irregularities, said  faction Deputy Chairwoman Larisa Lavina.    The Political Association of Economists deputies oppose the  consideration of the issue before the decision of the court on  Andrejevs KGB ties. The faction also considers that Andrejevs  fitness to the post is in the government competence.    The Democratic Party faction approved free vote on the  issue,  said its member Alfreds Cepanis.</p>

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Fincantieri starts work on cruise ship Fincantieri, the Italian shipbuilder, yesterday began building its fourth and last cruise ship for Holland America Line, part of the Carnival cruise group. Like its predecessors, the 54,000-ton, 220-metre Veendam will carry 1,600 passengers. Fincantieri handed over the first ship in the series in December 1992, and the third - the Ryndam - only last Saturday. The Veendam should be handed over in mid-1996. Fincantieri, part of Italy's state holding company Iri, claims to be the world leader in the construction of cruise ships, with a 30 per cent share of the world market in terms of tonnage. Including the Crown Princess, a 70,000-ton cruise vessel delivered to P&amp;O in June 1990, the company has built or is building 12 cruise ships this decade, fulfilling orders worth an estimated Dollars 3.6bn. They include contracts, for Carnival and P&amp;O respectively, for two vessels of around 100,000 tons, the largest cruise ships ever to be built. Separately, Fincantieri and Finmeccanica, the defence and engineering group which is also controlled by Iri, have set up a joint company to contribute to the Horizon project, which will develop a new generation of frigates for the Italian, French and British navies. The new Italian company, Orizzonte, will join an international consortium with DCN International of France and Yarrow Shipbuilders in the UK, part of GEC Marconi Naval System.</p>

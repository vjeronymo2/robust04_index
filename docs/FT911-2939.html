			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Ford plans 2,500 job losses in Europe FORD, the US car maker, plans to cut about 2,500 jobs or 12 per cent of its salaried workforce in Europe over the next three years. Ford of Europe's net profits plunged by 79.6 per cent last year, to only Dollars 263m (Pounds 156m) - from Dollars 1.29bn in 1989 and a record Dollars 1.56bn in 1988 - its second worst result in 10 years. Ford is under considerable pressure worldwide and is being forced to take far-reaching measures to cut costs. In the final quarter last year, it ran up a net loss of Dollars 519m, its first quarterly loss for eight years. Ford of Europe said yesterday that it was reviewing its European cost structure. 'Salaried personnel costs must be reduced significantly, if we are to remain competitive'. It said that the cuts would come from 'indirect' salaried staff and would not affect manufacturing or sales operations. It aims to cut around 30 per cent of indirect salaried staff at a rate of around 10 per cent a year over the next three years. Ford of Europe has around 21,000 salaried staff with the main presence in the UK with 9,800 and in Germany with 7,300. Ford's workforce in Europe had already been cut from 130,500 in 1982 to 115,500 in 1989, but it rose to 126,300 last year largely through the inclusion of Jaguar, the luxury car maker acquired at the end of 1989. The Ford group's new car sales in Europe (including Jaguar) fell by 3.2 per cent to 1.54m last year. Total vehicle production (including light commercial vehicles) in Europe fell by 4.3 per cent to 1.78m from 1.86m a year earlier. In a meeting with UK union leaders, Ford management yesterday emphasised the need for increased mobility and flexibility within plants and for further erosion of restrictive practices.</p>

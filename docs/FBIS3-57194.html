			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Alain Lamassoure, French minister [delegate] for  European affairs, is currently on a visit to Estonia. He held a  meeting with Estonian President Lennart Meri today. One of the  key aims of Lamassoure's visit is to make preparations for the  European stability pact's opening conference in the Baltic  states. For Estonia, the main political importance of the  European stability pact--or the so-called Balladur  initiative--comes from the fact that the pact views the Baltic  states as possible European Union members for the first time.    Lamassoure will be leaving Estonia at noon today. He will  travel on to Latvia and Lithuania.</p>

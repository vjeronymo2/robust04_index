			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: Nokia and Mitsui in mobile phones joint venture NOKIA, the Finnish telecommunications and electronics group, and Mitsui &amp; Co, the Japanese trading house, have formed a joint venture to market mobile phones in Japan. The joint venture, to be established in August, will provide Nokia, the world's second largest mobile phones maker after Motorola of the US, with a foothold in the Japanese market which is expected to grow strongly over the next few years. The Japanese industry is heavily regulated, with mobile phone companies, such as NTT's mobile phones subsidiary and IDO Cellular, restricted to leasing equipment. However, from next April companies will be able to sell mobile phones on the market. The industry expects increasing competition from next year when the two companies will be allowed to offer digital mobile phone services. Nokia's joint venture in Japan, Nokia Mobile Phone Japan, will also start marketing handsets for digital mobile telecommunications systems from next spring. Nokia, which is headed by chief executive Mr Jorma Ollila, will provide two-thirds of the capital of Y300m (Dollars 2.74m) for the joint venture while Mitsui will provide the remaining Y100m. Unit sales in the initial year are projected at 40,000 to 50,000 units with revenues targeted at Y5bn. Nokia expects initially to market its mobile phones on an original equipment manufacturer basis to telecommunications companies but plans eventually to sell products under its own brand name. Nokia has been studying the Japanese market for the past year or so, having established a mobile phones division in Japan last year. The Japanese mobile phones market has been held in check by heavy regulation and high prices which have kept penetration at a low 1.5 per cent of the population.</p>

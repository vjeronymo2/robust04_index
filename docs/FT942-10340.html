			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Business and the Environment: A costly colour run - Textile dye pollution is turning some of Britain's rivers purple Rivers have natural colours. They may look grey and uninviting in winter, but that is the way they are. Rivers are not for colouring by stray effluents from a textile plant. That is aesthetic pollution. So much is agreed by the National Rivers Authority, the official guardian which sets the standards of Britain's water purity, the water companies whose sewage plants expel treated effluent into the rivers and the textile companies whose dyes are the source of the colour. 'The removal of colour from dyehouse waste waters is currently a major problem in the textile sector,' says Peter Cooper, technical executive of Courtaulds Textiles. The problem is concentrated in three areas of the UK Midlands: around Leicester and Loughborough where, with about 100 mills, there is the most intense concentration; around Leek; and in the Erewash Valley. All in the region are covered by the operations of Severn Trent Water. Purple and black are 'persistent and noticeable', according to Brian Waters, the NRA's area general manager for the Severn Trent region. The dyes are not toxic. 'Their main problem is that they're consistent and they're not removed by conventional sewage treatment systems,' he says. There are possible solutions but none so far available at a price which industry finds acceptable. In an ideal world, colour would be eliminated from effluent running into the sewage system at the dyehouse. But, warns Barry Hazel, director of the Textile Finishers' Association: 'If every site has to do its own treatment, there's a risk quite a few of the small companies would go out of business. The capital costs frighten the dye works.' The plants would cost Pounds 2.5m, a considerable investment for companies with up to 100 employees, turning over between Pounds 5m and Pounds 10m a year. They operate in a harsh commercial environment, where longer term investment decisions are rare. Many companies would prefer to push the colour problem away. There needs to be cost-benefit analysis and 'there is a need for Severn Trent Water to accept responsibility', according to John Harrison, director of the Knitting Industries' Federation. Severn Trent, however, feels caught between industry and regulator. 'Sewage works are not designed to cope with these issues,' says David Woods, the environmental director. 'The NRA response (to the colour question) is to go after us. They are imposing very stringent colour consent conditions - or they've been seeking to impose them,' he says. Pressure on Severn Trent was one way of forcing the issue on the textile companies; water companies in their turn can place restrictions on the industrial waste they will accept in their sewage works. 'The proper way to tackle it is at source,' says Waters, mindful that the Water Act 1989, which set up the NRA, embodies the principle that 'the polluter pays'. With companies worried about high capital outlays, the easiest solution for them is to pump the coloured waste into the sewer and leave the question of separating out the residual dyes and disposing of them to the water company. But Severn Trent has also had its problems: it has spent around Pounds 5m on a treatment plant at Leek without finding a foolproof economic solution. As Cooper comments: 'Apportionment of costs is more difficult to arrange than reaching a technological solution.' But the NRA attitude concentrated minds in the textile and water industries. Discharges to rivers are controlled by 'consents', or authorisations by the NRA. It can review these consents and it threatened to withdraw, from the beginning of this year, those where discharges were putting colour into the rivers. Brandishing its consent powers, the NRA has given an urgency to work on solutions to the colour problem, which was already under way. It has removed its threat to withdraw consents in exchange for a collaborative programme with industry to eliminate colour from the water over about three years. 'I thought two years ago there was a technology void. Now, I'm beginning to worry about timescales to turn ideas into the ultimate panacea. I think now that treatment will have to be different for each business unless Severn Trent Water can do anything at the sewage works,' Cooper says. Certainly, the range of technological solutions is varied. The collaborative approach to environmental problems which are bigger than any single company has been used before in the textile industry - and worked. The Textile Finishers Association, four companies and the Department of Trade and Industry have just completed a Pounds 290,000 study of waste minimisation and effluent treatment. In the process, a way has been found to treat pentachlorophenol (PCP) - a toxic substance on the EU's red list of nasty chemicals - used to stop mildew forming on cloth in transit and washed out in the mills during scouring. Big changes have taken place in the technology, says Hazel. 'All PCP used is in closed systems. Before, it was swilled down the drain.' At the same time, the mills have persuaded the cloth importers to specify materials to which no PCP has been applied. There is no such simple answer to the colour problem. Over the short to medium term, efforts will be concentrated on treating the waste water either before or after it goes into the sewage system. But over the longer term the most effective solution may be to tackle the problem at its source. Cooper has noted that this has been applied to the colour problem on three levels: improving the ability of the dye molecules to stay on the material so that fewer escape as waste, changing the molecular structure of the dyes so that they are more readily biodegradable and the recovery and reuse of dye colours which otherwise become effluent. The difficulty is that the scientific solutions reduce the choice of colours for the consumer. The water companies are caught between the regulators and the mills and the mills are caught between two sorts of consumers. One sort wants bright coloured clothes, the other wants clean rivers. The two demands need not be mutually exclusive - if there is somebody to pay the bill.</p>

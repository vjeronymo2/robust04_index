			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / International Press Review INDIA In few other countries have demands for the scrapping of the Gatt accord been so loud as in India. No sooner had Mr Peter Sutherland declared the negotiations completed than Indian opponents of the agreement went onto the offensive. They argued the ruling Congress (I) party had failed to defend India's interests, fanning fears that the accord would somehow deprive India's poverty-stricken farmers of subsidies and of the rights to use their own seeds without infringing patent laws. The intellectual property rights clauses would also, it was alleged, rob India's poor of cheap medicines. The Economic Times, the business daily, tackled these attacks head-on in its main leader on the Gatt agreement entitled 'Ill-informed objections'. The paper said skilful propaganda by the domestic drugs lobby had fooled well-meaning people into regarding the Uruguay Round as 'a western conspiracy to re-colonise India'. Business Standard, another business daily, supported the view that attacks on the agreement were mostly born of ignorance. But it added there was genuine concern about textiles - India would have to wait 10 years before the Multi-Fibre Arrangement was phased out. 'Here the politics of world trade, where India is a lightweight, worked against it.' The Pioneer took up the point, saying the bulk of the benefits of the accord would be shared by the US and Europe. The dominance of the developed world in the talks was also forcefully taken up by the nationalist Indian Express. It argued in its leader that developing countries were being forced to follow economic strategies which benefit industrialised nations by providing markets for their exports. 'Late starters in industrialisation are to be held on a tight leash through discriminatory patents and forced to import instead of building on their manufacturing capabilities.' The whole agreement reflects the overwhelming power of the US, fumed the Express. 'Gatt has become a coercive instrument for the promotion of the American interest.' In the view of the Economic Times, such views are a distortion. It argued that the agreement would bring growth, trade and other benefits for India. 'The issue is not India vs the World,' it said. 'But Producers vs Consumers.' UNITED STATES The visiting senior editor from the Sacramento Bee was waiting in the White House press room on Wednesday to hear President Bill Clinton express satisfaction with the Gatt agreement. 'There was a time when we could not get trade into the paper,' he observed, 'now we can't keep it out.' Certainly no trade agreement can have received the blanket coverage accorded the Uruguay Round by the US press last week, with most twists and turns of the final negotiations closely followed, backed up by charts, tables and histories of Gatt. It was more often than not the front page lead story, until ousted by Les Aspin's resignation as secretary of defence. Even television, rarely at ease with complex economic issues, gave it reasonably full treatment. Editorially, most US newspapers have traditionally been overwhelmingly in favour of free trade. This week's leader headlines reflected this. 'After seven years, a global gift' - the New York Times; 'At last a hurrah at the trade talks' - the Los Angeles Times; 'The world wins one' - the Wall Street Journal; 'The big winner' - USA Today. There was some marginal disappointment at what was not achieved ('it is much less than it could have been,' said the Journal of Commerce; 'It will not turn out to be ideal. . . there are a number of disappointments,' said the Washington Post) but near unanimity that failure would have been disastrous ('its individual provisions are much less important than its vibrant message,' according to the New York Times.) Predictably, the Wall Street Journal, found it hard to praise the administration ('it seems to be dawning on some people - including some former interventionists around the White House - that government is simply too slow and clumsy to manage trade') and was sharpest in criticising the EC resistance to more liberal audio-visual trade. ('The EC doesn't have a 'cultural identity'. It has at least 12, even thousands.') FRANCE Mr Jacques Chirac, mayor of Paris and member of parliament for Correze, is pictured on the front page of this week's Le Canard Enchaine, the satirical magazine, clad in farmers' clothes and grimacing at a newspaper that trumpets the successful conclusion of the Gatt negotiations. 'Gatt: Balladur's Success,' cries the newspaper headline. 'No]' growls Mr Chirac, who has a pitchfork tucked under his arm. 'They still haven't dealt with the Correzienne issue.' Other cartoons in Le Canard feature Mr Edouard Balladur himself, the mastermind of France's Gatt machinations and Mr Chirac's main rival for the conservative ticket in the 1995 presidential elections. 'Cher Edouard' is shown looking even smugger than usual. The rest of the French press may have painted a slightly subtler picture than Le Canard's cartoonists of the political consequences of the Gatt affair, but the message was the same. The agreement has been billed in France as a triumph for Mr Balladur and a potential setback for Mr Chirac's long-held presidential ambitions. 'The Right Crowns Balladur' crowed the front page headline of Thursday's Liberation, the liberal-left daily. 'In eight months Edouard Balladur has made the best possible use of his parliamentary majority to exert his influence over Chirac and Giscard (the other conservative leader), while remaining popular,' said an article entitled 'The Modest Triumph'. Le Monde was even more laudatory. 'The confidence that the French electorate put in Edouard Balladur was not misplaced,' it said under the portentous headline 'The Balladur Era'. The only cautionary note was struck by the conservative Le Figaro. 'Mr Balladur has proved with Gatt that he is an exceptional manager of international crises,' said its Thursday editorial. 'It remains to be seen whether he will show the same talent for dealing with the problems of this country - rising unemployment and social unrest.'

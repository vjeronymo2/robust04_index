			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Russian President's Directive No. 298-RP, dated 14 June </F> 1994, "On Control of the Export from the Russian Federation of  Causative Agents of Disease (Pathogens) affecting Human Beings,  Fauna, and Flora, Their Genetic Mutations, and Fragments of  Genetic Material and Equipment Which May Be Used in the Creation  of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons"; followed by  interview with Pavel Syutkin, deputy chairman of the Russian  President's Chemical and Biological Weapons Convention Problems  Committee, by Lada Lyashenko under the "Commentary" rubric;  place and date of interview not given]    [Text] 1. To approve the Russian Federation Government's  list of causative agents of disease (pathogens) affecting human  beings, fauna, and flora, their genetic mutations, and fragments  of genetic material and equipment which can be used in the  creation [sozdaniye] of bacteriological (biological) and toxin  weapons whose export is controlled and carried out under license  (see appendix).    2. The Russian Federation Government shall ratify the  statute on the procedure for the control of the export from the  Russian Federation of causative agents of disease (pathogens)  affecting human beings, fauna, and flora, their genetic  mutations, and fragments of genetic material and equipment which  can be used in the creation of bacteriological (biological) and  toxic weapons.    3. It is prescribed that the foreign economic activity  commodity schedule codes indicated in the list appended to this  directive may, if necessary, be clarified by the Russian State  Customs Committee in conjunction with the Russian Eksportkontrol  [Export Control Committee].    4. The Russian Federation president's directive No. 711-RP,  dated 17 November 1992, is deemed to have lapsed.    5. This directive comes into force from the moment of its  signing.    [signed] B. Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation    [dated] 14 June 1994    Note. The list is not published.  <H5>  "We Are Conducting an Open Dialogue" </H5>   Pavel Syutkin, deputy chairman of the Russian President's  Chemical and Biological Weapons Convention Problems Committee,  now comments on this document.    [Syutkin] The Russian President's directive is a kind of  stage in the development of our country because this is surely  the first time that we have stated clearly and accurately that  Russia shares the principles and approaches to the problem of  bacteriological and toxin weapons adopted in the civilized  world. We have embarked on the path of cooperation and have  tacitly begun to cast off the rigid straitjacket which held us  tight for many years.    [Lyashenko] The international convention "On the Prohibition  of the Development, Production, and Stockpiling of  Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their  Destruction" was signed back in 1972. Is Russia today honoring  the commitments made by the USSR when it signed this document?    [Syutkin] The president has signed an edict confirming the  Russian Federation's succession in law with regard to the  Convention's obligations. This means that the development and  implementation of biological programs in breach of the  convention are prohibited on Russian territory. Control is  entrusted to our committee. However, whereas this convention  contains detailed measures on the banning and control of  chemical weapons, the same cannot be said about bacteriological  weapons. There are certain complications here. For example,  the basic "raw material" -- the human and fauna pathogens,  fragments of genetic material, and various types of equipment  and apparatus -- are dual-purpose. The pathogens are essential  for research purposes and apparatus is needed for vaccines, but  those same instruments can be used to produce bacteriological  weapons. Precise criteria are needed governing prohibition and  control. Work to elaborate such an approach is under way but  that will take many months, if not years. There have been many  international conferences since the convention was signed.  There was a conference of countries parties to the convention  in Geneva in September (?1991) [final digit indistinct], where  Russia openly stated its position for the first time.    [Lyashenko] The list of pathogens and equipment whose  export is controlled and carried out under license contains more  than 100 named items. However, many of them are not typical of  Russia and are hardly ever encountered here, for example, "Rift  Valley fever pathogens" and "banana top bushiness pathogens"  [vozbuditel kustistosti verkhushki bananov]. Why have they been  included in the list?    [Syutkin] This list was drawn up in accordance with the  recommendations of the so-called "Australian group." It was  created in 1985 and included the 25 most advanced countries.  These countries guarantee the implementation of a unified  control of the export of materials and equipment which can be  used to create bacteriological weapons. Furthermore, all 25  countries are interlinked by a kind of reciprocal pledge: If  one of them refuses the export of any materials or equipment to  anyone, the others are obliged to follow that example. This  reciprocal provision of information, support, understanding, and  openness help prevent the proliferation of bacteriological  weapons. In June 1993, in accordance with the requirements of  the international regime controlling the nonproliferation of  weapons of mass destruction, the "Australian group" extended and  clarified the list of materials and equipment whose export is  controlled and carried out under license.</p>

			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> KEMP SAYS HE'S 'A BIG-L LIBERAL' ON URBAN ISSUES  </P> <P> HUD Secretary-designate Jack Kemp told big-city mayors today that he will be an  activist and an advocate for solving housing and other urban problems, calling  himself "a big-L liberal" and "a bleeding heart conservative" on urban issues.  </P> <P> Kemp, addressing the U.S. Conference of Mayors, cited the problems posed by  federal budget constraints but spoke enthusiastically about working with the  mayors, whose complaints about cuts in federal aid to cities at a time when the  number of homeless has been growing have been a constant refrain during the  Reagan years.  </P> <P> "I'm going to throw the labels out. We're going to throw out ideology," said  the former New York Republican congressman chosen by President-elect Bush to  head the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  </P> <P> "I am going to be an activist. I'm going to be an advocate. The door is open.  My mind is open."  </P></p>

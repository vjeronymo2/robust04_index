			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Wescol losses increase 60% to Pounds 2.5m Wescol Group, the USM-quoted structural engineer, fell deeper into the red in the year to July 31 as pre-tax losses rose 60 per cent to Pounds 2.49m (Pounds 1.55m). Turnover dipped from Pounds 24.7m to Pounds 16.3m reflecting difficult conditions and the group's closure of TMV Aluminium Systemsy. Losses included an exceptional debit of Pounds 506,000. Per share the deficit was shown as 21.6p against 11.3p, and there is no dividend. Mr Peter Price was appointed chairman yesterday, taking over from caretaker chairman Mr Barry Anysz who replaced Mr John Hicks when he resigned last May. Mr Price said the group had strengthened its trading base, by 'refocusing operations, reducing overheads and securing fresh backing from our bankers'. Facilities included a new six-year Pounds 2m loan.</p>

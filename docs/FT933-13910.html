			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / International Company News: Dumez unit suspends payments of debts LYONNAISE des Eaux Dumez, the French industrial and utility group, is working on a recovery plan for a subsidiary in its construction division which has suspended debt payments with outstanding liabilities of about FFr220m (Dollars 37m). The subsidiary, Maillard &amp; Duclos, is the biggest building and public works company in the Rhone-Alps region of France. Dumez, acquired by Lyonnaise three years ago, has been using Maillard &amp; Duclos to expand its construction activities in south-eastern France. Maillard &amp; Duclos has bought a series of small and medium-sized companies in the region since it was itself acquired by Dumez in 1987. Last year, Maillard &amp; Duclos achieved sales of FFr850m and suffered losses of about FFr21m. It employs about 690. Dumez said that the recovery plan would be finalised within a few days. He said that the company had recently dismissed Mr Robert Bouracho, chairman of Maillard &amp; Duclos, and placed Mr Jean Pierre Fenayon, deputy managing director of Dumez, in charge of the Rhone-Alps region. One construction analyst described the cessation of payments at Maillard &amp; Dumez as another setback for Dumez, which has suffered as a result of the downturn in the European construction industry. In 1992, the construction activities of Lyonnaise - of which Dumez is the biggest part - reported losses of FFr461m, almost double those of the previous year. Sales at Karstadt, Germany's largest department store group, rose by 'more than 1 per cent' to DM10bn (Dollars 5.8bn) in the first six months of the year, writes David Waller in Frankfurt. Mr Walter Deuss, managing director, said sales at the parent company climbed at a slightly higher rate of 1.3 per cent to DM5.94bn.</p>

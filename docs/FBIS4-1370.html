			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Renamo Accuses Neighboring Countries </F> of Trying to Manipulate Elections"]    [Text] The Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] says it  has sent protest notes to some of Mozambique's neighboring  countries formally accusing them of preparing to manipulate the  legislative and presidential elections scheduled for 27 and 28  October of this year. Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama has alleged  that there is a secret accord between the Mozambican Government  and neighboring countries concerning the participation of  foreign nationals in the elections.    Efforts to convince the Renamo leader, who made the  accusation, to identify those countries have been in vain. He  simply said those letters had been sent two weeks ago.    Dhlakama told NOTICIAS that Renamo "had concluded that there  was already a secret accord between the Mozambique Liberation  Front [Frelimo] and the neighboring countries, whereby those  countries would send their citizens to vote for the Frelimo  Party. We, in Renamo, know which countries those are because,  in the past, Frelimo also sent Mozambicans to vote in favor of  certain southern African leaders."    We asked the Renamo leader whether he was talking about  South  Africa, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Swaziland, Tanzania, and Zambia. He  replied: "Yes, some of those countries."    The Renamo leader also disclosed that the recent Renamo  congress had decided that "our people should get in touch with  those countries to make them see that the war is over. However  much ideological sympathy there may be for Frelimo in those  countries, it is important in southern Africa at this stage that  we make every effort to create economic development, forget the  past, and enjoy good relations with the neighboring countries."    Asked about how the census would be conducted to allow  foreigners to participate in the country's elections, Dhlakama  answered that it would be "very simple, because there are many  Mozambican refugees in those countries and it is easy for  foreigners to come in with them on their return. What is more,  many border posts have been reopened along the borders, where in  the past there used to be none. Today, Frelimo is opening them  up, thereby making it easier for aliens to come in illegally and  take part in elections. It is possible that the [census] teams  could discover they are foreigners during the census, but this  is not a plan that Frelimo is just following blindly. It is  part of a strategy intended to fool even the census teams."    The Renamo leader said he believed that the letters "making  the accusation official," the governments of those countries  "may desist from their plans to send their citizens in to vote  in favor of Frelimo." [sentence as printed]    Afonso Dhlakama reiterated his accusation that the  government  is sending youths to some southern African countries "where they  are being trained to attack Renamo when it is in power." He  refused to give details but stressed that Renamo is committed to  "diplomatic action to explain the reality of the Mozambican  peace process to those countries and to make it clear that  Renamo does not want war any more."    Similar accusations had already been made by Renamo General  Mateus Ngonhamo, but they have been proven groundless.    NOTICIAS approached some African embassies in Maputo in  connection with Afonso Dhlakama's allegations, but they said  they knew nothing about them.</p>

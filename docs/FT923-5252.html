			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (11): The dog fight gets dirty - Airforce suppliers are in a murderous mood WITH DOUBTS hanging over almost all new combat jet projects, military aircraft manufacturers are fighting bitter and sometimes dirty battles to secure export orders for their current-generation aircraft. Since the Gulf war, most of the trophies have gone to the US, at the expense of the European industry. McDonnell Douglas's recent deal with Finland for 64 F/A-18 fighters, valued at between Dollars 2bn and Dollars 3bn and matched by industrial offsets for the full value of the sale, was a politically significant breakthrough in a neutral country. The aircraft to be replaced were Russian MiG-21s and Swedish Drakens. The Swedes had high hopes for their new JAS 39 Gripen, the French equally so for Dassault Aviation's upgraded export jet, the Mirage 2000-5. Dassault described the decision as 'surprising'. The deal followed the confirmation last year of a Swiss decision in favour of the F/A-18 - although that deal, worth some Dollars 2.4bn including spares, is now due to go to a referendum. The Swiss authorities originally opted for the F/A-18 in 1988 over the Mirage 2000 and General Dynamics' F-16, but then ordered a re-evaluation, with the Russian MiG-29 and Su-27 also joining in the contest. McDonnell Douglas has been through similar re-appraisals over the F/A-18 before - winning in Spain in 1983 and losing last year in South Korea to the F-16, a 120-aircraft deal worth more than Dollars 5bn. Although the F/A-18 is still some way from rivalling the success of the F-16 in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, McDonnell Douglas hopes to export between 270 and 470 more over the next five years. The Swiss and Finnish decisions were a big setback for Dassault, which was looking to these countries to bring a revival in its export business, flagging since the mid-1980s. After the failure of the Mirage 4000, a twin-jet aircraft developed with its own money, it has yet to find a customer for the 2000-5 version of the Mirage, which it has equipped with a new look-down radar to take on US competition in world markets. The company has not clinched an export deal for combat aircraft since 1988, and that deal - with Jordan - has since been suspended. Dassault has now set its sights on more controversial targets - Taiwan, where the US has for the past decade been unwilling to sell advanced fighters, and Pakistan, where an argument over nuclear weapons development stands in the way of more deliveries of US F-16s. Disappointments are not confined to the French. Hopes for the Anglo-German-Italian Tornado - except for the Saudi deal under way since 1986 - have been unfulfilled. Provisional deals with Jordan, Oman and Malaysia all fell through, although in the latter two cases they were substituted by sales of British Aerospace Hawk fighter/trainers. A new contest is now under way in Malaysia, with a proposal for leasing Tornados through the RAF put forward in a competition against the F/A-18, F-16, Mirage 2000 and MiG-29. BAe has been kept waiting anxiously for confirmation of a further sale of 48 Tornados to the Saudis agreed in principle four years ago, while McDonnell Douglas has been waiting for US administration approval to sell the Saudis 72 more F-15 fighters - both deals vital to the respective manufacturers' production plans. Budgetary pressures in Saudi Arabia following the Gulf war have added to the tension over new contracts. A further deal in prospect involves the replacements for more than 100 ageing Saudi F-5 fighters, with the F/A-18 and F-16 both likely contenders. Overall sales of front-line combat jets can be expected to decline as the F-15/F-16 generation comes to an end, giving way to a sparser generation of more expensive aircraft. However, the market for light fighters such as the Hawk and the Italian-Brazilian AMX is expected to increase. Possibly never have so many questions been raised about military aircraft programmes as now, in the light of changing defence policies and tough spending constraints. The questions involve numbers, specifications, timing and in some instances the overall viability of projects already well under way. A sobering blow was struck early last year with the US decision to cancel the A-12 naval attack aircraft being developed jointly by McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics, a Dollars 52bn project. This has been followed by a reduction in the programme for Northrop's extraordinary B-2 stealth bomber to 20 aircraft, compared with an original plan for 132. The bombers will now work out at some Dollars 2.2bn apiece. The F-22 being developed by Lockheed, Boeing and General Dynamics, chosen last year to succeed the F-15 as the top-of-the-range US Air Force fighter, has been protected in US budget plans, as has the McDonnell Douglas C-17 heavy transport aircraft. But other plans are subject to a battle over priorities. They include the navy's AX requirement (in lieu of the cancelled A-12) and the USAF's need for a new or upgraded multi-role fighter to succeed the current F-16. France's Rafale, being developed at Dassault both for navy and air force use, has suffered a revision since the French experience with single-seat Jaguar ground-attack fighters in the Gulf conflict. The French air force has switched its emphasis to two-seat versions and has put back delivery plans. The first air force Rafale squadrons are not now due to be formed until the early 2000s. After taking separate paths in the mid-1980s, when the French broke away from the European Fighter Aircraft project, BAe and Dassault have agreed to undertake joint research on the following generation of aircraft, planned for around the year 2020. BAe has also agreed with its Harrier partner McDonnell Douglas to undertake feasibility studies on a supersonic jump jet. In the world market, US and European manufacturers will have to look to new rivals in the next century. A recent UK Ministry of Defence assessment foresaw that indigenous combat aircraft production capabilities would to be limited to five Asian countries up to 2005 - China, India, Japan, Taiwan and Israel, all dependent on technical and/or financial assistance. After that date they could be joined by Indonesia, Pakistan, Singapore and Iran - and Japan would by then be fully self-sufficient.</p>

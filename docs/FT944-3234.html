			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitive British Land expands 11% to Pounds 17.9m British Land, the property investment company which last month unexpectedly wound up its joint venture with Mr George Soros's Quantum Fund, reported an 11 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 17.9m. Mr John Ritblat, chairman, said the company would remain an active buyer despite the Pounds 142m cost of buying out Quantum from the joint venture fund, which was set up in June 1993 and was expected to last for 10 years. The deal gave British Land full ownership of the joint venture's Pounds 591m property portfolio. In addition, it has spent Pounds 190m on acquisitions since its March year end, when the portfolio was valued at Pounds 2.2bn. The main purchases in the period were 73,000 sq ft of offices and shops at 2/14 Baker Street, central London, and 76,000 sq ft of retail warehouses in Oxford. Mr Ritblat said British Land had committed bank facilities and cash of Pounds 430m after the Quantum deal. Interest charges were covered 1.7 times by net rents during the period, he added. British Land is known to be interested in acquiring the Broadgate office development in the City of London. It has a 29.9 per cent stake in Stanhope, the developer which owns half of Broadgate and is in last-ditch refinancing negotiations with its banks. Boosted by acquisitions and rent reviews, net rental income for the half year to September 30 amounted to Pounds 66.4m, up from Pounds 58.1m. After interest charges of Pounds 43.9m (Pounds 40.8m) revenue profits, excluding capital items, increased by 30 per cent to Pounds 23.7m. Capital items included a loss on realised exchange movements of Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 1.4m) and the Pounds 4.7m one-off cost of redeeming long-dated bonds secured on properties which were acquired in 1992. Mr John Weston Smith, finance director, said the company had decided to redeem the bonds early because they carried restrictive coven-ants. British Land's share of the Quantum joint venture contributed Pounds 8.1m to net rental income and Pounds 2m to pre-tax profits. The company also received fees for managing the joint venture which were included in other income of Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 900,000). Earnings per share fell from 2.9p to 2.1p, or from 3.9p to 3.6p diluted. The interim dividend is lifted 8 per cent to 2.64p.</p>

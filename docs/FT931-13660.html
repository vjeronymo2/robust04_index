			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: ICI Yesterday's 2 per cent rise in ICI's shares in response to its asset swap with BASF suggests the market may have become over-sensitive. The deal adds only Pounds 60m turnover to ICI's acrylics business and little by way of additional profits. A cash payment of perhaps Pounds 25m will hardly transform the company's finances. By securing downstream capacity in continental Europe, ICI furthers its global ambition in acrylics, but approval from the US regulators for the proposed asset swap with Du Pont would be of far greater significance in that regard. On the evidence of third quarter figures, though, it remains touch and go whether ICI will be able to cover an unchanged dividend with earnings. The market is inclined to believe the disposal of the loss-making polypropylene business might just tip the balance in favour of maintaining the pay-out. Whether ICI should make the de-cision on the basis of such fine arithmetic is another matter. Regardless of whether the bio-science demerger goes ahead, some prospect of a sustained earnings recovery will be required to justify an unchanged dividend. It is far from clear that European acrylics will contribute much to that. The outlook is certainly better than in polypropylene - which faces ruinous over-capacity. But with demand for acrylic products so closely linked to the building cycle, a big improvement in profits this year seems too much to hope for.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The forces of unity, democracy and national concord  have destroyed large units of the Amaliqah [northern forces],  along with their stores, in al-Hawsh and Zinjibar, as well as  the strongholds of the Amaliqah in many parts of Abyan  Governorate. They have succeeded in wiping out many of the  Amaliqah advance units.    In a statement for the YEMENI NEWS AGENCY, SABA'', a  military  source said that our heroic armed forces had succeeded in  destroying the strongholds of the Amaliqah and overrunning their  forward positions east of Zinjibar with helicopters and  artillery, which participated in a concerted attack against the  fortifications and stores of the Amaliqah, completely destroying  them. The source said the forces of the 30th Brigade and the  Unity Brigade had occupied the positions of advance units in  Lawdar, Mudiyah and Shuqrah, where the attacking Amaliqah found  themselves under sustained attack from the forces of the 30th  Brigade, the Unity Brigade, and the Navy. The forces of national  alignment were able to penerate the defenses of the Amaliqah and  cut their communications, leaving them without central direction.    Meanwhile, other information indicates that the Amaliqah  tried to retreat at Zinjibar, Lawdar, and Mudiyah with [word  indistinct] the resident civilian population [words indistinct]  children caused by this invasion by the Amaliqah of peaceful  homes [words indistinct] the attacks of the patriotic forces.

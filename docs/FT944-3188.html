			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / International Company News: Optus posts operating loss of ADollars 98m for year Optus Communications, the Australian telecommunications carrier set up in competition to the government-owned Telstra, made an operating loss after tax of ADollars 97.7m (USDollars 75.6m) in the year to end-June, writes Nikki Tait. The figure, contained in a filing with the Australian Securities Commission, compares with a ADollars 69.3m loss in the previous 12 months. However, the company, which now competes with Telstra in the long-distance and cellular phone markets, also saw substantially increased revenues of ADollars 834.7m, compared with ADollars 300m in the previous 12-month period. The company's accumulated losses now stand at ADollars 172.6m, while the year-end balance sheet showed net assets of ADollars 1.33bn. Mr John Greaves, Optus chief financial officer, yesterday described the result as within expectations, and suggested that further deterioration was not expected in the year ahead. Optus is currently owned by a number of institutional and corporate investors, including Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK, and has suggested that it would be floated next year.</p>

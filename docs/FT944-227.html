			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / First Choice makes a 'new start' in links with WestLB First Choice Holidays yesterday abandoned two of the three legs of its strategic alliance with Germany's Westdeutsche Landesbank, which controls a 21 per cent stake in it. The group also announced that Mr Wolfgang Trube, chief executive of a WestLB subsidiary, would be joining the board as a non-executive director. He will replace Mr Christopher Rodrigues, chief executive of Thomas Cook, which is 90 per cent owned by WestLB. Thomas Cook bought the 21 per cent stake in First Choice, formerly known as Owners Abroad, last year, helping it to defeat a hostile takeover bid from Airtours, a rival tour operator. The Owners Abroad management at the time expected substantial savings to follow through co-operation with LTU, the German travel company 34 per cent owned by WestLB. First Choice will retain its retail agreement with Thomas Cook, but will end attempts to realise economies through links with LTU. Mr Trube's task will be to monitor WestLB's investment and to provide an informal channel for links with LTU. 'I think it's a new start,' said Mr Francis Baron, First Choice chief executive yesterday. 'It's a new start on a very pragmatic, business orientated basis, aiming to secure benefits for all our shareholders.' Dr Johannes Ringel, chairman of Thomas Cook and a member of the WestLB board, said that WestLB remained 'committed and supportive shareholders and believed that the company has a bright future ahead'. The alliance always promised far more than it ever delivered. At the same time the management structure of First Choice changed out of all recognition. Shortly after defeating the Airtours bid, the chairman and managing director of Owners Abroad resigned after disclosing that full-year profits would be only half market expectations. New management found that the strategic alliance was failing to win cost savings on the airline side through shared aircraft maintenance, fuel buying and spares purchasing, and on the tour operating side through greater buying power in booking holiday accommodation. The commercial agreement covering these two issues was terminated yesterday. Instead, a more informal arrangement is expected through Mr Trube's involvement. First Choice thanked Mr Rodrigues, who has a marketing background, for his contribution to rebuilding the company. But it is understood that his presence on the board was creating problems in the market place for holidays, with other multiple retailers suspicious of the Thomas Cook link. Mr Trube, 52, is now chief executive of Westdeutsche Spielbanken, which runs several casinos in Germany. He has been with WestLB since 1970, and was involved in the bank's acquisition of Thomas Cook.</p>

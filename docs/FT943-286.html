			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Deadlock over OECD top job The Paris-based International Energy Agency yesterday named a new director, but only on an acting basis partly because of the continued deadlock over a new head for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Mr John Ferriter is to take over as interim executive director of the IEA from Ms Helga Steeg, retiring after 10 years at the agency which seeks to co-ordinate energy policy among some 23 industrialised, oil-consuming countries. These countries all belong to the OECD, and some, notably France and the US, appear to be using the final choice of IEA director as a weapon in their battle for the secretary-generalship of the older and more prestigious OECD. Ambassadors of the OECD countries, which group IEA members plus Mexico and Iceland, were yesterday holding another crisis meeting, apparently to try to arrange a temporary manager of the institution after the term of Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the current French secretary general ends tomorrow In four hours of talks on Wednesday, they failed to reach a decision between the rival candidacies of Mr Paye, supported by France and a number of European countries, of Mr Donald Johnston, a former Canadian minister strongly backed by the US and some non-European members of OECD, and of Lord Lawson, former UK chancellor, whose backing lies mainly with his own country. Mr Paye's supporters claim majority support for their man who has held the OECD post for the past 10 years - though not apparently the Netherlands - behind him the Frenchman deservers to continue in the post he had held for 10 years. But the US and Canada are effectively vetoing Mr Paye on the grounds the OECD should have a non-European head for the first time in its history. Such is the deadlock it is possible both Mr Paye and Mr Johnston may have to withdraw.</p>

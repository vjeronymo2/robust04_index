			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Lamont's chance to relax FT-SE Index: 2,543.4 (+6.7) It might have been more awkward for the government if yesterday's output figures had turned out to be slightly better, rather than worse, than expected. Voters would still not have been enjoying much of the feel-good factor, but the markets might have been less inclined to give the benefit of the doubt to a generous pre-election budget. As it is, the worse the economic news, the greater the ap-parent scope for vote-winning fiscal manoeuvre, even though the GDP figures, like last week's unemployment numbers, are a lagging indicator. The consequence looks increasingly like a stimulus nearer to Pounds 4bn than to the Pounds 2bn which the City once expected, but that is not necessarily the way to restore sustainable growth. Were it not for the ERM, this objective would call for sharply lower interest rates to revive credit demand and arrest asset-price deflation. If fiscal policy has to be the main instrument, then it arguably makes more sense to target investment in productive capacity for the future rather than personal consumption. The markets may be forgiving before the election, but will they remain so afterwards if Mr Norman Lamont does succumb to the temptation to woo the individual consumer? Admittedly an injection of Pounds 4bn would be no more than those of 1983 and 1987 in relative terms, and only half the Lawson boost of 1988. Yetalmost forgotten by the electorate is the sizeable spending increase already announced in the Autumn Statement. Tilting the extra boost towards consumption could cause any recovery to run up quickly against renewed inflationary pressure and a rising trade deficit. The likely price is thus reduced scope for cutting interest rates down the road. But tight money and a looser fiscal policy would be convergence of a sort. The chancellor could even argue that he was still not as profligate as his German counterpart.</p>

			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL REJECTS HIGHER PARKING FEES FOR PADRES;  </P> <P> SPORTS: 7-1 VOTE OVERRULING STADIUM AUTHORITY DECISION IS BASED ON ECONOMIC  OUTLOOK, RISING TICKET PRICES.  </P> <P> Concerned about the economic recession and the escalating price of a day at the  ballpark, the San Diego City Council on Monday rejected a proposed $1 increase  in the parking fee for Padres games.  </P> <P> The 7-1 decision, which overrules a vote of the city's Stadium Authority,  leaves the Padres as one of only four major league baseball clubs charging less  than $4 for parking. It also will deprive the city and the club of an estimated  $340,000 each in additional revenue that would have been generated by the  increase next year.  </P> <P> The council agreed to reconsider the increase during budget deliberations next  spring. That timing virtually guarantees that the Padres will not be able to  impose a parking fee increase before the 1991 season begins.  </P> <P> Opposition to the increase was led by Councilman Bruce Henderson and  Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt, who were joined by Abbe Wolfsheimer, Ron Roberts,  Wes Pratt, Judy McCarty and Mayor Maureen O'Connor. John Hartley voted against  the rejection, and Bob Filner was absent.  </P> <P> "I don't think, at this point in time, with the economy the way it is, that it  would be the right message to send to the people of San Diego," Bernhardt said.  </P> <P> The Padres last raised the parking fee at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium from $2  to $3 in 1988. Under the city's lease with the club, the city receives the  first $1.5 million in parking revenue, minus operating costs paid to its  licensed contractor, Ace Parking. All revenue beyond that amount is split  evenly between the city and the club.  </P> <P> After a disappointing 1990 season, the team increased ticket prices by $1.50  for reserved seats and $1 for general admission seats. Reserved seats now cost  $11 and $9.50, and general admission tickets cost $5.  </P> <P> The ticket price increase was emphasized by council members and one resident  who testified that the price of reserved seats and parking for a Padre game now  totals $47 for his family of four. But Bill Adams, the Padres' vice president  for business operations, noted that the same family could attend the game for  $23 if all four sat in general admission seats.  </P> <P> In arguing for the increase, Adams said the additional revenue will help make  the Padres more competitive by allowing them to offer players higher salaries.  The team finished in a tie for fourth place last year, after being picked by  many to win the National League West division title.  </P> <P> "Every dollar we generate in revenue goes toward us becoming a stronger and  more competitive team," Adams said.  </P> <P> The Padres play 81 home games. The Chargers, which play eight games at the  stadium, not including exhibition games, charge $5 for parking.  </P> <P> City Manager John Lockwood urged the city to forge warm relations with the  Padres' new owners, led by television producer Tom Werner, and perpetuate the  cordial working relationship between the team and the city.  </P> <P> Cities such as Boston, Dallas, Chicago, Los Angeles and Oakland have faced  "serious litigation" with professional sports franchises, Lockwood said, and  endured bidding wars fostered by dissatisfied owners.  </P> <P> Roberts argued that revenue generated by other facilities such as the San Diego  Sports Arena or money from the city's general fund should not be used to cover  a projected budget deficit by the stadium.  </P> <P> But none of those arguments swayed most council members, who took pains to  praise the Padres at the same time they were turning down the parking fee  increase.  </P> <P> "The stadium shouldn't be a profit center," said Henderson, referring to the  stadium's first-ever surplus last year, caused largely by proceeds from a  concert by the rock group the Who.  </P> <P> "It was built by the people of San Diego, and to the extent that you charge for  parking at the stadium, you should try to recover costs."  </P></p>

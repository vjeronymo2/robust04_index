			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 5 Jun (AFP) -- Starting this week, Haitians  fleeing their country will be taken to three U.S. ships [not  further identified] anchored off Jamaica, and those who can  demonstrate refugee status will travel to any member nation of  the group "Friends of Haiti," it was reported today.    Guy Prim, representative for Venezuela and the Caribbean of  the UN Office of the High Commisssioner on Human Rights [UNHCR],  said this international organization will pay for the operation,  which is expected to amount to about $1.5 million.    In statements to the Caracas media, Prim said the difficult  situation facing Haiti makes its 6.9 million inhabitants  "potential asylum seekers." He announced that starting this  week, Haitians who flee their country will be housed aboard  three U.S. ships anchored off the Port of Kingston, Jamaica.  One of the ships will serve as a hospital.    He added that two commissions will be tasked with  classifying  the guests. These commissions will include an UNHCR commission  consisting of 10 jurists and 10 translators and a commission of  the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service consisting of 50  officials.    Prim said those who manage to demonstrate refugee status  during an interview will be informed about the possibility of  going to any member country of the group "Friends of Haiti."  This group is composed of Canada, United States, France,  Argentina, and Venezuela.    Prim, however, voiced his concern that Haitians might not  want to go to other countries because they are obsessed with  traveling to the United States. He bases his concern on a  recent experience when a majority of a group of Haitians who  failed to reach U.S. coasts returned to their native island.    In Venezuela, Prim added, the Social Pastoral Office of the  Bishop's Conference reached an agreement with the UNHCR to offer  lodging to Haitians welcomed by the administration of President  Rafael Caldera. Yesterday, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel  Angel Burelli Rivas said his country will welcome refugees for  as long as the difficult situation on the island persists.</p>

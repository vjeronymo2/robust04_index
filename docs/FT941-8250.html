			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Observer: Setting an example David Mellor, the former Tory Cabinet minister, is learning fast. He's been taken on as a senior adviser to accountants Ernst &amp; Young, adding to his increasingly fat portfolio of business consultancies. Mellor's policy of concentrating on advisory jobs, rather than company directorships, makes a lot of sense. Not only do most consultancy jobs pay far better than the average non-executive director's fee, but they involve none of the legal responsibilities of being a company director. David Howell (ex-Queens Moat Houses) and Sir Charles Powell (ex-Tiphook), are just a few of the political insiders who have sat on boards of companies that have run into trouble. It doesn't look good on their CVs. It is much more rewarding to be employed as an adviser to a company, and much easier to disappear into the shadows if there is a hint of corporate trouble. The habit's bound to catch on.</p>

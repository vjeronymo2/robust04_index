			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Normalizing relations with the United States  regarding migration has always been one of the Cuban  Government's objectives. For example, in 1993, Cuba authorized  100,000 people to temporarily leave the country, but only 30,000  were able to travel. The remaining 70,000 were denied a visa by  the U.S. Interests Section, located in our capital. Journalist  Zenaida Costales has a report for us on what goes on there, day  after day.    [Begin recording] [unidentified speaker] Everyone has an  objective. [indistinct comments by numerous unidentified  speakers, speaking simultaneously]    [Unidentified speaker] They stand guard here, in the line.  There is one who keeps the list of the people in line. Then...  [rephrases] but one must be here at 0630. To sacrifice all those  days! So, well, we do not have a set time for leaving here. We  are just as likely to leave at noon as at 1400 hours. It  depends. The U.S. Interests Section should consider that.    [Unidentified speaker] Well, here I am again today, for the  16th day.    [Unidentified speaker] And you have been... [rephrases] I  myself have been here a week, night and day. The other day, last  Monday, we were drenched by a rainstorm at 0500. This area was  so muddy that it looked like a pigsty around here. It was such a  mess that it was criminal to have to be here. And to have to  spend the whole day and the whole night that way.... [leaves  sentence unfinished]    [Two unidentified speakers, speaking simultaneously] But  that  is [words indistinct]. That kind of disregard!    [Costales] That kind of thing happens everyday at the park  at  Calzada and K Streets, called the Park of Lamentation because of  the thousands of people who gather there in front of the offices  of the U.S. Interests Section to await an interview, during  which they find out whether or not they will be allowed to  travel to the United States.    [Unidentified speaker] I have not been able to get in yet --  and without knowing, (without their) telling me yes or no.    [Unidentified speaker] Heck, it does people in, in the  heart!  People come out of there in tears -- all emotionally upset  because after all those things, to have them say to you: You  cannot go! [You think:] Let's see if I get lucky tomorrow and  will be able to go. And the luck (?involved in) having them say  yes to me! If they say no to me, then I will have spent all  those months in vain. That is not easy, [repeats] not easy.    [Unidentified speaker] I plan to go in there tomorrow, to  see  what they tell me. (?I have no idea what will happen.)    [Unidentified reporter] What if they say no?    [Unidentified speaker] Huh? What am I going to do, resign  myself? The thing is, he is going to die and I am not going to  get to see him before he dies, because he is in bed, in serious  condition.    [Costales] The U.S. Government turns the matter of  emigration  into one more stumbling block in the already difficult bilateral  relations between Cuba and the United States. But let us let the  protagonists themselves express their opinions.    [Unidentified speaker] (?We must) clear up one little thing:  The Cuban Government gives anyone who wants to go permission to  go. The whole blockage problem is here at the embassy because  the Cuban Government really does not prevent anyone from going.  Anybody who asks to go there and has complied with the  formalities gets permission. But it is here that one is blocked.    [Unidentified reporter] And what were you told at the U.S.  Interests Section?    [Unidentified speaker] That I could not go (?right now,)  because I was too young a person.    [Unidentified reporter] And what do you think of that?    [Speaker] His words of hope were for me to come back next  year, but I told him no, that next year I would be only one year  older, that it would be the same thing, that I would still be  young.    [Unidentified speaker] One cannot afford to lose the hope of  living, in this life!    [Unidentified reporter] And what if they say no to you?    [Speaker] Well, they will be forcing me to do something I  would rather not do. I would like to see my grandparents and  come back, but they are obliging me to do something else.    [Costales] There are still many things left to resolve  regarding emigration. These testimonies show that the doors in  that wall are still closed. [end recording]</p>

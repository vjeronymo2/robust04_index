			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today in Geneva, the UN Human Rights Commission  heard the agreed declaration on East Timor. Indonesia agreed to  take measures to release Timorese political prisoners soon and  to allow special rapporteurs access to East Timor. We have  Ramos Horta [resistance representative abroad] live from Geneva.    [Unidentified correspondent] Are you satisfied with the  agreed declaration?    [Horta] I am very pleased, obviously, although, as in all  situations, an agreed declaration means concessions from both  sides. The declaration does not condemn Indonesia for human  rights violations in East Timor, but on the other hand, at the  moment, it forces it to invite a special rapporteur --  responsible for investigating summary executions -- to visit  Timor in June. It is also hoped that the rapporteur  investigating torture and the working group for disappearances  will visit before the end of the year.    [Correspondent] Does this declaration open the door for the  release of political prisoners, as Indonesia has signed?    [Horta] I think so, I think so.    [Correspondent] Including Xanana [jailed Timorese resistance  leader]?    [Horta] Yes, I believe so. It includes Xanana and other  prisoners. I think that Indonesia will have to bring to the  Geneva negotiations in May some concrete confidence-building  measures. Indonesia will not be able to turn up empty-handed  again, as it did in New York and Rome. Yesterday, I spoke on  the phone to the UN secretary general's representative, who is  mentioned in the resolution, and I said that now the secretary  general also has the moral obligation of pressuring Indonesia  into coming to the May negotiations with some concrete steps.    [Correspondent] Can I assume that you are optimistic that  Xanana Gusmao will be released soon?    [Horta] Well, I am not optimistic or pessimistic. I hope  that Xanana Gusmao and others will be released, because it is  also in Indonesia's interest. There is a lot of pressure in  Indonesia on Suharto not to give in regarding Xanana Gusmao's  release, but Indonesia's international interests, its image  abroad would improve a great deal if President Suharto were to  make such a gesture.</p>

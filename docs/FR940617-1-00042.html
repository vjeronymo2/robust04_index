			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Several comments requested that certain warnings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required in the labeling of OTC drug products marketed for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general public should not be required on such products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distributed only to health professionals and labeled primarily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for use in health-care facilities as in proposed &sect;333.99  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Professional labeling'' (43 FR 1210 at 1248 and 1249). Examples  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cited were the cautionary statements for ``skin antiseptic'' and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``skin wound protectant'' in proposed &sect;&sect;333.90(c)(3) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 333.93(c)(3) ``Do not use this product for more than 10 days. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the infection (condition) worsens or persists, see your  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physician,'' and for ``skin wound protectant'' in proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;333.93(c)(7) ``Do not use on chronic skin conditions such as leg  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ulcers, diaper rash, or hand eczema.'' The comments stated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the professional use of these products sometimes differs from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer use and that products which are marketed only to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health-care institutions and are dispensed and administered by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professionals should only contain warnings that apply to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professional use. One comment concluded that requiring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professional labeling to contain a caution such as in proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;333.93(c)(7) could possibly subject the health-care facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the physician to unwarranted product liability claims,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> although the particular use of the product under medical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supervision is entirely justified and necessary for proper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment of the patient. One of the comments stated that flexibility should be provided so that manufacturers can utilize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only those warnings that are appropriate for professional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel when packages are restricted to health-care facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or where a topical antimicrobial product is used as part of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> course of treatment selected by the clinician.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of November 12, 1973 (38 FR 31260),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the agency published the tentative final monograph for OTC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antacid drug products, in which the concept of ethical labeling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for OTC drug products was first discussed in comment 56 at 38 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 31264. There, the agency stated that the warning statements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appearing on OTC drug products should be included in ethical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (professional) labeling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsequently, in the previous tentative final monograph for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OTC topical antimicrobial drug products, published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of January 6, 1978 (43 FR 1210), the agency proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;333.99 (``Professional labeling'') which stated that the labeling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of products (covered by the monograph) that is provided only to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health professionals and the labeling for those products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primarily used in health-care facilities shall include all of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warnings required in each subsection of the monograph, e.g.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those in &sect;333.90 for ``skin antiseptic'' or &sect;333.93 for ``skin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wound protectant.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As described in the first aid antiseptic segment of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tentative final monograph for OTC antimicrobial drug products,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of July 22, 1991 (56 FR 33644),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the agency has proposed deletion of the categories cited by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments, i.e., ``skin antiseptic'' and ``skin wound protectant,'' as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate drug categories and included them in a single drug  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product category identified as ``first aid antiseptic.'' The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cautionary statements referred to by the comments are addressed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in that document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this document, the agency is addressing the uses other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than first-aid, i.e., health-care antiseptic uses, of topical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antimicrobial drug products. These products may contain the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antiseptic active ingredient(s) as the first aid antiseptic drug  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products, but they are labeled and marketed for different uses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The cautionary statements previously proposed in &sect;&sect;333.90(c)(3)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 333.93(c)(3) addressed short-term first aid uses of products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primarily proposed as ``consumer products.'' These products were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not principally intended to be marketed for hospital or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professional use. Therefore, the agency agrees with the comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that such cautionary statements do not apply to professional use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of antiseptic drug products and need not appear in the labeling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of antiseptic products marketed as antiseptic handwashes or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health-care personnel handwashes, patient preoperative skin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preparations, and surgical hand scrubs. Likewise the agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that health-care antiseptic drug products, marketed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principally to health-care professionals, do not need to bear a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cautionary statement not to use the product on chronic skin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions such as leg ulcers, diaper rash, or hand eczema. As the comment pointed out, professional use of these products is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different than consumer use and, in some instances, use of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product on the above-mentioned skin conditions under medical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supervision may be justified and necessary for proper treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the patient. Therefore, this cautionary statement is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being included in this tentative final monograph.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

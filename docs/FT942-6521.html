			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Arts: Pleasure lies in mystery and moral ambiguity - The Lodger A landlord asks his prospective lodger for her references. She asks him for his. Who is to know who is safe with whom? No one. In Simon Burke's play The Lodger, at the Hampstead Theatre, both landlord and lodger use each other. He, Wise, comes to think he is in love with her - but only after he has fetishised with her bedclothes and underwear. She, Lois, comes to regard him as the nicest man she knows - but she only makes advances to him when she needs to make up for being unable to pay her rent. Subsequent developments are more shocking. Lois uses Wise's flat as a brothel; Wise, on discovering, beats her senseless. The pleasure of following The Lodger, though, lies not in its plot but in its mystery and moral ambiguity. Lois has lied to Wise about her work, but then she is a reluctant whore; she is manipulated by her pimp/lover Pollock. Wise has lied to her about working in the CID; but then he is pathetically anxious to attract some woman to relieve his loneliness. His best chum is his police colleague Reed, with whom he can discuss his needs; Lois's only chum is Pollock, who uses her repulsively. Which pair is preferable? Every man in The Lodger uses Lois, and the play sets up quite a range of misogynies. Most overt and chilling, Reed to Wise, after a few drinks: 'Pity we're not queer. . . A quick shag after footie. . . I can't see the point in women.' And yet - nice twist - Lois refuses to see the world as men vs. women. Though she resists Pollock's control over her, she defends him from Wise and Reed. They are cops (corrupt and brutal cops - another chilling element, especially after recent headlines); Pollock and she, she insists, are just perpetual social victims. The Lodger, which won Burke the 1992 Mobil Playwriting Competition for Manchester's Royal Exchange Theatre (which performed it earlier this year), holds the attention easily for just over two hours. At its best, the dialogue has the menace and suspense of early (pre-1968) Pinter. It includes several glib jokes that amuse without developing the play. (Lois about Wise: 'He's not that bad. He doesn't go round closing hospitals or anything.') The play disintegrates, however, as its several mysteries are elucidated. We are all pc enough to applaud Lois's resilience. But no character has been explored in depth. The performance, however, is excellent, apart from two of the most unconvincing stage slaps I have ever seen. The director, Richard Wilson (yes, he of One Foot in the Grave and The Weekend), hangs tension in the air from the very first moment. He and his designer, Julian McGowan, create several dark scenes, turning limited space to claustrophobic advantage. Body language and verbal pacing are full of meaning and suggestion. Amid a good cast, Julia Ford and Philip Jackson, as Lois and Wise, perfectly control the ambiguous lights by which we see them. Anyone seeking civilised entertainment in Covent Garden should fall into the Donmar for the next week or so where Maria Friedman is appearing 'by special arrangement', writes Antony Thorncroft. The 'special arrangements' are the settings to her songs. Friedman asked leading musicians to come up with new ideas to pep up cabaret standards. So just as you settle back for the soothing familiarity of Bernstein's 'Something's Coming' from West Side Story you get challenged by discords from Jason Carr's arrangement which suggests, rightly enough for the young leads, that what is coming is best avoided. In practice Friedman is such a strong performer - quirky face; blistering voice; confiding personality - that you hardly notice the new garments. Also her choice of songs - two yearningly sad Yiddish compositions from the Vilna Ghetto; lots of fairly rare Michel Legrand - lifts her performance out of the comfortable rut of most cabaret. The spunky arrangements from Jeremy Sams, Jason Carr, and more, are a bonus. Although it is a pleasure to come across such novelties as a lament from a little girl swallowed by a bear, I could have done with more Broadway and less Brel. Making something of 'If you go away' is meat and drink to any half decent late night chanteuse, but discovering the panazz in that most populist of all Cole Porter songs 'I happen to like New York' is a real achievement. Of the moderns Sondheim comes out best: his work always seems sharper delivered up front and solo than from the wide open stage. Perhaps Friedman's greatest coup was converting Elton John's 'Sorry seems to be the hardest word' into a sophisticated, heart wrenching, threnody. So a happy two hours. Excellent band, too. The best is left for the encore: a wonderfully defiant 'Broadway Baby'. Someone should book Maria Friedman's ticket now.</p>

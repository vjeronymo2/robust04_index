			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Competition in electricity THE UK electricity industry has borne out the predictions made at its privatisation a year ago. Both the two generating companies and the regional distributors stand accused of anti-competitive behaviour. National Power and PowerGen, it is persuasively argued, are using their dominant market position to manipulate prices in the wholesale market for spot electricity, known as the pool. Regional distribution companies are accused of making excess profits, and of showing insensitivity in awarding large salary increases to their directors. The Labour party, which has on the whole avoided promises to renationalise utilities, recently said it would renationalise the national grid and reimpose a measure of government control over the power market. Do these rumblings suggest that outside intervention is required, or are they merely teething problems, as a large and complex industry adjusts to its new existence? The answer is the former. The two large generators account for 65 per cent of the country's capacity, which is too much. This stems from the government's original wish to create generating companies large enough to own the nuclear power industry - which it no longer proposes to privatise. The big two have decisive leverage over the price of electricity set in the pool. They will also in future have a critical influence on the price of UK coal, and thus the shape and size of British Coal. Since the power generators are not directly regulated, Britain in effect has a largely unchecked duopoly, with too much power both over consumers and related industries, such as coal. Sceptical At the distribution end of the market, the case is less clear-cut. Although the regional companies enjoy monopolies in their local franchise markets which are providing them with a strong cash flow, the intention is that these monopolies will be steadily whittled away over the next six years. Consumers, however, are right to be sceptical whether these powerful regional bodies will ever face sufficient real competition to justify their release from anything but the tightest regulation. But what action should be taken? Prof Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, says the industry should be given five years to settle down before dramatic changes are made. Accordingly, he has proposed mild reforms in the pool arrangements, while reserving the right to make a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Running dogfight Some think that Prof Littlechild should bare his knuckles, as his counterpart in the gas industry has done in recent months. The problem, as we have seen in the telecommunications and gas industries, is that a running dogfight between regulator and utility may produce ad hoc improvements in competitive conditions, but does not automatically lead to considered structural reforms of the kind needed in the electricity industry. Apart from the central questions of prices and investment criteria, the electric power industry involves a particularly complex mix of issues. What allowance should be made for environmental requirements in pricing regimes? Should the need for a diverse fuel supply modify economic calculations in the case of coal and nuclear power? What is the correct framework for setting the contract price of UK coal when British Coal's contract with the generators comes up for renewal next year? Is the recent 'dash for gas' by generators likely to look as wise at the end of the decade as it does today? Because the UK's power industries were privatised in such a muddled and piecemeal fashion, and because of the gaping holes in the regulatory regime, it is entirely unclear on what basis these and other questions are to be answered. The danger is that they will be determined by the instincts of politicians, which is how most of the problems were created in the first place. A full MMC investigation is becoming a matter of some urgency.</p>

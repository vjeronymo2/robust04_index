The Department has determined that Indonesia is the most suitable surrogate for purposes of this investigation. Based on available statistical information, Indonesia is at a level of economic development comparable to that of the PRC, and Indonesian export statistics indicate that the country is a significant producer of lighters. Based on available information, Indonesia is the only surrogate country, of those identified by our Office of Policy, that meet both of these criteria. (See, memorandum to the file from Todd Hansen to Carole Showers, dated December 5, 1994, Surrogate Country Selection and memorandum from David Mueller, Director, Office of Policy to Susan Kuhbach, Director, Office of Countervailing Investigations, dated September 8, 1994, Lighters from the People's Republic of China, Non-Market Economy Status and Surrogate Country Selection.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Fair Value Comparisons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To determine whether sales of lighters from the PRC by COTCO, Gao Yao, GLIP, PolyCity and Cli-Claque were made at less than fair value, we compared the United States price (``USP'') to FMV, as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of the notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> United States Price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

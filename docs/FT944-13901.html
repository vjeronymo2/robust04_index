			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / How Kohl linked EMI choice to Delors succession: A confidential memo revealing the extent of German arm-twisting over siting of the European Monetary Institute in Frankfurt Germany threatened to block the candidacy of Mr Ruud Lubbers for president of the European Commission unless the Dutch premier dropped his opposition to Frankfurt as the site for Europe's future central bank, according to a confidential Dutch government memorandum. The memorandum is the first evidence that Chancellor Helmut Kohl linked the location of the future central bank to who should succeed Mr Jacques Delors. It also explains Mr Kohl's resolute opposition to Mr Lubbers, recently retired as the longest serving prime minister in Dutch history. But the document confirms, too, how Mr Kohl saw the location of the European Monetary Institute in Frankfurt as the absolute minimum needed to assuage the German public's fears about giving up the D-Mark in a future European monetary union. This is despite European allies' worries about strengthening Frankfurt as a financial centre in charge of a de facto D-Mark zone. In an interview yesterday, Mr Piet Dankert, the former Dutch minister for European affairs and current member of the European parliament, confirmed the authenticity of the memo, first disclosed at the weekend by the Dutch KRO public television service. Mr Dankert singled out a high-level diplomatic exchange in Bonn on October 21, 1993, in which Mr Joachim Bitterlich, the Chancellor's top foreign affairs adviser, attacked Mr Lubbers' opposition to Frankfurt as the appropriate location for the EMI. Mr Bitterlich warned Mr Dankert that this opposition would have 'consequences', with Mr Kohl turning to another candidate for the top Commission post. Mr Kohl's private office yesterday denied any connection between the location of the EMI and the Delors succession, or that Mr Bitterlich had raised the matter during Mr Dankert's visit to Bonn. However, Mr Dankert said he recalled receiving a veiled warning about the EMI connection from Mr Bernd Schmidbauer, a senior German official, which was then delivered more forcibly by Mr Bitterlich. Mr Dankert said: 'There is not the slightest doubt that the conversation took place. Because of its explosive nature, I asked for an immediate note to be taken down.' He relayed the German threat to Mr Lubbers at a meeting early the following morning. Mr Lubbers then sought a meeting with Mr Bitterlich two days later in which a second veiled threat was made, according to the KRO broadcast. Senior German officials familiar with the meeting argued that it made no sense for the Bonn government to issue a direct threat to Mr Lubbers because, at that time, he had failed to announce his candidature to succeed Mr Delors. But the officials conceded that the strongest representations had been made to the Dutch government to drop their campaign to locate the EMI in Amsterdam or, as a second best choice, Bonn. The officials said the matter turned on German's sovereign right to choose where it wished to place the future central bank. European Union leaders finally agreed to Frankfurt at a summit in Brussels on October 29, 1993. Mr Kohl subsequently asked Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, to become a candidate to succeed Mr Delors. France later backed the Dehaene candidacy, despite President Francois Mitterrand's preference for Mr Lubbers. However, the UK, with tacit Dutch support, objected to the Franco-German plan and vetoed Mr Dehaene at the European summit in Corfu last June. Mr Kohl called a second summit in mid-July in which he secured a consensus in favour of Mr Jacques Santer, prime minister of Luxembourg. Many MEPs objected to Mr Santer and raised questions about the procedure for selecting the president of the Commission, a post which Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister, described as one of the most important in the world.</p>

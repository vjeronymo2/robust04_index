			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> JAPAN SATELLITE IN MOON ORBIT  </P> <P> Japan put a satellite into orbit around the moon today, joining the United  States and the Soviet Union in the accomplishment, scientists said.  </P> <P> Japan's first lunar satellite, Muses-A, completed two missions, a swing-by  flight designed to boost its speed and enlarge its elliptical Earth orbit, and  the placement of a smaller satellite in lunar orbit, said the government's  Institute of Space and Astronautical Science.  </P> <P> "Both tests were completely successful, and we deeply thank U.S. and Japanese  scientists for their cooperation in the probe," said an institute spokesman,  who was not identified.  </P> <P> The institute's chief scientist, Kuninori Uesugi, said the release of the  smaller basketball-sized experimental satellite into orbit around the moon,  required extraordinary accuracy, "in baseball terms . . . comparable to hitting  the eyeball of a bug in the outfield from home base."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington May 23 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher wrote his Ukrainian counterpart today  and affirmed Washington's support for Kiev's control over the  disputed Crimea region.    "The territorial integrity of Ukraine within its present  borders is something that the United States has consistently  affirmed," State Department spokesman Michael McCurry said.    "The secretary recognized the responsible and conciliatory  approach that Ukraine has adopted in dealing with developments  in Crimea thus far and urged the Ukrainian Government to  continue to exercise restraint," the spokesman said of  Christopher's letter to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy  Zlenko.    He described the Crimean parliament's decision to "adopt  measures intended to loosen Ukraine's authority in the Black Sea  peninsula as contradicting the Ukrainian Constitution.    "Russia has also made clear its continued support of the  Ukraine's territorial integrity," McCurry said.    He denied reports that Ukraine might stop returning the  dismantled nuclear weapons if Russia intervenes in Crimea as  "baseless." The transfer "had been proceeding satisfactorily,"  McCurry said.</p>

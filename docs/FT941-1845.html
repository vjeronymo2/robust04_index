			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries jump as Fed nudges rates higher US Treasury bond prices jumped yesterday afternoon amid relief that the Federal Reserve had ended weeks of anticipation by signalling a small increase in short-term interest rates. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 1 1/32 higher at 92 11/32 , with the yield easing by about 10 basis points to 6.853 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was  7/32 better at 99 11/32 , to yield 4.948 per cent. The rally, especially at the short end of the yield curve, was surprising. It suggested that the market had already factored a rate increase into bond prices. News of the move came in a mid-afternoon announcement by the Fed that its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee had decided to increase 'slightly' reserves in the banking system. Analysts interpreted the statement as an indication that the FOMC had voted to lift its target for the Federal Funds rate by 25 basis points to 3.50 per cent. Early on, bond traders were content to remain on the sidelines until the Fed made clear its intentions. Prices across the yield curve were showing moderate improvement in light trading before the announcement. The reaction to the Fed's decision was immediate. Institutional investors poured money into the market, suggesting that yields, after moving markedly higher over the past few weeks, were attractive at current levels. The results of the Treasury's auction of Dollars 17bn in new two-year notes suggested as much. The offering, which was awarded at 5.15 per cent only minutes before the Fed's move, drew good demand even though confusion over monetary policy still reigned. European government bond markets pared their gains yesterday afternoon following early indications that the US Fed might leave monetary policy unchanged. Analysts had been surprised by the Fed's lack of action in the morning session, since most traders had expected it to sanction a rise of a quarter-point in the Fed funds rate to 3.5 per cent. The lack of a morning move by the Fed extended the markets' long vigil for evidence that European bonds were in the process of de-coupling from the US market. Analysts said that if the Fed had left monetary policy unchanged, it would have been easier for the Bundesbank to cut its repo rate today. The market had expected the Bundesbank to lower the rate by up to eight basis points from 5.88 per cent. UK gilts generally outperformed other European government bond markets, supported by hopes of favourable inflation data for February due to be released today. The market expects a monthly rise of 0.4 per cent in the retail prices index, bringing the annual rate, excluding mortgages, down to 2.6 per cent from 2.8 per cent in January. Media reports of a Gallup poll showing consumer confidence at a four-year low also supported gilt prices since the findings kept hopes of a further cut in interest rates alive. The June long gilt future on Liffe traded at 109 in the late afternoon, up 17/32 on the day, off the day's high of 109 31/32 but well up on the worst level of 109 5/32 . Analysts expressed disappointment at the size of the Bank of England's first floating-rate gilt for 15 years. They had been confident that the novelty value of the issue would encourage the Bank to set the amount at between Pounds 3bn to Pounds 3.5bn. However, the Bank chose to raise only Pounds 2.5bn, indicating to the market that it was comfortable with its funding programme. The other terms of the issue were in line with market expectations - a minimum price of 99.50, a coupon of three-month Libid less  1/8 point and a five-year maturity. German government bond prices see-sawed after news of the Fed's inaction. The June bund future on Liffe stood just under a half-point higher at 96.45 in the late afternoon, below the day's high of 96.60 but off the low of 95.84.</p>

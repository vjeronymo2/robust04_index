At present Vietnam has  105,000 km of high-way, 2,600 km of railway, seven main ports  and three international airports and 10 domestic airports. But  only 12 per cent of roads are surfaced with asphalt and only  half of the 8,000 national bridges are permanent ones.    The country has seven railway lines of which the longest one  is the Hanoi-Ho Chi Minh City line. This 1,726 km-transviet  line, which was restored after the Vietnam war nearly 20 years  ago, now needs to be upgraded to meet passengers' demand for  time and services. More than 12,000 km of river routes are  being used by means of transport but the river-port system is  not well prepared. Ports at sea have a better prospect of  modernization due to foreign investment. However at the moment  there is not any port whose annual capacity of commodities  delivered can reach 10 million tonnes. Vietnam's airports,  especially Noi Bai, Tan Son Nhat and Danang airports have been  upgraded to a considerable extent. But these airports need to  be transformed and enlarged with an estimated outlay of USD  [U.S. dollars] 300 million. So, from now to the year 2000, USD  hundreds of billion must be invested in upgrading the transport  system. While people are encouraged to contribute their  manpower and part of the funds for the building and repairing of  the local road network, the Vietnamese Government focus its  financial resources and aid funds and the international  cooperation on upgrading the national arteries. Highway No. 5  which connects Hanoi to the port city of Haiphong is planned to  be expanded to 20 metres with four lanes for vehicles. The work  is the result of loans from Taiwan and Japan. A USD 250 million  project to expand Highway No. 18 (linking Bac Ninh, Ha Bac  Province to Quang Ninh) has been approved. In the south, the  road linking Ho Chi Minh City with Vung Tau will be entirely  rehabilitated. Saigon-Long Thanh Express Way together with a  bridge lying across Dong Nai river will be completed in the year  2000. The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank will  provide fund totalling nearly USD 300 million for the  restoration of 1A highway, the road from Hanoi-Vinh and from Ho  Chi Minh City to Nha Trang. In addition the Governments of  Japan, France, Australia and some international organizations  will also fund additional loans for the repair and rebuilding of  some bridges. According to the Ministry of Transport and  Communications, in the coming time more than ten 100 metre-long  bridges will be built with expenditure ranging from USD 5  million to USD 100 million and four harbours will be upgraded so  that they can accommodate vessels of more than 30,000 DWT.</p>

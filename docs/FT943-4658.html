			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Russian military in troubled mood The first extensive survey of Russia's senior military officers reveals a group of men deeply disenchanted with Russia's place in the world and their place in Russia - as well as fearful of the future and resentful of the past. Most officers on or above the rank of major thought that 'without authoritarian rule we cannot overcome chaos'; that 'western types of democracy are not suitable to Russia' and that the 'main foreign policy task must be to re-establish Russia as a great power respected throughout the world'. The poll, carried out for the Friedrich Ebert Stifftung - the German social-democratic think tank - by the Munich-based Sinus polling group in co-operation with sociologists at a Russian military academy, is a unique view of the mind-set of a sample of 615 senior officers, including 60 generals and admirals. Though it shows that they do not endorse the more extreme nationalist politicians and parties - such as Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the Liberal Democratic party - they are overwhelmingly in favour of a strong hand to guide the state and evidently feel that such a hand is presently lacking. When asked which political or military figure they trusted most, the only two men to achieve more than 50 per cent (and to score less than 20 per cent on a disapproval rating) were General Alexander Lebed, commander of the 14th army based in the Trans Dnestr enclave of Moldova, and Mr Boris Gromov, the deputy defence minister who was the last Red Army officer to leave Afghanistan. Both of them are charismatic, hardline and critical of the present regime. Gen Lebed, who has called President Boris Yeltsin a 'nullity', said in an interview in the FT on Tuesday that it 'is just not possible' to create a democratic state in Russia and asked: 'What's wrong with a military dictator?' By contrast, Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, scored a little over 25 per cent, with a 50 per cent disapproval rating; and Gen Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, scored around 20 per cent, with a more than 50 per cent disapproval rating. Mr Zhirinovsky scored around 10 per cent, with a 60 per cent disapproval rating, while former Soviet president Mr Mikhail Gorbachev scored 2 per cent, with a disapproval rating of around 75 per cent. The most popular views of the immediate future were dark, even catastrophic. More than half thought that there would be one of the following alternatives: mass uprisings and strikes in different regions; the reassertion of a dictatorship; an explosion in a nuclear power station; or a military putsch. Very few believed in successful economic reforms or full co-operation with Nato, though few foresaw a return to socialism, the cold war or a planned economy. Other less apocalyptic views reflected in the survey including a high rating for Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the Yabloko group in the state duma (lower house) and a moderate reformist. The most popular foreign policy goal, endorsed by 55 per cent, was the re-establishment of Russia as a great power enjoying respect throughout the world. This goal scored just higher than agreement on a worldwide system of security.</p>

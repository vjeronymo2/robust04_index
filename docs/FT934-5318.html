			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: Gencor chief cool over Billiton deal prospects A decision about the deal that would transform Gencor, the South African resources group, into one of the world's biggest international mining and metals businesses, will be made before the end of the year, but there is a 'less than 50 per cent chance' that it will go ahead, according to the group's chairman, Mr Brian Gilbertson. Gencor announced in May that it wanted to buy most of Billiton, the mining and metals operations within the Royal Dutch/Shell group - assets with a book value of Dollars 1.8bn. But Mr Gilbertson says: 'It is not in our interest to buy assets that are fully valued. Billiton has to offer us a good return.' Billiton is heavily involved in the aluminium industry and Mr Gilbertson says that negotiations have been complicated by the fact that a view has to be taken about aluminium prices, which are close to their all-time low in real terms. Gencor's 40 per cent-owned Alusaf associate is building a Dollars 2bn, 450,000-tonnes-a-year aluminium smelter in South Africa.</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Arts: The Kocian Quartet and Welser-Most - Music in London Performances of Schumann's oratorio Scenes from Goethe's Faust are rare, so it was an excellent choice for the 'Deutsche Romantik' series on the South Bank. So was the plan of having the American Thomas Hampson sing Faust; his big, resplendent voice should have dominated the first two parts of the work, the quasi-dramatic ones. It was bad luck that Hampson fell ill just days before the London Philharmonic concert on Monday. In the event, listeners to the live broadcast on Radio 3 probably heard the piece to better advantage than those of us in the Festival Hall. Hampson's replacement was Simon Keenlyside, who - like Nicholas Folwell in Weber's Euryanthe on the previous evening - had bravely agreed to learn the part at short notice. It was understandable, but disappointing, that his attractive, intelligently used baritone lacked the authority to impose itself on the music. The conductor Franz Welser-Most did little to accommodate him, either by way of trimming back the orchestral sound or mitigating his tempi, which tended to be doggedly brisk. Margaret Price's Gretchen and Kurt Rydl's Mephistopheles were safe and strong, but Ian Bostridge was another souffrant, and after a plucky start his Ariel simply ran out of voice. The rest of the solo team were good, and the London Philharmonic Choir tolerably secure; the boys' chorus sounded frail. For Part 3, the elevated 'Chorus Mysticus' that Mahler was to set so much more dramatically in his Eighth Symphony, Welser-Most at last relaxed a little. So did his singers: Keenlyside's Doctor Marianus was fine and fervent, and each of Goethe's other mystical figures was gracefully sung. We began to appreciate Schumann's curiously gentle lyricism better. That was rather late, however. We had been taken at a jog-trot through much of the earlier music (composed later, in fact), with little chance to dwell upon its luminous moments. Yet hardly anything in the Scenes is 'symphonic'; the various movements are more like expanded mood-pieces.</p>

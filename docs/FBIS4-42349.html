			<p>BFN     [Text] Canada will not link its future trade relations with  China to the issue of human rights. Canada's minister of  foreign affairs, Andre Ouellet, presented the government's  policy on China in a speech in Ottawa.    He said linking trade and human rights would be  counterproductive and unlikely to succeed with such a large  nation as China. He says, however, that Canada won't ignore the  benefits of increased trade with China. Mr. Ouellet said  Canada's prosperity as a small nation depends on trade with  China, but he says Canada will press Chinese leaders in private  meetings on its human rights behavior.    Canada's Prime Minister Jean Chretien met yesterday in  Ottawa  with (Wu Bangguo), a member of the Chinese Communist Party's  Politburo. Mr. Ouellet said meetings such as this will be used  to discuss China's human rights performance and democratic  reform.    Mr. Ouellet's comments followed accusations from Amnesty  International. The human rights group said the Canadian  Government is neglecting its commitment to human rights. The  criticism comes almost five years after the massacre of  democracy supporters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Amnesty  says the situation in China hasn't improved since then.</p>

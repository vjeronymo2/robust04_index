			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 28 May (AFP) -- Today in Caracas, political  analysts highlighted the news that President Rafael Caldera's  administration, which will be four months in power on 2 June,  faces its first crisis due to ministerial disagreement over the  course of economic policies.    Government sources confirmed today the resignations of  Planning (Cordiplan) Minister Enzo del Bufalo and Transport and  Communications Minister Cesar Quintini, and said Caldera is  expected to announce his new cabinet by Monday [30 May] at the  latest.    According to political observers, Del Bufalo's departure is  due to his "conceptual differences" with government economic  proposals. Quintini was accused of "not touching the Perez  corruption structures (referring to jailed former president  Carlos Andres Perez) that rule the ministry," by his former  deputy minister Rafael Iribarren, who resigned. Others who will  leave their posts are the ministers for urban development and  environment and natural renewable resources.    Central Information Office Chief Guillermo Alvarez Bajares  justified the change of ministers arguing that this is not a  single party administration and its heterogeneity makes  differences understandable. Alvarez denied that the removal of  ministers proves the failure of certain policies and he pointed  out that the president has the power to modify and restructure  his council of ministers at any moment.    The current cabinet, made up of 26 ministers, the federal  district government, and the head of the Presidential Committee  to Reform the State, had been restructured by Caldera on 31  January, two days before becoming president.</p>

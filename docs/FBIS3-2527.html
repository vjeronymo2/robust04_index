			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Government  has set the growth rate of China's GDP [gross domestic product]  for 1994 at nine per cent, Premier Li Peng said here today.    "It is an appropriate speed after the country's GDP has  increased by 13 per cent for two consecutive years," he said.  "It would be an outstanding achievement if we can keep the GDP  growing at eight or nine per cent for a few more years."    Delivering a government work report at the National People's  Congress today, Premier Li stressed China will make its best to  maintain a vigorous and steady growth rate. Local authorities  should set reasonable growth rates for their respective  economies in accordance with their own conditions and not vie  with each other or concentrate exclusively on raising output  value.    On principles for economic work this year, Li Peng said,  China will carry out reform in depth and width, open wider,  strengthen macroeconomic controls, vigorously readjust its  economic structure, promote technological progress, open more  markets, improve economic performance, curb inflation, and  maintain a steady, rapid and sound development of its national  economy.    He called for strengthening agriculture as the economic  base,  developing the rural economy in an all-round way, encouraging  further development of rural enterprises, and increasing  peasants' income.    The central government, Li Peng said, will adopt the  following measures to support agricultural development and  protect peasant's interests: to raise the purchasing prices of  grain and cotton; increase investment in agriculture by both the  central and local governments; stabilize grain prices; assist  500 counties that are large producers of commercial grain, 150  counties that are large producers of quality cotton, and a  number of demonstration areas that are engaged in developing a  highly efficient type of farming that provides greater and  better yields; and continue to support the development of  township and village enterprises, especially in central and  western regions.    Li Peng said it is an objective requirement and inevitable  trend of economic development for surplus labor to shift from  farming to non-agricultural occupations and to move from one  place to another in a rational manner. "We should provide  guidance for such shifts, strengthen their management and  organize them in a systematic way."    To ensure a sustained development of the national economy,  Li  said, it is important to improve transportation and  manufacturing industries with priority given to large and  medium-sized state enterprises.    The State Council has decided that, starting from this year,  state enterprises will be exempt from payment of energy and  transportation development funds and from payment of budget  regulatory funds, and that special funds will be allocated for  the reorganization of bankrupt enterprises and the resettlement  of their workers and administrative staff, he said.    He noted that an important condition for maintaining  economic  stability and continued development is that investment must be  controlled at a rational scale. Since enough construction  projects are under way and considerable investment is planned  for this year, no further expansion will be permitted. "With  regard even to basic industries and infrastructural projects, we  should not undertake more than we can afford," he said.    All local authorities and departments should make rational  arrangements for the use of financial and material resources.  Projects to be supported should be selected on the basis of  overall national interest. First should come projects already  under construction in transportation, telecommunications, energy  and important raw materials sectors, and key projects for  harnessing big rivers and lakes.    No approval will be given this year to the establishment of  any new development areas. Henceforth no capital construction  projects will be launched unless they meet certain conditions.    On open policy implementation, Premier Li Peng said  attention  should be paid to improving the performance of existing open  areas -- special economic zones, Shanghai's Pudong, open coastal  cities and regions, and economic and technological development  zones. "At the same time, we should open wider major cities  along borders, along the Chang Jiang River and in the interior,  and improve our work in these places," he said.    "To maintain and expand foreign investment influx, we should  further better the environment for such investment and improve  related laws and regulations. We should protect the legitimate  rights and interests of enterprises with exclusive foreign  investment and use the government's industrial policies to  channel such investment into basic industries and  infrastructure," he said.    Li said China will continue to raise the people's living  standards and improve housing conditions on the basis of  economic [passage missing]    He said it is necessary to keep to the policy of encouraging  some areas and individuals to prosper first through honest work  and encouraging them to help others do so, in order to gradually  achieve common prosperity. "At the same time, we should  exercise necessary regulations over extremely sharp income  disparities by way of rational wealth distribution and taxation  policies," he said.</p>

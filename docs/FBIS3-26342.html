			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Sun Shangwu: "Local Government Reforms Planned"] </F>   [Text] A pilot project for local government reform in the  countryside is planned by the government.    Some 13 counties will take part in the first stage,  according  to official sources.    And a restructured social security system will be set up for  farmers.    The pilot scheme will make the selected county  administrations responsible for reforming the ways the State  property rights are used.    It is hoped the project will eventually extend to the more  than 2,000 counties in China, said the official from the State  Commission for Restructuring the Economic System (SCRES).  "Enterprises run by local authorities will be required to go  further than large and medium-sized State firm so far have in  the opening up of property rights," the official said.    A working committee will be established to guide the reform  of the pilot project counties. It will consist of SCRES and  provincial and prefecture government officials.    If the county reforms are successful, they will provide a  working model for the larger and more intractable rural and  urban administrations.    Restrictions on the transfer of ownership will have to be  abolished by the pilot counties. And State, collective and  private enterprises will be encouraged to work together to  develop industry and commerce in the pilot areas.    The counties to be chosen all have economic reform  experience.    The working committee overseeing the project will provide  specialist advice and help solve problems emerging from the  local reforms.    But local leaders will have to provide much of the impetus  themselves, the commission said.    The project's success will depend upon sound administration  and economic development across the pilot areas. And the  different counties will have to map out their own reform plans  in line with local conditions and not blindly imitate others.    About 350 counties have previously been chosen by provincial  governments across the country to take part in pilot reforms.    There are about 2,100 counties in China and one third of  them  are seen as "poverty counties".</p>

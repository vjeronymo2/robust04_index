			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Environment Minister Michel Barnier by </F> Jerome Strazzulla; place and date not given: "Michel Barnier:  `Our Culture of Nuclear Safety'" --first paragraph is LE FIGARO  introduction]    [Text] On the eighth anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster,  the upsurge of nuclear safety problems in eastern Europe, the  "long march" to Paris by opponents to the Superphenix [fast  breeder reactor], and a national debate on energy initiated by  the government for the first time in 10 years: Spring looks  like it will be dominated by the atom. Environment Minister  Michel Barnier explained the government's policy and its  prospects in the area of nuclear energy.    [Strazzulla] You are the environment minister of the world's  most nuclearized country. Do you get comments from your  counterparts, especially the European ones?    [Barnier] At no time within the Council of Environment  Ministers of the European Union [EU] has France's policy been  called into question in front of me. Every country has chosen  its strategy; we are not the only country which opted for  nuclear energy, even though in France it covers 75 percent of  our electricity requirments.    I think that other countries know our culture of nuclear  safety, the rigorousness of our inspections, and the quality of  our companies. This does not stop us from talking about it.    Whatever the atom's share in energy production, we have all  experienced common problems: especially with safety,  electricity lines, and nuclear waste.    [Strazzulla] As far as the choice of energy is concerned,  what kind of maneuvering room does the environment minister have?    [Barnier] The environment minister assumes a special  responsibility which he shares with the minister of industry:  nuclear safety. This is an issue to which I am personally  committed. The government is working in a coherent manner.    In the end, we ask ourselves the same questions, albeit with  different approaches. The most important signal, an initiative  by the prime minister, can be found in his desire to see an  open, national discussion on energy and the environment.    I have the feeling that this debate will raise greater  interest among local and national operators than we might  expect. Within the government, I feel quite easy saying, for  example, that in France we must revive diversification in energy  production and move toward hydroelectricity, renewable energy,  and biofuels, among other things.    [Strazzulla] Should we expect major changes in the national  energy policy following this debate?    [Barnier] There is no use in beating about the bush; our  electronuclear strategy will not change. However, what might  emerge from this debate is a greater understanding and a better  control over this choice. It should also help revive energy  conservation, which we inexcusably dismantled 10 years ago. I  would add a concern to this, namely a concern for greater  openness and greater control over energy policy by parliament.    This is why I raised the idea of a law on nuclear safety.  Lastly, this debate is linked to the law on regional  reorganization and decentralization, especially as far as  transport policy and the balance between road and rail transport  are concerned.    [Strazzulla] The alleged greenhouse effect is the new  argument used by the nuclear lobby. Does this seem credible to  you?    [Barnier] The current debate between scientists is focused  more on the seriousness of the greenhouse effect than on its  existence. In addition, I am organizing the third "Segur Talks"  on this topic on 16 May. While waiting to know the truth, we  have to apply the principle of caution. It is essential to  limit greenhouse gas emissions, especially carbon dioxide.    From this point of view, nuclear energy is actually a clean  energy. However, it raises other problems, the most serious of  which is waste.    [Strazzulla] The West seems to want to mobilize to help  Ukraine decommission its plant in Chernobyl. What are the main  options considered?    [Barnier] The shutdown of the two most dangerous reactors in  Chernobyl is something desired by both the West and Ukraine.  The prime minister asked us to prepare a specific initiative to  bring about this shutdown, in cooperation with the other  countries of the European Union and the G-7.    This point will be one of the main elements in the Naples  summit. Apart from the reactors, a new sarcophagus has to be  built in Chernobyl and there are still the major problems of  radioactive waste and water protection.    In order to meet Ukraine's energy needs, we could bring two  or three new reactors on line. That would assume a new culture  of nuclear safety in that country, as well as exceptional  support from all the Western countries. Lastly, in all the new  democracies, there is an enormous amount of energy waste.  Helping them better manage their networks and resources is a  big part of the solution to their problems.    [Strazzulla] After 40 years of operation, the problem of  nuclear waste has emerged in France. What do you think of it?    [Barnier] I believe that the operators and the bodies in  charge of nuclear energy have demonstrated a lack of foresight  by putting this issue off until later. Yet, very few political  decisions affect future generations to the same extent as the  production of long-life nuclear waste lasting 10,000 years or  more. The issue was finally raised -- rightly -- in the late  eighties.    The beginning of a solution was provided by the law of 1991  and the work of the Bataille mission concerning the  establishment of underground laboratories for studying deep  storage.    [Strazzulla] From the point of view of lack of foresight,  can  we dissociate nuclear waste from other industrial waste?    [Barnier] All industries produce waste. In the past,  industrial waste was often stored or buried in any manner and  anywhere. It is true that the industries which produced this  waste had no more foresight than the nuclear industry.    One of my first actions upon entering government was to  launch an in-depth inquiry in each department in order to draw  up a comprehensive and prioritized list of polluted sites. Once  this list is drawn up, we will have to find the resources to  treat these sites. I do not want anything to do with a  "contaminated earth" case.    Nuclear energy also produces end waste. It must be made  quite clear that no matter what type of reprocessing is used, we  must have underground storage sites for long-life radioactive  waste.    As for the processing of slightly radioactive waste, this  process must be more stringently managed.    [Strazzulla] Nuclear physicists assure us that the waste  problem will not be resolved with an incinerator. So what were  the government's real motivations in deciding to reactivate the  Superphenix reactor?    [Barnier] Superphenix will not be built to destroy all the  waste produced by France's 57 nuclear reactors.    The prime minister made a basic decision, namely to stop  fast-breeding operations in Creys-Malville in two years' time,  in other words, to stop producing plutonium.    The facility will make it possible to carry out experiments  aimed at gaining better knowledge of the means of reducing the  volume of the most dangerous nuclear waste.    I therefore have some trouble understanding the attitude of  certain ecologists vis-a-vis Superphenix at this time.    Bearing in mind the mass of money, research, and expertise  invested in this site, it would have been inconceivable to write  it off. This decision is in line with general interest.</p>

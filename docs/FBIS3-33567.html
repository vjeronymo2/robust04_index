			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bogota, 24 Feb (DPA) -- Today, Colombian Foreign  Minister Noemi Sanin said it is unacceptable that Colombian  citizen Maria Casas Dupuy, who was arrested in the United States  on charges of espionage for the former USSR and Russia, has been  both a diplomat and a CIA agent. This is the question that  interests the Bogota government in the midst of the huge scandal  that surrounds Washington and Moscow. Therefore, the Foreign  Ministry has already asked the State Department to explain if  Casas Dupuy worked for the CIA when she was the cultural attache  of the Colombian embassy in Mexico.    Casas Dupuy, a 41-year-old intellectual, was arrested this  week in the United States with her husband, Aldrich Hazan Ames,  a high-ranking officer of the CIA, who is accused of selling  secret information to the former USSR and then to Russia since  1985. Sanin said the Colombian Government cannot condemn the  former diplomat until U.S. authorities clarify this question.  She also warned that many times people accused of certain crimes  turn out to be innocent.    According to the Foreign Ministry, Casas Dupuy held the post  in Mexico from April 1982 to December 1983, which means she  would have been playing the double role of a CIA agent and a  member of the diplomatic corps. According to FBI documents, the  woman has worked for the intelligence corps since 1982.  According to Gustavo de Greiff, prosecutor general of the  Republic, if it is proven that Ames' wife was a CIA agent and a  Colombian diplomat at the same time, she would be charged with  treason to the fatherland.    In addition to clarifying the functions the woman had in the  CIA, the Colombian Government has also asked Washington to  explain what was the purpose of Ames' visit to Bogota on 30  October to 3 November 1993, when he apparently met with Russian  Secret Service agents.    One of the clues the United States used to capture the  Ames-Casas couple was an ad published by THE WASHINGTON TIMES  last October that said "we are ready to meet in the city you  know well." According to investigations, that city would be  Bogota.    The arrest of Casas Dupuy surprised everyone in Colombia,  inasmuch as her friends remember her as a brilliant person who  never showed any political inclinations. The woman, accused of  espionage, graduated from the School of Philosophy and Letters  of the University of the Andes in Bogota, and she has written  poetry and philosophical essays.</p>

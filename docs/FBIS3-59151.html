Pu.: "Paris Seeks To Curb Trade Deficit"] </F>   [Text] In committing itself not to sell any more offensive  weapons to Taiwan, France aimed to do away with the barrier  which prevented French companies from gaining a share of the  Chinese market comparable to that of their foreign competitors  in 1993. French companies are now "welcome to compete on an  equal footing (in this market," said China's Foreign Minister  Qian Qichen during his official visit to France.    By bringing its relations with Beijing back to normal,  France  hopes to be able to take advantage of China's economic boom  (annual growth rate of 14 percent) and thus to curb its trade  deficit with this country, which has been steadily increasing  since the mid-eighties. While it boasted a 2.5-billion-franc  [Fr] surplus in 1985, France's trade balance with China suffered  a Fr11.2-billion deficit in 1992. As for the exports-imports  ratio, it went down to 39.7 percent in 1992 from 157 percent in  1985.    However, statistics available for last year's first nine  months indicate an improvement. The 1993 deficit should be  comparable to that of 1992, a year during which France was  China's 12th biggest supplier and customer. Major French  corporations with a foothold in the Chinese market include car  makers Peugeot, Citroen and Renault, as well as CGE [General  Water Company], Alcatel-Alsthom, Elf-Sanofi, Rhone-Poulenc, and  Lyonnaise des eaux [Lyon Water Company].    Franco-Chinese trade is characterized by a typical  industrialized nation/developing country relationship. Owing to  its fast economic growth, China mainly purchases capital goods  from France. In 1992, machinery and mechanical apparatus made  up 23 percent of French exports to China; then came cars, car  equipment and commercial vehicles (19 percent), electrical  equipment (8 percent) and professional electronics (8 percent).  France purchases consumer products from China, such as textile  articles and clothes (21 percent of French imports in 1992),  toys, sporting goods and jewelry (19 percent), shoes and leather  goods (14 percent), and consumer electronics products (7  percent).    While French exports to China increased by 30.2 percent over  last year's first five months as compared to the same period of  1992, Germany's exports went up by 89.8 percent, Italy's by 83.3  percent, and Britain's by 52.3 percent. France's policy U-turn  with respect to Beijing should therefore enable French companies  to take full advantage of China's booming economy.</p>

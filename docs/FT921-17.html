			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Government Bonds: Matif recovers after morning political jitters FRENCH government bond prices set the tone for the rest of continental Europe yesterday, first trading lower as the market focused on political uncertainties before recovering to close higher on the day. The early tone of the French market was negative following the poor performance by the ruling Socialist party in the weekend's second round of regional elections. The government bond futures contract on the Matif, the Paris futures exchange, fell to a low of 106.78 from an opening level of 107.20. Both cash bond and futures prices recovered during the afternoon. Traders ascribed the rally to speculation that Mrs Edith Cresson, the prime minister, would soon resign, although the rumour was denied by the Socialist party. By the close of trading, the bond future stood at 107.40, just below the day's high of 107.44. Volume was 17,975 contracts. The benchmark 8 1/2 per cent 10-year French government OAT closed on a yield of 8.71 per cent, against the 8.73 per cent seen on Friday. GERMAN government bonds were dragged lower by negative sentiment in France during the morning session, the gloomy mood compounded by statements from prominent monetary officials which suggested German interest rates could rise. Mr Otmar Issing, Bundesbank board member and head of its economics division, was quoted in the German press as saying inaction by the authorities would give 'the wrong impression' to trade unions. Taken with earlier statements, this was interpreted as a warning that interest rates could rise to counter the effects of inflationary wage settlements. The June bund futures contract on Liffe, the London futures exchange, opened at 87.15 and fell briefly below the psychologically important 87.00 level during the morning, touching a low of 86.92 before finding support. The market later rallied in line with French government bonds, the bund future trading up to 87.33 by the close. Volume was an active 66,850 contracts. AFTER posting solid early gains on a weaker-than-expected US new-home sales report yesterday, Treasury prices fell back to approach the end of a quiet session little changed. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was unchanged at 100 5/8 , yielding 7.938 per cent. The two-year note was slightly firmer, however, up  3/32 at 100 9/32 , yielding 5.583 per cent. Prices moved higher after traders welcomed the morning report that new single-family home sales fell 2.7 per cent in February, after rising a revised 11.1 per cent in January. UK GOVERNMENT bond prices firmed yesterday. The gains were concentrated at the longer maturities. The benchmark 9 per cent gilt maturing 2011 gained 15/32 of a point on the day to close at 94 7/8 for a yield of 9.58 per cent. The June gilt futures contract on Liffe rose from 93.19 at the opening to 94.12 by the close, with trading volume a respectable 25,000 contracts.</p>

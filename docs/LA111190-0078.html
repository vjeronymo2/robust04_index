			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PSYCHING OUT A KILLER;  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA STREET BY DONNA LEVIN (SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER: $18.95; 290 PP.)  </P> <P> Donna Levin's lively and engrossing San Francisco murder mystery/love triangle  might be described as "a California detective novel." But it is a sensitive and  introspective book, certainly nothing that could be called hard-boiled.  </P> <P> The sleuth is Dr. Joel Abramowitz, a sometimes inept, self-doubting, endearing  33-year-old psychiatrist who mentally toys with the possibilities of every  situation he confronts with maddening ambivalence. But it is precisely his  ongoing quick-minded neurotic analysis that makes this book so fascinating. We  experience the story through Joel's mind, and he calls on his psychoanalytic  training to seek out hidden motivations, posit alternate theories and scenarios  of behavior for other characters, and creatively piece together the clues in  this puzzle. The subtle subtext is that a mystery writer does exactly the same  thing.  </P> <P> "California Street" is an innovative variation on the detective-novel formula,  sort of a psychological whydunit in addition to a whodunit. Interestingly  enough, such variations are getting to be the rule rather than the exception.  From Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes tales to Robert Parker, mysteries have had a  large element of the howdunit. But lately, the other interrogatives have  dominated. Taking us to Japan or New Mexico, mystery writers such as James  Melville (the Inspector Otani series) and Tony Hillerman have pioneered the  wheredunit. With settings as disparate as 12th-Century monasteries and 1940s  L.A. jazz joints, writers such as Ellis Peters and Walter Mosley take us on  whendunit time trips to solve crimes. (I suppose you could also argue that  Stephen King and Clive Barker often are writing whatdunits.)  </P> <P> Although readers of P. D. James, Martha Grimes and Dick Francis are howling  that these writers are straying away from that cozy, traditional English  drawing room down the rocky path of the whydunit, the author who has shaped the  psychological mystery novel into an art form is Jonathan Kellerman. In fact,  the opening of "California Street" almost reads like a Kellerman novel.  </P> <P> Dr. Abramowitz receives an urgent telephone call asking him to rush to a nearby  day-care center: A mentally disturbed woman has a child on the roof. Joel  rescues the child and agrees to help the woman as a patient. The scene also  introduces us to Margot Harvey, heir to the San Francisco Courier fortune,  founder of the Playground Daycare Center and wife of his former college  roommate and best friend, Ted Harvey. Joel is in love with Margot, guilty about  his relationship with her alcoholic husband, and completely manipulated by her:  </P> <P> "They were a threesome, a dynamic which persisted even when he (Joel) brought  other women along. Joel hadn't ignored the obvious Oedipal implications of  that, he'd just -- well, ignored them. Ignored, for example, how he didn't mind  going to the theater alone with Margot, if it was something Ted didn't want to  see. After all, he went to games alone with Ted, didn't he? And sometimes a  cigar was just a cigar."  </P> <P> This trick cigar full of Oedipal surprises blows up in Joel's face when Margot  asks him to run away with her; a new client of his, a beautiful young model, is  found dead; Margot disappears but seems to be in contact with the deranged  woman from the roof of the day-care center; and Ted admits that he was having  an affair with the dead model. Joel races ahead of the police to track down  Margot and finds the evidence stacking up against Ted in the murder case. He  turns to his girlfriend and fellow therapist Denise for support, which turns  out to be complicated because they are sleeping together and she's in love with  him -- and he's not sure whether, perhaps, in some way, he's in love with her,  too.  </P> <P> At first, Joel's incessant internal dialogue with himself, a running commentary  on everything that impinges on his awareness, appears to be a distraction for  the reader, a background chatter that keeps us from concentrating on the plot.  But, quickly enough, it becomes clear that we've just got to sit back and enjoy  being in the mind of Dr. Joel Abramowitz, being party to all his anxieties,  obsessions,and mental gymnastics. This book is at least as much about Joel's  mind as it is about the external events. Of course, we are also victims of his  errors and interpretations, too, which reminds us that there is a novelist  telling the story behind the protagonist telling the story.  </P> <P> Levin handles the complicated twists and turns so deftly that the more rapidly  the plot unravels, the more involved you become with Joel's wildly careening  life. She sends us roaring into a denouement that Hitchcock would have loved  and ties up the numerous loose thematic threads with dramatic flair.  </P> <P> This is an inventive novel that is thought-provoking and fun to read, and  Levin, who previously wrote "Extraordinary Means," is a novelist to keep high  on your reading list.  </P></p>

Dehaene had said Saturday that his centre-left coalition  would remain in office despite the departure of his deputy Guy  Coeme, who stepped down after being implicated in a scandal over  a 1988 government helicopter contract.    A statement from Belgium's King Albert II said Elio Di Rupo,  culture minister of the country's French community, was named to  replace Coeme as deputy prime minister, minister of  communications and public enterprises.    Magda De Galan, former minister of social integration,  health  and environment, was named minister of social affairs.    Jacques Santkin, a member of parliament, was named minister  of social integration, health and environment.    Jean-Maurice Dehousse will be in charge of infrastructure  while conserving his post as minister of science policy, the  statement said.</p>

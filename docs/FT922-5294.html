			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Spain (4): The people's friend - An interview with Alvaro Gil-Robles, the Spanish ombudsman ALVARO GIL-ROBLES is, officially, the people's friend. The son of a controversial conservative leader during the Spanish republic 1932-1936, he is el Defensor del Pueblo,the Government-appointed ombudsman to the nation. Gil-Robles sees the down-side of Spanish life as people bring him their complaints. But he is also an optimist - an educated and demanding Spain is, he says, rapidly shedding the detritus of half a millennium of misrule and conflict. QUESTION: It is 500 years since Spain as we know it was created. Has the way Spaniards and their rulers regard each other changed much since then? ANSWER: Yes and no. The Spanish people have 500 years of conflict behind them. Spain has undergone a great transformation, more in the past few years than at any other time. They have learned the lessons of many years of misunderstandings, of angry and violent conflicts, and have established a basis for peaceful understanding between each other. They have also learned they cannot live in isolation. They have had to open themselves to the European phenomenon and this has required an important mental leap. They want public services to work and although everyone complains, they pay their taxes. Also, this is the first time parties of all ideologies have backed a single Constitution while at the same time we have set a great regional (political) project in train. So is this once centralised country becoming a federal one? I really cannot say. Not long ago the thought of politically autonomous regions (the 1978 Constitution established 17) would have been distant and strange to many millions of Spaniards. This was a centralised culture and we had had centuries of other models failing. Now, suddenly, the regional ideal seems possible. The regions have their own dynamic, they have not distorted the country, they have not made it poorer. But after the Reconquest ended in 1492 Spaniards seemed to surrender their hard-fought liberty back to a powerful central power. Are they now taking it back? The key is education. By the start of this century, Spain was riddled with inequalities. Millions of citizens had no real access to culture or education. Wealth was very badly distributed. Until the 1960s, we were a nation of emigrants, a people without a modern economy. There was nothing to do but leave. But things have changed with education. There is time now to look at how they are organised. Spaniards want to know how to remain competitive and to make public services work and how we will combine giving more (autonomy) to those regions that want it with less to those which do not. Are Spaniards in the countryside, in small towns, really aware of what being part of Europe implies? I have my doubts. The Spaniard in Granada, for example, knows that Europe is a reality, that the country cannot live in isolation and that we have to work within Europe. But he is beginning to discover that this implies sacrifices. I think, though, that he is less distrustful of Europe than a Frenchman in Lyon, or an Englishman in Manchester. The problems Maastricht created have been much easier to deal with in this country, knowing that it (the decisions taken by the EC summit in Maastricht last December to proceed with economic union) is a decisive step with enormous consequences. But how is it possible to sell these messages when there seems to be such a wide gap between political life in Madrid and what happens to ordinary people in the provinces? Madrid is extremely lively politically and the rest of the country follows its own pace but I would not say the rest of the country is not informed. Maybe the rest have not begun to think about the consequences of Europe, positive and negative. People are still filled with expectation, living out the transition (to democracy) with many problems of their own. Europe may not be a tangible thing. It is still a young idea here. At Maastricht Spain pledged to converge its economy with the rest of the EC by 1997. How will the country react to what could be a second transition, another modernising leap? One has always known that we Spaniards are capable of doing extraordinary things very quickly. The question is whether we can also be long-distance runners. I belive we can be. Convergence will force us to stop thinking about today. We will have to begin to be professional, rigorous, serious, to plan. We need to drop our bad habit of wanting everything to happen at once. One example is the tourist industry. We have destroyed our coasts and built a poor tourist infrastructure, but when the Expo happens in Seville or the Olympics take place in Barcelona suddenly hotel prices rocket. This is awful and there is no reason for it if we want to maintain serious and solid tourism polices. What do Spaniards complain about? About many things but they do it with intelligence. They complain because the system of justice is so slow. It's a fact and important to the economy. Part of the principle of legal security is that justice is agile. They want the public administration to improve and to be a service rather than an intrument of power. They want that when they have a sore ear the social security don't hand them a piece of paper and tell them to see a specialist in three months. Our public administration has many old vices. It is centered on itself and not connected to the people. But people know how to complain, which is an important indication of a civic culture. People who come here are desperate. The administration can drive people crazy. Where has Spanish democracy implanted itself most firmly? In the municipalities. The town halls of Spain, which were once very poorly run, are become very efficient. They have moved very close to their citizens. Especially in small towns, the mayors are in constant contact with the people. For that reason municipal life is hard; the people are on top of them all the time. There is much discussion about corruption is Spain. Is it universal in public life? In the last few years you could say that a money cult has been let loose among the people. They need to spend, to consume, to show off. This has created a consumer culture and the idea that you can be measured by your financial success. It has affected ordinary people, industry and commerce. Many people are living beyond their means and the money phenomenon has made people lose their respect for work. This has created the sensation in some parts of society that it is better to be unemployed than to work. We need to recover some old values, of work, of seriousness, of honesty. The Constitution gives political parties a presence in a very wide range of Spanish institutions - from broadcast media to savings banks to the selection of judges. Is this not dangerous? The idea that everything political is corrupt or negative is wrong. What matters is transparency in how institutions work, how people get into them and how they take decisions. Civil liberties are better established here than in most of Europe. People speak here with a freedom that never existed before. The Spanish press is one of the freest in the world. In the dictatorship everything depended on the central power. Not a school was built, nor a road, nor a business created, nor a doctor consulted, without a nod from Madrid. Is Spain still a Catholic country? Spaniards have become very tolerant but everyone still carries cultural and sociological traces of religion. The other question is whether they practise. But they are respectful and do not attack the religious feelings of others. Popular fiestas and important family events continue to be linked to religion for all of our lives. France, Italy and Germany have all experienced outbreaks of feeling against immigrants. Will Spaniards prove to be racist when immigrants begin to arrive here in great numbers? I don't think we are different and we have already experienced outbreaks of violence against Gypsies. Racism is not a problem yet but as a society grows richer it becomes more protective of its interests and shows less solidarity with others. But we were once a nation of emigrants and we should be more understanding. I don't know what will happen when we are put to the test. What does 1992 mean for Spain? It is profoundly important. We are certifying the fact that we have come out of the tunnel of a history as a paralysed country. This country no longer wants to close itself off from the Pyrenees down. We are no longer what people thought. For years people carried a photograph of us fixed in time with our carts and donkeys. This is over now. This country is alive.</p>

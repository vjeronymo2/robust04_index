			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by correspondent Valeriy Vyzhutovich: "Code For </F> the Steppe; Kalmyk Statehood Buried by Kirsan Ilyumzhinov"]    [Text] "By proclaiming its sovereignty and signing the  Federation Treaty, Kalmykia has unequivocally expressed the will  of its peoples for socioeconomic progress, national and cultural  revival, and a higher standard of living for its population  within the framework of a unified Russian Federation.... It  thereby assumes full responsibility for its future." (Kirsan  Ilyumzhinov, candidate president of Kalmykia, March 1993).    "No one will send us money and the republic's inhabitants  will be in a lamentable state. Consequently, we must abolish  the Constitution of the Republic of Kalmykia and dual  citizenship, proclaim exclusively Russian citizenship, and abide  by the Russian Constitution alone in the territory of Kalmykia."  (Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, president of Kalmykia, March 1994).    The document adopted in place of the abolished Constitution  of Kalmykia is called the "Steppe Code."  <H5>  "I Did Not Prepare the Population...." </H5>   Ilyumzhinov's address to an enlarged session of the republic  parliament, when he proposed to abandon the Constitution of  Kalmykia, was stunning in its suddenness, as much as in its  abolitionist zeal. "I deliberately did not prepare the  population," he was to say several days later before a large  audience. "I did not even warn my assistants. If you were  watching television, you will have seen how the faces of people  sitting in the auditorium fell."    The president's legislative initiative has tempted people by  the noble language in which it is couched: "To help Russia, to  extend a helping hand to the Kremlin and to the Russian  leadership, and to take a step in the direction of uniting  Russia."    Until now, there has been no organized opposition in  Kalmykia. Now there is. It is a rare example -- perhaps the  only example in all Russia -- of political antagonists,  communists and members of "Russia's Choice," joining forces.  Members of the Agrarian Party, the Republic Party, the Party of  Russian Unity and Accord, and the Oyrat-Kalmyk National Movement  have cast aside their differences. The Union of War and Labor  Veterans and the Union of Students have found a common language.  Finally, a public committee to protect the Constitution of  Kalmykia and Kalmyk citizenship and statehood has been born.  Ilyumzhinov is extremely satisfied with this and has told the  whole republic: "This was all planned beforehand.... I have  exposed overt and covert enemies and people standing in my way  in this process of restructuring and reorganization.... Lists  will soon be published, practical conclusions will be drawn in a  week, and I shall name names.... I have already dismissed four  people. On Saturday, several leaders will write statements of  their own accord."    The prayer-like introduction of the published draft "Steppe  Code" is disturbing: "Throwing ourselves at the feet of the  great prelate who now turns the wheel of modern teaching...."  Kalmyks account for 45 percent of the republic's population,  and only one-quarter of them are believers. Local Christians  and Muslims, let alone inveterate atheists, are certainly not  obliged to "throw themselves at the feet" of Buddha.    The draft invests the president of the republic with  dictatorial powers. He may dissolve the People's Hural  (parliament) before term if it "does not guarantee stability in  society" (what boundless scope for interpretation!); recommend  who is to be elected chairman of parliament and his deputy;  recommend who is to be appointed head of the Supreme Court and  the Court of Arbitration, chairman and deputy chairman of city  and rayon courts, and so on and so forth....    "Replacing the Constitution by the proposed normative act  will legally consolidate the authoritarian system of government  established in the republic, which has consigned to oblivion the  principle of separating powers," an extraordinary congress of  the people of Kalmykia stated. However, a Constitutional  Assembly (by the nature of its tasks, it would, of course, have  been more appropriate to call it the Anticonstitutional  Assembly) was hastily formed under the strict control of the  presidential apparatus. This burial team was knocked together  from 300 people: 10 from every rayon, 50 from Elista, 75 from  the executive, 25 (the whole of parliament) from the  legislature, and 20 from various parties and movements.    Kalmyk statehood was ready for "burial" in three weeks.  <H5>  Bidding Farewell to Sovereignty </H5>   It was "buried" on 5 April, Ilyumzhinov's birthday. Morning  pickets outside the parliament building noted the intersection  of these occasions with a placard: "The president's birthday  should not be the republic's death day!" (Local political  folklore was immediately enriched with an oral version along the  same lines: "Kirsan did not slaughter a sheep for his birthday  -- he slaughtered the Constitution"). The hopeless words  fluttered in the wind: "Shame on the gravediggers of Kalmyk  statehood!" and "Mr. President, our Constitution is not for  sale!"    Meanwhile, the crack troops of approval and support were  entering the sessions hall.    "I mount this rostrum with great excitement and a deep sense  of responsibility," a nice woman, a local doctor from the rayon  and first in a line of disciplined orators, began reading.  "Kirsan Nikolayevich has initiated a new, peaceful revolution  in our society...."    Passing the baton of approval lasted four hours, plus an  interval. A lone dissenter requested the floor, but the  assembly unanimously refused his request. So the drafting  commission proposed that the document be "adopted as a basis"  (one vote against, one abstention), the president made an  emotional speech of thanks, and the national anthem was played  for some reason, despite the fact that the state no longer  existed....  <H5>  No Sign of a "Second Kuwait" </H5>   "So you are exchanging sovereignty for federal subsidies?"  The president was not at all disconcerted by my question.    "What do you mean by exchange? There never was any  sovereignty! Not real sovereignty. Only on paper. The  republic has always been subsidized."    "But a year ago you promised that the republic would live on  its own resources. `We plan to build economic relations with  Russia on a partnership basis and give up the billions in  subsidies.' That is a quote from your election program."    "Well, that I do not deny. Everything is being carried out.  I still say we shall turn the republic into a single  industrial, financial, and investment corporation. People ask:  Where are the results? But it takes time for them to show.  Only a year has passed since my election."    Yes, a year has passed, and there is still no sign of  Kalmykia being turned into a "second Kuwait." There is no  offshore zone (that is, a zone virtually free of taxation),  which, it was triumphantly proclaimed, would take no more than a  year to create. Furthermore, one in five families in the  republic do not have their own Mercedes as promised.    There is none of this. There is an average wage of 36,500  rubles [R]. There is the desperate need of the collective  farmer, who receives approximately R6,000 per month, to  slaughter his own livestock and "hitchhike" with sheep carcasses  along the Stavropol-Elista-Volgograd highway, selling them at  R20,000 each -- approximately R1,000 per kilogram. Otherwise he  does not have the means with which to buy sugar, salt, candy,  and vodka (he gets everything else, apart from manufactured  goods, from his own kitchen garden and pastures).    Sheep farming and primary wool processing, which account for  80 percent of the republic's total output, have been devastated.  The sheep population has fallen from 3.5 million to 1.5 million  as a result of disease, theft, and forced slaughter.    The catastrophic collapse of the economy and Kalmykia's  total  dependence on federal subsidies (in 1993 they accounted for 86  percent of budget revenue) are Kirsan Ilyumzhinov's main motives  for selling the republic's sovereignty. But there are other  reasons to do with politics and the Criminal Code.    Request for Forgiveness    As head of several dozen private companies, banks, and  exchanges in Russia and abroad, the origin of Ilyumzhinov's  billions in capital is a subject of natural curiosity -- as yet  not fully satisfied beyond a shadow of doubt -- for the media  and, basically, for anyone unsure whether this money has been  honestly acquired.    "The Internal Affairs Ministry and the Security Ministry  spent five months investigating my commercial activity," he told  me. "They found no criminal. Think about it: If I were  involved in some shady business, would I have drawn attention to  myself by running for president? I would have sat quiet and  kept a low profile. Let them continue investigating: I have  nothing to fear."    Yes, it is possible that they will investigate further: The  top Russian leadership has suddenly begun to take a lively  interest in the origin of Ilyumzhinov's capital, although before  it seemed totally unconcerned. A letter from Russian Internal  Affairs Minister Viktor Yerin to Russian First Deputy Economics  Minister Andrey Shapovalyants has appeared in the press. It  said that the Russian Internal Affairs Ministry has discovered  abuses of specially targeted credit worth R14 billion allocated  on preferential terms by the Central Bank to the "Steppe"  Commercial Bank (Kalmykia) to purchase wool. The document  continues:    "In order for Ilyumzhinov to profit from the the illegal use  of credit resources, the "Steppe" Commercial Bank was set up in  the city of Elista, the founders being commercial enterprises  headed by him.... Under the guise of purchasing wool,  Ilyumzhinov and his closest associates secretly converted  money... and subsequently placed it in the accounts of foreign  firms, including 2.5 million in the account of a private  individual in Poland...."    It is unlikely that Ilyumzhinov wants an investigation to be  set in motion. Particularly since the president of Kalmykia  forfeited the trust of the top Russian leadership with his  peacemaking march on the White House to Aleksandr Rutskoy at the  height of the October events.    Thus the springtime efforts by Ilyumzhinov, hastily  surrendering the sovereignty of his republic for use by another  power, look like a request for forgiveness. For political sins.  And for criminal sins, if the president of Kalmykia really is  burdened with such, which no one has the right to say at  present, other than the courts.  <H5>  Direct Speech </H5>   "I will introduce a state of emergency in the republic and  simultaneously announce a moratorium on rallies, demonstrations,  and strikes. I will terminate the activity of all social  movements and organizations and close down many newspapers. I  will adopt an edict on disbanding all political parties, popular  fronts, and movements."    "I propose to introduce an economic dictatorship in  Kalmykia."    "In order to increase production, I will introduce a six-day  working week for the male half of society."    "When our standard of living is twice as high as that of  other regions of Russia, democracy can run the show."  <H5>  "Kalmykia Needs a Khan" </H5>   These public statements by Kirsan Ilyumzhinov are so  definite  and unequivocal that they hardly require any comment. Others,  on the contrary, need to be clarified and explained.    "I have invited Gaydar to become prime minister of Kalmykia  and have received his preliminary consent." (Gaydar has not  consented to take up this post, as he made clear in an  interview).    "We are to conclude agreements with Russia and other CIS  countries on dual taxation." (Dual taxation in tandem with the  republic's planned transformation into an offshore zone is  economic nonsense, as the former cancels out the latter).    "On instructions from Gorbachev, I went to the United States  in 1990 as part of our delegation to discuss the question of  buying grain." (Ilyumzhinov did not take part in this mission  and did not have the official powers to do so).    "I have been invited to take up the post of ambassador to  Japan." (According to information supplied by the Russian  Foreign Ministry, Ilyumzhinov has received no such proposal).    "I have been nominated as mayor of Moscow." (Ilyumzhinov did  not feature on the list of candidates for this post).    "The republic's Internal Affairs Ministry will be equipped  by  France." (According to the Russian Internal Affairs Ministry,  this question can only be considered after the appropriate  accords have been reached between the Russian and French  Governments. The federal Internal Affairs Ministry has no  information on possible supplies of French specialist equipment  to Kalmykia).    These inaccuracies and exaggerations, to put it delicately,  and this self-image -- instilled in the local public -- as a  statesman renowned throughout Russia and the world are explained  by observers in Kalmykia as a symptom of Ilyumzhinov's morbid  vanity: "He wants to be first everywhere. He wants to be the  person whose name day it is, the bridegroom at the wedding, and  the corpse at the funeral."  <H5>  The Constitution Is Up For Sale. But Is Anyone Buying? </H5>   The political market is like any other market: Demand is  formed by supply. But will the center buy the Constitution of  Kalmykia and hand over the billions Ilyumzhinov is demanding in  return?    Experts at the presidential administration's analytical  center recommend that the Russian leadership "not make any  long-term commitments with regard to giving Kalmykia subsidies  and credits from the federal budget, issuing it with export  licenses, and generally making concessions; all financial and  economic relations with the republic should be arranged on a  short-term basis."    The Russian president's press secretary, Vyacheslav  Kostikov,  was also cautious and restrained in his official statement  responding to Ilyumzhinov's initiative: "The Constitution of  the Russian Federation allows the status of a component of the  Russian Federation to be changed only by the mutual consent of  the Federation and the component in question.... The proposal  made by K. Ilyumzhinov, as we are to understand from his words,  deals precisely with the matter of changing the status of the  Republic of Kalmykia. If it is proposed to retain republic  status, however, Kalmykia must have its own constitution in  accordance with the Constitution of the Russian Federation."    Representatives of several Russian republics have spoken  out,  calling the president of Kalmykia "a traitor and an apostate."    In short, Ilyumzhinov's proposal is not yet in broad  political demand. He risks finding himself in isolation.  Wishing to please everyone at once, he may please no one. The  republic will not forgive his treachery (particularly if Moscow  does not give subsidies and credits). The Kremlin will not turn  a blind eye to his mysterious billions and political  vacillation. Then the president of Kalmykia's "world renown,"  of which he never tires of reminding people, will only be  prolonged by his regular visits to the Bulgarian prophetess  Vanga and by his embraces with the Dalai Lama.</p>

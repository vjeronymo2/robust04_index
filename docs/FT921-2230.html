			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Superconductors won't slow down THE NEXT GENERATION of superfast telecommunications and computer equipment will require higher speed components utilising the rules of quantum mechanics and techniques like superconductivity. Sanyo Electric, the Japanese electronics group, has developed what it claims is the world's first superconducting transistor that uses 'tunnel-effect' oxide superconductors. The new device has a theoretical speed 10 times faster than current semiconductors and uses less than one-hundredth as much electricity. It is built around a thin high-temperature superconductor film made of barium potassium bismuth oxide deposited on an oxide semiconductor so that it is only one crystal wide. The film creates a junction in which electrons move under the laws of quantum mechanics, rather than conventional electron flow, resulting in high speeds and low power consumption. Under the 'tunnel-effect' phenomenon electrons are able to 'tunnel' through thin barriers at very high speed in certain conditions. By varying those conditions, the flow of electrons through the transistor can be regulated. Other companies have developed superconducting transistors as well as tunnel-effect semiconductors, but Sanyo says its transistor is the first that is both superconducting and uses tunnel-effect oxides.

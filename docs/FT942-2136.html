			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Barclays calls for business 'Tessas' - In a Nutshell Barclays Bank is calling for the introduction of tax-exempt business savings accounts to promote long-term investment in the small business sector. These business 'Tessas' would operate in the same way as their personal sector equivalent. Businesses could invest retained profits in a special account which would be tax-deductible over a set period (three to five years). The funds could then be used for approved purposes such as capital investment, R&amp;D or training. Barclays' research shows that 78 per cent of businesses prefer retained profits as a source of funding rather than bank overdrafts or venture capital. Some 87 per cent would re-invest more of their profits if the tax system were altered.</p>

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Government gives go-ahead for privatising Railtrack At least 51 per cent of Railtrack, owner of Britain's railway tracks, signalling equipment and stations, will be sold in the life of the present parliament, the government said yesterday. But it drew back from setting a target date for the sell-off. Labour and the Liberal Democrats condemned the plan as a 'hare-brained' scheme likely to destroy the rail network. The Freight Transport Association, whose members account for 90 per cent of rail freight, warned that the rail industry must take more account of the needs of its customers, particularly after the paralysing four-month strike of signal workers in the summer. Mr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, told parliament the timing of the flotation depended on stock market conditions. But everyone would have the opportunity to buy shares, he added. A leaked government memo obtained this week by the Labour party mentioned a target date of the first three months of 1996. The sale of Railtrack is a key element of the government's rail-privatisation programme alongside the franchising of passenger-train operations and the auctioning of three newly created rolling stock leasing companies. Originally, ministers planned to sell Railtrack later in the privatisation programme but franchising has taken longer than expected. Railtrack assets have been notionally valued by the Treasury at Pounds 6.5bn, though City estimates are closer to Pounds 4bn. The company owns more than 10,000 miles of track, 2,500 stations and employs about 12,000 people. Mr Mawhinney said that the flotation would allow more use to be made of private sector skills in managing the network and would encourage investment by Railtrack and independent providers of private capital in upgrading Britain's rail network. The Railways Act of 1993 included powers to privatise the railway network and no further parliamentary approval is needed. Mr Michael Meacher, shadow transport secretary, said the sale had nothing to do with transport policy but was driven 'entirely by the desperate desire . . . to make a quick financial killing to finance Tory tax cuts in time for the next election.' Labour was committed to a publicly owned rail system and would fight privatisation 'tooth and nail'. Investors weigh network's returns, Page 13; Editorial Comment, Page 19; See Lex</p>

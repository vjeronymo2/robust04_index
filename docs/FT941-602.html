			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / International Company News: Kodak chief launches shake-up Mr George Fisher, who took over last December as chairman of Eastman Kodak, the photographic products company, yesterday announced one of his first significant moves to shake up the business - the formation of a new unit to spearhead its involvement in the emerging market for electronic imaging. Mr Fisher, former chief executive of electronics group Motorola, took over at Kodak when unrest over the company's lacklustre earnings led to the resignation of the chairman, Mr Kaye Whitmore. Most of Kodak's photographic earnings come from traditional film, which utilises a chemical process, the sensitivity to light from silver halide salts. However, Kodak has long feared that this business could ultimately be superseded by the rapidly growing market for digital, electronic imaging. Kodak is itself a significant force in electronic imaging - for example in its invention (together with Philips of the Netherlands) of the photo CD system. But critics said that under the previous management they were uncertain as to how much clout the electronic side carried within the group, as well as lines of command. Kodak said yesterday it was forming a separate worldwide unit for digital and applied imaging and was searching outside the company for someone to head the operation. It will initially comprise several existing Kodak businesses - applied imaging, CD imaging, printer products and the company's equipment and software platform centre. Mr Jack Thomas, president of Kodak's imaging group, said 'our traditional businesses will continue to furnish the majority of our earnings for a long time. However, fuelled by digital technology, digital imaging is growing faster than conventional photography'.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Notice No. 581  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> On the basis of the recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contained in the Committee's final report, ATF issued Notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. 581 on February 4, 1986 (51 FR 4392). This notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed the addition of Subpart J, American Grape Variety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Names to Part 4. ATF received 156 written comments in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response to this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In respect to use of Gamay Beaujolais, Notice No. 581  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed that it should be permitted as an alternate grape  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variety name for future use only for a period of five years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the period of its continued use, Notice No. 581  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed that the actual name of the grape, either Pinot noir  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or Napa Gamay, should appear on the label in direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conjunction with the designation ``Gamay Beaujolais.'' After  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the passage of five years, Gamay Beaujolais could no longer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be used as a label designation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Comments to Notice No. 581  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The proposal to phase out  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of Gamay Beaujolais proved controversial. Only three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respondents concurred with ATF's proposal to phase out use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gamay Beaujolais noting that it is not the name of any grape  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variety. Twenty-seven other respondents objected to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal. The consensus among these respondents was that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gamay Beaujolais is well known to consumers as a light red,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> young, fruity wine and that consumers do not view it as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> varietal wine. Several consumers commented that consumer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognition of Gamay Beaujolais is good; that the wine is popular; that consumers know what they are buying; and that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elimination of the designation would serve no consumer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose. Winery proprietors cited the large market for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wine and argued that elimination of the designation would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have a severe economic impact on their business and also on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grape growers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Notice No. 749  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Because the comments on Notice No. 581  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> varied widely in their approach to the proposals, and because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a lengthy period of time had passed since the issuance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice No. 581, ATF decided to open the issue of grape  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> varietal names to additional public comment. Thus, on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> September 3, 1992, ATF issued Notice No. 749 (57 FR 40380),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seeking comment on new and revised proposals relating to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grape variety names. In Notice No. 749, ATF proposed that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Napa Gamay be considered a synonym for the prime name  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Valdiguie and requested comments on whether Napa Gamay should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be phased out in the future. A resolution of the Napa  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gamay-Valdiguie issue will be in a forthcoming Treasury  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision on grape variety names.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The evidence considered by ATF established  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that ``Gamay Beaujolais'' is not a true varietal name, and that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the two grape varieties which have been called ``Gamay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Beaujolais'' in this country are not Gamay grapes. Therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATF has concluded that Gamay Beaujolais should not be listed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Subpart J of 27 CFR Part 4 as a grape variety name. On the basis of the comments to Notice Nos. 581 and 749 and current trade and consumer recognition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the name, ATF instead believes that Gamay Beaujolais is generally known as a type of red wine which may be described as light and fruity. However, ATF believes that many consumers associate the designation ``Gamay Beaujolais'' with a wine produced from the Pinot noir or Napa Gamay grape varieties. Therefore, instead of phasing out the use of the designation ``Gamay Beaujolais'' as proposed by Notice No. 581, ATF is proposing to specifically allow the continued use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gamay Beaujolais under section 4.34.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since only wines produced from the Pinot noir or Napa  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gamay grape varieties have been labeled as ``Gamay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Beaujolais,'' ATF believes that consumers now associate those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two varieties with the designation ``Gamay Beaujolais.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, ATF believes that as part of its effort to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standardize the use of American varietal names, it should no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longer allow the unqualified use of the designation ``Gamay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Beaujolais'' to refer to two separate grape varieties, neither  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of which is a true Gamay grape.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As previously discussed, existing regulations provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a wine is not entitled to a varietal type designation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unless 75 percent of its volume is derived from grapes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that variety. Accordingly, ATF is proposing to allow the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of the designation ``Gamay Beaujolais'' only where the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wine derives not less than 75 percent of its volume from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pinot noir grapes or Napa Gamay grapes. Wine which is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labeled with the designation ``Gamay Beaujolais'' must also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state on the label a varietal type designation (Pinot noir or Napa Gamay) and an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appellation of origin. Furthermore, the proposed amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to section 4.34 specifies that the optional designation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Gamay Beaujolais'' must appear in direct conjunction with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> varietal type designation and the appellation of origin, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall appear in lettering of substantially the same size and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kind.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATF believes that the proposed amendment strikes a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> balance between the views of the opposing commenters on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue. On the one hand, various consumers and winery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proprietors have commented that consumer recognition of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designation ``Gamay Beaujolais'' is good, and that winery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proprietors should not be forced to abandon its use. On the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other hand, it has been pointed out that ``Gamay Beaujolais''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not an accurate varietal designation, and the purpose of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the varietal grape regulations is to ensure that the consumer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not misled as to the actual grape varieties used in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production of wine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATF believes that allowing the use of the optional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designation ``Gamay Beaujolais'' in direct conjunction with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actual varietal type designation (Pinot noir or Napa Gamay),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as well as an appellation of origin reflecting the true  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> origin of the grapes, will not be confusing or misleading to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumers. The proposed amendment will authorize labels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which clearly inform the consumer about the actual grape variety used to make the wine, and the origin of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the grapes, while still allowing winery proprietors to use a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> label designation which has gained widespread consumer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognition in this country.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Public Participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ATF requests comments from all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interested persons concerning the proposed wine designation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments received on or before the closing date will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carefully considered. Comments received after that date will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be given the same consideration if it is practical to do so,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but assurance of consideration cannot be given except as to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments received on or before the closing date. ATF will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not recognize any material in comments as confidential.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments may be disclosed to the public. Any material which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a respondent considers to be confidential or inappropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for disclosure to the public should not be included in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments. The name of any person submitting a comment is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exempt from disclosure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any interested person who desires an opportunity to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment orally at a public hearing on the proposed regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should submit his or her request, in writing, to the Director  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the 90-day comment period. The Director, however,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reserves the right to determine, in light of all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances, whether a public hearing will be held.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

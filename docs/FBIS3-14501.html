			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Riyad Mansur in Amman] </F>   [Text] The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine  [PFLP] has set three basic conditions for 'Arafat's continuing  as PLO leader in accordance with a national consensus.    Speaking on behalf of the George Habash-led PFLP, Political  Bureau member 'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh said the conditions are:  admitting failure in assuming his political and national  responsibilities, renouncing the Oslo and Cairo agreements, and  apologizing to the Palestinian people.    Malluh, who represented the PFLP in the PLO Executive  Committee before he withdrew to protest the Madrid conference,  told SAWT AL-SHA'b that if 'Arafat fails to meet these  conditions he should leave the leadership immediately.    Malluh said 'Arafat now has a last chance to respond to the  conditions of the Palestinian national forces, adding that while  there is still time left to carry out these conditions, this  time is narrowing day after day.    Malluh said the Palestinian opposition is now more confident  of its position now, noting that what is taking place in the  occupied territory belies the miserable option of the PLO's  negotiating wing.    While expressing the Palestinian opposition's confidence in  its position, Malluh strongly criticized it for its inability to  unify its forces on joint issues and voiced regret for the  absence of a unified strategy for these forces.    Malluh said that despite the failure to unify the opposition  forces, there is a joint political base represented by  opposition to the Oslo and Cairo agreements and the need to  continue the intifadah and the struggle against the occupation.    Answering a question, Malluh said the democratic forces have  many concerns and that the two fronts' [PFLP and the Democratic  Front for the Liberation of Palestine] joint leadership has a  unified strategy to face the dangers of the imposed settlement,  which is threatening the national cause with liquidation.</p>

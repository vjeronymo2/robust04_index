			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, March 3 (AFP) -- A controversial 1991  European Union regulation that television channels must  broadcast a majority of European programmes is being largely  respected, the European Commission said here Thursday [3 March].    It released a survey showing that 70 of 105 channels -- 66  percent -- had obeyed the directive, which states that more than  50 percent of programmes excluding sport and news must be  provided by European producers.    Among those not meeting the directive, a Commission  spokesman  named several satellite channels in Britain and a cable channel  in France.    The Commission is preparing a report on the directive and  possible modifications before October this year.</p>

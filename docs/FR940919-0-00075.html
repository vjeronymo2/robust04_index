			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> D. Incorporation of Newly Listed Wastes Into Lab Packs and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Changes to Appendices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> On June 1, 1990 (55 FR 22629), EPA promulgated alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment standards under 40 CFR 268.42(c) for waste codes listed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in 40 CFR 268 Appendix IV and V that are placed in lab packs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These alternative standards are legally constructed, in part, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``specified methods of treatment'' because of physical difficulties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in measuring compliance with numerical standards for these multi- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coded waste forms (i.e., compliance is complicated by the fact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that many lab packs are comprised of hundreds of small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containers, each with different organic or organo-metallic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemicals in them, making it difficult to accurately sample  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment residues for those organics). In the January, 1991,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correction notice and again in the May 30, 1991, Advance Notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Proposed Rulemaking (56 FR 24453), the Agency requested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment on potential improvements to these alternative standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's original intent in establishing two separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appendices was to distinguish between those lab packs containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organo-metallics (Appendix IV) and those containing only organics  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Appendix V). As such, lab packs containing organo-metallics  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Appendix IV) were expected to need stabilization after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performing the specified method of treatment, INCIN (i.e.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incineration), while Appendix V lab packs only needed to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incinerated. However, under 40 CFR 268.42(c)(4), all treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residues of either type of lab pack also had to comply with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards for the extraction procedure (EP) for metals, i.e.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D004, D005, D006, D007, D008, D010, and D011. (D009 is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in this list because most mercury-bearing wastes were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excluded from the use of the alternative standards in both of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these Appendices.) As such, if metals were concentrated in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residues from the incineration of an Appendix V lab pack and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resultant residues then exhibited one of the characteristics for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EP metals, these residues would also have had to be stabilized to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comply with the appropriate treatment standard for metals. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such a case, there was no practical difference between Appendix  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IV and Appendix V lab packs in terms of the treatment that was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The majority of the comments received from the regulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community supported the Agency's proposed approach. In this final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule EPA is, therefore, replacing Appendix IV and Appendix V with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a new Appendix IV. In order to simplify the new Appendix IV it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only contains those wastes excluded from lab packs. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following wastes are excluded from lab packs (and appear in new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix IV) for the purpose of using the alternative lab pack  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment standard in 40 CFR 268.42(c): D009, F019, K003, K004,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> K005, K006, K062, K071, K100, K106, P010, P011, P012, P076, P078,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U134, U151.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In today's rule, EPA is also stating that the alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment standard for lab packs applies to the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional waste codes that were previously not included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix IV or V: wastes for which treatment standards were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgated in the LDR Phase I rule August 1, 1992 (57 FR 37194),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and wastes (including TC organic wastes) for which treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards are promulgated in this final rule. Today's rule does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not list these as excluded waste codes in the new Appendix IV.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a matter of clarification, the alternative treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard for lab packs is INCIN. This required combustion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology combined with the requirements of 40 CFR 268.42(c)(4)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ash residues are treated to meet the characteristic metals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment standards), will ensure that all underlying hazardous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituents present in characteristic wastes (other than those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excluded in the new Appendix IV), will be treated. The use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this alternative lab pack standard negates the requirement to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitor for, or comply with, the UTS for underlying hazardous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organic constituents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For reasons outlined in the June 1, 1990 final rule, mercury  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes were excluded from this alternative standard for lab  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> packs. Mercury is considered a ``volatile metal'' which may lead  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to excessive air emissions in some combustion devices when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present in large quantities. Mercury is also very difficult to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stabilize if present in ash residues in large quantities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters did not provide any justifiable technical reason for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA to modify its position with respect to mercury wastes, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thus these wastes shall remain excluded from this alternative lab  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pack treatment standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> E. Changes in the LDR Program in Response to the LDR Roundtable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> EPA convened a roundtable meeting on January 12&hyph;14, 1993 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discuss the LDR program. The purpose of the roundtable was for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA to hear suggestions on improvements to the LDR program from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> persons who implement it. Participants included representatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of hazardous waste generators, treaters, and disposers; public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest groups; state environmental agencies; EPA regional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offices; and other federal agencies. EPA is today promulgating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several recommendations made by roundtable participants. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency is consolidating the three existing treatment standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tables into one table, and is simplifying notification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements and reducing paperwork, as discussed below. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, as discussed in an earlier section of this preamble,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Agency is also promulgating universal treatment standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, the Agency is committed to continue to identify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ways the LDR program can be simplified. Additional opportunities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for such streamlining will be explored in future LDR rulemakings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 1. Consolidated Treatment Table  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Several of the groups present at the LDR roundtable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expressed an interest in having a consolidated treatment standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> table in the regulations. Participants stated that the existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system of three separate tables at 40 CFR 268.41&hyph;268.43 was too  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complex and burdensome. In its September 14, 1993 notice, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed a single consolidated table of treatment standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments on the table were favorable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today, EPA is replacing the three existing treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard tables with the consolidated table, called ``Treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standards for Hazardous Waste'' and placing it at &sect;268.40 along  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with much of the text found currently in &sect;&sect;268.41&hyph;268.43.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 268.42 continues to describe the technology codes, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulate California list PCBs and HOCs, to set out exemptions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the required methods, and to provide procedures for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalency determinations. The numerical treatment standards in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the consolidated table are identical to the UTS promulgated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> today's rule with the exception of characteristic metal wastes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reformatting &sect;&sect;268.40&hyph;268.43 also corrects a confusing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aspect of the way the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeared for some time. The ``No Land Disposal'' treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards that have appeared at &sect;268.43 will be deleted from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations and should no longer appear in the CFR. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment standards have not been in effect since 1990, when the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LDR Third Third rule set treatment standards for these wastes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that were expressed as either methods of treatment or numerical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards that now appear in the consolidated treatment standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> table &sect;268.40. It was only a drafting oversight that made these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``No Land Disposal'' standards continue to appear in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations, and today's rule corrects this mistake. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

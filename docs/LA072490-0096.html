			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> BRAHMS AND PREMIERES AT CABRILLO FEST  </P> <P> No fewer than nine premieres enlivened the weekend concerts at the 28th  Cabrillo Music Festival. Yet, what dominated the musical landscape, after these  programs had been given, were performances of music by Brahms.  </P> <P> In both cases, Ursula Oppens happened to be the pianist of these performances  -- of the Second Piano Concerto on Friday night and the Variations and Fugue on  a Theme by Handel on Saturday evening. If neither of Oppens' readings turned  out definitive, or even hair-raising, they both at least had solidity and  seriousness in their favor. And the large-scale works by themselves commanded  the ear and our attention.  </P> <P> At the Friday Festival Orchestra concert, conductor Dennis Russell Davies and  his game colleagues disappointed with a one-dimensional run-through of the  B-flat Concerto -- a reading full of spirit but lacking Brahmsian detail and  contrast.  </P> <P> Oppens played respectably, but failed in nobility and authority -- she  struggled where she should have reigned.  </P> <P> Proving once again his gift for making provocative programs, music director  Davies preceded Brahms with three reported West Coast premieres.  </P> <P> "Preambulo" by the Puerto Rican composer Roberto Sierra (born 1953) turned out  to be a showy and brilliant overture, and a highly eclectic mix of 20th-Century  styles not unlike many film scores -- and just as forgettable.  </P> <P> A revival of the Violin Concerto in G (1772) by the West Indian Joseph  Boulogne, Chevalier de Saint-Georges, became a happy vehicle to display once  again the accomplishments of Romuald Tecco, longtime concertmaster of this  festival. Through all technical hurdles -- and a most affecting and probing and  Mozartean slow movement -- the patrician, virtuosic Tecco excelled, seconded  lovingly by his orchestral colleagues.  </P> <P> Oppens was the able soloist in "Kabiosile," Tania Leon's six-minute scherzo, a  vehement statement of exotic aspect.  </P> <P> Saturday night, in a characteristically Californian setting -- a church in a  shopping center immediately off a freeway ramp -- Oppens gave one of the most  fascinating recital programs imaginable. She was hampered by an acoustical  situation hostile to resonance, but she triumphed anyway.  </P> <P> In Resurrection Church in Aptos (south of Santa Cruz), Oppens offered an agenda  beginning with Stravinsky's urbane and still-wondrous Sonata (1924).  </P> <P> There were other, deeper revelations here: the emotional context and Russian  heritage shared by the Four Studies, Opus 7, by Stravinsky, and Rachmaninoff's  "Etudes-Tableaux," Opus 33, written in 1911; the open-heartedness of Brahms'  variations, Opus 24, in contrast to the mechanistic devices of Nancarrow's  robotic "Two Canons for Ursula" (1989).  </P> <P> In the same hall Saturday afternoon, five works from the California Composers  Project were unveiled by the Festival Orchestra.  </P> <P> The players' patience was sorely tried with this event. Only Charles Shere's  spare but gloomy Concerto for Violin and Harp, Percussion and Small Orchestra  (1985) deserved such a showcase.  </P> <P> Shere's brooding and intense concerto, an essay in small, telling musical  gestures, occupies its 15 minutes engagingly. It was performed sensitively by  violinist Beni Shinohara, solidly accompanied by the orchestra led by Ken  Harrison.  </P> <P> The weekend also included the festival's annual trek to San Juan Bautista for  two concerts that did not exactly live up to the promise: "Masterpieces at the  Mission."  </P> <P> William Schuman's pre-World War II paean to American optimism, the  now-embarrassingly-dated Third Symphony (1941) received a linear,  conviction-rich reading, and the Festival Orchestra came close to making this  cloying work as noble as many wish it were.  </P> <P> The resourceful, vigorous players were even more successful in ennobling two  recent works by North Americans, Henry Brant's post-impressionistic "The Desert  Forests," (1983) and Philip Glass' "The Light" (1987).  </P> <P> "The Light," the composer's first large-orchestra work, plays with colorful and  granitic chords, flashes of melodic interplay and shifting harmonies for 23  engaging minutes. In Davies' evocative performance, the work progresses from  lyrical introspection to triumphal catharsis with a sense of inevitability.  </P> <P> Three virtuosos -- violist Hans Brunig, cellist Othello Liesmann and bassist  Wolfgang Guttler -- make up the novel ensemble, Trio Basso, which brought its  unconventional repertory to the Mission Sunday afternoon.  </P> <P> They failed to prove that their low-voiced combination is a charming or sexy  one. Indeed, in recent works by Wolfgang Rihn, Manfred Niehaus, Rolf Riehm and  Hans-Joachim Hespos, they proved only that a little musical violence, some  comedic archness and a lot of aural space between notes can be just as tedious  as academic exercises.  </P> <P> Heavy-handed humor became the strongest element in this competently performed  concert.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN FILES CLASS-ACTION SUIT OVER DIET SYSTEM  </P> <P> A 38-year-old Ventura woman has filed a class-action suit against Nutri-System  Inc., claiming that her gall bladder had to be removed after she lost 34 pounds  in 18 weeks on the company's diet program.  </P> <P> Nancy Alyne Kirkham's suit filed in Ventura County Superior Court claims that  Nutri-System caused her to lose weight too quickly, which led to gall bladder  disease. The suit accuses Nutri-System of falsely advertising itself as a safe  way to lose weight.  </P> <P> It also claims that Nutri-System officials knew about a link between too-rapid  weight loss and gall bladder disease and should have warned her and other  customers about it.  </P> <P> The suit asks for an injunction to force the company to put warnings on its  product labels, and it seeks unspecified damages that could reach into the  millions, said Kirkham's attorney, Louis M. Marlin.  </P> <P> Nutri-System officials and Chief Executive Officer Donald McCulloch Jr. could  not be reached Tuesday evening for comment. In the face of earlier criticism  alleging that the program causes overly swift weight loss, Nutri-System  officials have said the program is medically safe.  </P> <P> Citing a CBS News report last month, Marlin said more than 200 people  nationwide have sued Nutri-System. They alleged that they contracted gall  bladder disease while using the company's products.  </P> <P> But he said Kirkham's suit is the first in the country to seek a court's  designation as a class action against Nutri-System on behalf of an untold  number of potential plaintiffs.  </P> <P> The suit seeks to include anyone who used Nutri-System since the company was  founded July 18, 1979, and who later contracted gall bladder disease, Marlin  said. He said he has been approached by nine people seeking to join the suit  since it was filed Friday.  </P> <P> Marlin said Kirkham began using Nutri-System in December to try to trim her  weight from 216 to 155. Kirkham spent $99 in initiation fees and more than  $1,200 for 19 weeks' worth of Nutri-System foods and began losing weight  rapidly as she substituted the food for her regular fare, Marlin said.  </P> <P> By early April, Kirkham had slimmed down to 182 pounds, losing an average of 2  1/2 to 3 pounds per week, Marlin said.  </P> <P> But one night in February while watching television, Kirkham suffered stabbing  abdominal pains, Marlin said. Believing she was just feeling stress, she took  Tylenol and went to bed, and the pains were gone by morning, he said.  </P> <P> In early April, Kirkham suffered another bout with abdominal pain, which again  subsided after she took pain killers and went to bed for the night, he said.  </P> <P> Then June 12, abdominal pains struck again, leaving Kirkham doubled over on the  floor of her home, unable to stand, Marlin said.  </P> <P> On June 22, Kirkham was admitted to Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura,  where doctors removed her gall bladder, including a gallstone the diameter of a  quarter, Marlin said. Although Kirkham lost eight weeks' work while recovering  from surgery, she might not suffer any long-term damage from the removal of the  organ, Marlin said.  </P></p>

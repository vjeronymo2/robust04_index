			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zou Aiguo (6760 1947 0948)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 10 May (XINHUA) -- Economics, science and  technology, and laws are three important factors behind today's  social development. More than 200 Chinese and foreign  specialists, scholars, and entrepreneurs gathered in Beijing  today to attend a four-day international conference on  integrating and developing economics, science and technology,  and laws.    The main theme of the conference, which is jointly sponsored  by the China Association for Science and Technology and the  Chinese Society of International Economic, Scientific and  Technological, and Legal Personnel, is to study and explore the  operational mechanisms for integrating and developing the  economic, scientific and technological, and legal fields; to  search for ways to groom and train interdisciplinary personnel  suited to these efforts; to further promote economic prosperity,  scientific and technological advancement, and the sound  development of laws; to increase exchanges and cooperation  between specialists and scholars in various countries; and to  advance social development and progress.    Chen Muhua and Li Ximing, vice chairpersons of the National  People's Congress Standing Committee, attended the opening  ceremony this morning.    This was the first time that an international conference of  interdisciplinary personnel from a wide range of fields was held  in our country. Chinese and foreign specialists and scholars  submitted 65 academic papers to the conference. The papers show  that they share this common understanding: The integration and  development of economics, science and technology, and laws is a  very important research project. Science and technology are the  motive forces for social progress, the economy is the foundation  of social development, and laws are guarantees for social  progress. The integration and simultaneous development of these  three aspects represent a general trend in today's social  development.    In his speech, Justice Minister Xiao Yang said: The  convocation of this international conference will facilitate the  efforts to explore the operational mechanisms for integrating  economics, science and technology, and laws; to search for ways  to groom and train interdisciplinary personnel; and to promote  academic services, peace, and development in the world.  Moreover, it will benefit contacts and exchanges between people  in economic, scientific and technological, legal, and business  circles in various countries, thereby creating conditions for  forging effective links and cooperation in the future.    In his speech, Zou Yu, president of the Chinese Society of  International Economic, Scientific and Technological, and Legal  Personnel, said: The present-day world is characterized by very  close economic contacts between various countries and regions,  and by an extremely rapid pace of interaction between the  economy on the one hand and science and technology on the other.  The development of these two fields should be guaranteed by  law, and it is increasingly urgent to coordinate and harmonize  various laws. This dictates long-term exchanges and cooperation  between specialists and scholars in various countries in  carrying out strenuous, in-depth exploration and studies in a  joint effort to promote social progress and development.    Attending the conference are more than 60 economic,  scientific and technological, and legal specialists and scholars  from such countries and regions as Germany, Canada, the United  States, Australia, and Austria.</p>

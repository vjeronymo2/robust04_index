			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Insurers given credit for fall in ships lost THE NUMBER of ships being lost at sea is falling thanks to pressure from insurers on owners of older ships to improve safety standards, marine underwriters said yesterday. Figures issued by the Institute of London Underwriters show that 111 ships were lost last year compared with 182 in 1991 and 144 in 1990. Tonnage lost fell to 1.08m tons compared with 1.74m in 1991 and 1.36m in 1990. The total cost to insurers will exceed Dollars 500m (Pounds 330m), though final figures are not yet available. The institute, in its annual commentary on the marine insurance market, said the fall reflected a vigorous campaign by insurers against 'older, unsafe tonnage'. Underwriters have begun to discriminate against 'sub-standard' ships by making insurance dependent on owners carrying out thorough structural surveys of their vessels and implementing recommended changes. Insurers are also charging additional premiums for cargo carried in older vessels. More than 85 per cent of all ships lost last year were more than 15 years old, with tankers and bulk carriers particularly vulnerable. The institute said the value of passenger vessel and ferry losses could 'finally prove to be the highest for some years'. The figures also indicate that ships flying so-called 'flags of convenience' tend to sink more easily. Just under a third of the total tonnage lost was registered in Panama, for example. The fall in claims has been accompanied by a rise in premium rates as insurers respond to their losses of recent years, leading to a recovery in the marine insurance market.</p>

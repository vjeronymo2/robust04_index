			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Russia hit by delay in energy payments The Russian government yesterday announced a payments crisis in the energy sector, which threatened 'to paralyse' both domestic and export deliveries. The energy ministry's Infotek information service said that 'the total of non-payments has taken on such proportions that in the near future. . . it could completely paralyse economic activity on the part of energy sector enterprises.' January production of oil and gas condensate was down to 6.5m barrels per day - a fall of 10.1 per cent on the previous January's output. Mr Alexander Shokhin, a moderate reformer who yesterday appeared to be struggling to continue market reform in an inhospitable environment, said that among three different strategies being considered for economic reform, the proposal for price controls, at least on 'natural monopolies' such as rail traffic, electricity supply and other services, was most appealing. The non-payments crisis, affecting in particular such basic industries as coal and steel, has been hugely aggravated by the uncontrolled and steep price rises brought in by the railways and the electricity companies, on whose services the basic industries depend. The independent miners' union yesterday again threatened action because of delays of months in payments to their members - a constant feature of the past few months. The former Soviet republics, still supplied by Russia at below world prices, are among the largest debtors. The gas monopoly Gasprom said yesterday that while it was working flat out supplying Russia and the 'near abroad,' it had received almost no payments for January and had sent 'final demands' to the governments of Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova. These three countries, all without significant energy resources except coal, owe many billions of roubles to the Russian energy suppliers - with Ukraine alone owing over Rbs1,000bn for gas deliveries. Gasprom told the official Itar-Tass news agency that payments were outstanding from Ukraine and Belarus for just under half of the gas supplied to the beginning of January, and for nearly 90 per cent of that supplied to Moldova. Mr Vyacheslav Kebich, the Belorussian prime minister, underscored the urgency of the energy issue facing his country when he said that 'if energy prices in Russia and Belarus are not kept the same, then I will not sign the agreement to merge the two countries' monetary systems.' The draft agreement, which Mr Shokhin said could be signed next week, would effectively re-integrate Belarus' economy back into Russia. The cost to Russia of such a deal would probably be the conversion of the devalued Belarussian currency into roubles at an unfavourable rate, the supply of cheap energy and the opening of credit lines to Belarussian industries. Mr Shokhin spent much of yesterday meeting three groups of economists, all of whom proposed wages and price controls and more state intervention.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Leonel Perez Moya from Guantanamo Province for </F> the "Exclusive" program -- live or recorded]    [Text] The Eastern Army forces maintain their combat  readiness to quickly and effectively repel any offensive action  from the Yankee Marines posted at the Naval base in Guantanamo  Bay. This statement was made today in the mountains by Division  General Ramon Espinoza Martin, chief of the Eastern Army, upon  concluding a tour of FAR [Revolutionary Armed Forces] military  units and agrarian and livestock enterprises in Guantanamo  Province.    Div. Gen. Espinoza remarked that increases in military  personnel and combat measures have recently been observed in the  U.S. military enclave, where maneuvers were carried out early  this month and where there has been an increase in the arrival  of ships and aircraft.    These movements may reflect preparations for a possible  military invasion of Haiti. If this action takes place, it will  worsen tensions in the Caribbean region, so FAR must be alert  for any eventuality, Div. Gen. Espinoza said.    The visit began at the Antonio Maceo Border Guard Brigade,  which is in charge of protecting the line of demarcation with  the Yankee base. The visitors were able to observe the high  morale that prevails among the fighters, who each day become  more alert and prepared to reject any aggression.</p>

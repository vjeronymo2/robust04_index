			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Annuities The average annual inflation rate over the past decade stands at 5.25 per cent, so August's 2.4 per cent might appear relatively low, writes Peter Quinton, of the Annuity Bureau. But those approaching retirement need to consider the most effective way to protect annuity income against inflation. Some protection can be achieved by choosing an escalating annuity. This guarantees a selected annual increase of 3 per cent, 5 per cent, 8.5 per cent (which can be subject to Inland Revenue restrictions) or, alternatively, in accordance with the retail prices index. A comparison with last week's table listing level annuity rates shows the first year's payments for escalating annuities is considerably lower. Over time, however, income will outstrip what would be achieved through a level annuity - particularly if the annuitant anticipates living beyond the average life expectancy - 78 for a man aged 65 and 82 for a 65-year old female.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LATEST ANNUITY RATES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Compulsory purchase annuity  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Male age 55             Annuity     Female age 50              Annuity    Escalating at 5% pa    (Pds)        Escalating at 5% pa       (Pds)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Royal Life             6,617.88     Prudential                5,475.96 Prudential             6,598.20     Royal Life                5,416.65 Sun Life of Canada     6,463.56     Sun Life of Canada        5,259.04  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Male age 60             Annuity     Female age 60              Annuity    Escalating at 5% pa    (Pds)        Escalating at 5% pa       (Pds)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Royal Life             7,618.75     Royal Life                6,720.37 Prudential             7,469.76     Prudential                6,557.88 Canada Life            7,366.68     Sun Life of Canada        6,359.92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Male age 70             Annuity     Female age 70              Annuity    Escalating at 3% pa    (Pds)        Escalating at 3% pa       (Pds)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- RNPFN                 12,328.92     Royal Life               10,534.45 Royal Life            12,288.20     RNPFN                    10,350.84 Canada Life           12,113.40     Canada Life              10,235.40  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Joint Life - 100% spouse's benefit  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Male 60/Female 57       Annuity     Male 65/Female 63          Annuity    Escalating at 5% pa    (Pds)        Escalating at 5% pa       (Pds)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Royal Life             5,741.87     Royal Life                6,565.24 Prudential             5,735.88     Prudential                6,420.60 Sun Life of Canada     5,540.96     Canada Life               6,339.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- All payments are monthly in arrears, without a guarantee period.

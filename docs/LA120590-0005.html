			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAY INCREASES FOR FEDERAL RETIREES  </P> <P> I take exception to Keith's remarks "that the average federal pensioner is  getting double dips and triple scoops, all of them with COLAs like me."  </P> <P> Very few are getting Social Security. Social Service retirees receive COLAs.  Why not federal retirees?  </P> <P> I do not believe, however, that all individuals should be eligible for Social  Security benefits; if they have an income over a certain amount, they should  not receive Social Security.  </P> <P> JOHN R. RUDDELL  </P> <P> San Pedro  </P></p>

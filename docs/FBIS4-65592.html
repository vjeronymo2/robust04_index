			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, May 18 (A.A.) -- Orhan Tasanlar was  reinstated as Ankara security director today, after being  removed following the roughing up of May Day celebrators and a  deputy by the police on May 1.    After assuming his post in the morning, Tasanlar told the  Anatolian Agency that Turkey was a state of law and everything  took place before the public.    `The inspectors concluded their interrogation and could not  find any element of crime against me,' he said. `There, the  state was destroyed. What I regretted most was the fact that  the police were injured and state vehicles were destroyed in the  incidents which broke out on May Day and no one mentioned this.'    Interior Minister Nahit Mentese had removed Tasanlar from  his  position temporarily after calls from the government's junior  coalition partner Social Democratic Populist Party (SHP) for an  investigation into the charges of police brutality.</p>

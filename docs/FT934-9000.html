			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Shell Last week's results from BP set the market expecting something of a gusher from Royal Dutch/Shell as well. It should perhaps have known better. Without BP's gearing, Shell is less well-placed to benefit from economic recovery. With its strong presence in the Far East it was less affected by the recession in the first place. But its lack of a recovery story leaves investors plenty of time to dwell on the impact of weak oil prices, especially as its high volume winter season looms. Strip out the tax credits and Shell's earnings from exploration and production actually fell in the third quarter. Strip out the currency effect and margins look distinctly weak. Not only is the crude price to blame. There is not much sign of Shell's much vaunted cost-cutting showing through. The oil price played to Shell's advantage further downstream in manufacturing and marketing. But it will be lucky to escape having to pass on some of this benefit soon. While a large part of the Pounds 171m charged against chemical profits reflects the environmental clean-up at Rocky Mountain Arsenal, restructuring charges continue apace, again without much sign of benefit showing through. Part of Shell's problem may simply be its very strength. With no debt problem, the need for cost-cutting was less urgent than at BP. At around 10 per cent, its return on capital is already higher. But since Shell Transport has out-performed Exxon by over 20 per cent this year, the market is looking for growth which so far seems elusive.</p>

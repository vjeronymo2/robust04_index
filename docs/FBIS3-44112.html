A Lesotho Government spokesman said all  attempts to get the warring factions around the table had failed.    Mr. Pik Botha, South Africa's foreign minister, says that at  this stage he is not considering sending the military into  Lesotho, but that South African soldiers are being deployed  along the border to monitor events. Mr. Botha emphasized that  South Africa would not recognize a new Lesotho Government that  came into power by a coup, adding that South Africa will even  consider imposing sanctions against it.    [Begin Botha recording in English] There may be politics  behind this. There may even be an attempted coup behind the  present trouble in Lesotho and that is why I made it clear to  the Lesotho people, and to the defense force, that this  government will under no circumstances recognize any government  that comes into being in there in an irregular fashion, and  particularly through violence, and that we would close the  border. And that we would take other steps, which we can take,  we can withhold funds from the customs pool which will make it  impossible for a government that takes over by force, to govern  that country successfully. [end recording]    Storm clouds hung over Maseru today, but for local residents  the sound of thunder was a welcome relief from the sound of  machine gunfire. Five soldiers have been killed since the  fighting broke out 10 days ago. Schools in the capital were  closed today and some shops and government offices closed early  today. The last sound of gunfire died down at about 0000 GMT  this morning, but there are rumors that renewed fighting could  break out by tomorrow morning. Foreign embassies in Maseru are  monitoring the situation closely and some are ready to evacuate  their members if fighting resumes.    [Begin Gerhard Visser, South African Ambassador to Lesotho  recording] I spoke to my staff members -- some of them have been  here for about three years -- they told me that the present  troubled situation is much worse than the previous coup in 1990  when General Ramaema overthrew General Lekhanya. Because the  present situation is so unpredictable it is really very  difficult to make decisions without causing any panic within the  South African Community here. [end recording]    Soldiers from the Royal Lesotho Defense Force headquarters  took up positions in the hills just south of Maseru late today  and are believed to be waiting for the soldiers from the  Makoanyane barracks to make the next move. Mr. Leeiso Serutle,  principal secretary of the Ministry of Information and  Broadcasting, said today that until the two factions talked to  the government they won't know what the fighting is really about.    [Begin Serutle recording in English] They wanted to take the  government by force, and I'm not quite clear whether this is  true or not. But, yes, your guess is as good as mine. [end  recording]</p>

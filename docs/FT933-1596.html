			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Pension split could mar Ashdown address MR PADDY ASHDOWN will today seek to sum up his party's conference in a speech warning representatives that too much is riding on the Liberal Democrats for them to throw away their present opportunities by acting irresponsibly. 'The message will be that we have won people's hope, now we must win their trust, their confidence,' one party strategist said yesterday. 'It's about turning potential into reality.' Just before Mr Ashdown speaks the conference will have faced what the leadership sees as the most serious test this week of its political maturity, when it considers a paper which would cut back its commitment to spending on pensioners. A split is inevitable, with an amendment to the paper Retirement with Dignity being put forward by Mr Archy Kirkwood, the party's social security spokesman. At the general election the party promised to uprate pensions in line with earnings, but the new policy paper proposes instead uprating the basic pension in line with prices, and targeting extra help at those most in need. Mr Kirkwood's proposal would restore the commitment to the earnings link. The leadership is said to regard this vote as critical, as a continuing pledge to link pensions with earnings could turn out to be unrealistic unless the party commits itself to higher taxes. Party officials say that the decision today will also affect the way in which policy on benefits more generally is developed. In particular, a vote against the targeted approach on pensions will limit the policymakers' freedom of manoeuvre in proposing targeted rather than universal benefits in other areas such as child support. Mr Ashdown's speech will underline to representatives that to make the most of their recent successes and be taken seriously, the party must face up to some difficult choices in the spending commitments it takes on. He will also use his speech to put forward new ideas about international peacekeeping and peace-making, and is expected to deal extensively with what is happening in Bosnia.</p>

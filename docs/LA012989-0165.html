			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> SIX HUTU FREED DESPITE ACCUSATIONS  </P> <P> The Burundi government freed six people who last year accused the army of  summarily executing Hutu tribe members during ethnic clashes, a state-owned  radio reported Friday.  </P> <P> Radio Burundi, in a broadcast monitored in Nairobi, did not identify the six  people it said were released Thursday, but did say that they belonged to the  majority Hutu tribe.  </P> <P> In August, Hutu in two northern communities of this East African nation  attacked Tutsi neighbors.  </P> <P> The predominantly Tutsi army was sent to restore order but turned against the  Hutu. At least 5,000 people died and an estimated 50,000 fled to neighboring  Rwanda.  </P> <P> Government opponents say 17 people were arrested for accusing the army of the  executions in a letter last year to President Pierre Buyoya of Burundi. The  radio denied that charge.  </P></p>

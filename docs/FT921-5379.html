			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / 24 big companies back Olympics bid MANCHESTER'S bid to stage the Olympics in the year 2000 will be backed by 24 leading companies in the region. These include Amec, Coats Viyella, Granada TV, Johnson Group, Kellogg, Littlewoods, Manchester Airport and Pilkington. The bid, which was last week given government backing of Pounds 55m, was officially launched in Manchester yesterday. The Duke of Westminster, who is leading the city's bid, said the companies were ready to support Manchester as the site for the summer games. The private sector has so far contributed Pounds 1m towards the Pounds 5m needed to mount the bid and must now match Pounds 2m given by the government as part of last week's package. The logo for the bid was presented at the launch, which was staged by Granada TV in a dancing blaze of coloured laser lights which merged to form a flickering representation of red, white and blue Olympic flames. A flood of merchandising - from T-shirts and coffee mugs to lapel pins and car stickers - was also released. Apart from supporting the bid, initial government funding is to go towards an arena for events such as gymnastics, a national velodrome for cycling, and preparing the site for a Pounds 170m stadium. The business leadership team has long favoured a national stadium in the north as a potential economic generator. The government is committed to spending about Pounds 360m if Manchester's bid succeeds. The rest of the Pounds 1bn estimated cost would have to come from the private sector.</p>

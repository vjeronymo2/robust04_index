			<p>BFN     [Text] Wuhan, May 25 (XINHUA) -- Mikerf Woerinsd, a World  Bank adviser, said that the equipment and the technology for  producing iodized-salt in central China's Hubei Province have  reached world advanced level.    He made the remark after heading a four-member delegation,  entrusted by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) to  investigate the salt industry in Yingcheng city and Yunmeng  county of Hubei, in the middle of this month.    The two areas are ideal centres for producing iodized salt,  according to the mission. The two areas should expand projects  for producing edible iodized salt, in a bid to meet the demands  for iodized salt of China's 450 million people in the country's  iodine-deficient areas and help China to realize its target to  wipe out completely by the year 2000 all the diseases caused by  iodine deficiency.    Hubei is one of China's leading producers of salt from  mines,  and most of Hubei's salt production centers are located in areas  between Yingcheng city and Yunmeng county.    Along areas between these two, there are ten large and  medium- sized salt-making enterprises, producing 2.1 million  tons of crude salt a year.    Hubei began production of iodized salt in the 1960s.</p>

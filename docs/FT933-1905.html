			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Crisis in Russia: Crisis tests the loyalty of a disaffected army MR Boris Yeltsin has taken care to pay court to, and be photographed with, elite divisions of troops stationed near to Moscow in the past two weeks. He declared, on one of these visits, that he would 'work with the military', one day out of every month. It is now obvious why this attention was lavished on a group which had felt - and probably still feels - out in the cold. The Russian Army - the successor to the Soviet Army - has shrunk faster than any military force not demobilised from war and has suffered a precipitous decline in prestige, to the point where thousands of (especially young) officers are resigning their commissions. It is so limited in its supplies that training flights are disallowed, firing practice is curtailed and there have even been cases of starvation reported in the Pacific Fleet. An army under such pressure may be a dangerous army and may also be a disloyal one. Its first response was standard. The head of the Defence Ministry information service, General Vladimir Kosyrev, said last night that the 'armed forces of the Russian Federation in all its actions would be guided only by the constitution and the laws of the country and would above all observe strict political neutrality.' The difficulty is, however, in knowing what political neutrality means when two rival 'presidents' - one of them, General Alexander Rutskoi, was a distinguished serving officer - both claim the constitutional right to tell them what to do. At the top level, Mr Yeltsin has taken care to have his own men. General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, is a hero of the coup attempt in August 1991 (when he refused to deploy the paratroopers he then commanded against Mr Yeltsin's stand in the White House) and, though often said to be isolated at the top of an officer corps who regards him as an upstart, is probably loyal. Yet, according to a senior parliamentarian last night, Gen Grachev had yesterday argued violently on the phone with Mr Yeltsin, who was clearly soliciting his support - at one point saying: 'What do you want me to do? Bring the troops in (to Moscow) or what?' At the Security Ministry (the former KGB), a new appointment has just filled the gap left by the departure of Mr Victor Barannikov, the security minister, whose loyalty was in doubt. Mr Nikolai Golushko, his deputy, now minister, is a long-serving KGB man (once the head of the department which spied on internal dissidents), and is likely to have been checked out for allegiance to the president. Mr Victor Yerin, the gruff interior minister (who has like Mr Golushko, many thousands of troops at his command) is likely to be loyal, if for no other reason than that the parliament wishes to sack him. These are the president's military men; however, the men below them may be more restive. The Officer's Union, the openly hostile group of serving officers within the military which have long called for a resumption of Soviet rule, are vocal and may also be numerous. Each officer will have a tug on his loyalty oath: it is to the president, but to which president?</p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Labour claims some Tory MPs will refuse to support domestic fuel VAT Labour claimed yesterday that 12 Conservative MPs will refuse to support the government's plans to impose value added tax on domestic fuel in a vote on the finance bill next week. Such a rebellion would be enough to ensure victory for a Labour amendment reversing the phased imposition of VAT announced by Mr Norman Lamont, then chancellor, in last year's March Budget. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said the list was compiled from Conservatives who opposed the measure during the passage of the 1993 finance bill or before the November Budget of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. However, the list takes no account of the compensation package included in Mr Clarke's Budget, which is believed to have satisfied many potential rebels. The list was ridiculed by senior Conservatives. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said Mr Brown had 'nothing better to do all day than think up headlines'. Mr Brown said pressure on Tories would be increased by revised Inland Revenue tax codings being despatched this week.</p>

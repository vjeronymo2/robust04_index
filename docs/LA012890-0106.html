			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPRAYING FOR MEDFLIES, STIRRING UP A BACKLASH;  </P> <P> AGRICULTURE: MALATHION MAY BE A 'SAFE' INSECTICIDE, BUT DOUSING BY HELICOPTER  ISN'T WHAT IT WAS INTENDED FOR AND HASN'T BEEN ADEQUATELY STUDIED.  </P> <P> The official notice is shoved through the mail slot or tucked under the  windshield wiper. In English and Spanish, the U.S. Department of Agriculture,  the California Department of Food and Agriculture and the Office of the County  Agricultural Commissioner announce: "An aerial application of malathion protein  bait is necessary in your area, due to the presence of the Mediterranean fruit  fly."  </P> <P> The next night, helicopter bombardment begins. And it continues, sometimes as  often as 12 times in a single neighborhood. To many, this is just another  oddity of life in a semiarid tropical paradise; cover the fishpond, hose down  the lemon tree, a quick trip to the carwash next morning and it's all over. But  for a growing number of grumpy urban villagers, sticky chemical rain is one  assault they don't want to put up with. Who cares about the Medfly, anyway?  </P> <P> Obviously federal, state and county agriculture officials care plenty. They are  willing to subject a widening area, populated by millions of citizens whose  only relationship to agricultural production may be a back-yard kumquat, to  wholesale aerial spraying. Malathion, the pesticide of choice, kills many  beneficial insects as well as Medflies. The sole purpose is to prevent the  flies from marching inexorably toward Modesto -- from an agricultural point of  view, it is cheaper to spray most of Los Angeles and Orange counties for a year  than to spray or treat produce from the Central Valley.  </P> <P> The price of spraying malathion over the largest population center in  California may be considerably more than helicopter rental and chemicals,  however. As the Medfly war drags on, without apparent victories and over an  increasingly larger battlefield, questions are being raised about the whole  approach to agricultural pest management in the nation's largest  produce-exporting state. These questions pit some (though by no means all)  California agribusinesses -- and the chemical industry that services them --  against consumers and farm workers.  </P> <P> Malathion, ironically, is probably the safest pesticide in use today. As the  official notice says, it is used by many home gardeners. But those gardeners  spray malathion directly on insect-infested plants, not over whole  neighborhoods -- swimming pools, toddler's tricycles and all. Perhaps most  important, the home gardener is not spraying from helicopters in the dark. For  many Southern Californians -- including refugees from real war zones, as well  as those whose neighborhoods are sometimes policed by air -- the sound of  helicopters at night is a cause for genuine alarm.  </P> <P> The fact that malathion is relatively innocuous compared with other chemicals  currently in use and that government agencies have proclaimed it safe does not  mean the end of the health and safety debate. No scientific studies or public  hearings have been conducted to support the safety of general spraying of  malathion over urban areas. Even assuming that current official assessments of  risk are correct, even a very small risk of neurological damage is magnified by  the very large numbers of people exposed. The finding of no significant risk is  only applicable to uses of the pesticide for which it is registered -- i.e.,  ground application on selected crops that are washed before they are consumed.  </P> <P> After the public controversy aroused by former Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown  Jr.'s intervention in the 1982 California Medfly infestation died down, the  state Department of Health Services did gather data on birth defects. Not  surprisingly, in a short-term study the researchers failed to find a link  between spraying malathion and harm to fetuses. Other, more subtle health  effects were never studied simply because studies cost money and the state  chose to put its limited health-research dollars elsewhere once public  attention wandered off the issue.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has called for  manufacturers of malathion to provide more health data to support  re-registration of the insecticide. The agency refuses to make its data public  despite public requests sparked by rumors that a new study establishes a link  between malathion and cancer.  </P> <P> The EPA has chosen to evade the current controversy by claiming its studies are  part of internal decision-making, therefore exempt from the Freedom of  Information Act.  </P> <P> Prodded by concerned residents, several cities including Los Angeles are now  holding hearings and threatening legislation to halt the spraying. State Sen.  Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) last week introduced a bill to ban aerial spraying  pending further health studies. Meanwhile, spraying continues, set through  summer. The longer it continues, the more impetus it provides for a more  sweeping solution -- "Big Green" -- than either lawsuits or the Torres bill  would offer.  </P> <P> Big Green is the environmental-protection limitation initiative of 1990, a  comprehensive measure now being circulated for the November ballot by a  coalition that includes major environmental organizations, elected officials  and such political groups as the California League of Conservation Voters.  Among other reforms, the initiative would take control of the registration of  pesticides away from agriculture officials and put it in the hands of the  Department of Health Service.  </P> <P> Losing control of the registration process is the threat the chemical industry  fears most; the trade association of agricultural pesticide manufacturers is  already gearing up its own counterinitiative to draw votes away.  </P> <P> The Medfly may have flown away as an issue by then, but the sound of  helicopters and the smell of sticky malathion bait will still be fresh in the  minds of many big-city voters.  </P> <P> California's pesticide industry may win the current battle but it is now at  greater risk of losing the war.  </P></p>

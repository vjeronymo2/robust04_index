Shirokaya, Hydrobiology Institute at the Ukrainian  Academy of Sciences, Kiev; UDC [581.526.3:577.34](282.247.32)]    [Abstract] The high bioindicator potential plant life in  studies of the impact of radioactive water contamination after  the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident (1986-1991) prompted  a broad range of research into the plant phytocenoses in the  Kiev reservoir. To this end, the character of changes in the  Kiev reservoir surface vegetation under the effect of acute  radionuclide contamination and accumulation levels of the  principal radionuclides in the vegetation mass were  investigated. In so doing, overgrown areas were assessed by the  aerovisual method, and the structure of the most important  vegetation systems was studied by the transect method using data  obtained by large-scale aerial photography survey of the Kiev  reservoir vegetation in 1983, i.e., three years before the  Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident, as a frame of reference.  The study reveals considerable changes which have occurred since  the accident and which cannot be attributed to multiyear  vegetation successions or the characteristics of the  hydrological conditions during this period. In particular, the  ecological areal of plants of the Potamogeton genus  has shrunken considerably, probably due to its low radiation  resistance and high [.sup]137[/]Cs and [.sup]90[/]Sr  accumulation ability. The conclusion is drawn that large tracts  of aeroaquatic vegetation play an unequal role with respect to  the ingress of radionuclides into the bottom sediments and water  depth, depending on their structural characteristics. By mowing  vegetation and changing the level conditions one can alter the  correlations between different types of aquatic plants and thus  develop an optimum method by which the vegetation systems affect  the radiation environment in a certain reservoir section as a  function of the contamination character.

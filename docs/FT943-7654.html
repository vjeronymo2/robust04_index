			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Observer: Ba black sheep Excitement is running high among dealers at the Frankfurt stock exchange - and not solely on account of the D-Mark's gyrations. The fuss concerns a broker who is retiring - and his would-be replacement, August Schafer. Schafer is the state commissioner responsible for supervising the bourse. With the new financial supervisory laws, he has more or less regulated himself out of a job and is looking for pastures new. However, potential future colleagues reckon that the aptly named Schafer (meaning shepherd) knows a mite too much about them and their ways to be a suitable member of their flock. For his part, Schafer claims his second name is discretion and insists on pressing his case. But why is he so eager? Does he not appreciate that, given his provenance from the old school of toothless watchdogs, those bleaters on the floor will eat him alive?</p>

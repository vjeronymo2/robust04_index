			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Jets strike at rival Yemen strongholds Yemen edged towards civil war yesterday, as soldiers from the feuding northern and southern regions clashed and as aircraft pounded rival strongholds. Aden radio said northern jets launched air raids against Aden's airport, oil refinery, port, power station and television station. It claimed gunfire brought down three of the attacking jets. Earlier, the military command in the northern capital, Sanaa, said its forces shot down five southern aircraft when they raided three airports in the northern region. Residents of Sanaa said southern jets struck the international airport and the presidential palace. The northern command also reported pitched battles in several areas along the former border between south and north Yemen, which merged four years ago to form a unified country of 14m people. Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the Middle East, with modest oil production of about 335,000 barrels a day, of which 140,000 barrels come from the south. Up to 30 foreign oil companies are operating in the main oilfields. Concern that fighting might endanger Yemeni oil exports, along with new signs of firm oil demand, sparked a rally in petroleum prices. London June futures for the benchmark Brent blend traded as high as Dollars 15.83 a barrel, up 35 cents from Wednesday's close. New York light crude futures also stood higher by nearly 40 cents at one point. Oil companies lifting Yemeni crude said earlier in the day that operations continued normally despite the attacks. Yemen has been plagued by political rivalry since the merger between marxist South Yemen and the tribal, conservative North Yemen. Differences over power-sharing has prevented integration of the armed forces and led to a fierce power struggle. Clashes broke out last week, with the south conceding that one of its brigades in the north had been defeated in a two-day tank battle near Sanaa. Panic spread among Sanaa's 1.5m people yesterday as waves of aircraft flew overhead at daybreak and as heavy gunfire and explosions rocked the city. Diplomats said the southerners' attack on Sanaa airport slightly damaged runways and the control tower. But a northern official denied there was any damage. The southerners said their raid was in retaliation for an earlier northern raid on Aden. Diplomats said they believed the airport in Aden, capital of former South Yemen, was badly damaged in air attacks and had been closed. Shipping and trade sources said Aden port was shut. In Sanaa, President Ali Abdullah Saleh declared a 30-day state of emergency. The Yemeni news agency said the US assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs, Mr Robert Pelletreau, met President Saleh in an attempt to mediate in the crisis. France said it would evacuate French and European Union citizens from Aden.</p>

Speaking before the Korea-America Friendship Society in a  dinner speech, Han predicted an end to confrontational division  of the Korean peninsula by the 21st century.    To better facilitate this, the Asia-Pacific region needs to  strengthen a multilateral cooperation forum and incorporate  North Korea in this new order, Han said.    The region, for example, could embark on security dialogue,  give APEC a bigger role, and cooperate closely with North  American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and link it with EAEC, the  foreign minister said.    To prevent NAFTA and EAEC from becoming regional blocs,  South  Korea and other mid-economy nations of East Asia should link up  with both forums in due course, he suggested.    "No matter what the situation, South Korea and the United  States should continue to work to retain and develop world free  trade order and make APEC which connects North America with East  Asia the basic framework for the economic order in the  Asia-Pacific," said Han.</p>

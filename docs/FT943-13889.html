			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Danes attack Brussels over ship subsidies The Association of Danish Shipbuilders has charged that the European Commission exceeded its powers by approving German subsidies to shipyards in the former East Germany and is attempting to bring the issue before the European Court. Danish shipbuilders contend that the German subsidies will jeopardise their own shipbuilding industry. However, the association received a severe setback late last week when the Danish government refused to take the Commission to task before the European Court. Any action will have to be taken by the association itself without concerted government backing. Requests by the German chancellor, Mr Helmut Kohl, to the Danish prime minister, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, not to pursue the shipbuilding issue have been reported by the Danish media as a factor in the government's decision. The Danish shipbuilders' case is driven by grave concern that their shipyards will be rendered uncompetitive. The history of their complaint dates back to 1992 when German subsidies to four shipyards in the eastern provinces were approved in principle by an EU directive - the seventh shipbuilding directive under which several conditions were attached. 'A genuine and irreversible reduction' in shipbuilding capacity was one of the conditions. Another was that the subsidies should not exceed 36 per cent of a shipyard's 'normal turnover' after restructuring. The Danes claim that far from being reduced, capacity at the four German yards will be dramatically increased. The Danish shipbuilders also contend that the German yards are being restructured to compete in precisely the type of ships - supertankers, and Panamax container-carrrying and bulk carriers (the maximum size for passing through the Panama canal) - in which two of the largest Danish yards, the Burmeister &amp; Wain Shipyard in Copenhagen and the AP Moller shipyard near Odense, are specialists. At the MTW Shipyard at Wismar, say the Danes, the yard will be able to build up to six supertankers a year, of 300,000dwt each, compared with vessel up to a maximum of 30,000dwt before restructuring. The Kvaerner Warnow yard's new drydock at Warnemunde will allow it to build vessels of up to 180,000dwt compared with its present four slipways each for vessels up to 7,000dwt. Yearly potential capacity will be much more than doubled, according to the Danish association. Similar changes in capacity are planned at Volkswerft (Stralssund), and Peenewerft, according to the Danes. The Danish shipbuilders fail to see how this complies with the seventh directive's call for 'a genuine and irreversible reduction in capacity' and point to an apparent discrepancy between the seventh directive and the Commission's wording when in May this year it approved the subsidies for the MTW Shipyard. In the case of MTW, the Commission declared that 'The German government is requested to ensure that the volume of production is limited for five years,' which is not the same as an irreversible reduction. The Commisson, say the Danes, has agreed to subsidies to the MTW Shipyard equal to about 70 per cent of annual turnover, not 36 per cent. The MTW Shipyard is a test case, as it is the first of the yards for which the Commission's approval has been received. The Danish shipbuilders argue that the Commission's decision 'will legalize a smilar practice' for the three other yards. Under the seventh directive, all operating subsidies were to be paid out by December 31, 1993, but the latest tranche of operating subsidies was authorised by the Commission on May 11 this year, which makes the payments illegal, according to the Danish argument.</p>

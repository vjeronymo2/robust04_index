The ministry is also requesting information on why  Aldrich Ames, her husband, went to Colombia. In addition, the  Foreign Ministry asked the prosecutor general and the attorney  general to investigate Maria del Rosario Casas' conduct.    On this same issue, Noemi Sanin, Colombian foreign minister,  has already offered the U.S. Government her full cooperation  with the investigation into Maria del Rosario Casas' involvement  in the case, the most talked-about spy case in recent times.  Meanwhile, the Registrar's Office has disclosed the  identification card of the accused.    The Foreign Ministry received orders today to maintain under  strict reserve the curriculum vitae of Maria del Rosario Casas  du Puy, Colombian Mata Hari captured by the FBI in the United  States. She is accused of spying for Russia. This is Casas du  Puy's photograph when she applied for a diplomatic post in  Mexico.

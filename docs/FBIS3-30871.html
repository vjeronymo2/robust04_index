The Agrarian Democratic Party, its leader Victor Surdu said,  "considers that through such statements that contradict the  historical truths and the course of so far of the relations  between Romania and the Republic of Moldova, whose independence  our country was the first to recognize -- their authors oppose  the natural course of history, commit themselves with fishy  haste to a direction with unforeseeable ends. Their positions  cannot be legitimated by any argument. Moreover, they advance  dangerous ideas, disregard an independent, sovereign and unitary  state like Romania.    "Through such statements, which the PDAR definitely rejects,  their authors assume a serious responsibility before history and  their own citizens so tragically tried by insane decisions made  in the past. They claim rights they really do not have towards  their destiny. And the territorial claims that result from the  strange outlook on the union of the Republic of Moldova with a  part of a neighbour and sovereign state disclose a grave  departure even from the rational and realistic spirit, a  worrying betrayal of history and of the real and essential  interests of the Romanians across the Prut.    Hearing with surprise, sorrow and worry such statements,  firmly rejecting them, the PDAR is sure that the truth will  triumph, that future history will do justice to people so hard  tried by fate, by foreign oppression, that the Romanians  everywhere, just like their brave forefathers, will know how to  defend their rights, faith, language and national being.</p>

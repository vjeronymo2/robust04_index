			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: In festive mood This week's rally in UK equities feels like more than the seasonal meandering of an inebriated market. Trading volumes have been unusually high for the festive season. The best of the gains have been in second-tier stocks, pushing the FT-SE 250 Index ahead. With no futures contract on that index, the pernicious influence of pit traders can hardly be at work. That the 250 is weighted towards the capital goods sectors only adds to the impression that the market is rationally pricing in a cyclical recovery in earnings. Even so, a multiple of over 17 times last year's earnings is taking a lot on trust. The market last reached a comparable multiple in the run up to the 1987 crash. There are powerful supports nonetheless, not least the dwindling returns on cash. With long gilts yielding only 2.1 times more than the market, equities are hardly out of line with bonds. Equally, the prospects look bullish set against the grim economic outlook on continental Europe. That should draw funds from overseas. Come the spring, though, the government will be competing hard for funds. If that means higher bond yields, equities will be swimming against the tide. Companies may be tempted to make a dash for cash before the government wades in. If recovery really is around the corner, corporate funding will be required. Assuming some moderately good news on earnings, a rush of first quarter rights issues is a real possibility. That would really test the courage of the market's convictions.</p>

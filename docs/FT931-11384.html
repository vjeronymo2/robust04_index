			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Fears on confidentiality prompt industry review THE BRITISH Bankers Association is conducting an industry-wide review of how to prevent leaks of customers' account details. The move follows the leak last autumn to The Sun newspaper of details of Mr Norman Lamont's Access credit card statement. Banks are concerned that the leak over the chancellor's details was not unique, although they dispute claims by some law firms and private detective agencies that almost anyone's bank account or credit card details can be obtained relatively easily. Senior bankers said it would be damaging to business if customers lost confidence in banks' ability to keep their account details secret. Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive of Midland Bank, said: 'What I find concerning is the suggestion that someone will disclose information on bank customers for as little as Pounds 200.' Mr Bert Morris, the National Westminster Bank director who called for the review, said: 'I do not think it is easy to obtain such information. But there are sophisticated investigators who can get in to our systems.' The banks' main fear is that some of their employees may be selling information to private detectives. Because banks have introduced nationwide computer networks for the storage of customer information, a bank employee may be able to obtain access to information about any customers of the bank. Prior to computerisation, the employee could only get access to details about customers of the branch. The association's review will cover three issues: Are there effective legal sanctions against the disclosure of information about customers' affairs? In particular, is the Data Protection Act tough enough? Could banks build more safeguards into their computer systems to make it harder for employees to use them in unauthorised ways? The process of 'logging on' to a computer system is under particular scrutiny. Could banks do more to ensure the honesty of their staff? The law in this area is complex, but lawyers and bankers agree that it is not a criminal offence to pass on information about a customer's accounts without authorisation from the customer. It would, however, be a breach of contract and banks say they would have no hesitation in dismissing an employee making unauthorised disclosures. There are laws to protect confidentiality of information stored on computer. The 1990 Computer Misuse Act makes it illegal for anyone to gain unauthorised access to computerised information, and the 1984 Data Protection Act obliges companies to take steps to prevent leaking of information stored on computers.</p>

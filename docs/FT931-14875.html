			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: Strong gaming results lift Hilton HILTON Hotels, the California-based lodging and gaming company, yesterday reported a 23 per cent improvement in after-tax profits during 1992, to Dollars 103.9m. The advance was largely due to better results from the casino side, with the hotels turning in a flat performance. Overall, the company posted operating profits of Dollars 219.9m for the year, a 19 per cent improvement. Within this, however, the gaming division - boosted by the purchase of the Reno Hilton at the end of July - made Dollars 153.4m, up from Dollars 115m, while the hotels side posted operating profits of Dollars 91.5m, slightly lower than the previous year's Dollars 92.9m. Total revenues were Dollars 1.23bn, an 11 per cent advance. During the fourth quarter, net profits were Dollars 26.5m, down from Dollars 29.6m in the same period of 1991. Operating profits were marginally higher at Dollars 56.4m, but although the gaming division showed a 33 per cent operating profit improvement, the hotels slipped by 6 per cent. Yesterday, Hilton said it continued to see 'weak conditions in certain key markets', on the hotel front, and average room rates were lower than in 1991 'due to competitive conditions'. Hotel occupancy for 1992, however, increased to 66 per cent - a couple of percentage points higher than in 1991. On the gaming side, the company was much more optimistic. The Nevada property saw occupancy rise from 85 per cent to 87 per cent, with an increase from 81 to 86 per cent in the final quarter. Hilton said it planned to spend Dollars 246m on expansion and renovation of properties in Nevada during the next two years and estimated the cost of its gaming riverboat venture in Kansas City - which is still subject to approval by local residents - at Dollars 75m.</p>

			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Letter: Caught out Sir, Jurek Martin's comment ('Theeeeere's Johnny', May 23) about cricket being played only in the old British Empire and Holland is surprising. May I add that cricket is played in many 'overseas' countries, including the US, South America (Argentina, Brazil) and Europe (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece - Corfu, Italy, Luxembourg, Monaco, Portugal and Spain) as well as in the Channel Islands, Gibraltar and Malta. In fact, certain of these countries will be participating in a European Cricketer Cup competition to be held in England in July this year. In Portugal cricket has been played since the 1850s with the first match between the British Clubs in Oporto and Lisbon being held in 1861, making this annual event one of the oldest in cricket on the continent of Europe.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by K Swart] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 5 SAPA -- A team of 80 senior  European police officers assigned to monitor security force  conduct during the election process is due in South Africa this  week. Headed by British Deputy Inspector Keith Biddle, the  officers will be deployed at joint operation centres throughout  the country and will report directly to the Independent  Electoral Commission [IEC]. "Our reports will be compiled from  hard evidence and we will report fairly without fear or favour,"  Insp Biddle told a press conference in Johannesburg on Tuesday  [5 April].    The head of the European Union election unit, Jacob de  Ruiter, said he had received a request for police observers from  IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler on March 22. "I am  pleased to say the European Union has been able, at very short  notice, to respond positively. Mr Biddle, who has the rank of a  deputy police commissioner, has been joined by Chief  Superintendent Herman ven de Berge, a senior colleague from The  Netherlands. Most of the European officers will arrive in South  Africa later this week. We sincerely hope this initiative will,  in the words of Mr Justice Kriegler, materially contribute to  the IEC's ability to work for a free and fair election," Mr de  Ruiter said.    Mr Biddle said the role of the European Union police  contingent would be to advise the IEC on the formulation and  implementation of plans to police the elections, to observe and  monitor policing activity relevant to the election process and  to report on this to the commission. "Our officers, after  briefing, will be dispatched to all corners of South Africa.  Our task is to monitor the way all police forces in South  Africa carry out their duties. We want to see how they  facilitate a free and fair election, prevent intimidation and  how they conduct themselves," he said. "It should be stressed  the officers will have no responsibility for operational matters  nor any power to intervene in any policing activity."    Mr Biddle will be assisted by 10 regional co-ordinators who  will operate mostly from national and regional joint operation  centres.    The officers would be deployed in consultation with the  South  African Police, the South African Defence Force, the European  Union election unit and the IEC.    Mr Biddle said he was honoured to have been selected by the  European Union and his own government to head the observer team.    IEC Commissioner Charles Nupen said the security forces had  an "awesome responsibility" to secure the elections. "The way  they conduct themselves in the field and the confidence they  build in the electorate is of critical importance to the success  of the elections. Consequently the monitoring is very  important. The observers should be deployed in areas where they  are most needed to observe the conduct of police forces," Mr  Nupen said.</p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / International Company News: Decline at BASF deepens gloom in chemical sector BASF's first-half figures yesterday showed that the trials of the German chemical industry were continuing and likely to keep profits in the sector under pressure for some time. The result was the worst of the three big German chemical concerns. Hoechst on Wednesday announced a poor performance while Bayer reported better than expected, though still lower, figures. BASF's interim pre-tax profits were 37 per cent lower at DM972m (Dollars 607m), with net income down by 33 per cent at DM465m. Hoechst reported a 20 per cent drop in first-half pre-tax profits and Bayer one of 10 per cent. Both said they saw little evidence of any improvement on world markets. BASF yesterday echoed this comment. Noting that 1992 remained a difficult year, it added: 'As yet, there are no reliable signs of any improvement, especially in the US.' It said rising labour costs, higher environmental protection costs, and the slackening of business in the holiday period meant the second half was unlikely to bring any marked improvement in earnings. Commenting on the poor first-half figures, it said demand had not weakened but excess capacity in the industry and low prices hampered performance. BASF's group turnover was 0.6 per cent higher at DM23.6bn, but the company, which has a large energy subsidiary, said the downward trend was concealed by the increase in the mineral oil tax which added about DM500m. BASF had to accept sharp price reductions over a wide range of products. The lower dollar had added to this pressure, without providing adequate relief on the raw materials side. In spite of lacklustre economic growth, volume sales increased in all markets, partly due to new plants. In the US, 'our business reflects the fact that the expected upturn has yet to materialise,' the company said. The group is continuing with its cost-cutting and labour reduction programmes, with the labour force down by 3 per cent to less than 127,000 people in the first six months. Lex, Page 14</p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Warburg to act as custodian for Halifax Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest, has appointed SG Warburg's custody and investor services division to handle the administration of its new unit trust business, due to be launched early next year. The move is part of a growing trend among providers of retail investment products to assign administration and custody functions to third-party providers in an effort to reduce costs. Efficient management of custody and administration increasingly requires significant investments in systems technology which are too large for all but the largest groups. Last year, Henderson Administration and Gartmore, two fund management companies with significant retail products, formed a joint venture to handle the back-office custody and administration business for their own and others' funds. The other leading provider in the UK is Premier Administration, a division of US-based Mellon Bank, a significant participant in the global custody business. Warburg is already the custodian for the new start-up retail financial products business of the Leeds Building Society and the retail products business of Invesco, the fund management group. 'This is a business where economies of scale really do make a difference,' said Ms Elizabeth Corley, director of Warburg's custody and investor services division. About Pounds 3bn to Pounds 4bn of Warburg's custody assets are those of third parties. 'What we have found is that their interest is less pure custody and more administrative services,' she said. Rules governing unit trusts make explicit requirements on the pricing of units, frequency of fund valuations and transfers of ownership of units.</p>

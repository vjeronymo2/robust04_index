			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / School standards plan attracts over 4,000 would-be inspectors MORE THAN 4,000 people have applied to become school inspectors under the government's new scheme for monitoring standards in England's schools. Launching the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted) yesterday, Professor Stewart Sutherland, chief inspector of schools, said the selection of the first 210 inspectors would start next week, with teams ready to start work in September 1993. From next year, all schools in England will be subject to inspection at least once every four years by a team appointed by Ofsted, the successor to Her Majesty's Inspectorate, under the direction of the chief inspector. Inspection teams, which must include at least one lay member without direct teaching experience, will be licensed by Ofsted. Licensed teams will bid for inspections, most likely school-by-school, with Ofsted awarding inspections on the basis of price and quality. Of the 4,000 applicants, 1,500 are from individuals applying to be inspection team leaders, the majority wishing to inspect secondary schools. In line with government hopes, lay inspector posts are proving attractive to individuals from private sector backgrounds. Of 100 applications processed, 24 are from present or past consultants, 21 from managers, six from company directors and six from 'professionals'. Prof Sutherland said: 'My office is now heavily engaged in the assessment of this avalanche of applications. Nearly 1,000 have already passed the first scrutiny and will be invited to take a place on the Ofsted training scheme.' Schools thought to be 'at risk' of failing to offer a satisfactory education will be given priority for inspection by Ofsted. Where a school is found to be 'at risk', its governors will be expected to take urgent action to improve standards. Mr John Patten, education secretary, intends to take powers to send in a national taskforce to run schools which fail to improve themselves after being designated 'at risk'. Ms Ann Taylor, Labour's education spokesman, said the new system was 'a recipe for uneven and sub-standard inspection', adding: 'Inspectors will be sent to schools with little training.'

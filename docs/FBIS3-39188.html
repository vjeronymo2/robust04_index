			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Oscar Garschagen: "Bill Clinton Shows His </F> Weakest Side"]    [Text] U.S. fighter planes were flying over Sarajevo on  Saturday [5 February] while in the market in the eastern part of  the city a horrific scene was unfolding. The marine pilots saw  how the graves were being dug on the football field next to  Kosevo hospital. And then they flew back to base, without being  able to fire a single shot.    America could see, mainly through ABC, how the Bosnia policy  of President Clinton, the European Union, NATO, and the United  Nations was once again being reduced to nothing at all. The  dramatic television pictures produced an immediate effect, in  the form of meetings between the President and his foreign  policy advisers. Throughout the weekend anxious looking  ministers and CIA bosses shuttled back and forth to the White  House. But the collective handwringing remained without result  in Washington and Brussels on Monday.    The absurdity level of these meetings was further emphasized  by an anonymous Pentagon military official who told CNN that if  U.S. pilots in Italy were given the order they could destroy  Serbian positions around Sarajevo within an hour. But instead  of this the world was treated to new declarations on ending the  siege of Sarajevo "with all possible means, including air  strikes." Powerful but familiar words.    President Clinton in particular revealed an unexpectedly  weak  side last weekend. Following the latest meeting of NATO  government leaders, in mid-January, Clinton gave the impression  that new attacks on the so-called safe areas -- including  Sarajevo -- would be met with harsh measures.    But now at the first sign of aggression the President is  balking -- or at least this is the impression he is giving. He  has called for an enquiry to find out who carried out the  attack. According to UN soldiers on the spot it is impossible  to precisely determine the mortar's line of fire, but it is  certain that it was fired from a position to the northeast of  Sarajevo, from a Serbian position.    The reason for Clinton's hesitant approach is clear.  Divisions within the alliance -- with Great Britain and Canada  exerting great pressure for restraint -- and divisions within  the U.S. Government --- the State Department versus the Defense  Department -- are the major causes.    At the White House the belief took root some time ago now  that active intervention by Clinton in Bosnia could be very  dangerous for his domestic agenda, as the American people would  not support him in such a policy. Clinton's power base in the  United States and in Congress is too small to embark upon any  foreign adventures, the argument goes.    Given his slim electoral victory in 1992 and the balance of  power in Congress, there are indeed arguments to support this  analysis. The call for strong action by Congress comes mainly  from a handful of Republicans and a few Democrats -- such as Lee  Hamilton, president of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Together  with a few vociferous columnists in THE NEW YORK TIMES, they are  arguing for the United States to play a bigger role.    This call -- which is being voiced increasing loudly -- has  found little support among large groups of Republicans and  Democrats from the south, mid-west and west of the country.  Memories of previous wars -- Vietnam -- and recent military  actions -- Somalia -- are still too fresh. And Clinton is a  political animal who is acutely aware of prevailing opinions.    Although no American lives are threatened in Bosnia, peace  and stability in Europe are an American interest too. And  violations of human rights are an affront to American values.    What he can be accused of is having done so little to shift  opinion and to assume the leadership of the international  community. In public -- and as far as we know also behind the  scenes -- he has done nothing to put an end to the national and  international divisions.    It is true that the Europeans have -- regretfully -- been  found wanting, but the United States has subsequently done  little to correct their errors. The only strong stance taken by  Clinton concerned the lifting of the arms embargo so that the  Bosnian Muslims can defend themselves. The attack on the  Saturday market in Sarajevo has deprived opponents of lifting  this arms embargo of any good arguments. If the Bosnians are  not helped by the West then they certainly have the right to  defend themselves.    The basic error is that right from the outset the Europeans  have presented Bosnia as a humanitarian problem and not also as  the victim of a military campaign of conquest by the Serbs and  Croats. If a UN enquiry shows that the Serbs launched the mortar  grenade then military air strikes will be unavoidable.    These must be accompanied by the lifting of the arms embargo  to allow the Bosnian Muslims to defend themselves against the  advancing Serbs and Croats. The argument that arms supplies  will only prolong the fighting also lost its force last  Saturday. What use have the Bosnian Muslims of food parcels if  they are then going to be slaughtered on the marketplace? When  Winston Churchill asked President Roosevelt for weapons and  equipment in December 1940, Roosevelt -- who did indeed show  leadership -- did not reply with the argument that it would  simply prolong the Second World War.</p>

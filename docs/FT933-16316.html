			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Olive branch from Estonia Estonia has sounded a conciliatory note in its dispute with Russia and indicated that it would change the controversial aliens law which Moscow considers discriminatory, writes Matthew Kaminski from Tallinn. Mr Mart Laar, the Estonian prime minister, said the legislation could either be returned to parliament for reconsideration or amended after President Lennart Meri has signed it into law. The law, passed by parliament on June 21, obliges non- ethnic Estonians to choose Russian or Estonian citizenship within the year.</p>

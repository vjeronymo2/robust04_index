			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Market dictates speedy memoirs MR NORMAN Lamont, the backbench MP, will have to be very fast and very frank if he hopes to make even a modest killing from his memoirs. Mr Julian Rivers, marketing director of bookstore chain Dillons, said: 'A biography of Lamont would be a disaster. An autobiography could be a big success but only if he writes it now, while he is still angry.' Mr Matthew Evans, chairman of Faber &amp; Faber, which is publishing the memoirs of former home secretary Mr Kenneth Baker, believes the Lamont story could be worth up to Pounds 200,000, but only if it was produced quickly - ideally this year. 'If he goes on the back benches for three years then it's worth Pounds 10,000,' Mr Evans added. WH Smith, the UK's largest bookseller, warned that political memoirs rarely sold well, with Liberal Democrat reminiscences faring much worse than their political rivals. A WH Smith executive said: 'Just look at the cut-price tables. They're all there.' A Norman Lamont political life would only work, the executive added, 'if he moved quickly, got someone to write it for him and he told the truth'. Publishers are sure the former chancellor has a few interesting stories to tell if he chooses to, such as what really happened on Black Wednesday, the day Britain left the European exchange rate mechanism last September. Baroness Thatcher is now dominating the world of political memoirs, just as she dominated political life when she was prime minister. Harper Collins is reported to have paid an advance of Pounds 3.2m, and her 800-page tome is expected to reach the bookshops in October. By comparison Sir Edward Heath, who was commissioned by Weidenfeld in 1985, has not completed his work.</p>

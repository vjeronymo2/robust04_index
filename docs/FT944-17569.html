			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Opportunity to agree broadcasting ground rules Sir, The recent debate concerning the emergence of powerful, vertically integrated satellite broadcasters has left unresolved the important issue of how best to ensure that ownership by those broadcasters of conditional access systems (the 'gateways') does not prevent or distort competition between satellite television channels. The answer in our view is not to prohibit vertical integration, but to establish a clear regulatory framework which would ensure that all channel providers can obtain access to conditional access systems on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, and that an effective mechanism existed for the speedy resolution of any disputes. The aim must be to encourage broadcasters to invest in new systems, while ensuring that a wide range of new television services is available at a reasonable cost to viewers. Unfortunately, the voluntary code of conduct put forward by the European digital video broadcasting project does not safeguard the public interest in this way. It provides little comfort to broadcasters that they will be treated fairly, nor does it contain an adequate arbitration procedure. An effective regulatory framework would, as a minimum, require the provision of full information on access terms, backed up by transparent accounting and indicative published tariffs. Channels provided by conditional access system operators should be subject to the same terms and conditions of access as those applied to similar types of channels offered by other broadcasters. Regulation would also need to incorporate an effective disputes procedure. Reporting abuses of the code to existing competition authorities, with the costs and delays implied, is inadequate given the importance of rapid market entry in developing satellite markets. Neither is it clear that any other regulator at present has the remit or the capacity to deal with such disputes in an effective and timely manner. For this reason, while the BBC agrees that an 'ill-thought-out layer' ('Scrambled layer', October 4) of additional regulation should be avoided, we do believe that a clear and enforceable framework is essential for the future development of competition in European digital television markets. As standards for digital television in Europe are being finalised, an important opportunity exists for new ground rules to be agreed.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Ivan Ivanov and Gennadiy </F> Talalayev]    [Text] Moscow January 14 TASS -- Russian Deputy Foreign  Minister Georgiy Mamedov regards the present Russian-American  talks "the most substantive, businesslike and concrete" out of  all summits in which he participated.    Mamedov said in an interview with ITAR-TASS on Friday [14  January] that the characteristic feature of the present talks  was that "Russian-American relations came to the end of a period  when bilateral ties focused, due to circumstances connected with  the initial stage of Russian reforms, on rendering aid to Russia  in the humanitarian and other spheres".    "We witness now a switch to macroeconomic partnership,  assistance in structural changes of the Russian economy, in  restructuring of Russia's relations with close neighbours and  major countries in the world as well as in a change of the  attitude of international economic organisations to reforms in  our country with a greater edge on social programmes," the  deputy minister noted.    According to Mamedov, Clinton "put forth a package of  specific measures, to be taken by the United States together  with other countries and international economic organisations,  to help change radically attitudes to Russia in order to ensure  a greater foothold for it on world markets and to ease Russia's  economic relations with former Soviet republics.    Mamedov noted that, thanks to U.S. assistance, international  economic organisations will appropriate funds to countries of  the Commonwealth of Independent States to purchase energy  carriers from Russia at higher prices.    "There is also a programme for converting the munitions  industry to prevent greater unemployment. Funds released as a  result of conversion will be channeled for social programmes,  including creation of jobs," he continued.    "You see, the package provides not for canned meat  deliveries  but serious measures which will help restructure the Russian  economy and simultaneously create 'a social insurance system'."    Incidentally, Mamedov added, Clinton, guided by an analysis  of the situation made by American agencies, said during a  discussion of the economic situation in Russia that Russia would  make a powerful breakthrough in two years' time.    In this connection, the sides discussed changing the seven  most industrialised countries into a G-8. "This issue is  difficult enough," Mamedov admitted. "The American side  expressed support for such a change in the political resepect.  It also noted that structural changes in the economy should  lead to turning the G-7 into a G-8 also economically."    ITAR-TASS learnt from a member of the Russian delegation at  the talks, who refused to be identified, that the U.S. expressed  support for Russia's admission to GATT during the second round  of the summit.    It was also made known that customs restrictions on nearly  4,400 types of Russian goods will be lifted on the American  market.    Mamedov noted that the Russian president supported the  "Partnership for Peace" initiative put forth by Clinton.</p>

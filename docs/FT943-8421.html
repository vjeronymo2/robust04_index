			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: US side behind growth in Irish Life premium income US growth continued to be the main driving force behind increased premium sales at Irish Life, which reported a 5.8 per cent rise in total premium income to IPounds 360.1m (Pounds 355m) for the six months to June 30, against IPounds 340.2m. Premium income at Interstate, the Dublin-based assurance company's US subsidiary, increased by 36 per cent from IPounds 62.3m to IPounds 84.8m. Even stronger growth in the second half is anticipated following completion next month of a Dollars 51.1m acquisition of the Boston-based First Variable Life, which is licensed to sell unit-linked products throughout the US. Group revenue growth has remained static, however, because of a 12 per cent fall in investment income to IPounds 135.6m (Pounds 154.6m), primarily due to a lower short-term interest rate environment compared with the 1993 first half. The present period's figures do not include David, its Norwegian business sold for IPounds 12m in May. New recurring premium business in the core Irish activities grew by 11 per cent from IPounds 26m to IPounds 28.8m, taking the total to IPounds 144.8m (IPounds 141.8m). The upturn is seen as important, as this sector has been facing intense competition in recent years by new entrants to the market and attractive tax-based investment alternatives. Single premium sales were up by a more modest 6 per cent to IPounds 64.5m (IPounds 60.7m). Sales of individual investment products were 'particularly buoyant', rising 38 per cent to IPounds 44.6m. Total new business in the UK fell by 37 per cent to IPounds 13.2m (IPounds 21m), a trend which is expected to continue into the second half as the company scales back its appointed representative distribution network. The company said that 'good progress' had been made in its cost reduction programme in Ireland, which is expected to be complete by the end of the year. Management expenses were down by IPounds 2.2m to IPounds 45m in the first half. As a valuation is not carried out at the interim stage, the company's policy is to maintain an unchanged interim dividend at 3p. Brokers, however, anticipate an 8 per cent dividend increase for the full year, and 6 per cent growth in embedded value to IPounds 590m.</p>

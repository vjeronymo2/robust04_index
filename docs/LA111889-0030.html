			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INSULT TO SOVIET VISITORS?  </P> <P> Re Donna Perlmutter's critique of the Red Army Chorus: I am convinced that with  the ingrained attitudes and low level of public awareness in the "Free" World,  the Cold War will never end ("The Red Army Chorus -- A Show of Strength,  Inside, Outside Shrine," Nov. 4). It was a display of mass rudeness for the  Armenians -- "1,000 protesting emigres" -- to insult the members of the Red  Army Chorus, guests of the United States. It is a sad commentary on the brave  new world when art has to be used as a political weapon.  </P> <P> JAMES REESE  </P> <P> Banning  </P></p>

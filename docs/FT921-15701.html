			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Money Markets: UK rates steady MONEY market interest rates were steady in London yesterday, although liquidity remained in short supply and sterling drifted lower against the D-Mark on the foreign exchange markets. The Bank of England forecast a liquidity shortage of Pounds 1.25bn early in the day, later revised down to Pounds 1.1bn. In an early round of assistance, the bank purchased band 1 and band 4 bills totalling Pounds 229m. In addition it purchased Pounds 84m paper for resale to the market on January 20 at 10 7/16 per cent. Later in the morning session, the bank injected a further Pounds 118m, buying band 1 bills at 10 3/8 per cent, band 3 bills at 10 7/32 per cent and band 4 bills at 10 1/8 per cent. In the afternoon, a further Pounds 303m band 1 and band 3 bills were purchased at the same rates. Late assistance totalled Pounds 205m, leaving total assistance for the day around Pounds 160m below the forecast liquidity shortage. Unsecured overnight money was traded down to 10 9/16 - 7/16 per cent, below the 10 3/4 - 1/2 per cent level on Monday. The key three months inter-bank rate traded at 10 13/16 - per cent. The March short sterling futures contract on the London International Financial Futures Exchange closed at 89.37, against 89.32 on Monday, implying base rates of around 10.63 per cent by the spring. In Frankfurt, call money rates were steady at around 9.5 per cent, a level which has held since the Bundesbank raised interest rates by  1/2 point on December 19. Today a Bundesbank customer repurchase pact expires, draining DM33.2bn from the market at interest rates of between 9.20 and 9.25 per cent. However, analysts expected this shortage to be covered by a new repurchase agreement. In Tokyo, the Bank of Japan again demonstrated its determination to prevent money market interest rates from falling too far following its 1/2 point cut in key interest rates last week. The bank recalled Y200bn loans to the banking system when over-night money rates dipped to 5 3/32 per cent from Monday's 5 9/32 per cent. The action forced rates back up to 5 11/32 per cent by the close, suggesting that the authorities will keep money market interest rates above 5 per cent for the foreseeable future. Today, analysts are expecting a liquidity shortage of around Y340bn, which the authorities may off-set in full if interest rates appear to be firm.</p>

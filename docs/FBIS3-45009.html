Standing Committee members discussed how to deepen the struggle  against corruption. They pointed out the need to persist in the  guiding principles set by the party Central Committee for the  first-phase struggle against corruption and to consider and  carry out the struggle against corruption in line with the  overall situation of expediting the establishment of the  socialist market economic structure and maintaining the  sustained, speedy, and healthy development of the national  economy.    The session listened to a report by Yang Tonghui, member of  the provincial party committee's Standing Committee and  secretary of the discipline inspection commission, on last  year's struggle against corruption in the province and on  proposals for the future struggle against corruption.    At the session, provincial party Secretary Xie Shijie  stressed: Leadership should be strengthened over the struggle  against corruption, the provincial party committee and  government, as well as party committees and governments at all  levels, should regard the struggle against corruption as an  important political task, put it on their agenda, and carry it  out persistently. The party Central Committee has set three  requirements for the current struggle against corruption. These  three requirements should be implemented in the period up to the  Spring Festival so as to make phased achievements. This year's  struggle against corruption will be arranged by the provincial  party committee in light of Sichuan's actual conditions  according to the Central Committee's plan.    Xie Shijie pointed out: In our work, we should play the  exemplary role of leading cadres, strengthen education against  corruption and for a clean administration, and conscientiously  abide by the system of cadres reporting major cases and the  system of maintaining files for clean administration. In the  course of rectifying arbitrary collections of charges, we should  straighten out malpractices in using special funds, examine and  deal with major and important cases, pay proper attention to  strengthening discipline in key departments, resolve problems by  looking into their root causes and symptoms, constantly make  phased achievements in a down-to-earth manner, and profoundly  and protractedly carry out the struggle against corruption so as  to ensure the smooth fulfillment of all tasks this year and to  promote the better and faster development of the province's  reform, opening up, and conomic construction.</p>

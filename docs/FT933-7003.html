			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Dealers undismayed by profit-taking INVESTORS in London remained unconvinced of the prospects for cuts in UK interest rates in the near term, and the UK stock market followed the downward trend set yesterday in the other leading European bourses. London investors took a cautious view of the latest cut in rates in France. Some stock was sold but traders showed no dismay in the 15.6 fall to 3,042 on the FT-SE 100 Index. Profit-taking was not unexpected in view of the market's strong upswing and comfort was drawn from a steadier performance in UK government bonds. There was some playing between the September future contract on the Footsie and the index stocks themselves, but activity in the futures sector was never large enough to play a significant role in equities. Sterling remained steady and it was an early fall of 16 Dow points on Wall Street that took the heart out of London in the closing minutes of the session. Also unsettling were suggestions that a large rights issue is in the offing, perhaps from MB-Caradon or in the building and construction sector. The general air of malaise also hung over the second line stocks, which have fared so well in the market advance. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index lost 15 points to 3,467.4, while trading in these smaller capitalised stocks made up around 64 per cent of the day's Seaq total of 546.8m shares. On Friday, 633.4m shares traded through Seaq reflected retail, or customer, business of Pounds 1.58bn. Customer business, having traded since last September at the Pounds 1bn-plus levels regarded as profitable for the London-based securities trading industry, has risen sharply over the past month as share prices have soared to new territory above the Footsie 3,000 mark. With the influence of transatlantic markets now challenged by last week's poor trade figures from the US, international blue chips lost some of their recently revived confidence. Pharmaceuticals, in particular, shaded lower again, casting doubt over the rally in share prices in the sector, which provided a significant boost to the UK market last week. Glaxo, Wellcome and most other drug leaders lacked support yesterday. Nor was the picture much brighter on the domestic scene. Retail issues tried to edge forward at first as London took a fresh look at comments on German interest rate policies made in the US on Friday by the Bundesbank's vice-president, but support soon dwindled and the sector closed lower. The banking segment, also closely linked to interest rate prospects since lower rates would ease some of the sector's burden of non-performing debts, again took its cue from a poor performance from HSBC, which was still depressed by last week's gloomy half-time statement from Hang Seng Bank, its Hong Kong subsidiary. However, the stock market rallied from the day's low point on the Footsie index of 3,035.6 and equity strategists professed to be willing to see the index down to the 3,020 area before the present phase of profit-taking would cause any reconsideration of medium-term views on UK equities. The satisfactory level of retail trading volume indicated that the big institutions were trading stock, rather than merely selling. 'Consolidation is the name of the game,' was the comment from several leading trading houses.</p>

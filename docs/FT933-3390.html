			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Candover drops to Pounds 1.63m LOWER INTEREST rates hit pre-tax profits at Candover Investments, the investment trust specialising in management buy-outs, which yesterday reported a 28 per cent decline to Pounds 1.63m for the six months to June 30. The group reported a 5 per cent increase in its net assets per share, however, to 281p. Mr Roger Brooke, chairman, said the rise in net assets reflected the strong performance of the companies in which Candover had invested. Mr Brooke was bullish about Candover's prospects in the medium term, saying he had discerned positive signs of economic recovery. Although in the past, most improvements in Candover's investments had been due to cost cutting and productivity increases, there had been recent signs of an upturn in consumer demand. 'It shows recovery is happening; not very fast and not universally, but it is happening,' Mr Brooke said. Candover was also expecting to realise investments in at least five of its companies, he said - including Midland Independent Newspapers and Inspec - which were planning public flotations in the near future. As a result of these prospects, the interim dividend was increased by 5 per cent to 3.95p (3.75p). Earnings per share fell from 6.81p to 4.87p. Operating income fell from Pounds 2.23m to Pounds 1.64m due to lower interest gains and a reduction in financing fees. Only one major deal had been done in the first half - the buy-out of catering company Gardner Merchant - compared with several the previous year. Mr Brooke said he expected the second half to remain largely similar to the first. However, prospects for buy-outs of more than Pounds 100m appeared more encouraging next year. 'We have seen a considerable uplift in the number of deals that look interesting,' he said.</p>

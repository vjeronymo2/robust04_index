			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [White paper on the ROK's development of fast-breeder </F> reactor, issued by the Central Committee of the South Korea  National Democratic Front on 2 May]    [Text] According to the Voice of National Salvation from  Seoul, the South Korean National Democratic Front [SKNDF]  Central Committee issued the following white paper on 2 May,  exposing the South Korean puppet clique's attempt to accelerate  its nuclear armament by developing fast-breeder reactors:  <H5>  The White Paper on the ROK's Development of Fast-Breeder </H5> Reactors    1. The Blitz [chongyokchok] Development of  Fast-Breeder Reactors    According to the June 1992 final decision of the Atomic  Energy Commission [AEC] on its plan for atomic energy research  and development, the ROK is supposed to complete the development  of positive reactors [silchungno], which is the third stage of  fast-breeder reactor development, 19 years ahead of Japan, which  has now started to operate prototype reactors [wonhyongno].    In order to realize this plan, the ROK is using the same  blitz mosaic method of synthesizing various countries'  technologies that is used to develop nuclear weapons.    The ambition of ROK rulers to develop fast-breeder reactors  began in the eighties. According to a report on the  proliferation of mass-killing weapons which is a secret document  of the Russian bureau of foreign intelligence, the ROK  authorities agreed early in 1984 with a European country that  possessed the most advanced technology in developing  fast-breeder reactors, to introduce its fast-breeder reactors  and thus began to introduce core technologies, designs, and  experimental reactor facilities [silhomno solbidul]. The  Institute of Atomic Energy Research thus secretly developed an  experimental reactor with a diameter of 1 meter at the end of  the eighties, and has used it in the various technological  experiments required in the development of prototype and  positive reactors.    In the nineties, the Chongwadae ruling group began to  develop  the prototype reactor in cooperation with Japan. On 25 May  1990, the government authorities and Japan signed an agreement  on cooperation in the atomic energy field, and agreed to promote  technological exchanges and joint research on atomic energy. In  an ROK-Japan conference on atomic energy held on 9 November  1990, they conspired [moui] to jointly promote the development  of next-generation reactors.    In an exclusive secret meeting between Kim Yong-sam and  Hosokawa in Kyongju on 6 November 1993, they even secretly  signed an agreement on ROK-Japan joint promotion to develop  nuclear weapons in return for calling off Japan's repayment for  its past crimes.    When they began to suddenly [chongyokchoguro] introduce  technology and experience for the development of prototype  reactors from Japan, government authorities decided to invest  about 2 trillion won in atomic energy research and development,  such as the development of a fast-breeder reactor. They began  to push ahead with the development of a prototype reactor in  1992, mobilizing all experts concerned with [words indistinct].    Regarding this, NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN dated 29 July 1992  reported: the ROK has already started to develop fast-breeder  reactors, hastening its mid- and long-term plans.    According to the ROK experts on nuclear development, the  design of a prototype fast-breeder reactor was turned over to  Korea Heavy Industries by the Institute of Atomic Energy  Research, and they have not only started to produce facilities  of the prototype reactor but also completed a basic study on  positive reactors, drafted a conceptional design, and set aside  budgeting for it, with an investment of 118.3 billion won.    Today, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is busy seeking  justification from the international community regarding the  lawfulness of the fast-breeder reactor development.    In October 1993, the Kim Yong-sam group held an  international  symposium on next-generation reactors in Seoul and even had some  quarters of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  promise to cooperate in the ROK plan to develop next-generation  reactors.    At that time, in a public notice issued in a news conference  in Seoul, Greenpeace exposed and denounced that, far from  discussing scientific and technological problems, this symposium  was a meeting to encourage construction for producing plutonium  in the ROK, as well as an insidious meeting that would bring the  danger of nuclear war closer to East Asia.    2. The Ulterior Motive Behind Development of the  Fast-Breeder Reactor    Throughout the world, the fast-breeder reactor is  acknowledged as lacking economic advantages and safety. For  this reason, the countries developing it have either suspended  its operation or closed it down--the United States in 1977,  France seven years after its initiation of operations, and  Britain in 1994. Germany gave up operating a test reactor which  it had built.    (Frank Hanabby), a British nuclear physicist, who visited  Japan recently, likened the Monju, the Japanese reactor for  producing high-purity plutonium which was put into operation  sometime ago, to a nuclear explosion waiting to happen.  Meanwhile, South Korea and Japan are desperately engaged in the  development of a fast-breeder reactor. This is directly  connected with their ambition to develop nuclear weapons. We  are making this statement based on the following grounds:  First, if the South Korean authorities develop the fast-breeder  reactor, they can multiply and produce a large quantity of  plutonium for the production of nuclear bombs. The December  1991 issue of MAL magazine stated that since the fast-breeder  reactor is a device justifying the massive stockpile and  production of plutonium, which is the raw material for nuclear  weapons, the country operating it should have little difficulty  in producing nuclear weapons. The South Korean ruling group is  attempting to secure a large quantity of plutonium through the  development of the fast-breeder reactor.    Second, the development of the fast-breeder reactor provides  a pretext justifying the purchase of plutonium from a foreign  country. Because the fast-breeder reactor is a reactor which  feeds on plutonium, if the fast-breeder reactor is developed,  South Korea can massively and legitimately import plutonium and  the dioxide of highly enriched uranium, which the authorities  have secretly been importing from Britain. (Kim Chi-o), atomic  energy policy officer of the Ministry of Science and Technology,  has stated that plutonium, the raw nuclear material that is to  be used in the fast-breeder reactor, will be imported from a  foreign country.    Third, the fast-breeder reactor must be equipped with  reprocessing facilities. WOLGAN CHOSON, April 1990 issue, noted  that the introduction of the fast-breeder reactor is a  prerequisite to the construction of a reprocessing plant, adding  that since the introduction of the fast-breeder reactor is  almost certain, the construction of a reprocessing plant is a  question of time.    Chong Chae-mun, chairman of the National Assembly Foreign  and  Unification Affairs Committee, openly calling for a review of  the North-South agreements of 1991, asserting, "We cannot  continue depending on another country for nuclear fuel." This  clearly illustrates how frenziedly the Kim Yong-sam ring is  attempting to provide reprocessing facilities with the  development of the fast-breeder reactor.    Fourth, the development of the fast-breeder reactor is in  itself a process to develop a nuclear bomb. Technologically,  the theory of designing the fast-breeder reactor and that of  designing the nuclear bomb are the same. Therefore, the  technology for the development of the fast-breeder reactor means  in many respects the transfer of the technology for the  development of a nuclear bomb. Furthermore, nuclear physicists  say that the high-purity plutonium obtained from the  fast-breeder reactor can be used for the production of a nuclear  bomb with the appropriate critical mass [imgye chillyang].    The stern reality clearly proves that the traitorous ruling  group in the South scrapped the joint declaration on  denuclearization on the Korean peninsula agreed upon between the  North and the South and that it is persistently engaged in the  development of nuclear weapons. Their attempt to extract  plutonium by developing the fast-breeder reactor, the monster  called a time-bomb, which is prone to horrible accidents, and to  make criminal nuclear weapons that will destroy the entire  nation, is an unpardonable antinational crime.    The persons in authority should not only abolish the  heavy-water reactor and the multipurpose research reactor but  suspend the development of the fast-breeder reactor immediately.  The international reactionary forces, including Japan, should  stop acts of conspiring with the Kim Yong-sam ring in its  development of the fast-breeder reactor directly connected with  the development of nuclear bombs.    Our SKNDF and patriotic masses will certainly check and  frustrate the Kim Yong-sam ring's development of the  fast-breeder reactor for nuclear armament and its maneuvers to  secure a large quantity of plutonium. We express the hope that  the world's fair opinion will wage vigorous activities to trace  to the end and stop the South Korean rulers' maneuvers to  develop the fast-breeder reactor and nuclear weapons.</p>

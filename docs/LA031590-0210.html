			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NFL NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> NBA SALARY STRUCTURE DRAWS A CLOSER LOOK FROM MANAGEMENT  </P> <P> The NFL, following the lead of the NBA, is proposing a salary cap for its  teams.  </P> <P> Jack Donlan, executive director of the NFL Management Council, said Wednesday  the players would benefit because there would be a "guaranteed amount of money  clubs would be required to spend."  </P> <P> Earlier in the week, the NFL completed a new, mammoth, four-year television  package with the three major networks and two cable channels.  </P> <P> Donlan said if a formula were reached from "the money (the league) just  received, the players will feel they're getting their fair share."  </P> <P> The players, who have been without a collective-bargaining agreement since an  unsuccessful strike in 1987, aren't expected to embrace the idea of a salary  cap. Undoubtedly, they would view it as another cost-saving measure.  </P> <P> Last year the NFL Players Association, frustrated in its attempt to reach a  bargaining agreement, decertified itself as a union. NFLPA executive director  Gene Upshaw said he thought the organization would benefit by abandoning its  role as a bargaining agent. Upshaw hoped that total free agency would  eventually result.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, however, Upshaw said he was hopeful progress could be made on a  contract after conversations with new Commissioner Paul Tagliabue.  </P> <P> Donlan, noting that NFL salaries are steadily increasing but still lagging  behind basketball and baseball, said the league still recognizes the NFLPA as a  union.  </P> <P> "Lawyers can get together anytime to meet," Donlan said, calling the  decertification a ploy. "I'm sure they can go back into business the same way  they went out of business."  </P> <P> Donlan produced a chart that said the average NFL salary in 1989 was $304,000  and the 12 highest-paid players on each team averaged $593,000.  </P> <P> According to Donlan, who has access to team salary figures, the NBA's 12-man  rosters averaged $600,000 last year. Taking the 24 highest-paid players on each  club for 1989, Donlan said the NFL averaged $450,000 against $488,000 for  major-league baseball.  </P> <P> Donlan also distributed a survey of players changing teams under Plan B free  agency, a period that begins Feb. 1 and ends April 1.  </P> <P> Donlan said 51 players will be wearing new uniforms this season. In 1989, 229  players changed teams under Plan B, including a rash of late signings.  </P> <P> The Dallas Cowboys lead this year's signings with 13, followed by the New York  Jets with five and the Los Angeles Raiders and Washington Redskins with four  each.  </P> <P> The New England Patriots, who haven't signed any players, lost the most, eight.  The New Orleans Saints were next with five, including defensive back Dave  Waymer, the only player to sign with the San Francisco 49ers.  </P> <P> The 49ers, who have not lost any players, may be close to signing two more  players and are looking at another. Vice president John McVay said Wednesday  that he planned to meet with the 49ers' brain trust about signing two Atlanta  Plan B entries, punter Rich Donnelly and center-guard Wayne Radloff.  </P> <P> McVay said discussions also continue with Buffalo nose tackle Fred Smerlas.  Coach George Seifert said the 49ers also have shown an interest in veteran  Cleveland cornerback Hanford Dixon.  </P></p>

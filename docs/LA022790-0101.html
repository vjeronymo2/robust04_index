			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 16 WEST BANK COLLEGES TO REOPEN; 28 ARABS WOUNDED IN GAZA CLASH  </P> <P> Under pressure from the United States and the European Community, Israel said  Monday that it will reopen 16 Arab community colleges ordered shut during most  of the Palestinian uprising.  </P> <P> But the army kept a closure order on six Palestinian universities with an  enrollment of more than 22,000 students.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the most violent confrontation in the occupied territories in three  weeks occurred in the Gaza Strip, where Arab reports said soldiers shot and  wounded 28 Palestinians, including 22 in the Rafah refugee camp.  </P> <P> U.N. relief workers said 38 other Palestinians from Rafah were treated for  lesser injuries from rubber-coated metal pellets while about 100 people sought  help for tear-gas inhalation after army helicopters sprayed the crowd.  </P> <P> In the occupied West Bank, three Arabs were shot and wounded by Israeli troops  during clashes in the town of Tulkarm, Arab reports and Israel Radio said.  </P> <P> The order allowing community colleges and vocational schools to reopen will  affect 16 West Bank schools with an enrollment of about 5,000 students,  according to Shmuel Goren, coordinator for the Israeli military government in  the occupied lands. All of the schools were ordered closed in January, 1988,  after the army declared they were hotbeds of violence.  </P> <P> Goren said the community and vocational colleges were reopened "to bring about  some change in the climate and feelings" in the territories. "When we reach the  conclusion that the universities will really be a place for study, we will  reopen them," he said.  </P> <P> The European Parliament voted last month to freeze scientific and technical  cooperation with Israel until the universities are reopened, and at least two  planned Israeli-European Community conferences have been postponed  indefinitely.  </P> <P> The United States criticized continued closure of the universities in its  annual human rights report last week.  </P></p>

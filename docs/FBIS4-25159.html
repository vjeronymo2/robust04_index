			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Song Jian </F> (1345 0256) and XINHUA reporter Chu Baoping (2806 0202 1627)]    [Text] Beijing, 6 Jun (XINHUA) -- At the National Work  Conference on Radio Administration in Beijing today, Zou Jiahua,  vice premier and chairman of the State Radio Regulatory  Committee [SRRC], stressed that it is necessary to step up radio  administration and push forward the development of radio  services.    Zou Jiahua pointed out: China has made tremendous progress  in radio administration over the decades, especially in the  dozen or so years since we began implementing the policy of  reform and opening up to the outside world. However,  development has also brought to light the existing system's  problems and inadequacies, the prominent ones being overlapping  government organs, sluggish management, lack of coordination in  the organizational and command structure, and a monitoring  system that needs strengthening. These problems may stand in  the way of the development of China's radio services if we do  not face up to and resolve them with persistent efforts.    He pointed out: The "PRC Regulations on Radio  Administration"  promulgated last September provide the fundamental legal basis  for China's radio administration. The "regulations'" basic  guidelines are their emphasis on centralized and unified  leadership and their call for stepping up centralized and  unified administration and for stepping up legislation,  planning, and construction of technical facilities. He stressed  that the "regulations" are a set of administrative rules. Radio  administrative departments at all levels must implement them  earnestly in the light of their actual conditions and in  accordance with the principles of administering according to law  and strictly enforcing the law and punishing lawbreakers.  Penalty for typical violations such as defying supervision or  ignoring administrative rules and regulations should be publicly  announced.    He said: After the regulations were promulgated, it became  necessary to sort out relevant regulations and formulate  supplementary ones. The rules that are to be formulated by the  localities and departments, including the specific regulations  which the "regulations" referred to as necessary, must not  deviate from the principles set in the "regulations." Earnest  efforts should be made to sort out the regulations that were  formulated by the localities and departments before the  "regulations" were promulgated.    Speaking of structural readjustment, he pointed out: One  important aspect of the ongoing structural readjustment is  stepping up centralized and unified administration, with the  emphasis on the central and provincial levels. The  responsibility and powers of these two levels should be  enhanced. Instead of radio regulatory committees, an provincial  radio regulatory committee agency will be set up at prefectural  and city levels. All royalties for use of radio frequencies  should be sent to treasuries at the central and local levels.  The treasuries will appropriate radio administrative  departments' operating expenses.    He concluded: Emphasizing unified management does not mean  that the SRRC will take charge of everything. Matters such as  general principles, legislation, law enforcement, frequency  distribution, geographical distribution of transmitters,  frequency planning, and organization of overall airwaves  monitoring must be handled by the state under unified  leadership. The purpose of readjusting radio administration is  to step up administration and to advance the development of  radio services. Whenever the phrase "stepping up  administration" is mentioned, we must refrain from exercising  rigid control and excessive interference to the extent of  stifling and restricting the development of radio services.  Administration and development should be closely interrelated  and mutually complementary.    On behalf of the SRRC, Wu Jichuan, vice chairman of the SRRC  and minister of posts and telecommunications, delivered a report  on the significance, methods, and requirements of the  readjustment of the radio administration structure and  departments. Kui Fulin, vice chairman of the SRRC and assistant  to chief of general staff; Zhang Kezhi, vice chairman of the  SRRC and deputy secretary general of the State Council; and  other SRRC members were present at the meeting.</p>

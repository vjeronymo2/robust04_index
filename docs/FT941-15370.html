			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Tories divided over Westminster effect on May elections With Britain's local council elections just four months away, allegations of gerrymandering by Westminster city councillors could not have come at a worse time for the Tory party. But in the face of newspaper headlines about how the Conservative-held council sold homes for votes, Tory MPs remain divided over how much damage the allegations would do to the party in May's polls. The most pessimistic assessment came from an MP who, until this week's events, had thought that the Conservatives would fare very badly in May's elections. 'It now appears that we will be utterly wiped out,' he said, recalling that the Conservatives control only one metropolitan council outside London. His fear was that, like the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry, the accusation of gerrymandering would hang over the Tories until it was resolved in the courts. 'This kind of activity involves moving so-called socially inadequate people out of your borough and into another,' he claimed. 'When people realise what these allegations are about they will be utterly disgusted.' No Tory MP questioned the seriousness of the accusations against Dame Shirley Porter, the former Westminster council chairman, and her colleagues. But several had grounds for thinking that the political damage could be contained. One backbencher said Mr John Magill, the district auditor in Westminster, had acted unwisely when criticising councillors this week. The MP echoed remarks by Lord Hailsham, the former lord chancellor, that 'grave charges ought not to be made unless the person accused has the right to rebut'. He added: 'There needs to be a big debate about the whole process by which district auditors investigate these matters.' In a robust radio interview, Lord Tebbit, the former Conservative party chairman, put the point more bluntly. 'What we know is that an accountant has made certain allegations about politics,' he said. 'What we also know is that Westminster council has been an excellent council.' Other MPs believed that Tory campaigners would have plenty of ammunition with which to highlight potentially illegal practices by councillors in Labour-held boroughs. One MP recalled a district auditor's report last May claiming that Lambeth council in London was owed Pounds 173m in unpaid rent, poll tax and debts. 'By not collecting rent, Lambeth ensures that Labour voters stay in the borough,' he said. 'I just don't see how that is worse than what might have happened in Westminster.' He recalled that Mr Herbert Morrison, a prominent member of the post-war Labour government, had threatened to 'build the Conservatives' out of London by constructing council houses. Dame Shirley had simply done the opposite, he said. 'Since the war, Labour and Tory governments have had housing policies which resulted in advantageous voting swings in key constituencies,' he said. But he was realistic, too, about the political consequences of this week's scandals on the local elections, which will help to determine whether Mr John Major survives the year as prime minister. 'A great deal of mud has been flying around,' he said, 'and it's mud that will probably stick.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE THIN BLUE LINE What the Conservatives are defending in May's council elections  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- English metropolitan districts (36 councils)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------       Conservative                         1       Labour                              25       Hung                                10  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- English non-metropolitan districts (114 councils)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------       Conservative                        20       Labour                              41       Liberal Democrat                     7       Hung                                45       Independent                          1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Welsh districts (4 councils)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------       Labour                               4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- London boroughs (32 councils)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------       Conservative                        11       Labour                              15       Liberal Democrat                     3       Hung                                 3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Scottish regions/islands (12 councils)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------       Labour                               4       Independent                          4       Hung                                 3       Other                                1  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

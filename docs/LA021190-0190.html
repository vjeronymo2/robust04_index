			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPILL AT A GLANCE THE SPILL  </P> <P> Ship: American Trader.  </P> <P> Oil spilled: Nearly 400,000 gallons, Southern California's biggest in two  decades.  </P> <P> When: About 4:30 p.m. Wednesday.  </P> <P> Where: Washing ashore along a 14-mile stretch as far north as Seal Beach.  Several fingers of the slick were within two miles of Long Beach.  </P> <P> Ocean depth: As little as 50 feet in some spots in the sea berth, 60 feet or  more in area where ship maneuvers.  </P> <P> How: Coast Guard suspects the ship ran over its port anchor while maneuvering  into a U-shaped nest of seven mooring buoys off Huntington Beach. As crew  pulled up anchor, it apparently wrapped around bow and put two holes and a dent  in the starboard bottom of hull. Ship also may have hit sea bottom, causing  anchor to puncture hull.  </P> <P> The slick: At least 60 square miles. About 10% of the oil was recovered by  skimmer boats.  </P> <P> Oil left: Damaged tank still contains more than 19.32 million gallons of oil,  but it apparently is not leaking. Steel and wood patches are likely to be  placed over the two holes in the tanker by early this week.  </P> <P> THE SHIP  </P> <P> Built: In 1969 by Sun Shipbuilders and Drydock Inc. of Philadelphia, now  defunct. Named America Sun. Acquired by American Trading Transport Co. Inc. on  July 11, 1989, and renamed American Trader. Chartered by British Petroleum Co.  of North America, which was operating it at time of spill.  </P> <P> Width: 125 feet.  </P> <P> Length: 800 feet.  </P> <P> Hull depth: 42 or more feet below water surface at time of incident.  </P> <P> Anchor: More than 10 feet long.  </P> <P> Oil capacity: 23 million gallons. More than a dozen tanks, some of them for  ballast and ship waste. Fully loaded at time of incident.  </P> <P> Itinerary: Planned to unload more than 12 million gallons at the sea berth,  where a pipeline connects to a Santa Fe Springs Refinery. The rest was to be  delivered to the Port of Long Beach.  </P> <P> THE CLEANUP  </P> <P> Offshore: At least 13 skimmer boats are on scene. Coast Guard was also there to  monitor operation.  </P> <P> Beaches: As oil comes ashore, cleanup crew in slickers use absorbent pads on  sand. More than 500 workers were scheduled to be involved in the cleanup by  today.  </P> <P> Preventive measures: Rubberized booms have been set up to keep oil from  estuaries at Bolsa Chica State Reserve, Anaheim Bay, Upper Newport Bay and  Santa Ana River.  </P> <P> Options: Officials have ruled out chemical dispersants, which break up the  slick. Dispersants can reduce the chance that oil will wash ashore but cannot  be used in shallow areas because of possible toxic effects on bottom-dwelling  organisms, fish or shellfish.  </P> <P> Birds: Sixty-six oil-covered shore birds washed up after spill, 31 of them  dead. If slick reaches Bolsa Chica wetlands at north end of Huntington Beach,  it could be devastating to one of California's largest ecological reserves.  California brown pelican, California least tern, the light-footed clapper rail  and the salt marsh bird's beak, an upper marsh coastal plant, are endangered  species in the wetlands.  </P> <P> Other wildlife: One dead sea lion washed ashore in Huntington Beach Saturday  night, but it was unclear late Saturday whether oil caused the death. The oil  could take a deadly toll on fish and perhaps marine mammals such as sea lions.  Oil mats mammals' fur, making them susceptible to cold and less buoyant. About  30 seals were spotted Friday on mooring buoys near the tanker but apparently  were unharmed. More critically endangered may be tiny links in aquatic food  chain -- anchovies, mussels and barnacles.  </P> <P> Source: U.S. Coast Guard, Times staff  </P></p>

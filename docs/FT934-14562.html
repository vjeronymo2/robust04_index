			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A LITTLE life was breathed into Footsie futures trading yesterday, writes Christine Buckley. However, as the activity comprised a slide followed by a rally, the December contract ended the day in exactly the same shape as it had started it, The opening of the contract on the FT-SE 100 surprised some traders who had expected a weak start reflecting the poor sentiment over recent economic data. The contract began up at 3,109 but the positive start soon diminished and swiftly moved into a slide. With dealers becoming nervous and starting to open arbitrage positions, the contract slipped below the 3,100 mark and continued down. For a substantial part of the morning session it traded below fair value. The bleakest point came about three hours into the session when the contract touched 3,087. But after lunch a ripple of optimism moved through the market fuelled by hopes of a strong Wall Street opening and the resurgence of interest-rate-cut hopes. The contract's closing at 3,109 - 6 points below the day's high - marked a 3 point lead over the fair value premium to cash which is about 21 points. The afternoon optimism continued with after-hours business reported as brisk. Traded options had moderate volume at 30,188. In stock options Cable and Wireless was most traded at 1,874 lots.</p>

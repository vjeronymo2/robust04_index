			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Observer: Public relations A BBC television play called The Vision Thing, which is due for screening in October, must be causing some stage fright at one high-flying City public relations firm. The play concerns a clever young PR flack whose smooth charm lands him the job of spokesman for the Tory party. One thing leads to another, and, as a reward for a spot of deceit and cover-up at election time, he is given the job of foreign secretary. Sad to say this promising career comes to an abrupt halt in a now predictable way. His illicit affair with a glamorous young interior decorator is exposed after their pillow-talk is bugged by GCHQ and subsequently picked up by a retired building society manager who also happens to be an amateur radio operator. Not much to worry about in that - except that the central role is played by one Nathaniel Parker, son of Sir Peter Parker, chairman of the Young Vic, and brother of Alan Parker, the smooth-talking boss of Brunswick, the City PR firm whose rapid rise to fame was crowned by its handling of the BT3 flotation. So uncanny is the resemblance that viewers who switch on half way through might even think they are watching a cinema verite documentary about the comeuppance of Alan. One only hopes they will be properly able to distinguish fact from fiction.</p>

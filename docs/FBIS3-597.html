This follows discussions between the union and ANC  leader Nelson Mandela this morning.    According to the ANC's plan, black farmers should own 30  percent of agricultural land within 5 years. The agricultural  union says this means that about 25 million hectares will be  handed over, leading to the large-scale disruption of  agricultural production.</p>

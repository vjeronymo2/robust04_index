			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Second Friday sermon by Ayatollah Khamene'i, leader of the </F> Islamic revolution, at Tehran University on 18 February --  recorded]    [Excerpts] In the name of God, the Compassionate, the  Merciful. [passage omitted]    First I feel obliged to thank the honorable Iranian nation  with all my being--an aware nation, a nation with a sense of  timing, a nation which recognizes its enemy, a nation which is  grateful for God's great bounties--for their demonstration of  power on 11 February before the eyes of friends and foes the  world over. We, who know about the world issues, and are aware  of them, somewhat more than the general public, understood the  strength of the blow that was delivered to the propaganda which  the enemies of the Islamic republic of Iran had started a few  months ago.    When they start the adverse propaganda they start it  together  since the other side is but one front. Those Zionist and  arrogant news agencies--those famous agencies from whom all news  reports and analyses are taken by all the world broadcasting  aerials--and several radio stations which spend millions every  year perchance to be able to get their voice across to a few  people in Iran. The translators and presenters write, they  employ people, they spend on technical things, spend on  publicity, spend on writing, make policies, and spend much money  to get that voice across to Iran, so that maybe a few  individuals here and there listen to it and be influenced by it.    Beginning several months ago they began whispers--of course  that is not new either, but once in a while they begin an  onslaught--to the effect that the people no longer have anything  to do with the revolution and Islam in Iran. The people are fed  up with Islam. Look how badly the Islamic Republic of Iran's  authorities have acted that the people have even put aside Islam.    Domestically, too, some were repeating those sentences. They  still will do so, let me tell you! Unfortunately in our very  universities--I say this to the Hizbollahi students so that they  know--there are such motives here and there. Of course the  majority of the lecturers are good; are faithful; support the  development and advancement of this nation; support the Islamic  revolution and the holy system of the Islamic republic. But you  can't say that there are no sly ones either. In those same  universities there are some people--of course they are very few,  very few--who try to give this issue a philosophical form,  saying that since the Islamic Republic came to power Islam  weakened. There cannot be a more blatant lie and trick.    Islam's acme was reached all over the world with the  creation  of the Islamic Republic of Iran.    They want to portray the situation in an exactly opposite  way. They want to say that the Islamic Republic, the formation  of an Islamic state, and the delivery of the crushing blow of  Islam and the Koran to the mouth of the enemy are all causing  Islam harm. If this had been so, then the prophet and the lord  of the faithful ['Ali, the first Shiite imam] would not have  formed a government, and the leaders of the Islamic community at  the advent of Islam would have just sat in their homes. What  need was there then for forming a government? If an Islamic  government was harmful for the delivery of Islam's message, then  why did the prophet go to all that trouble and engage himself in  so many wars in which so many people lost their lives? You can  now see for yourselves how ignorant they are about Islam.    Sometimes words such as these are disseminated by a certain  radio station belonging to one of the world's disgraced and ugly  groups. This can be blamed on that group's ignorance, or the  fact that it is not part of this community. But some people in  this very Islamic homeland utter such meaningless words.    Anyway, the nation did what it had to do at a highly  appropriate time. It came out on 11 February and amazed them.  They were left speechless. What could they say, after all?  The huge streets of Tehran, Azadi Square, and all towns and  cities were filled with a massive crowd. This was the case even  in those towns which the enemy wants to portray as having  disputes with the Islamic system. The serious and resolute faces  of the people of these towns were clearly visible. The enemies  and the others witnessed how cohesively the Iranian nation was  conducting its movement.    I tell you here that, in the world of today, there is not  even one other single government -- whether among the major  powers such as America or the smaller powers -- which has the  capability to mobilize its nation in such a magnificent way to  participate in a national and ideological event. This is  something which only the Islamic Republic of Iran is able to  accomplish.    Another point is that there is an onslaught against Muslims  in the world, brothers and sisters, and Muslims should realize  that they are being attacked from all sides. Even if a country  is left alone in a corner of the world, it should not think that  it is so; there is an onslaught against Islam and Muslims. Of  course, the clear example of this is the great tragedy of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is really strange, it is unprecedented.    Those Serbs and Croats, backed by the British, certain  European Governments, and America, have outdone the usurping  Zionists of Israel in creating tragedies and cruelty. [passage  omitted]    Today all the events are seen in American and European  magazines and press and television, and the hardhearted West and  the arrogant and unjust governments are sitting around -- having  first equipped the oppressor, doing everything for him, and  giving him plenty of scope -- waiting for the strong to cut off  the head of the weak, from ear to ear. Every once in a while  they say a few things, hold a conference, and so forth; it is  all empty talk.    Of course, Islamic governments are not all that faultless.  Some have behaved well. The Iranian Nation and Government have  behaved better than all. Some others have behaved well and some  badly. Otherwise, if Islamic governments had said to those who  support the Serbs that they would sever ties and stop trading  with them for a month, things would not be as they are. They  were negligent.    In any case, it is a big event. Of course, God willing, you  will see -- the whole world will see -- in the future that this  event will be beneficial to Islam in Europe and harmful to  arrogant European powers.    The nature of this event is such that in future years  [pauses] God willing, this will pave the way for the revival of  Islam and the situation of Islam in Europe. That is one example  of the onslaught. Another example is Palestine, occupied  Palestine. Today Israelis, before the eyes of the world, have  usurped Palestine and have imprisoned, tortured, convicted,  forced into exile, and dropped bombs on Palestinians and the  world remains silent. Moreover, the world condemns the oppressed  people, saying: Why you do such things? When I say the world, I  mean the world of arrogance -- that is, America in the first  place, which is the most wicked and malicious of them all,  followed by those who follow America.    What is happening in Lebanon is a struggle against the  usurper Zionist enemy that has usurped both Palestine and parts  of Lebanon. Instead of asking the usurper why it has usurped,  the world criticizes the people who are defending their homes,  asking them: Why are you defending them? See what a filthy new  world order is dominating the world. Is that the new world  order they were speaking about? A bullying thug enters the  house of a group of orphan children, occupies their home, takes  away their facilities, foodstuffs, their comfortable rooms,  their bedrooms, occupies the whole space of their house, and  imprisons the occupants of the house in a cellar, for example,  and sets restrictions on them. As soon as an opportunity arises  for those children to cry out and ask why, he gets angry,  saying: You always speak of struggle, why do you not think of  peace? Why you are so ill-humored? You see, that is the  situation of the world today. They carry out acts of aggression  and mass murder against Muslims, and the mass murderers are  encouraged, as has happened in Kashmir and Tajikistan. They  collaborate to destroy Islam. But when Muslims open their  mouths once, they say: For God's sake, you always speak of  struggle. You are always ill-humored. That is the way things  are. They have begun a dangerous and violent confrontation  against Islam. Of course this confrontation that, despite going  on strongly for around 10 to 12 years and being properly  planned, has, God be praised, created more problems for  arrogance and has made life more difficult for it. Each day  world arrogance becomes more disappointed and the governments  that support it become more hesitant. That is the way things  are. Muslims of the world should know this, and you, the Muslim  nation of Iran, should also know that Islamic Iran is where  Islam can speak forcefully.    Appreciate such power, glory, and independence. Appreciate  the capability of this nation and this government to express  their feelings about any power. Others do not have such a  capability. God be praised, we have increased our capability in  that respect day by day. We have become stronger each day,  thanks to almighty God. the enemy, with all its power, has  become frustrated in its confrontation with Islam. Our nation  should appreciate this, our government should appreciate this,  officials should appreciate this. Do not distance yourselves  from Islam. We should not forget the enemy. We had the test of  11 February, in which our nation performed well. We also have  the Jerusalem Day test, toward the end of the month of Ramadan,  to come.    A couple of times each year, God be praised, we have such  general demonstrations and shows of the Islamic Iran's strength.  One is performed better than the other. You should not forget  Jerusalem Day, and, of course, the path of being steadfast in  this arena is to maintain a close link with God, so that God  almighty does not deny us his bounty and mercy.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [UK press release from the Scottish Office : "Latest AIDS </F> Figures for Scotland"]    [Text] An additional four AIDS cases were reported in  Scotland during August making the cumulative total 422. The  figures issued by The Scottish Office show that no further  deaths from the disease were reported during August, the  cumulative total therefore remains at 284.    In the UK the number of reported cases of AIDS has risen to  8001 - an increase of 159 over the July 1993 figures. The total  number of deaths from the disease reached 5047 last month  compared with 4893 in July.    Of the 422 reported cases in Scotland 45 percent are related  to sexual intercourse between men and 32 percent to injecting  drug use. The comparable figures for the rest of the UK are 76  percent and three percent, respectively.  <H5>  Notes to News Editors </H5>   1. Details of the process of compiling this data and the  categories used are available on request.    2. Epidemiological surveillance of the Acquired Immune  Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) was begun at the PHLS Communicable  Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC) in collaboration with the  Communicable Diseases (Scotland) Unit (CD(S)U) in 1982. The  figures announced today are the cumulative totals of cases  reported. The case definitions of AIDS compiled by the US  Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia are used for  classifying and recording the UK case reports.    3. Because of the nature of the reporting system, the number  of cases of AIDS reported each month does not accurately reflect  the number of cases diagnosed during the period.    4. It should be noted however that in view of the long  interval between infection with HIV and the development of AIDS,  the trends of AIDS cases and deaths and their distribution  between risk groups are not indicators of the current progress  of spread of HIV infection.    5. News releases setting out the latest Scottish AIDS  figures are issued by The Scottish Office Information  Directorate at monthly intervals. Quarterly breakdowns of known  HIV antibody positives are issued with the AIDS figures in the  month which follows the quarter to which they refer.</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Letter: Maxwell woe Sir, I write at your invitation to clarify a comment in Bronwen Maddox's interview with me ('Bumpy transition for a lord of the City', August 5) which has been misinterpreted by a number of newspapers. The reported quote concerning those 'double-crossed' by Robert Maxwell was not, of course, directed at Mirror Group pensioners and shareholders who tragically suffered at his hands, but at those in the City and industry who dealt with and were taken in by him. Stevens, chairman, United Newspapers, 245 Blackfriars Road, London SE1 9UY</p>

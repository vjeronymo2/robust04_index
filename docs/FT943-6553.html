			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Shoppers make a day of Sunday trading Shoppers were out in force yesterday, the first Sunday when stores could open legally under the Sunday Trading Act to sell a full range of goods. Many customers would find it difficult to notice the difference because some of the supermarkets, DIY stores and out-of-town retailers have been opening on Sundays for some time. Only three big retailers were open for the first time. They were Marks and Spencer, Waitrose and House of Fraser. For many people it was a Bank holiday family day out, particularly at shopping centres where free entertainment and shows were laid on. Mr Paul Keenan, a spokesman for Gateshead's MetroCentre, which has spent about Pounds 50,000 on publicity, said: 'It's been very, very busy and we reckon it could well turn out to be the second-busiest day of the week after Saturday.' Trade union concerns about Sunday trading appear to have eased. The chief fear was that employees might be forced to work on Sunday against their will, or face the sack. But all shopworkers, including part-timers and those with less than two years' service, are protected under the Sunday Trading Act from enforced Sunday work. The only exceptions are those who contract to work exclusively on Sundays. Usdaw, the shopworkers union, is happy with the act but is advising shopworkers not to sign agreements to work on Sundays unless satisfied with the terms and conditions. The Keep Sunday Special Campaign was less phlegmatic. It said many staff were coming under pressure to agree to work on Sundays.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Chetverik: "Currency Exchange Rates and </F> Ukrainian Exports"]    [Text] A paradoxical situation has taken shape in Ukraine  with regard to currency exchange rates. At this time there are  actually three different rates--the fixed rate, the market rate,  and the rate resulting from the relationship of world prices to  the domestic prices of goods, which is different for each  producer. The potential impact of this situation on Ukrainian  exports is everyone's concern.    An agency of the Ukrainian Ministry of External Economic  Relations assessed the export potential of the main types of  industrial commodities in 1994. Table 1 illustrates the results.

Besides  this, there will also be some emphasis on machine building. They  should account for most of the receipts. Nevertheless, there is  some indication of wishful thinking here. Profitability, after  all, is one of the essential conditions of exports, and no one  must ever forget that enterprises have to sell 50 percent of  their foreign currency receipts to the state at the fixed rate.  This puts producers in vastly different positions, because the  production costs of all of these commodities are different, but  the 50 percent of the foreign currency receipts remaining at the  disposal of the enterprises must cover all of the expenses of  reproduction and produce a certain amount of profit as well.  Obviously, if these conditions are not met, the export of the  commodity becomes unprofitable. This means that exports of some  of the commodities listed in Table 1 or exports as a whole might  be reduced considerably or be discontinued. The reader can judge  the validity of this statement for himself. The figures in Table  1 and the results of simple computations, presented in Table 2,  illustrate the current situation quite clearly.    Table 2   Categories            Finished     Cast iron    Ferroalloys    Steel pipe   Carbamide    Polystyrene                        rolled                        metal   Average price per     225          92           380            400          84           734  tonne in world  market (dollars)   Average producer      6.5          2.851        10.925         5.442        1.760        11.6  price in domestic  market (millions of  karbovantsy/tonne)   Average producer  price   per tonne at fixed    515.5        226          866            432          139.6        919.9  rate of 12,610 krb  = $1   per tonne at market   151          66.3         254            127          41           270  rate of 43,000 krb  = $1   Dollar exchange       28,960       31,000       28,750         13,605       20,950       15,800  rate based on  relationship of  world price to  producer price,  thousands of krb/$1    Producer's receipts  from sale of  currency   at fixed rate of      140,000      580,000      240,000        2,522,000    500,000      460,000  12,610 krb = $1   at market rate of     4,800,000    2,000,000    8,200,000      8,600,000    1,800,000    1,590,000  43,000 krb = $1      We should stipulate from the very start that any price set  by  a producer in karbovantsy will include a certain profit margin  and all overhead expenses, including the cost of using obsolete  equipment and inefficient production technology.    An analysis of the figures in Table 2 suggests the  following:    1. Goods cannot be exported at prices set with consideration  for the fixed exchange rate of the dollar, because these prices  would be much higher than world prices. In other words, the  fixed rate and inflationary processes distort actual enterprise  expenses by exaggerating them. It is also impossible, however,  to export a commodity at a price set with consideration for the  market exchange rate of the dollar, because this would be much  lower than the world price and consequently would be a dumping  price.    2. The undifferentiated approach to enterprises in different  industries which export their products and sell 50 percent of  their foreign currency receipts at the fixed rate will reduce  exports of the products of the metallurgical complex because the  income the enterprises earn will not cover their production  costs at the present market exchange rate of the dollar. Exports  of products of the chemical industry, on the other hand,  probably will increase even under the conditions of the  compulsory sale of 50 percent of the foreign currency receipts  at the fixed rate. This is due to the high world prices, the  fairly low production expenses of producers, and the high market  exchange rate of the foreign currency.    3. In view of the fact that the projected export figures for  the metallurgical complex are much higher than the projections  of other industries, we can assume that enterprises of the  metallurgical complex play a cardinal role in the determination  of the market exchange rate. This means that unless the fixed  rate is adjusted and the requirement for the compulsory sale of  50 percent of foreign currency receipts at this rate is  cancelled, enterprises of the metallurgical complex will have an  incentive to increase the market value of the dollar and will  strive to do this, because this will give them a chance (their  only chance) to cover their own expenses, earn a good income,  and increase their output.    Finally, if the National Bank could start buying foreign  currency at the effective enterprise or industry rate, this  would benefit the producers and the state. Furthermore, this  probably would aid in stabilizing the exchange rate of the  Ukrainian karbovanets.</p>

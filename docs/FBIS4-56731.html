			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 6 May (NOTIMEX) -- A demonstration by  students who were protesting the death of one of their  classmates yesterday overshadowed the nine-hour meeting held by  the presidents of Venezuela and Colombia.    Barely two blocks away from Miraflores presidential palace,  Fermin Toro High School students who were holding a vigil for  slain student German Sotillo, whom police shot to death, became  too excited and clashed with the public security forces.    Presidents Cesar Gaviria and Rafael Caldera had to meet  exclusively at Miraflores and not at the Foreign Ministry, where  the signing of a joint document had been scheduled.    Even though the authorities were able to momentarily  dissuade  the demonstrators, who were protesting because bus drivers were  not accepting preferential fares for students, clashes became  more intense during the afternoon, when Sotillo was buried.    Following the funeral at a cemetery in this capital attended  by approximately 5,000 high school students and people from  various social organizations, violence returned to the streets  of downtown Caracas, but there were no reports of casualties.    The Judicial Technical Police, in a last-minute report,  stated the officer who fired the shots that killed Sotillo and  wounded three other students confessed and was immediately  arrested so that homicide charges would be brought against him.  However, that announcement was unable to calm the angry  students, whose protests spread to at least three other high  schools in this capital.    In view of the prevailing tension and following the  transportation sector's announcement to increase general bus  fares, the students, including university students, announced  that more protests were planned.</p>

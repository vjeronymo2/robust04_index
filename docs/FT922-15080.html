			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / EC oil 'breaking embargo on Haiti' THE US administration has complained to European Community governments that shipments of oil from Europe are undermining an embargo aimed at restoring President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power in Haiti. The embargo was established by the Organisation of American States after the military overthrow of Fr Aristide six months ago. But significant shipments of oil, mainly from Europe, have rendered much of the embargo ineffective and are seen by the US State Department as lifting the coup leaders' confidence in their ability to resist international pressure. 'The latest information we have is that there are more tankers in the harbour than they can unload,' said a senior state department official. Shipments had come from France, Britain, Germany and other countries. Sanctions by the EC would be useful in keeping pressure on the government in Port au Prince, the official said. However, when the US had made representations to EC governments, 'we were given all sorts of reasons why sanctions were not possible.' For example, the US was told that European sanctions would require six months' notice of implementation under the terms of the Lome convention, which grants developing countries privileged access to EC markets. The latest known oil deliveries to Haiti were 10 days ago by two vessels under the Norwegian and Danish flags. They unloaded fuel products expected to last three weeks. An even steadier supply of goods for Haiti has been crossing its border with the Dominican Republic. Trade in petrol and other fuels, food and consumer durables has become a lucrative venture for the Dominican military, despite the government's public adherence to the embargo.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Solidarity Chairman Marian Krzaklewski by </F> Jerzy Pawlas; place and date not given: "We Do Not Want To  Strike"]    [Excerpts] [Pawlas] We are supposed to have left the  recession behind, and yet this year's budget makes it look as if  we are still in the depths of the recession.    [Krzaklewski] Recession means a fall in the GNP. But the  GNP has been rising in recent years. In 1992 it rose by 1.9  percent, and in 1993 it rose by 4 percent. Industrial output  has risen even more. In a situation like this, every trade  union has the right and duty to demand wage rises in the  production sphere. Wages should rise faster than prices. We  included this postulate in the "accords to compensate the  increase in the cost of living," in other words the Enterprise  Pact. The provisions are clear. An increase in real wages in  the production sphere cannot be less than half the increase in  the GNP. The pact has been signed into law, but not only is the  present government failing to implement this law, it is ignoring  it altogether. In view of this, every self-respecting trade  union must dictate harsh terms to the government, including the  possibility of a general strike. Therefore we demand an  increase in real wages, at least to offset the increased living  costs, because the country is experiencing an economic growth.  A preliminary analysis of the 1994 draft budget shows that  there is a danger that the real incomes of families will fall  even further. We cannot agree to that, all the more so because  1993 was another year of economic growth. And that is the main  reason for our demonstration on 9 February.    [Pawlas] Governments are not accustomed to adhere to pacts.  That is a tradition dating to communist times. However, they do  tend to lay down so-called social guarantees, a process that can  last for months. So what is the point of establishing pacts  when the budget is empty?    [Krzaklewski] I fear that unless the philosophy behind  fiscal policy changes soon, there will be continued talk of  empty budgets over the next few years, despite the increase in  output. Also, an increasingly greater proportion of the GNP is  going to be swallowed by the so-called gray economic zone and by  investors. The rich will get richer, and the poor poorer.  [passage omitted]    [Pawlas] The defense industry has staged a strike, and the  miners are demanding higher wages. Can the 9 February  demonstration be regarded as a forerunner to a general strike?    [Krzaklewski] Yes, if the government fails to adjust the  socioeconomic program laid down in the 1994 draft budget, and if  it fails to implement the whole of the 1992-93 social pact,  known as the Enterprise Pact, within a reasonable time, such as  by the end of March 1994. I hope we do not reach a situation in  which we have to declare a strike.    Our postulates concerning the budget and Enterprise Pact are  possible for the government and parliament to fulfill, and their  fulfillment will stabilize the social situation. We also insist  that the government fulfill not more than 10 percent of the  preelection promises of the coalition parties.</p>

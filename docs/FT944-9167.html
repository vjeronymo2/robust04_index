			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (19): A symbol of modernisation - Milan Stock Exchange / Andrew Hill discusses the new stock index future The fact that Italians already trade futures on government bonds, but are only now getting round to establishing a future on the equity index tells you a lot about Italian markets. Government bonds have long been the investment instrument of choice for Italians, particularly for savings. The market is popular and liquid. But the equity market has been viewed with some suspicion. The fact that a small number of stocks are quoted - only 210 domestic companies are listed compared with twice that number in Germany and France, and eight times in the UK - coupled with a perceived absence of regulation (a law to make insider trading illegal was only introduced comparatively recently, for instance), seemed to make it a market for the brave professional. In that sense, the introduction of a future on the revamped index of most liquid Italian stocks - the MIB 30 - is being heralded by the stock exchange authorities as the latest and most important symbol of the modernisation of the Milan-based market. It is no coincidence that a presentation on the new equity derivatives market was at the centre of the Italian investment road show in London and New York. The road show also promoted developments such as the move to full screen-based trading of equities, and the gradual transformation from a monthly account system to five-day rolling settlement. The futures market should be launched 'on or around' November 28, according to Ettore Fumagalli, who heads the stock exchange's equity derivatives committee, and the first product will be the MIB 30 index future. The contract will have a face value of L100m - calculated by multiplying the base value of the underlying index (fixed at 10,000 points) by the L10,000 value of each index point, which will also be the minimum price variation of the contract. Trading will take place between 9.30am and 5.30pm (compared with the equity market itself which, from November 28, will trade between 10am and 5pm). Settlement will be in cash. Potential traders seem broadly optimistic about the prospects for Italian equity derivatives. Some 70 Sims (locally registered securities houses) have signed up to trade on the computerised market. 'I'm very confident,' says one trader with a foreign bank. 'I'm also happy that a limited number of companies has requested machines, because, frankly, the requirements of Consob (the financial market regulator) on capital backing were too low.' In the next phase, the stock exchange authorities hope to introduce an option on the MIB 30 index, and then, probably early next year, options on single shares. The stock exchange's forecasts on trading volume of the new future are comparatively modest - daily volume of L412bn, half that of the total underlying volume, with around 2,750 contracts traded in about 900 transactions - but the exchange says the impact on the liquidity of the underlying market should be notable. 'There should be a positive effect on volumes,' agrees Alberto Pasqualone, chief trader at Sigeco in Milan. In this respect, the introduction of the future comes at exactly the right time. This has been one of the most volatile years in recent memory for the Italian market, which has taken its lead from the constantly changing political scene. Immediately after the March election of a pro-business right-wing coalition, headed by media magnate Silvio Berlusconi, equities surged ahead, prompting a string of opportunistic rights issues. But since June, uncertainty about the coherence of that same coalition, and its robustness in the face of escalating industrial action, has brought the stock market back to pre-election levels or lower. 'International investors, who have been extremely active in the underlying market for the past year or so, have been particularly keen to be able to use futures and options, either to obtain or hedge their exposure, or to profit from the volatility of the market,' Mr Fumagalli told analysts during the London roadshow. The Italians are eager to emphasise that unlike in some other European trading centres, both the underlying market and the derivatives market use the same trading system and come under the same regulatory and management authority. 'Specifically, we believe that through these advantages, market participants will benefit from the possibility of creating integrated information, research and trading systems,' says Mr Fumagalli. Starting a new market not easy. Other fledgling futures and options markets have struggled with technical and trading problems - in Belgium, the new Belfox exchange took nearly two years from its 1991 launch to overcome teething troubles.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by O. A. Godin, D. Yu. Mikhin, and S. Ya. </F> Molchanov, Russian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Oceanology]    [Abstract] The author investigates the applicability of the  widely used approximation method for the description of acoustic  fields in moving media, which is commonly applied to the  measurement of ocean sound fields. The method, which is based on  Rayleigh's ``Theory of Sound,'' consists in replacing the the  actual moving medium with some immobile one, which has the  effective speed of sound, dependent on the speed of the current.    Analytical estimates were made of the error in determining  the phases and amplitudes of the rays arriving at the point of  observation. The validity of the estimates was confirmed by  simple models of the medium, with exponential laws on the  variation of the speed of the current and of the velocity of  sound, which made possible an accurate computation of the path  of the rays and eikonals. The validity of the estimates was also  confirmed by means of numerical modelling.    It was demonstrated that the main component of error in  calculating the level of sound pressure under conditions of  multiple rays is the error in the determination of the phase of  the field at the rays, and that this error increases with  distance. This knowledge made it possible to construct formulae  expressing the error, and thereby provided a simple method for  estimating the applicabiity of the approximation method in  calculating the intensity of an acoustic field. In conjunction  with these formulae the approximation method can be used  successfully.</p>

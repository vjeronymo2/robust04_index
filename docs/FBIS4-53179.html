			<p>CSO     [Text] Fuji Bank has decided to participate in multilateral  netting (multilateral settlements) which involves simultaneous  settlement between foreign banks of credit and debit balances  that arise in foreign exchange transactions. In July, Fuji Bank  will contribute capital to the netting agency and will initiate  transactions beginning in the first part of 1995. Since netting  reduces the credit risk in the event of a default by one of the  counterparties to the agreement, some commercial banks have  moved to sign agreements with U.S. banks, but this is the first  time that a Japanese bank has involved itself in a multilateral  agreement.    Fuji Bank will be participating in a multilateral netting  agreement scheduled to begin business in July and include 13  principal European banks such as Barclays Bank and Paris  National Bank and the Hong Kong-Shanghai Bank.    The plan calls for the 14 banks to jointly capitalize Echo  (headquartered in London), in the amount of several hundred  pounds and to deposit 10-20 million pounds with the agency  necessary for use as security to serve as the netting agency.    For example, if Fuji Bank in a transaction with Bank A has  receivables of $2 million and payables of 500 million yen and  effects transactions with Bank B for $2 million in payables and  1 million pounds in receivables, Fuji Bank can use the netting  system by paying the netting agency 500 million yen and  receiving 1 million pounds.    Even if Bank A should fail, risks can be minimized by  reducing Fuji Bank's credits as if it had received $2 million.    If a bank uses the netting system to offset credits and  debits, it can reduce its assets. The Bank for International  Settlements (BIS) is reviewing the possibility of recognizing  increases in bank equity through such methods of reducing assets.    Netting agreements are established in three forms; i.e.,  agreements that cover only one specific branch of a banking  system, agreements that cover all branches of a bank, and  agreements that cover several banks. Among city banks, there is  an agreement between the Bank of Tokyo and the Tokyo branch of  U.S. Citibank and the agreement which covers all branches of  Mitsubishi Bank and U.S. Chemical Bank.</p>

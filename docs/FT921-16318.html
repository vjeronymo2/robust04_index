			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: More companies to sponsor PEPs MORE COMPANIES are stepping forward to sponsor their own single company Personal Equity Plans, which became available to investors on January 1, writes Philip Coggan. Investors can put up to Pounds 3,000 in a single company PEP in any one tax year, on top of the Pounds 6,000 they can place in a general PEP. Income and capital gains are tax-free. As a rule, sponsored single company PEPs will offer lower charges than plans from independent managers.

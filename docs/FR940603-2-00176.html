See, e.g., Granular Polytetrafluoroethylene Resin from Italy, Preliminary Affirmative Determination of Circumvention of Antidumping Duty Order, 57 FR 43218 (September 18, 1992). However, in order to make an effective comparison, the Department must ascertain that it is using the appropriate value for the imported component. To that end, we provided the respondent with three options for demonstrating that the price of the wire strand imported by Camesa Inc. from Grupo Camesa represented a valid market price for use in our difference-in-value calculation. The options were as follows: (1) Sales prices for strand sold to unrelated parties in the home market and largest third country market; (2) purchase prices paid to unrelated suppliers in Mexico by Grupo Camesa for strand; or (3) monthly weighted-average manufacturing costs for strand sold to Camesa Inc. during the POI. In order for us to ascertain the value of the completed merchandise sold in the United States, we also requested that Camesa provide cost data relevant to the production of steel wire rope in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Camesa, however, failed to provide any of the requested information. Instead, Camesa provided a single price quotation from a supplier in a third country. Camesa's failure to provide the requested information prevented the Department from determining whether the difference between the value of the steel wire rope sold in the United States and the value of the strand produced in Mexico is small. Accordingly, the Department is required to rely on the best information available (BIA), pursuant to section 776(c) of the Tariff Act, to make the determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In deciding what to use as BIA, the Department's regulations at 19 CFR 353.37(b) state that the Department may take into account whether a party refuses to provide requested information. Thus, the Department may determine, on a case-by-case basis, what constitutes BIA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because Camesa refused to provide the requested information, as BIA, we preliminarily determine that the quantitative difference between the value of the finished steel wire rope sold in the United States and the value of the strand produced in Mexico is small. This eliminates the need for the Department's qualitative analysis of the nature of the processing Camesa Inc. performed in the United States. However, we note that the result of a qualitative analysis supports the BIA assumption that the difference between the value of the imported strand and the value of the finished rope is small, as discussed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

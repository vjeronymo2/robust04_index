			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Back to the task of Russia's future: Yeltsin leaves Vancouver facing a daunting agenda. Clinton departs to plaudits / Assessing the summit After his weekend meeting with Bill Clinton in Vancouver, Boris Yeltsin is returning to Moscow secure in the knowledge that he has the American president's unequivocal support. Assistance for the Yeltsin reform programme has now been enshrined in the Clinton declaration that it is 'the highest duty of all the western democracies' to come to Russia's aid. Vancouver was time out, and Mr Yeltsin looked and sounded the better for it. It was a little over a day and a half of lavish hospitality, high praise and smooth Canadian organisation which the Russian delegation accepted gratefully, if a little forlornly. Now comes the more difficult part, when the weary Russian president has to take on the tricky tasks at home vital to his political survival. Mr Yeltsin must first present the weekend's summit as a victory. That may prove more difficult than might be thought after securing a pledge of Dollars 1.6bn from the US (plus nearly another Dollars 400m pledged by Canada and Britain before Vancouver) and the promise of a multi-billion dollar package from Group of Seven leading industrialised nations before the end of the month. The problem is that such aid is regarded sceptically by many Russians and with hostility by Mr Yeltsin's opponents. Reactions range from doubt that it will be forthcoming to feelings of humiliation - a sentiment which Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, Mr Yeltsin's increasingly obstructive prime minister, expressed in a pre-summit interview. The president has been assisted in this presentational task by the cunning construction of the US package. It is, as Mr Yeltsin said on Sunday, a plan which accentuates co-operative aspects and stresses what each economy can do for the other. However, Mr Yeltsin must keep his political balance until the April 25 referendum, which will measure popular support for his continued leadership, his economic proposals and for holding early presidential and parliamentary elections. As Mr Clinton's aides have pointed out, the president has done little or no campaigning recently, beyond rather tense TV appearances at times of high drama. Upon his return from Vancouver, he must immediately take his case directly to the people, in the way he did so effectively nearly two years ago when he secured the presidency. He is immeasurably more tired than he was then and may be discouraged, but he has no choice if he is to emerge with a popular mandate. Yeltsin must also make clear what he will consider a victory in the referendum. Under the rules which the parliament proposed, it will require 50 per cent of the voting public not just to turn out, but to register assent for Yeltsin's propositions, before he can claim a victory. This is highly unlikely even with the tide turning in his favour. If the Constitutional Court does not rule this stipulation unconstitutional, then the Russian president faces a difficult choice. He must be prepared to ignore the court's decision and present a majority vote for himself as sufficient basis for a claim of victory, or he must revert to his original idea of holding his own vote, free of such qualifications. In any case, the Russian people must be made fully aware of what they are voting for, and what the stakes are. Mr Yeltsin said on Sunday that these stakes were formidably high - nothing less than the preservation and extension of freedom itself. The president will need to bring that message from Vancouver to Vladivostok, Voronezhh and Volgograd. If he wins the referendum, Yeltsin has no choice but to capitalise upon it immediately. He must resist the temptation to disengage himself from government as he did after his triumph over the attempted coup of August 1991. What is needed most urgently is for Yeltsin to implement the G7 funding package expected to be put before him after the group's finance and foreign ministers meet in Tokyo later this month. Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy premier in charge of the economy and finance, said on Sunday that 'everything depends on April 25'. Decisions on the control of the central bank and the bankruptcy of state enterprises await its outcome. A plan is ready, but the political support is lacking. Victory in the referendum must also be followed by the introduction of a constitution which clearly defines the balance of powers between president and parliament and allows both to develop effective and complementary responsibilities. This will surely be a long process as it has been elsewhere, including the US, where there was a gap of 13 years between the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the adoption of the constitution. Russia, however, cannot wait a decade and survive in one piece. There must be a workable resolution which will preserve the fissiparous federation and allow reasonably effective government in the short term. Mr Yeltsin must also define clearly his country's relationships with the other former Soviet states. These are currently in disarray. Russia cannot continue to advance credits to its neighbours as if they were its own regions. It must force them, in effect, to adopt their own currencies. At the same time it cannot treat them as political punch-bags to be battered whenever attention needs to be diverted from the faltering Russian economy. There must be a coldly rational process of defining national interests - but one which recognises interdependence among the former Soviet republics. The final task facing Mr Yeltsin is to provide a sense of hope to the Russian people, in whom he has placed his trust. In the past he tried and failed to provide a sense of optimism with unrealistic promises of rapid economic improvement. Instead he must use exhortation, example and openness. 'There is no alternative to me,' he said in Vancouver. 'There will be tomorrow, but not today.' But that will only be true if he makes himself indispensable to reform. Only if President Yeltsin nurtures the soil on which a worthy successor can grow will he be able to hand over power peacefully and with a sense of achievement.</p>

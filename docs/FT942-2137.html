			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Checklist for staying solvent - In a Nutshell Many insolvencies could be avoided if company directors were aware of mistakes made by other businesses. London consultants Ringrose have produced a checklist for directors based on a review of 250 insolvencies during the recession. More than a third of these companies could still be trading had they taken measures included in the checklist early enough, it is claimed. The list includes questions and skeleton solutions. It asks directors to plot 12 months' gross profit and fixed costs and see if the lines are converging; it asks whether directors always draw up cashflow forecasts to quantify the effects of accepting a large order; it suggests simple calculations of stock turn and trade receivables: if these fail to pass muster, it recommends management time be dedicated urgently to stock control and collection of bills. Checklist available from 071 383 4142.</p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Ofgas competition and tariffs director to return to DTI Mr Greg McGregor, Ofgas director of competition and tariffs, is to leave the gas industry regulator to take up a new post at the Department of Trade and Industry. His departure is seen by independent gas suppliers as a setback for plans by the government and Ofgas to open up the domestic gas market. 'This is a real blow as Greg was one of the few people in Ofgas with experience,' one executive from an independent gas company said. Mr McGregor's move to the deregulation unit of the DTI follows a series of difficulties encountered by Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Ofgas director-general. Ms Spottiswoode was recently the target of a smear campaign which centred on unfounded allegations about her private life and the closeness of her working relationship with Mr John Michell, a senior DTI official. Ofgas itself launched an unofficial probe in an attempt to find the source of the stories but has not made any announcement. Mr McGregor, employed by Ofgas for four years, was heavily involved in writing the recently published joint DTI-Ofgas consultation document on the introduction of competition in the domestic market. As the director of competition and tariffs he played a central role for Ofgas in its evidence to last year's Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation into the gas industry. One gas consultant said yesterday: 'Mr McGregor and Clare never really saw eye to eye.' He added that Mr McGregor had joined Ofgas at a time when Sir James McKinnon, then director-general, was at the height of his difficulties with British Gas. One of Ms Spottiswoode's first decisions as director-general was to abolish the post of deputy director-general. Mr McGregor's move leaves Ms Spottiswoode and Ms Eileen Marshall, chief economics adviser, as the most senior Ofgas staff. Ofgas said yesterday that Mr McGregor had spent four years at Ofgas on secondment from the DTI and that it was normal for him to be returning now. 'The DTI has a lot of work for him to do over there.' No decision has been made on his replacement and Ms Marshall will take over his duties meanwhile. An Ofgas official said yesterday that the long-awaited consultation paper on the rate of return British Gas will be allowed to earn from its transportation assets would be released early next week. He added: 'At the moment it is looking like it will be released on Monday. There are no surprises or anything radical.'</p>

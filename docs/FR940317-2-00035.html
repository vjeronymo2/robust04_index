The tariff sheets are proposed to be effective as set forth in Appendix A to the filing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TGPL states that on May 3, 1993 it submitted a Settlement in the referenced proceeding which, among other things, resolved cost-of-service, cost allocation, rate design and throughput mix for the period September 1, 1992 (the effective date of Docket No. RP92&hyph;137) through October 31, 1993 (the date immediately preceding the November 1, 1993 effective date of TGPL's Order No. 636 restructuring). On November 4, 1993 the Commission issued an order approving the Settlement (November 4 Order). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TGPL states that the tariff sheets submitted in the instant filing reflect the settlement rates approved by the November 4 Order updated to incorporate tracker filings made subsequent to the date the Settlement was filed (i.e. subsequent to May 3, 1993). The purpose of those filings was to track, under certain TGPL rate schedules, rate changes made effective by upstream providers of storage and transportation services. TGPL states that Appendix B to the filing includes workpapers which support the derivation of TGPL's settlement rates for those services affected by the aforementioned tracker filings. Also, TGPL has revised its historical imbalance tariff provisions (section 5.8 of Rate Schedules FT and IT) consistent with the directives set forth in the November 4 Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TGPL states that copies of the instant filing are being mailed to customers, State Commissions and other interested parties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with 18 CFR 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such protests should be filed on or before March 18, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Linwood A.

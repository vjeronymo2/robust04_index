			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STEAMED HOTDOG VENDORS URGE COUNTY SUPERVISORS TO MODIFY HEALTH RULES  </P> <P> Instead of slathering mustard and relish on wieners Tuesday, a handful of  hotdog vendors urged the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors Tuesday to  make their dog-eat-dog lives easier.  </P> <P> Boiling mad, the hotdog salesmen asked the board to modify rules that they  contend are driving them out of business. The disputed health regulations  require that vendors haul their carts each night to a commissary that can store  their buns and meat and also wash their stands.  </P> <P> The vendors complain that these commissaries charge exorbitant rents, maintain  inconvenient hours and are too far away.  </P> <P> "This law was designed to put hotdog carts out of business," said Mort Diamond,  the San Fernando Valley's self-styled "hotdog king" and leader of the  protesters.  </P> <P> Diamond has butted heads with the bureaucracy before. Last year, Diamond quit  the business in disgust and gave away his last 350 hotdogs rather than comply  with the controversial regulations.  </P> <P> In asking the supervisors to help, Diamond reminded them of an inscription  prominently engraved in stone in the board's meeting room.  </P> <P> "Right above your heads here -- I don't want to sound corny -- but it clearly  states that this county is founded on free enterprise," Diamond said.  </P> <P> The supervisors seemed sympathetic to the wiener lobby's plight.  </P> <P> "I heard this two years ago and I thought it was a racket then. I still think  it's a racket," Supervisor Kenneth Hahn said to applause from the vendors in  the front row.  </P> <P> Supervisor Mike Antonovich introduced an emergency ordinance to allow any  vendor operating fewer than three carts to park them elsewhere and to have the  carts cleaned at a carwash. The matter was postponed until May 29 to allow the  county counsel to determine if the county could help make life easier for the  vendors.  </P> <P> But two commissary owners, sitting across the aisle from the hotdog  contingency, vigorously disputed the vendors' contentions. They argued that the  commissaries help ensure that what the hotdogs consumers eat is not  contaminated.  </P> <P> "We're not here to rip anybody off, we're just providing a service," said  Gabriel Garciamendez, the owner of One Stop Foods Co. in Los Angeles.  </P></p>

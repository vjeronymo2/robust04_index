			<p>921022 FT  22 OCT 92 / Takeover combines Lloyd's agencies BARDER &amp; MARSH, the Lloyd's agency, has reached agreement in principle with Wendover Underwriting Agency, to take over the management of five syndicates administered by Wendover, Richard Lapper writes. The announcement is further evidence of the rationalisation among syndicates and agencies at the Lloyd's of London insurance market, which has suffered badly in recent losses. At least 50 of the 279 syndicates trading in London are not expected to survive into next year.</p>

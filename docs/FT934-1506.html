			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Home game, away fans: Staging the World Cup in the US is a gamble for its organisers When they held the draw for the 1990 World Cup finals in Rome, Luciano Pavarotti was the star of the show. When the draw for the 1994 World Cup finals is held in Las Vegas tomorrow, Barry Manilow will be the main attraction. Pavarotti was a natural host in Rome because he loves football and is an international star. Manilow, however, like most Americans, does not - at least not enough to convey its excitement on radio and television to his home-grown fans. The organisers of the World Cup have had trouble finding an American grown superstar to extol the virtues of 'soccer' to a country with no footballing tradition. So it is important that the stars who perform in person or by satellite tomorrow - Rod Stewart, Elton John, Robin Williams and James Brown  -do so with the kind of pizzazz normally reserved for a Super Bowl half-time show. Otherwise, Mr and Mrs Middle America might ignore the event altogether. 'All we're looking for is some exposure,' says Jim Trecker, senior vice-president of World Cup '94, the organising committee in the US. Outside the US, the going should be easier. Fans around the world usually follow the draw closely to discover which country their national team will be playing in the opening round of the tournament. A global audience of about half a billion people is expected to watch the ceremony live tomorrow. But only a fraction of that number will be in the US. While the draw will be shown on ESPN cable sports channel, none of the country's three main networks is broadcasting the event, which is not surprising since most Americans know little about football or the World Cup. Although millions of children play the game - it is regarded as safe and inexpensive - their interest rarely survives beyond their teens. The reasons are plain: since the North American Soccer League folded in 1985 there has been no fully-fledged professional league which they could support or which they might join as players. In addition, football is rarely shown on television, apparently with good reason. A poll last year by a Dallas sports marketing group found it ranked 95th among 124 sports Americans liked to watch. Dog-sledding and log rolling ranked higher. So if Americans are uninterested in the game, why is the World Cup being held in the US? Two words hold the answer: ambition and money. In 1988, the Federation of International Football Associations, the world governing body, selected the US to host the 1994 finals because it wanted to conquer the last big developed country which had not embraced 'the world game'. It also wanted to make a lot of money in the process. Fifa is almost certain to achieve the latter. A roster of blue-chip US companies - including Coca-Cola, General Motors, Mastercard and McDonald's - have lined up to pay as much as Dollars 20m each to Fifa to earn the status of sponsor of the World Cup - not because they want to reach their domestic market, but because they want to tap into the global marketplace. Sponsors can attach their logos to World Cup merchandise and publicity material and can buy prime television advertising slots. It is estimated that by the time the 52nd and final game is over, a cumulative audience of 25bn to 30bn will have watched the World Cup. Aside from corporate sponsorship, Fifa has received Dollars 300m for the international broadcasting rights, and Dollars 210m should come from the sale of 3.6m game tickets, which are expected to be sold out in advance of the opening ceremony on June 17. The nine cities hosting the games - New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Dallas, Washington DC, Detroit, San Francisco and Orlando - anticipate a flood of foreign visitors, who will contribute to the estimated Dollars 4bn which could be spent on the World Cup in the US - on everything from hotels, to ticket and T-shirts. While the tournament is virtually guaranteed to be a commercial success, doubts remain about Fifa's primary ambition: to colonise the US for football. Its hopes rest on the theory that the interest created by the World Cup will sustain a US professional football league. George Vescey, a New York Times sports columnist who has covered the last three World Cups, is sceptical whether the tournament's legacy will be strong enough to support such a league. 'I don't think the US will embarrass world football. We have the stadiums, the phone lines, the hotels, and the multinational (sponsors) - that's why we were selected. Whether it will feel like a real World Cup is another question.' By a 'real World Cup', Vescey means a tournament which not only stokes the passions of fans in the 24 competing countries, but also captures the imagination of the host nation. A lot will depend upon how the US team, one of the weakest in the tournament, fares. It is crucial that the home team advances past the first stage of round-robin league games and into the more exciting knockout stage. Quality will also be critical. Too many unexciting, low-scoring games will make it harder to sell the sport to sceptical Americans. At the moment, however, the World Cup organisers are more concerned about making sure the stars booked for tomorrow's draw turn up to perform. Only when the Las Vegas ceremonies are over, will the task of selling an American World Cup to Americans crank into top gear. A survey released two weeks ago by Fifa showed that only 35 per cent of Americans knew that the World Cup was being held in their country next summer. In Brazil, the figure was 99 per cent. The final score in the US is far from certain.</p>

			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Bredero dissidents seek to block bid A group of private shareholders accounting for more than 10 per cent of Bredero Estates are preparing to oppose Slough Estates' bid for the troubled property developer. They claim that the offer, pitched at a 50 per cent discount to Bredero's share price prior to the announcement, is 'unfair and opportunistic.' At present, their opposition would be sufficient to block Slough's offer, which is conditional upon 90 per cent acceptances. However, Slough already owns 50 per cent of Bredero and it stands to gain significant tax benefits if it can push beyond 75 per cent ownership. It is therefore likely to lower the minimum acceptance level, if necessary. The dissident shareholders, so far a group of five holdings, are complaining about the valuations of the properties, which they feel do not reflect their potential performance in an improving property market. Bredero's only significant remaining assets are development sites in Hammersmith and Glasgow. Its other assets, which at the peak of the market were valued at more than Pounds 100m, were sold to stave off its bankers. The company was negotiating the sale of its half interest in the Buchanan Centre, in Glasgow, to pension fund group AMP Asset Management, before the Slough offer came in, indicating that there is outside interest. Bredero has built up substantial tax losses, which Mr Alex Henscher, one of the dissident shareholders, claims will offer substantial value to Slough, given more than Pounds 100m of losses in the past three years. In addition, he says the offer attaches no value to Bredero's property management expertise. 'We are not looking for a higher offer, but prefer to see Bredfero continue in business, and hopefully rise from the ashes,' he said. However, Morgan Grenfell, the adviser to Bredero's independent board members, has fully supported the offer. The bank points out that Bredero's standstill agreement with its bankers will last only until September, and the company would probably be forced to sell at least one, and possibly both, of its two significant assets. The valuations for these sites were made independently in December 1993, and unless these are exceeded, the company would crystalise its current net asset value.</p>

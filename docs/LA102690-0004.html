			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOSEPHSON ON ETHICS OF YOUTH  </P> <P> In response "Young America Is Looking Out for No. 1," by Michael Josephson  (Commentary, Oct. 16):  </P> <P> I will concede that the ethics of my generation tend to be lax. Now, I'd like  you to consider where we've been getting our ideas from.  </P> <P> When President Reagan gave tax breaks to the rich so the money would "trickle  down" to the poor, who came first?  </P> <P> When members of Congress voted themselves a raise as the national debt climbed  to its highest in our country's history, who came first?  </P> <P> When President Bush asked the country to read his lips, was he telling a little  white lie or just pretending he could do whatever he wanted? Now he's trying to  protect the rich from higher taxes. It seems we've heard this song before.  </P> <P> Who caused the Iran-Contra scandal, the HUD scandal, the savings and loan  scandal, the billions in misappropriated defense funds? And who will be paying  for all this well into the next century? It's the working population ages  18-30.  </P> <P> We've gotten a pretty strong message from the men and women who have been  setting examples for us. We've learned that when it comes to ethics, rich and  poor are the only delineations made by the people who make the laws in this  country.  </P> <P> Before we are told our ethics "will cause significant future harm," examine the  code of ethics handed down to us by the past two generations of leaders.  </P> <P> NOAH EDELSON  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

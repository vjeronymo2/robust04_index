			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Observer: To sum up . . . Pity the MPs on the House of Commons Social Security Committee, chaired by Frank Field, as they wade through the enormous amount of technical information thrown up in their investigation on behalf of the aggrieved Maxwell pensioners. What they really need is an accountant to help them interpret all the figures and ask the right questions of those summoned into their presence. They could also use some assistance with the answers. The only problem is that among those being summoned are many firms of accountants. Indeed, after excluding the auditors and advisers to the Maxwell empire before its collapse, the administrators, receivers, liquidators and bankruptcy trustees following in its wake, and those on secondment to the Serious Fraud Office, there's barely a single firm left which doesn't have a conflict of interest.</p>

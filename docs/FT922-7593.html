			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Lamont to face pressure over VAT BRITAIN'S European Community partners and the European Commission are likely to put Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, under pressure tomorrow to abandon his hard line against legally binding EC rates of value added tax (VAT). EC finance ministers will meet in Brussels to discuss for the first time the most sensitive aspects of indirect tax harmonisation, including draft directives which would give a legal form to last June's historic agreement on VAT and excise rates. Ministers agreed then to keep to a 15 per cent minimum standard rate of VAT from January 1 1993, to abolish special top rates on luxury goods, and to simplify reduced rates. Mr Lamont won almost all the concessions the UK required - the right, for example, to keep zero-rating on certain household necessities - but the Commission has so far shied away from asking Britain to back a legally binding directive. Like all EC tax measures, the directive on the table tomorrow requires the unanimous approval of the 12 member states. The British government does not see the need for legal constraints on VAT rates and is also suspicious of Commission-inspired measures which bind UK fiscal policy. British officials in Brussels refused to comment at the weekend about whether the chancellor's position had changed since last June, when a succession of meetings was required even to reach a broad political agreement. Moreover, the ministers are unlikely to reach formal agreement on any of the fiscal measures under discussion tomorrow. These highly sensitive areas include a revived proposal to impose VAT on art works and collectors' items, and measures to enshrine last June's agreement on harmonised excise duties on alcohol and tobacco.</p>

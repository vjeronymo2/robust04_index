			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 18 May (MENA)--The central Cairo prosecution  today started interrogation of 10 lawyers who were arrested  early this morning for taking part in the events surrounding the  march they were planning to hold yesterday, Tuesday.    Among the 10 lawyers, three are members of the Lawyers'  Union  council. These are Mukhtar Nuh, Khalid Badawi, and Jalal Sa'd.    The central Cairo prosecution had ordered that 39  people--among them 25 lawyers--be imprisoned for 15 days for  interrogation.    All those who were arrested have been interrogated about the  crimes they are charged with, such as participating in criminal  collusion to incite a riot, demonstrate, or organize protests in  order to disrupt security and attack some police officers.</p>

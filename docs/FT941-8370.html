			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Outdoors: When Shame comes before Death - Skiing It was a straight choice: there were two ways down, the Wall of Death or the Chair of Shame. I will just have to learn to live with the shame. Everyone wants to ski the wall, a treacherously steep black run in the Swiss section of the Portes du Soleil circuit. And if I had been staying at Champery for more than a long weekend I might well have given it a go. But from the comfort of the Chair of Shame you can cultivate a superior air as you gaze down at the reckless adventurers bouncing gracelessly from mogul to mogul. The Portes du Soleil offers skiers a range of challenges - from the wall, above Les Crosets, to fun skiing in gullies, to cruising for miles from resort to resort, to flitting unchallenged and passportless across national borders. It claims to be the largest international, linked skiing area in Europe, covering 12 resorts in Switzerland and France, including Morzine, Les Gets, Chatel, Avoriaz, with its strikingly dark wooden triangular buildings, and Champery. There are said to be 650kms (more than 400 miles) of piste, 228 ski lifts and 650 ski instructors. There are also piste maps that defy gravity in their determination to be comprehensive. The maps include the estimated time of each journey to give everyone a sporting chance of catching the last lift back to their base resort. Penalties for becoming stranded can be high - the taxi driver will make sure of that. With so much to ski, is it worth going for a long weekend? Desperately keen skiers who only come down from the mountain as the coach home is about to leave for the airport might baulk at the idea. Anyone desperate to ski should consider it. Champery is close enough to Geneva airport - 1 1/2 hours - to make light of the travelling and there are small, specialist ski travel companies who will use scheduled flights to suit your timetable. Leave the office a little early on Thursday, ski Friday, Saturday and Sunday and be back at work on Monday. It can be done. Surprisingly, we didn't spend all three days queuing to get up and down mountains: there are so many lifts and so much to ski that the only minor hurdle is the Champery telecabin (it carries 125 people plus a driver, and takes four minutes to reach the top). But even here the weekend queues only become serious if you dally over breakfast. On Saturday and Sunday our guides found us sparsely populated slopes to ski. Especially worthwhile was a 2 1/2 -hour session with Jimmy Thomson, Canadian diamond dealer turned ski instructor based at Planachaux, who combined touring the resorts with some excellent tuition. At SFr140 (Pounds 65) for up to five people, it was excellent value. Over the three days, we made the most of an intermediates' paradise around Planachaux, Les Crosets, Avoriaz, venturing as far Les Lindarets. There are wide, fast and exciting blue and red runs everywhere, perfect for improving technique and looking good. Getting back to the Swiss side has been made tremendously easier with the addition of the Avoriaz bypass - a long chair lift between Les Brochaux and Pointe de Mossette, new for 1994. At 1,055 metres, Champery cannot guarantee permanent snow in the village, but there is a long run down a winding road when the snow is good, to the neighbouring village of Grand Paradis. The old village of Champery itself is far easier to navigate than the slopes above: it has one main street surrounded by chalets, arranged as if a flock of cuckoo clocks had alighted randomly in the valley bottom. The four-star Hotel de Champery, with 70 rooms, is in the centre. The dining room is very white linen, but informal enough for skiers, while the Le Mazot restaurant on the ground floor tempted us to sample fondues featuring fish, horse and ostrich. It also has a piano bar and sauna. Be sure to find your way to the sports centre offering swimming, ice skating and curling. And for a healthy evening out, Val d'Illiez is a 10-minute drive. Here there is an outdoor pool warmed to 30`C by natural means, and full of minerals to ease you back into work on Monday. Peter Whitehead travelled with Ski La Vie, 28 Linver Road, London SW6 3RB, tel: 071-736 5611, staying at the Hotel de Champery, with return flights to Geneva with Swissair. Ski La Vie also offers accommodation at Hotel National and three chalets (catered) at Champery, plus holidays in Zermatt and Meribel, as well as tailor-made flexible breaks.</p>

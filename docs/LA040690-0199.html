			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> BORG ORDERED TO PAY CREDITORS  </P> <P> Five-time Wimbledon champion Bjorn Borg suffered a defeat in court today when  he was ordered to pay creditors of his failed business empire between $1.65  million and $2 million.  </P> <P> Stockholm District Court said that an earlier agreement by the former tennis  ace to pay his Swedish creditors was valid and that half the payments must be  completed by June 1.  </P> <P> Borg, 33, disputes the exact amount owed to creditors of Bjorn Borg Invest AB,  maintaining that some transactions were carried out without his permission. But  a court-appointed liquidator said today that the two sides agreed that at least  $1.65 million is Borg's responsibility.  </P> <P> Since quitting the professional tennis circuit at 27, Borg built up an  exclusive design and fashion retail business with a holding company in the tax  haven of Jersey, but the group went into liquidation last year.  </P></p>

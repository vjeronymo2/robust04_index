			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Survey of Bulgaria (1): Light at the end of the tunnel - Although Bulgaria is going through a painful period of transition, it has managed to renegotiate its foreign debt and remains a force for stability in a turbulent region After five painful and confusing years of political and economic re-adjustment, Bulgaria is heading for general elections which are likely to bring back into power politicians with their roots in the communist past. If so, this Balkan country of 8.5m people will be following a trend well established elsewhere in central Europe. In recent elections in countries such as Poland and Hungary, the political experience and party organisation of former communists have combined to defeat the inexperienced 'democrats' who inherited the vacuum of power and bankrupt economies left by the collapse of Soviet hegemony over the region. In some respects Bulgaria is ahead of the trend. The anti-communist Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) which helped oust the communist regime and won the 1991 elections, collapsed 11 months later after losing an unnecessary no-confidence vote. The government which replaced it in December 1992, a non-party 'government of technocrats' headed by Lyuben Berov, a former university professor, was supported in parliament by the votes of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), successor to the defunct communist party led for several decades by Todor Zhivkov. Many Bulgarians interpreted this as allowing the BSP to regain power behind the scenes, ensuring that institutional, economic and other reforms were either delayed or implemented in a way which benefited the communist era managers and power brokers who retained jobs throughout the state and local administration and largely controlled the economy. Given the totalitarian nature of former party-state regimes throughout the region, such a development is unsurprising. The old system specialised in co-opting talent into its various sectors, leaving non-party people in subordinate or purely technical positions. Centuries of Turkish suzerainty and economic backwardness in the Balkan region retarded the development of a substantial middle class and modern institutions. This facilitated the subsequent re-imposition of feudal-type communist power relations under Soviet influence after the second world war. Seen from this historical perspective, Bulgaria has performed somewhat better than any of its Balkan neighbours since the collapse of the Soviet system. In Yugoslavia, former Titoist communists turned themselves into rabid nationalists and violently tore the country apart. In Romania, Ion Iliescu, a senior communist party official sidelined by the dictator Nicolae Ceausescu almost 20 years earlier, seized power after the palace coup of December 1989 and was able to legitimise his grip at subsequent elections. What is more, in contrast to Greece's nationalist claims in Albania and its mounting of a wounding trade embargo on the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, Bulgaria has preached moderation and practised good-neighbourliness under its pro-western president, Zhelyu Zhelev, a former professor and UDF leader. As a result, Bulgaria has remained an island of good sense and stability in an otherwise turbulent region. Domestically, the much-maligned Berov government also provided the necessary stability and continuity to conclude debt reduction negotiations with both the Paris Club of official lenders and the London Club of commercial bank creditors. Before resigning at the beginning of September this year the government also concluded a smaller debt swap and repayment deal with Russia, together with a new trade and investment agreement. Under this agreement Bulgaria will become one of the main transit routes for future exports of oil and gas from the Caspian region to the Mediterranean and southern European markets. The prospects for an increased flow of trade and investment between Bulgaria and Russia and other former Soviet states - especially Ukraine and the central Asian states - are linked to the expected economic revival of former Comecon markets which five years ago accounted for more than 80 per cent of Bulgaria's trade. Now the proportion is between 35 and 40 per cent with more than half of Bulgaria's trade taking place with OECD countries. The aim is to continue developing trade in both directions in order to avoid the over-dependence seen in the past on the former Soviet market. The combination of economic recovery in the German and other European Union markets and the prospect of growing trade on a new market-oriented basis with the middle east and former Comecon states is laying the basis for an export-led economic recovery after five hard years of declining production and real incomes. For this to proceed, however, Bulgaria desperately needs more foreign and domestic investment with which to modernise its obsolete industries, improve the energy, transport and telecommunications infrastructure and complete the present structural shift towards a more modern service, food processing and light industry based economy. In the short run, the recent sharp devaluation of the Lev, the Bulgarian currency, has improved the price competitiveness of Bulgarian goods and services, albeit at the cost of increasing inflationary pressures and further depressing real incomes. Growth prospects have been aided by a sharp recovery in tourism, increasing transit traffic from Macedonia, higher foreign investment, and the first signs of recovery in the disorganised agricultural sector. Overall, the economy is expected to show no growth or possibly a marginal rise in gross domestic product this year after five years of steep decline. While encouraging for the future, the first signs of economic recovery are unlikely to provide much of a 'feel good factor' for most Bulgarian voters. Too often a free press and open political debate has led to a popular perception of pervasive corruption, criminality and political incompetence. The promised mass privatisation programme remains mired in technical detail while the unemployment, loss of social security and high inflation affecting many Bulgarians contrast with the high-spending lifestyles of the new rich. A growing number of private business people are working hard to build up legitimate companies, living modestly and re-investing profits. However, with the Serbian border just 50km from Sofia, the capital's refurbished shopping streets, new restaurants and casinos have become filled with large men whose swaggering walk and ostentatious wealth is assumed to come rather from smuggling, drug trafficking or money laundering than from honest toil and respectable entrepreneurial activity. All this has brought the politics of envy back to Bulgaria, reflected in the rising popularity of the BSP with its implied promise of a partial return to the security of the old regime under a new generation of leaders more comfortable with market notions of economics and bourgeois concepts of legality. Opinion polls also reflect disillusionment with the factional rivalries within the UDF which is heading for elections under the same leadership that failed to retain power in 1992 and has lost many of its more competent and moderate leaders since. The men to watch are the Socialist Party's young generation of politicians such as Zhan Videnov, the party's 36-year-old leader, and especially those from the BSP's social democratic wing such as George Pirinsky, who are seeking to realign Bulgarian politics and create a moderate, left of centre grouping in the future parliament. Above all, the need is to strengthen the rule of law and provide a level playing ground for the development of legitimate, tax-paying private business and to encourage the development of a responsible middle class to underpin democracy.</p>

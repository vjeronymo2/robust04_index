Located on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai Province is  the  country's largest owner of sylvite and is rich in many other  mineral resources.    To better exploit local resources and improve the investment  environment, a total of 17 billion yuan has been earmarked by  the state for the construction of seven major projects in  Qinghai during the past decade, including the Longyang Gorge  hydropower station, Qinghai potash fertilizer plant and Golmud  oil refinery.    Completion of the Longyang Gorge hydropower station on the  upper reaches of the Yellow River has created great profits,  increasing Qinghai's electricity supply by 1.5 billion kwh [kw  hours] annually and bringing electricity to most of the rural  households of the province.    The first phase project of the Golmud oil refinery has laid  a  firm foundation for the future development of the local petro-  chemical industry as well as injecting vitality into the whole  economy of Qinghai.    In accord with the mushrooming of large projects, Qinghai  Province has also developed a host of related industrial  enterprises and established township enterprises, taking  advantage of abundant local resources.</p>

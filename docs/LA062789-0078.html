			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> President Bush plans to announce this week a broad package of proposals aimed  at changing the way federal campaigns are financed and limiting the advantages  enjoyed by incumbents, the Washington Post reported. The Bush proposals are  expected to include new limits on political action committee contributions, a  ban on the retention of excess campaign funds for use in the next election and  tighter limits on free congressional mailings to constituents. Administration  officials said Bush is meeting the next three days with a variety of groups  interested in campaign finance reform before he makes final decisions on the  package. Officials said most of the options he is considering would tend to put  limits on incumbents, a pattern that would help Republicans since Democrats  control both houses of Congress.  </P></p>

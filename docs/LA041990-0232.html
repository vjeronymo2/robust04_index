			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> VATICAN, PRAGUE RESTORE TIES  </P> <P> The Vatican and Czechoslovakia restored diplomatic relations today in a move  that expands the church's influence in the former Communist-dominated countries  of Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> The announcement of the resumption of ties after 40 years came two days before  Pope John Paul II begins a historic visit to Czechoslovakia.  </P> <P> Czechoslovakia, where the Roman Catholic Church was severely repressed for  decades, is the latest in a series of Warsaw Pact countries to renew ties with  the Vatican. The Pope's native Poland re-established diplomatic relations last  year, followed by Hungary in February. A month ago, the Vatican and the Soviet  Union established official ties for the first time since the Russian Revolution  although they fall short of full diplomatic relations.  </P></p>

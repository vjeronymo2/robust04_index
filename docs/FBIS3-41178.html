According to the local IRNA correspondent the miscreants  have  kidnapped three soldiers retuning to Zahedan from leave.    The provincial law enforcement official rushing to the scene  immediately mobilised all resources to track down the  miscreants, resulting in the arrest of two of bandits along with  weapons and several rounds of ammunition.    The panic-stricken passengers of the bus were being  questioned on details of the attack.    A law enforcement official told IRNA that the miscreants  were  agents of a notorious drug trafficking gang leader known as  'Hamid Nahtani.    Nahtani leads an international gang which uses Iran soil as  a  transit route to smuggle drugs to Europe.    At the moment, said the official, all roads leading to  Zahedan have been reopened and the security forces are keeping a  vigilance. A special group was also trying to track down the  rest of the miscreants, he added.    The smugglers had blocked the Khash-Zahedan, Kerman-Zahedan  and Zabol-Zahedan roads in the past weeks several times looting  people's properties.</p>

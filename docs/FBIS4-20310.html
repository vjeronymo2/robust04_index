			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jing Xuecheng: "Implement a Controlled Floating </F> Exchange Rate System--The Fourth of the Serial Reviews of the  Reform of the Foreign Exchange System"]    [Text] According to the announcement by the People's Bank  of China on the further improvement of the foreign exchange  management system, the unification of exchange rates, the  abolition of the foreign-exchange retention system, the  establishment of interbank foreign-exchange trading markets, and  the reform of the mechanism of exchange rate formation this time  constitute a complete framework of reform of the exchange rate  system. Substantial progress has been achieved in nearly a  month's time since the unification of exchange rates: first, the  People's Bank publishes market exchange rates on a daily basis;  second, the designated foreign exchange banks are all actively  studying and implementing the announcement, making preparations  for handling foreign exchange settlements and deposits; and,  third, independent operators (enterprises engaged in  foreign-exchange swap transactions) on the foreign-exchange swap  markets have withdrawn from the swap markets, and the framework  of transactions between foreign exchange banks is being  gradually established. Thus, in terms of unifying exchange  rates, the unification of exchange rates has been basically  completed in a formal sense; the focus of work in the future  should be put on observing the impacts of the reform of the  exchange rate system on various areas and on exploring ways of  achieving a "controlled floating" exchange rate system.    First, with regard to the use of unitary exchange rates,  during the transition period before 1 April, it is necessary to  pay attention to the impact of exchange rate adjustments, and it  is particularly necessary to study the issue of the extent to  which the adjustments affect the macro economy, fiscal revenues  and expenditures, and bank credits, thereby affecting the price  level. Current analyses are conducted under a situation where  the impacts of the unitary exchange rates on various area are  not yet clear. In the beginning stage of the reform of the  foreign exchange system, only by making further tracking  observations will it be possible to find correct operating  procedures.    Second, in the "controlled" floating exchange rate system,  floating is appearance, representing a normal phenomenon in  regard to the trajectory of exchange rate movement and foreign  exchange trading; but, it is "control" that is the key issue.  How to do a good job of controlling the unitary floating rates  so that "they may float but are not chaotic, remaining stable  amid movement," thereby providing a stable exchange rate  environment for the growth of the national economy, is a new  issue facing us. Specifically, if a "controlled" floating  exchange rate system is to be maintained, the central bank's  intervention in the market is indispensable. It is necessary to  study all the practical operational issues, including issues of  time, location, and mode of intervention (if it is direct  quantitative intervention, there will be the issue of the amount  of foreign exchange to be sold or bought) as well as related  issues of market analysis and of the understanding of market  psychology.    Third, the central bank's intervention in the market entails  the issues of determining target areas, of the functioning of  the mechanism of market trading, and of operating mechanisms.  Unitary exchange rates have resolved the issue of dual exchange  rates, but have not provided a stable exchange-rate level which  the central bank must maintain in order to ensure the steady and  rapid growth of the national economy. Whether unitary exchange  rates can be stabilized at an appropriate (perhaps only  relatively appropriate) level depends on whether there are a set  of indicators used in observing the economy and market and a set  of market transaction mechanisms which can serve to ensure the  stabilization of the rates at an appropriate level. Therefore,  it is necessary to actively cultivate and develop an interbank  foreign-exchange trading market, making it both serve the  trading on foreign exchange markets itself and be useful to the  central bank in its intervention in foreign exchange markets. In  order to establish a unified standardized national interbank  foreign exchange market, the People's Bank of China and the  State Administration of Exchange Control have decided to  establish the Foreign Exchange Trading Center of China in  Shanghai; through communications facilities, foreign exchange  trading centers in all the major cities across the country will  constitute a foreign exchange trading network centered on  Shanghai. Furthermore, the central bank will also make the  relevant rules and, together with designated market  foreign-exchange banks, conduct actual examinations of banks'  quoted exchange rates which are based on the central bank's  market rates and of the appropriateness of the rates used by  banks in their transactions with customers. Ultimately the  central bank should formulate a time-point or time-period  framework of its intentions regarding the regulation of the  foreign exchange market.    Fourth, although "floating" exchange rates only represent  appearance and form, they still need to be further studied. The  ideal situation of movement of RMB exchange rates should be a  situation of some floating in the medium and long term without  too much floating in the near term. Exchange rates which remain  fixed for a long time will lose the flavor of "floating," and  will even become fixed rates. If floating happens too frequently  and too violently, RMB exchange rates will be in a chaotic  situation governed by no laws, thereby producing many harmful  effects on the reform of the foreign exchange system and on the  development of the national economy.    Fifth, to further reform the exchange rate system and the  foreign exchange system as a whole, it is necessary to carry out  supporting reforms in various areas. For instance, exchange rate  fluctuations will result in enterprises facing exchange rate  risks. All this on the one hand requires that further reform of  enterprises' operating mechanisms be carried out so as to  establish a modern enterprise system, and on the other hand also  requires that our designated foreign exchange banks be able to  provide enterprises with risk-avoidance services commonly seen  on the international financial market, such as value-preserving  forward hedging and foreign currency forward trading.    Sixth, the floating and control of exchange rates raise  higher demands on the domestic money and credit supply,  adjustment of interest rates, and the central bank's use of  those means to adjust macro-monetary policy. The central bank  should adopt different measures to flexibly control floating  rates in view of different situations; sometimes it should  intervene in the market to directly affect exchange rates and  prices for foreign exchange, but sometimes it should pursue the  root causes or take facilitating measures to provide support,  raising or lowering interest rates and tightening or loosening  the retrieval of RMB so as to achieve the goal of "stability  amid floating."    Finally, more detail-oriented work will also be needed to  improve the management of foreign debts and foreign-owned banks  and to achieve other objectives.</p>

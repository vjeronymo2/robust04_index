			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by PRENSA LATINA correspondent Jorge Gomez Barata: </F> "Cuban Emigrants: A Plea for Magda"]    [Text] The broadcast of some videos of the reception that  followed the closing ceremony of The Nation and the Emigrants  Conference, which President Fidel Castro attended, has served as  a pretext for a wave of verbal lynchings of some conference  participants, especially Magda Montiel David, a young lawyer.    The wrath against Madga and the lack of scruples it reveals  are evidence of the counterrevolution's control over Miami  media; a control that gives it considerable power to manipulate  public opinion in that city.    Based on a few minutes during which Magda Montiel  fraternized  with Fidel, a caricature has been created to portray her as a  meek, pliant person who simply came to Havana to participate in  a scheme carefully crafted by the revolution. Nothing could be  further from the truth.    On the contrary, it was the seemingly fragile Magda Montiel  who raised the most delicate and sensitive issue during the  conference when she asked about the death penalty by firing  squad -- a penalty meted out by the courts for extreme crimes.  This penalty took on political connotations after the victory  of the revolution, when it was imposed on those who had  committed war crimes and torture at the service of the Fulgencio  Batista dictatorship.    If any of her detractors had held the conversation Montiel  held with Fidel Castro, that person would be considered a hero  in Miami. It seems that what bothers them the most is not what  Magda did but what they are unable to do.    Montiel did not receive an answer to her question because  her  issue was not on the agenda and because of a desire to avoid  controversial issues that could detract from the event's main  objective. Nevertheless, when Castro met her at the reception,  with his natural honesty, he brought up the issue.    Fidel Castro: "You are Magda? I heard you speaking this  morning, but you did not receive an answer. No one gave you an  explanation about the firing squads. You do not know that story  well."    Magda Montiel: "No, but someday you are going to have to  tell  it to me."    Fidel Castro: "I will tell it to you now."    Magda Montiel: "I want to tell you something, Fidel. Thank  you for what you have done for my people. For me, you have been  a great teacher."    Magda uttered words that inquisitors to the right of  Torquemada consider blasphemous: She thanked Fidel for "what  you have done for my people," an expression that in the context  of the occasion could be considered a simple courtesy -- void of  any commitment -- while addressing someone who is not only a  head of state but a historically renowned figure.    Magda did not take sides nor did she express an opinion. Not  even Cuba's most rabid enemies deny Fidel's role in the advances  made by the Cuban people, nor is calling him a teacher unusual.    What is curious about this situation is that the substance  of  the conversation between Fidel and Magda is being minimized  while the unimportant details are being blown out of proportion.    Although it was done cautiously and respectfully, to have  brought up the issue of the firing squads during the conference  does not make Magda Montiel any more agreeable to me, nor does  it move me to praise her. If I had a choice, I would have  preferred that she not bring up the topic, but the fact of the  matter is she did.    In my opinion, what we are really dealing with is an attack  on an entire generation of Cuban-Americans, in the person of  Magda Montiel, who -- because they are not committed to the  militant counterrevolution and do not share their elders'  reservations about the revolution but have a different style and  modern outlook on politics -- reach reasonable albeit critical  conclusions about the national situation and are accepted as  valid interlocutors. Jorge Mas Canosa and Armando Perez Roura  feel more envy than hatred.    The young sector has made a convincing debut in this  conference. They have the opportunity to be heard in Cuba and to  be a decisive factor among the emigrants. Havana is not trying  to saw the floor out from under the counterrevolution; the  counterrevolution is scurrying to prop up the ruins.    By insulting Magda Montiel the reactionaries are  accomplishing several objectives. They are trying to discredit  the conference and settle old political accounts, but most of  all they are availing themselves of the opportunity to try to  discredit their potentially most effective rivals who, to tell  the truth, are not in Cuba but in Miami.    I met Magda during the conference. I was impressed by her  simplicity, open spirit, and unselfishness. She is a happy,  successful, and fulfilled person. She is not gaining anything  nor seeking anything for herself; on the contrary, she seems  like a missionary dedicated to serving the community where she  lives.    I trust that in this brazen exhibition of sterile and  primitive rage by adversaries who have not respected the privacy  of her home nor the innocence of her children, Magda and her  family will find new reasons to persevere.</p>

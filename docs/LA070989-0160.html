			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Greece's new conservative-Communist government coalition won its first  confidence vote in Parliament, clearing the way for the prosecution of former  Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and other defeated Socialists. The  unprecedented coalition won 174 votes in the 300-seat Parliament after a stormy  debate in which Socialist deputies denounced a decision to name Papandreou as a  target for criminal investigation. The confidence vote, required by the  constitution, was the last procedural hurdle before the coalition could start  work on lifting immunity and prosecuting former Socialist ministers for alleged  involvement in financial scandals.  </P></p>

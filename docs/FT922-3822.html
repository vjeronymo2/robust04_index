			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / TV network contract won A MULTI-million-pound contract for a microwave network linking the studios of Westcountry Television, the new broadcaster for south-west England, will be awarded today to National Transcommunications. The Westcountry network will be the first such television system to be independent of BT, which has been involved in the television industry since the 1930s. National Transcomm, formed from the engineering division of the old Independent Broadcasting Authority, will be installing a network that will not only link studios in the region but carry virtually all Westcountry's internal communications and data links. The deal is a small example of plans to modernise the UK's broadcasting infrastructure and provide digital networks. Earlier this year BT signed a Pounds 50m contract over 10 years for an advanced digital network for Channel 4 - a network that will allow the channel to broadcast different adver-tisements simultaneously in six regional TV areas. BT's broadcast and visual services division has started negotiating with the main ITV companies and the BBC to provide them with modern digital communications. Investment of about Pounds 100m is required. BT has warned the broadcasters that the existing system, dating from the 1960s, cannot be sustained after 1994 as faults continue to increase. 'Some of the switches need oilcans,' said Mr Steve Maine, director of BT broadcast and visual services.</p>

By a 92-8 vote, senators passed and sent to the House the  Excellence in Education Act, initially submitted to Congress by President Bush  last spring. The final passage came after Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) was  thwarted in attempts to strike a provision awarding $25 million in federal  funds over three years to the National Board for Professional Teaching  Standards.  </P></p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Environment wins higher priority in White House PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday announced an overhaul of the White House's environmental policy structure and a move to turn the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) into a full cabinet-level department. 'The days of photo-op environmentalism are over,' he said, announcing his intention to abolish the Council on Environmental Quality, a White House agency set up in 1969 to review environmental policies and report each year on the condition of the environment. He had already abolished the Competitiveness Council, another White House agency which under the chairmanship of former Vice-President Dan Quayle became one of the most important channels for setting environmental policy in the Bush administration, and often blocked efforts by the EPA to implement environmental protection regulations. Vice-President Al Gore's views on environmental issues are almost diametrically opposed to those of his predecessor, and he is expected to remain the administration's most prominent spokesman in the field. About half the employees of the Council on Environmental Quality are expected to be kept on, in a streamlined environmental team merged into the general White House policy structure. Environmentalist groups appear happy with the decision, since they believe integrating the environmental policy team into the White House structure may lead to environmental issues being treated as less of an afterthought. Mr Clinton has given cabinet status to Ms Carol Browner, EPA director. But transforming the agency into a full cabinet-level department will require legislation.</p>

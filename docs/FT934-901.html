			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Observer: Gear change from BMW When the marketing supremo of the German car industry handed in his notice a couple of weeks ago, his associates at BMW sat heavily on speculation that Robert Buchelhofer was headed for Audi or any of Germany's other hard-pressed carmakers. Indeed he is not. From February, the 51-year-old Austrian will be on the starting blocks of a brand new career, as a partner at the Frankfurt offices of TASA International, the Swiss-based headhunting network. Gabriele Willner, one of his new colleagues, claims he decided about a year ago that he had peaked in the motor trade - just when BMW was crowing about having outsold arch-rival Mercedes for the first time. It was also when Bernd Pischetsrieder, group production director and just 45, was being presented to BMW's supervisory board as the man to succeed chairman Eberhard von Kuenheim. Unusual as it may be for German executives to undertake such dramatic career switches, there comes a point when some say 'I've had it with this job and stupid supervisory boards', Willner notes diplomatically. She herself marketed Lancaster cosmetics in an earlier life, while other TASA International partners in Germany come from retailing or the drinks business. Willner confides that the new recruit will be helped from 0 to 90 with searches for two motor industry scalps, but that he will be expected to be up to speed in all fields before long.</p>

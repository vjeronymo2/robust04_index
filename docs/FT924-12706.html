			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Sayonara to job security: The prospect of slow economic growth is threatening Japan's system of lifetime employment Saturo Asami was shocked. His long-held beliefs about the benefits of being Japanese had been dashed. Recently, his company, Ohkura Electric, a medium-sized Japanese electronics manufacturer, fired him without warning. Mr Asami recalled: 'All I got was a piece of paper; there were no explanations.' Mr Asami was one of 130 people Ohkura made redundant by closing a components factory at Saitama, west of Tokyo, after the company had reported pre-tax losses for the past two years. As Japan's economic downturn spreads from property and finance into industry and retailing, demand for labour is contracting fast. As a result, the social contract which has governed employment in Japan since the 1950s, offering workers at large companies lifetime employment in return for their devotion to the company, is being threatened. Over the next year this contract, one of the most distinctive features of Japanese capitalism, will be put through its toughest test. Figures published last week show that official unemployment is still only 2.2 per cent, well below the average for OECD economies of 7.5 per cent. However, the labour market's health is deteriorating rapidly. For every 100 job-seekers there are 102 jobs, a ratio of 1.02, close to equilibrium and sharply down from 1.45 in March last year. But soon there will be an excess supply of labour as Japan faces what could be its worst recession since that caused by the oil shocks of the 1970s. Mr Shijuro Ogata, former governor of the Japan Development Bank, now a senior adviser to Yamaichi Securities, said: 'So far this has been a company recession, with companies taking the strain in the form of lower profits. It could become an individual recession with people paying the cost through employment adjustment.' Whether the weakening of the labour market will lead to lasting changes in the Japanese system will depend on how companies reconcile the traditions of lifetime employment with the need to boost profitability after three successive years of decline in the corporate sector. Lifetime employment lends companies a potent mixture of flexibility and rigidity. Employees at large companies are treated as if they are a fixed cost with their base salary paid whatever the economic environment. But companies demand considerable flexibility, and workers are often required to shift between jobs. This implicit contract would fail if companies resorted to large-scale redundancies. Employers have another pressing concern which would make them reluctant to sack people. Japan's low birth rate means that, by the end of the decade, the country could face a labour shortage. Companies are unwilling to shed workers now, only to risk skill shortages once the economy recovers. The problem is that profitability is plunging. Japanese business has become accustomed to very high rates of economic growth, and this has largely shaped strategy. They generally carry high fixed costs - including labour costs - which they cover by selling large volumes of shares, cars or videos at relatively thin profit margins. When sales increase sharply, so do profits. In a downturn, however, Japanese companies take longer than their international rivals to restore profitability because they do not use redundancies to cut costs in line with lower output. The pressures of the current downturn may herald a prolonged period of slow economic growth. In fiscal 1992, the economy is expected to grow by less than 2 per cent, compared with 3.5 per cent a year earlier. The official consensus of Tokyo economists is that growth next year will reach 3 per cent, but many admit that it may fall below 1.5 per cent. In response, companies are already reassessing their long-term cost base. What are the prospects for the Japanese system of lifetime employment as companies attempt to cope with these pressures? In the short run it is extremely unlikely that the system will be threatened by a sharp rise in officially registered unemployment. The economy, and total employment, are still growing, albeit slowly. In August the male employed workforce was 39.2m, up 1.1 per cent from the year before; the female workforce stood at 27m, up 0.4 per cent. Most economists do not expect unemployment to rise above 3 per cent over the next year, mainly because companies are prepared to go to extreme lengths to retain staff. Many have reduced working time. Total overtime hours in manufacturing fell by 24 per cent in the past year, and total working hours fell by 3 per cent last month. Transfers within big companies are becoming commonplace. Mazda, the car maker, has moved staff from production to sales in an attempt to sell its way out of the downturn. Some companies are going even further. Mr Noburu Hatakeyama, vice-minister at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, explained: 'Many of the electronics companies are paying staff simply to stay at home.' To help cover the costs of this 'employment adjustment', industries are queueing up to claim government help. The steel and software industry associations have already formally claimed subsidies which help their companies cover the cost of training laid-off workers for one year. The electronics industry is expected to follow suit. Such strategies suggest that a revolution triggered by rising unemployment is extremely unlikely. But pragmatic reform is almost certain. The coverage of the lifetime employment system will be reduced and its terms tightened; its benefits will be increasingly confined to young, male, full-time, white-collar workers. Lifetime employment is largely confined to employees of large companies. The gap between those in mainstream employment and those on the fringes of the labour market will widen. The Japanese labour market is like an onion with many rings; the outer rings will be peeled off first to protect the core. Those on the extremities of the labour market - illegal foreign workers attracted to Japan during the 1980s boom - are already being hit by unemployment. The day labourers of the poorest districts of Osaka rioted earlier this month, after relief loans were cut, because a slump in the construction industry pushed up the numbers applying for jobs from a few dozen to more than 1,000. Unemployment is also rising fast among those who work for small private companies. In August, the number of self-employed fell to 8.49m, down 3.2 per cent from a year earlier, while the number of workers at small family enterprises fell by 8.7 per cent to 4.71m. In contrast, the number of salaried employees rose by 2.5 per cent to 51.38m. Many of these redundant workers are women, who in Japan often leave employment without claiming benefits, and thus are not reflected in official statistics. Women employed at large companies, especially part-timers, are also considered vulnerable. The rapid economic expansion of the late 1980s attracted many women into employment, but many will leave the workforce in the next couple of years without being replaced. The trend is already evident; women's employment in stockbroking, for example, fell by 11 per cent last year compared with a 3 per cent decline in male employees. About half the 2,700 employees at the Tobu department store at Ikebukuro, a commuter junction on the outskirts of central Tokyo, are women. Mr Isao Kubokawa, the managing director, believes that despite a loss this year the company will avoid redundancies. 'Within the next three years many of these young women will get married and leave, so the workforce will be cut by natural wastage.' Members of two other groups - the young and the old - could find themselves partially excluded from the system. Older workers are supposed to be the most respected at Japanese companies, which operate systems of promotion by seniority. However, the seniority system is starting to fray at the edges as companies such as Sanyo, the electronics manufacturer, implement early-retirement programmes for staff over 50. At the other end of the labour market, young workers are being hit by recruitment freezes. Job offers from companies employing more than 1,000 people were 51 per cent down in August compared with the previous year. CSK, Japan's largest software house, plans a 70 per cent cut in graduate recruitment next year, while All Nippon Airways, Japan Airlines and the Central Japan Railway company all plan cuts of about 30 per cent. For the next couple of years new membership of the inner sanctum of the Japanese labour market will be limited. But even for those in the protected core life will get tougher. First, companies are becoming more selective about which managers they want to retain and motivate. Performance is becoming more important in setting executive pay, rather than simple seniority. Cuts in executive salaries and benefits are becoming commonplace in both manufacturing and financial services. NTT, the large telecommunications concern, is cutting management bonuses by 5 to 10 per cent. IBM Japan has imposed a pay freeze for 300 managers. Companies are also streamlining their management. Mitsukoshi, Japan's most famous department store, plans to cut management posts from 2,600 to 1,100. Second, some leading employers are drawing up long-term plans to overhaul their corporate cultures by encouraging individual initiative and promotion by merit, as well as reducing their cost base. In June, Honda, the car maker, introduced an innovative merit-based payment system to motivate employees; the programme will gradually introduce an annual pay scheme based on performance, rather than seniority. Meanwhile, Nomura, the largest finance house, plans a 17 per cent reduction in its workforce to meet increased competition from banks in a sluggish securities markets. Mr Richard Koo, senior economist at the Nomura research Institute, said: 'Other companies must be thinking of following Honda's lead because payment and promotion by merit is the best way to retain the young staff a company needs while cutting costs by paying less to those it does not need.' Leading companies such as Honda and Nomura may be pointing the way for the rest of Japanese companies away from a strict system of lifetime employment. Slower growth over the next few years may force a gradual but significant evolution in a system which has been at the core of the Japanese economic miracle.</p>

			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> SPIKE LEE'S NEW FILM SIZZLES  </P> <P> Spike Lee says sex, not race, will generate a lot of heat in his new film, "Mo'  Better Blues."  </P> <P> "The audience may squirm," Lee said in the March 5 issue of People magazine.  </P> <P> The $10-million film starring Denzel Washington is about a trumpet player torn  between his love of music and his desire for two women, a singer played by  Cynda Williams and a Harlem schoolteacher played by Lee's sister, Joie.  </P> <P> Joie Lee said she had no problem working with her brother in scenes that called  for nudity.  </P> <P> "When he said, 'OK, take off your top,' I just did it. It's not perverse," she  said.  </P> <P> Williams said the love scenes are tasteful, "but when I think of going to see  the movie with my parents and grandparents, it freaks me out."  </P> <P> Lee's last film, "Do the Right Thing," examined racism with a tragic  confrontation at a pizza parlor.  </P></p>

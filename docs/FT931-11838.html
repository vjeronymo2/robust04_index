			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / When you ask a silly question . . . 'Few trends could so thoroughly undermine the very foundations of our free society as the acceptance by corporate officials of social responsibility other than to make as much money for their shareholders as possible.' This assertion of Milton Friedman's - like so many - combines provocative exaggeration with an important kernel of truth. The exaggeration is in the phrase 'make as much money as possible'. Friedman is not advocating the shooting of business competitors or other Mafia tactics. He is perfectly aware that the profit maximising game, if it is to be in the general interest, requires a complex background of property rights, law, and above all mutual trust. Every medieval fair had its own body of accepted practice and tribunals for settling disputes. Friedman probably regarded these aspects as too obvious to discuss when he wrote these words in Capitalism and Freedom 30 years ago. If so, he was wrong. The difficulties of the ex-communist countries in setting up market economies show that the background of institutions is as important as the removal of the constraints of the old regime. Moreover, cases further west, such as the court award against British Airways for harassing Virgin, show that observance of accepted business norms cannot be taken for granted anywhere. What Friedman was really getting at, however, was the doctrine that business has to contribute to good causes, such as urban renewal, support of the arts, or the out of hours welfare of its own employees, let alone sacrifice profits to wrong headed causes such as Buy American or Buy British campaigns. The point is not that these activities (except for the last) are undesirable but that it is up to individual citizens to decide how much to contribute. Insofar as they favour collective action, such action should be through duly constituted political processes and not through managers setting up as taxing authorities over the funds of shareholders. These reflections arise from an attitude survey, Business Ethics in the UK, carried out for the Co-operative Bank by the University of Westminster. The sample response of managers of 16 per cent was reasonable given the paper which floods through business in-trays. Participants were scored for 'ethical sensitivity' in their responses to 33 statements. The result, in the author's words, is that businessmen 'have strong ethical beliefs about honesty and truthfulness in business dealings, but there is also evidence of a tough freely competitive attitude'. The statements offered for approval or disapproval, and the scoring system, are more revealing than the answers. For instance, those who agreed that 'a company has a duty to pay its workers a decent living wage, rather than as little as they can' scored highly. Not only is the statement question-begging, but the attitudes behind it encourage employers to sack workers rather than trim pay - which is the reverse of ethical. Unfortunately the majority answered the 'politically correct' way. Other statements were systematically misleading, eg: 'There is nothing wrong with selling low-quality goods, if that is what the public wants.' Taken literally, the correct attitude should be the low-scoring 'strongly against'; but there is a subtext hinting at deception or sharp practice. No wonder that responses were evenly spread. One statement is economically illiterate, namely: 'Products which use scarce resources should be banned.' In that case nothing would be produced, for all resources are scarce and the task of the price mechanism is to see they are not wasted. The study is valuable despite the absurdities. It contains a worthwhile discussion of why objectives other than short-term profit maximising emerge from the Darwinian struggle of firms for survival. But before giving executives ethical sensitivity ratings, future studies should reflect on which attitudes really are and which are not helpful in the true ethical sense of promoting the general welfare.</p>

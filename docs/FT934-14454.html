			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / International Company News: Lafarge Coppee to expand US interests LAFARGE Coppee, the French company which is the world's largest building materials concern, is expanding its North American interests by buying a 10 per cent stake in National Gypsum, one of the largest plasterboard manufacturers in the US. National Gypsum emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this year. The French group, which recently staged a FFr2.5bn (Dollars 439m) capital increase on the Paris stock market, described the deal as an opportunity to diversify into the US plasterboard market. Under the terms of the transaction, Lafarge agreed to buy nearly 4m shares in National Gypsum, or about 20 per cent of the total, and to transfer half of them to Golden Eagle Industries, a privately held investment company controlled by Mr CD Spangler of Charlotte, North Carolina. Lafarge said it paid FFr200m for its 10 per cent stake. Golden Eagle declined to comment on the terms. It said the Spangler family was 'pleased' National had relocated its headquarters from Dallas to Charlotte in July, a move which coincided with the company's emergence from nearly three years of protection under Chapter 11. On the Nasdaq over-the-counter market in New York yesterday, shares in National Gypsum traded at Dollars 26 3/4 , down Dollars 1. For Lafarge, the deal re-establishes a relationship which began 30 years ago, when the US group helped it with the technology to begin plasterboard making in Europe. In 1986 the French group invested Dollars 33m in a Dollars 1.5bn leveraged buy-out of National Gypsum, and a further Dollars 47.5m in 1988 to take its stake to 50.1 per cent. However, Lafarge kept its relationship with National Gypsum at arm's length because of the US group's heavy debt burden. It stake was held by a US trustee to limit its exposure. Under terms of National's reorganisation, Lafarge was left uncompensated for its investment. The French group said it had 'no plans in the short term' to raise its holding above 10 per cent, but that it would keep 'an open mind'. Lafarge, a leading player in the US cement and concrete markets, has a strong presence in plasterboard in Europe.</p>

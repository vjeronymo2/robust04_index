			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Russia promises Ukraine: no nuclear war THE leaders of Russia and Ukraine last night announced tentative agreements on two of the most pressing issues dividing the two Slav states - though large differences remain, particularly on repayment of the foreign debt. Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian leader, said last night Russia was prepared to give neighbouring Ukraine a guarantee against nuclear attack, in return for Ukrainian parliament ratification of the Start 1 treaty and return of its strategic nuclear missiles to Russia. Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, said that the guarantee would help him persuade the country's parliament to ratify Start 1 - necessary if the treaty, signed between the US and the Soviet Union in July 1991, is to be implemented and Start 2, signed by Russia and the US early this month, is to proceed. Mr Yeltsin also said that Russia would provide up to 5m more tonnes of oil above the 15m tonne limit it set for supplies to Ukraine this year in earlier talks. Ukraine, now desperately short of oil supplies for its refineries, had requested 45m tonnes - but Mr Yeltsin said that because of an expected drop in Russian oil production to under 400m tonnes in 1993, 'unfortunately we cannot satisfy Ukraine's needs.' Confusion surrounds both the level of supplies and the method of payment. Mr Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister, was quoted by the news agency Interfax after talks with Mr Leonid Kuchma, the Ukrainian premier, on Thursday, as saying that only 11m tonnes of oil would go to Ukraine this year, and that it would be paid for by supplies of food and industrial goods, with both the Russian oil and Ukrainian products denominated in hard currency. Russia had announced its intention to move to world prices for its oil sold to the other 14 former Soviet states - but has only implemented the intention in the case of the three Baltic republics. Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy premier, said yesterday that because of the close links between Russian and other states' industries and economies, 'a standard approach of charging world prices should not be expected.' The nuclear guarantee, however, is a move for which Ukraine has lobbied in the past few months, and may stimulate similar guarantees from the other main nuclear powers, the US, Britain and France. Mr Borys Tarasiuk, the Ukrainian deputy foreign minister, has raised the issue of all-round nuclear guarantees in the event of Ukraine giving up the 176 missiles on its territory, and received encouragement from the western allies. Start 1 has still to be ratified by Ukraine and by Belarus, but has been ratified by Kazakhstan, the fourth of the former Soviet states to possess nuclear weapons. Talks will continue over the weekend on the repayment of the former Soviet debt of Dollars 80bn (Pounds 52.6bn). Ukraine has insisted on separate repayment of its 16.34 per cent of the debt in return for a share of the overseas assets, a deal the overseas creditors in the London and Paris Clubs have so far rejected. Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, chairman of the Paris Club, and Mr Christian Vontz, a Deutsche Bank director who chairs the London Club's Paris group, arrived in Moscow yesterday to conduct talks on the debt with Russian and Ukrainian ministers. An agreement between them is essential for rescheduling the debt and for the release of more loans to the former Soviet states.</p>

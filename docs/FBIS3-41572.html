			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: ``Thai Industrial Standards Institute </F> Allows Objections to Limits on Diesel Pollution'']    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Mr. Chen Bunsong, the  Secretary-General of the Thai Industrial Standards Institute  [ISI] said that with regard to the ISI controlling pollutants  from all new automobiles and motorcycles, the limits would not  be stricter than the standards set by the ISI to control air  pollution. He announced that standards for level one motorcycles  with MOK [registered weight in kg] 1105 to 2535 had taken effect  as of 10 August. Preparations were being made to announce the  pollution standards for gasoline-powered, level two automobiles  with MOK 1120 to 2535 soon. The ISI was preparing to control  pollutants from diesel vehicles more strictly. The pollution  standards for small, level one diesel vehicles had been set  already.    Mr. Chen said that these safety standards covered amounts of  carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen allowed for  diesel vehicles with not more than nine seats, diesel trucks  with a gross vehicle weight of not more than 3,500 kg, and  passenger vehicles made from trucks with a gross vehicle weight  of not more than 3,500 kg with no limit set on the number of  seats. In any case before this was given the stamp of an  official decree so that it could be announced as the standard of  the ISI, an opportunity would be given for manufacturers and  others involved who wished to object to present objections  together with the reasons to the ISI on or before 7 October.    The following table shows the quantity of carbon monoxide,  the quantity of hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen, and the  quantity of oxides of nitrogen from the engine of a vehicle with  six seats or less and with a gross vehicle weight of 2,500 kg or  less. This is for the certification test. Units are in grams per  test.    Engine Capacity in   Carbon Monoxide   Hydrocarbons and      Oxides of  Cubic Centimeters                      Oxides of Nitrogen    Nitrogen   less than 1,400      54                19                    7.5   not less than        36                10                    not specified  1,400      The following table shows the quantity of carbon monoxide  and  the quantity of hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen from the  engine of a vehicle with more than six seats, a gross vehicle  weight of more than 2,500 kg or which operates off the public  highways including trucks and passenger vehicles made from  trucks. This is for the certification test. Units are in grams  per test.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |[Registered Weight] in kg|Carbon Monoxide          |[Registered Weight] in kg|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1,020 or less            |70                       |23.8                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |over 1,020 but not over 1|80                       |25.6                     |  |,250                     |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |over 1,250 but not over 1|91                       |27.5                     |  |,470                     |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |over 1,470 but not over 1|101                      |29.4                     |  |,700                     |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |over 1,700 but not over 1|112                      |31.3                     |  |,930                     |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |over 1,930 but not over 2|121                      |33.1                     |  |,150                     |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |over 2,150               |132                      |35.0                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Lloyds Chemists 17% ahead - Largest gains achieved in pharmaceuticals and veterinary products Lloyds Chemists, the UK's second largest pharmaceuticals retailer, lifted both profits and turnover by 17 per cent for the year to the end of June, helped by large sales gains in the pharmaceuticals and veterinary divisions. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 49.7m to Pounds 58.3m, while sales expanded from Pounds 802m to Pounds 940m. The latest profits included an exceptional gain of Pounds 2.81m from disposals. Earnings per share rose from 28.5p to 33.67p. The board is proposing to increase the final dividend from 5.25p to 6.8p, raising the total by 31 per cent to 9.5p (7.25p). Mr Allen Lloyd, chairman, said the record results had been achieved in the fourth year of a recession characterised by negligible inflation, fragile consumer confidence and a very competitive retail climate. 'We have no declining markets, all our divisions are profitable, and all are moving forward,' he said. The shares rose by 16p to 299p. Sales in the retail division, which includes the chains of more than 900 chemist shops and some 300 Holland &amp; Barrett healthfood shops, were 5.5 per cent ahead to Pounds 601m (Pounds 569m). Profits rose from Pounds 44.9m to Pounds 49.5m. The group said the healthcare market was continuing to grow, with increasing NHS business and buoyant over the counter sales. The group describes itself as the leading neighbourhood pharmacy chain, with most shops near doctors' surgeries. It has won the NHS contract to distribute 14.3m rubella vaccinations in the government campaign to treat all child-ren between five and 16 years old. The pharmaceuticals division increased sales by 49 per cent from Pounds 184m to Pounds 274m and lifted profits from Pounds 11.4m to Pounds 13m. The increases reflected acquisitions in Scotland, where it is now the leading distributor, and in Northern Ireland, a new market for the group, as well as organic growth. Profits at the veterinary division rose from Pounds 2.08m to Pounds 3.54m on the back of a 32 per cent increase in turnover from Pounds 49.2m to Pounds 65.1m. Mr Lloyd said the group would 'do even better in future', adding that first quarter sales in the retail division were 8 per cent higher, while the pharmaceutical and veterinary divisions were 39 per cent and 47 per cent higher respectively. While he did not rule out further acquisitions completely, he said he would be happy for the group to grow organically. COMMENT It is becoming increasingly difficult to be a bear on these shares. Chemist shops are a low risk business as licence requirements make it difficult to open new branches. The policy of issuing shares to mop up competitors, much criticised at the time, now looks like good strategy. The group has made no large acquisitions for a couple of years, and has consistently delivered results in line with expectations. Gearing is 31 per cent - by no means excessive - and interest cover is a healthy 14.6 times. A dividend of 11.5p this year gives a prospective yield of 4.8 per cent, while forecast profits of Pounds 62m leave the prospective multiple at about 9. AAH and UniChem - the companies most often held up for comparison - are on multiples of 14.1 and 15 respectively.</p>

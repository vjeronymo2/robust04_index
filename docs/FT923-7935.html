			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / International Company News: Palabora Mining down 10% at halfway stage LOWER copper prices and reduced sales of zirconium products accounted for a 10 per cent fall in profits at Palabora Mining, the South African copper producer, in the six months to the end of June. Although operating costs rose by only 6.7 per cent, well below inflation, turnover dropped to R534.4m (Dollars 193.6m) from R557.6m a year earlier. Operating profits fell to R201.6m from R245.8m while net profits dropped to R106.2m from R118m. Mr Frank Fenwick, managing director, said copper sold, including metal in concentrates, advanced to 69,569 tonnes from 68,147 tonnes. About 85 per cent of the copper was sold in the form of cathode and rod, with the remainder as concentrates. Production levels were expected to be maintained in the second half, and forward markets suggested prices would be reasonably firm. The interim dividend, meanwhile, is being maintained at 110 cents a share on earnings of 346 cents a share compared with 417 cents a year earlier.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITIM report] </F>   [Text] "The Palestinian Authority has the power to cancel  previous legislation. This is no violation of the agreement."  These remarks were made last night by Justice Minister David  Liba'i in response to the decree by Yasir 'Arafat regarding the  cancellation of the Israeli laws in Jericho.    Minister Liba'i added: "'Arafat tends to favor symbolic and  demonstrative acts instead of coming down to the territories and  starting to run the inhabitants' life and worrying over real  needs. He did nothing by issuing a statement announcing that he  is canceling the Israeli laws. According to the agreement  between us, we have restricted the validity of their laws so  that they cannot pass laws which contradict the agreement. He  is no legislator, and has not presented an alternative or  introduced order. All that he has done so far is make a  statement."    The minister noted that the Palestinian Authority has the  right to cancel some of the laws. It would not be a violation,  he said, but the question is whether this is wise and how will  it impact on the territory.</p>

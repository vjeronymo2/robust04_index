			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Suspension lifted on fund managers Fimbra, the regulator for financial intermediaries, managers and brokers, yesterday lifted the 11-month suspension of the individual registrations of Mr Paul Hogarth and Mr David Warnock, co-owners of Bankhall Investment Management of Altrincham, Cheshire. The suspensions last August followed a dispute between Bankhall and Clerical Medical International over the alleged unauthorised transfer of Pounds 20m to an account at Lombard NatWest Bank in Limassol, Cyprus, for a complex investment scheme involving offshore financial instruments. The account was in the name of Hanover Bank, which is authorised by the government of Antigua. When CMI - a Clerical Medical offshoot based in the Isle of Man - tried to recover the money Kinitor, a Cypriot company involved in the scheme, obtained an injunction freezing the funds. Legal proceedings were started by Kinitor against Hanover and Lombard NatWest, as well as by Managed Opportunities, another Clerical Medical subsidiary, against Kinitor, Hanover and Lombard NatWest. Mr Hogarth and Mr Warnock also alleged defamation by CMI. Following a secret out-of-court settlement, all actions have been withdrawn and the money returned with interest. Bankhall, which employs 15 people and manages about Pounds 50m of private client funds, was not suspended and has continued to trade throughout Fimbra's inquiries, some of which are understood to be continuing. Mr Hogarth and Mr Warnock can resume giving advice to Bankhall clients. Mr Hogarth said yesterday: 'Bankhall has worked closely with the regulator throughout in bringing this matter to a satisfactory conclusion. I would like to thank our clients and professional connections throughout the UK for their support.' Fimbra said the two fund managers had been suspended under a Rule 7 direction, which can be made against individuals or a member firm.</p>

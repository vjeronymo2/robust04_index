			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By unidentified ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 9 Jun -- First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg  Soskovets has categorically refuted a report that appeared in  the press about the possible resignation for health reasons of  Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and the appointment  of Yuriy Skokov to this post. He called such information  complete garbage.    A well-informed source in the government told the ITAR-TASS  correspondent today that this evening Chernomyrdin was returning  from Germany. But the question of his participation in  tomorrow's all-Russian builders' conference in the Kremlin with  the participation of the Russian president currently remained  open. In all probability, Soskovets would deliver a report  there.    Aleksandr Livshits, head of the Russian president's group of  experts, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent the following  concerning the fabrications about the possible resignation of  Chernomyrdin: Such rumors are advantageous only to those who are  trying to snatch power, and for this purpose to set at  loggerheads the leaders of the government and the president's  administration. We are working amid continuous malevolence, but  our team of reformers will not let this put their nose out of  joint.    At the federation of goods producers, which is chaired by  Yuriy Skokov, whom the authors of the article in KOMSOMOLSKAYA  PRAVDA have destined for the post of prime minister, the  ITAR-TASS correspondent was told: This is mere fiction and  nothing else, and it is a pity that it compromises our  federation's leader.</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: Argentine banking opened still further Financial institutions from the US and Europe are exploring the possibility of starting operations in Argentina following a government decree last week which further opened the banking system to foreign competition. Mr Roque Fernandez, president of the central bank of Argentina, said those applying to open branches included the financing arm of General Motors, GMAC, and a Chilean group. Other applications were expected from US and European banks. Mr Fernandez was in London for talks with the Bank of England. He hopes to persuade the Bank that his institution is capable of supervising Argentine banks' international activities - thereby paving the way for the opening of further Argentine bank offices in London. He is also talking to banking authorities in Spain, the US and Japan. Last week's decree brought protests from Argentine banks. Mr Fernandez said the Argentine banking system was competitive - 200 financial institutions were now operating compared with 800 in 1980. However, there has been concern among businesses about high lending margins.</p>

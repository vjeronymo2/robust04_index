			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Electricity Until the government decides just how it intends to privatise British Coal, there will be rich seams of confusion to mine. It is pertinent, all the same, to ask what the rumoured quashing of the so-called dash for gas might mean for the UK electricity industry. The short answer is relatively little. Arguably, the majority of planned gas stations will never be built anyway, either because they will not be given permission or, more simply, because there is not gas to go round. A more complicated response concerns the consequences for the two generating companies. On the face of it, they would lose out because their dependence on coal would remain uncomfortably high. In reality, the impact would probably be rather more favourable. Assuming Mr Michael Heseltine steps in, the generators' market share will gain a degree of protection as competitors fall away. They would also be spared the capital cost of at least three large gas-fired power stations. In the case of National Power, that could leave up to Pounds 500m of cash looking for an alternative use. Perhaps most important, the generators' hands might be strengthened in negotiations over future contracts with British Coal. They could extract a higher price for agreeing to take more domestic coal, helped by the knowledge that the government might also be making plans to dispose of its remaining 40 per cent stake in them. Thus, the market was probably right to mark the generators' shares higher yesterday.</p>

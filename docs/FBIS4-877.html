			<p>BFN     [Text] Abidjan, 20 Apr (AFP) -- A French aid agency has  denied a UN report that five of its employees in Liberia had  been kidnapped by one the country's armed factions.  International Action Against Hunger said in a statement here  that two Liberian nationals working for the group had been "held  up for several hours last week at Kanweikan," about 200  kilometers (125 miles) east of the capital Monrovia. "They were  held up by local military security officials on grounds that  authorities had not been informed that the two employees had  been transferred," the group said. It noted that the transfer  had in fact been initiated by "the highest local civilian  authority." A United Nations spokesman in Monrovia said Monday  [18 April] that militants from the National Patriotic Front had  seized five workers from the French agency, accusing them of  backing a rival militia, the Liberia Peace Council.</p>

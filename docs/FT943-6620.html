			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Outdoors: You can take a boy to water . . . - Fishing There was a scene in Jonathan Dimbleby's recent television programme about Prince Charles in which the young prince was receiving instruction from the old prince in the art of fly fishing. The lad stood in a Scottish loch, waving his rod back and forth, his gaze apparently fixed - not on the water but on his dad, perched in his kilt on two boulders. It so happened that a few days before, I had taken my elder son fishing. I was not wearing a kilt, and nor is he a prince, and our intended quarry was not Scottish trout, but whatever we might find lurking in a miniature weirpool on a sidestream of the Kennet in Berkshire. Nor were we fly fishing. Instead, I carried a tin of sweetcorn, with hook and float at the business end of the line. I told him we would certainly catch fish. He - with the bolshie scepticism customary in adolescent sons, and mindful of previous disappointments - was disbelieving. I impaled a grain of corn, dropped it in the pool, and the float shot under. Soon a dace was in the keepnet, to be followed by perch, chub, roach and bream. Within an hour he was proclaiming himself an expert. And after an hour and half, even though we continued to catch fish as fast as I could rebait the hook and he could cast it, he announced that he was satisfied, and asked if we could go and watch football on television. The truth is that, in his heart, he is not a fisherman. This matters not a jot to him or me. But that afternoon, spent whisking out a netful of little fish, and the glimpse of the Royal fishing lesson, set me thinking about how the love for a sport is born and how, in my own case, the fire was lit. My father was no angler. But by the time I was eight or nine I had become aware that two of my elder brothers were thoroughly infected with this strange passion for angling. They had been given elementary instruction by my grandmother afloat on Windermere. They had learnt the nasty but necessary technique of sticking a hook through a worm, and how to subdue the perch which grabbed it. This knowledge they took to the banks of our local river, and there developed it. And eventually I was allowed to go too. We were fortunate in our river, the Loddon, which flows into the Thames at Wargrave, Berkshire. We had friends who lived in a large house beside it, and we were given the run of the two or three miles of river which went with it. It is many years since I fished there, and I would not care to do so now, for there is too much of a tangle of memories attached to it. Thirty years and more ago, it ran clear and was rich in weed and fish. Chub thronged the quicker water, with barbel as well; while the quieter holes held perch and roach. I was passionate about fishing at once, and it is a sign of the depth of that passion that it endured, for it was two years before I caught a fish at all. This great event took place, not on the Loddon, but at the mill on the Thames at Sonning. The great grinding wheels are now silent, and the place is a pretty theatre. But then the water in the millpool roared and surged, and shoals of chub and barbel gathered there to feed on the tasty waste from the milling. It was a tricky place to fish. You had to stand on the road bridge, and cast up with a heavy weight towards the mill. The bottom was strewn with snags, and many a week's pocket money was swallowed up on the hooks and leads we left there. The best time was early morning, and we would bicycle over with the aluminium worm bucket clanking against the handlebars. It was not much of a fish, the chub I caught near the willow tree on the right side of the millpool. But it was big enough to require one of my brothers to scramble down on to one of the bridge supports to net it. And I felt that I had joined the big boys. Being made a bishop or taking one's seat in the House of Commons might be an adult equivalent. Not long after, I caught a much bigger chub on the Loddon. It came up and seized a piece of floating breadcrust, dived into several weedbeds, and reduced me to an utter lather before giving itself up. By then the fire was well and truly lit, and - though it has flickered occasionally in the intervening years - it still burns warmly enough today. The moral of my tale, if you can call it that, is as follows. You can teach your child, or anyone else's, to fish; but not to want to fish. You can provide opportunity, cash, advice, encouragement. But the spark, the magic of the passion, is a gift, from somewhere.</p>

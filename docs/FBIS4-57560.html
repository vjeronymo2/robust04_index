			<p>BFN     [Text] On 17 May, Felipe Sola, the Argentine agriculture,  livestock, and fishing secretary, and Bob McMullan, the  Australian minister for trade and administrative services,  analyzed several subjects to be included on the agenda of the  Cairns Group meeting that will be held in Montevideo on 18 May,  especially the problems that Canada's subsidies create in the  international market.    Both officials also discussed trade and technological  exchanges between both countries since Argentina may be able to  offer Australia training and modernization services. Another  subject broached at the meeting was animal health and its  relation with the concept of regionalization (disease-free  areas) recently approved by the GATT.    Sola and McMullan, who is also Cairns Group chairman, were  of  one mind concerning the importance of making strides in the  implementation of GATT's animal and plant health framework.    With regard to the Cairns Group meeting, they agreed that  this group's new role is of paramount importance because since  the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of GATT's trade talks, now  its 14 member countries will have to monitor whether countries  abide by the Final Act agreed upon in Marrakech and will have to  establish the basis for future negotiations on international  agricultural and livestock trade.    Sola and McMullan, who arrived in Chile on 16 May, will  leave  for Montevideo tomorrow to attend the 14th Cairns Group meeting.</p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL LIBRARIES  </P> <P> A handful of books are banned from a few isolated schools. High profile authors  (Harlan Ellison, Amy Tan) view this with alarm and hold teas and readings to  protest. The Times devotes headlines ("Celebrities Rally 'Round Written Word,"  Metro, Sept. 24) and reporters to tell us of the creeping "darkness" that  threatens to take the marginal book from the grasp of the hungry reader.  </P> <P> Yet, on a daily basis in California, most children are denied access to all  library books. Everywhere else in the United States, a student can walk down  the hall to a school library filled with books, make a choice and pursue an  interest by reading.  </P> <P> Not in California. National and state reports have verified what anyone who  cares to look can see. The vast majority of California elementary (K-8) schools  have no library.  </P> <P> We don't have to burn books in California because there are no books to burn.  </P> <P> In other states a school cannot be accredited without a library. In California,  libraries are designated "extracurricular," like golf.  </P> <P> In other states the school librarian buys books to support all aspects of the  curriculum and to appeal to the reading interests of all children. In  California the state Department of Education suggests that additional books  might be a useful adjunct to the required texts. And state Supt. of Public  Instruction Bill Honig gets to use your Opinion Section to lecture President  George Bush on national education policy ("Education Reform Can Reach High  Payoffs With Modest New Federal Help," Op-Ed Page, Sept. 24).  </P> <P> Let one parent object to a racial slur in a required novel and we have "news."  Let schools remain empty of library books while children are denied access to  choice and we have . . . California.  </P> <P> A meager attempt to change all this, AB 2026, Assemblyman Delaine Eastin's  (D-Union City) L.E.A.R.N. bill, made it through both houses, with bipartisan  support.  </P> <P> The bill would have provided $1 for each California child to nudge districts in  the direction of school libraries.  </P> <P> No headline, no article.  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian vetoed the bill.  </P> <P> RICHARD K. MOORE  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P> <P> Moore is a librarian at Torrance High School.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 15 TASS -- ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on a CIS  summit opening in Moscow on Friday:    "Main attention at the summit will be devoted to the  implementation of the treaty on an economic union. The  discussion will begin with the consideration of a draft  agreement on Ukraine's accession to the CIS economic union as an  associated member".    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) believes that the efficiency of  the regular CIS summit will be "quite modest" because up to now  the CIS has not been able to turn either into a confederation  or, still less, into a federation. The CIS has failed to form  even a sensible economic or defence union".    At the same time the newspaper admits that if there were no  CIS at all, the gap between the ex-Soviet republics and their  peoples "would have been immeasurably wider".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA (INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER) maintains that  the CIS summit is unlikely to become "the embodiment of a  re-integration success". It is not clear so far how serious is  the refusal of Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev to  attend the summit. The refusal can hardly be accounted for by  the "non-diplomatic cold" alone.    The newspaper's opinion is that President Boris Yeltsin of  the Russian Federation "in Nazarbayev's absence and with a  comlex relationship with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk is  unlikely to feel confident presiding over the summit: The lack  of support from strong partners will not be made up for by the  loyalty of the other summiteers".    PRAVDA briefly reports a CIS summit agenda, pointing out the  possiblity that the summit will decide to create a permanently  functioning body of the economic union -- an inter-state  economic committee.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA singles out a report that a plane owned by  one of U.S. private air companies crossed the Russian border in  the area of Kamchatka on April 13. Anti-aircraft systems  spotted the plane when it was only approaching the border. The  plane was forced to land at one of Russian airports.    After the circumstances of the incident were cleared up, the  plane was allowed to refuel and leave Russian territory.  Referring to U.S. news media, the newspaper points out that  this is illustrative of a "radical change in relations between  the two countries".    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an interview with merited test pilot  Mark Gallai, Dr. of science (technology), who is chagrined by  how the property of the former Soviet Union is being divided.  He says this does not look like a "civilised divorce".    "Soviet long-range aviation was deployed all over the  country  as was prompted by military considerations. If a large number  of our strategic bombers turned out to be in Ukraine, this, to  my mind, does not at all mean that citizens of Ukraine had a  larger input of energies and resources in the developemnt of the  aircraft than residents in the other ex-Soviet republics".    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on the recent bombing of Serbian  positions in the area of Gorazde by NATO aircraft:    The West apparently "is not afraid of waking the Russian  bear". Otherwise, "NATO would have been careful not to bomb the  hope for peace in Yugoslavia".    SOVETSKAYA ROSSIA asserts that no "breaktrhough to peace",  as  was widely publicised by pro-Yeltsin media, was observed: As a  matter of fact arms-twisting tactics were being applied to the  Serbs with the mediation of Russian diplomacy..."    PRAVDA runs an interwview with Yuriy Vlasov, a member of the  State Duma, who comments on the forthcoming signing, scheduled  for this month, of a deed of Russia's accession to the  Partnership-for- Peace system.    "Such partnership is not for Russia," Vlasov maintains.  "NATO  does not reduce its armaments but thoroughly modernises them,  qualitatively increasing its combat might with our simultaneous  weakening devoid of any logic. It is the weakening of Russia,  an ultiimate weakening, that the United States presses for, not  an equal disarmament."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Belyayev] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- Following prolonged  discussions, the State Property Committee established procedure  and time (April) for selling shares of a Russian joint stock  society, Gazprom. The committee announced the number of shares  to be sold -- 28.7 per cent from the authorised capital  totalling 236.7 billion roubles.    The state seeks not to release Gazprom from its hold at the  first stage of privatisation and retains 40 per cent of shares  for three years. The society has already sold 15 per cent of  stocks to gas industry workers according to a closed  subscription: they were purchased by nearly 270,000 people.    It is necessary now to sell the largest block of shares  which  will be sold at 60 regional auctions. Each auction will sell  blocks of shares, the size of which will be proportionate to the  value of the industry's fixed assets on a given territory.  There is another distinguishing feature of auctions. Their  participants will consist of physical persons having permanent  residence registration on a given territory.    Tyumen region residents will buy the greatest number of  Gazprom stocks: 17 million shares worth 1,000 roubles each.  This is 7.15 per cent from the authorised capital. Another 5.7  per cent of stocks will be floated in the Yamal-Nenets national  area. The labour and shares floating division of the Gazprom  society compiled a map of a kind: a list of regions indicating  the value of Gazprom fixed assets on their territories.    The Orenburg region with its gas fields and gas-processing  amalgamations trails the Sverdlovsk and Perm regions as to the  value of fixed assets. This is despite the fact that gas is not  produced there. The last cities on the list are Moscow and St.  Petersburg consuming the greatest quantities of gas but having  no production facilities of the society on their territories.</p>

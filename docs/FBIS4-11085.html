			<p>BFN     [Text] With warm congratulations to Eastern Army troops,  Army General Raul Castro, minister of the Revolutionary Armed  Forces [FAR], said farewell to the participants in the Eastern  Army Special Military Council.    Raul presented an enlarged picture of Eastern Army Chief  Ramon Espinosa Martin, in which both men are standing in front  of a billboard reading: This command is top notch. Raul affirmed  that this gift marks the 33rd anniversary of the creation of the  Eastern Army, and described as masterful the demonstrations he  attended.    The closing address by Division General Ulises Rosales del  Toro, member of the Politburo and chief of the FAR General  Staff, stressed that the council's accomplishments are part of a  program which foresaw the current situation much earlier than  other institutions. He pointed out that the key has been the  implementation of a complete concept were every FAR Ministry  member has specific responsibilities, from the minister to the  soldier.    In its final phase, the council listened to addresses by the  first secretaries of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] in  Guantanamo, Santiago de Cuba, and Holguin Provinces, regarding  the energy potential of these regions. The PCC officials  stressed efforts and results of the work to increase, among  other things, the use of bagasse and shaft, the construction of  minidams and windmills, and conservation of traditional fuels.    Central Committee member Eugenio Mainegra gave a special  address to the council on the status of the nationwide efforts  to solve difficulties in alternative energy sources efforts.  Earlier, the FAR minister's work group and the members of the  military council visited the Limoncito hydraulic complex  designed to irrigate plantain plantations by gravity. The  project, with a capacity of 7.14 million cubic meters, supplies  water to 33 plantain caballerias planted on planters in order to  enrich the organic layers of the soil and improve drainage.  Limoncito is a landmark for Holguin construction workers who in  10 months in 1992 completed the main reservoir, a flow  regulating facility, and over four kilometers of the channel.    The military visitors also inaugurated an experimental  facility for processing agricultural residues such as sugarcane  shaft which is shaped into compact briquettes. Once the facility  reaches its top production capacity it will produce over 4,000  metric tons of briquettes a year, which will replace 1,440 tons  of oil or prevent having to cut down 174 hectares of forest. At  his site, coal and phenolic acids are obtained simultaneously.  These are used to produce heavy oils such as creosol, guaiacum,  emollients, and solvents.    During a visit to a repair workshop, the two work groups  observed procedures to make tires for light vehicles with  methods developed in that workshop -- a vanguard unit of the FAR  Civilian Workers Union. According to technical tests the final  product's quality is superior to imports and lays a basis for  the budding production of tires for heavy vehicles.    Great prowess has been demonstrated by the mini-industries  of  the General Staff of the Eastern Army, which have produced so  far this year, 21 tons of food including candied preserves,  tomato and other vegetables pastes, candy, and cassava. In the  other 51 facilities of this type in the Eastern Army the  production extends to detergents, lotions made from citrus  extracts, liquid and bar soap, and shoe polish and dye.    Before the closing of the council, there was a praiseworthy  cooking demonstration including 160 recipes for cooking fresh  water fish grown in dozens of army units. The things seen in the  extensive tour evidence how much is being done by the Eastern  Army to overcome the effects of the special period and  contribute to the FAR and to Cuba's development.    Raul was right when he affirmed in his farewell that it will  be difficult to take away from the Eastern Army the title of  best in the FAR.</p>

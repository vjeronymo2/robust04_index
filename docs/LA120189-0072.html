			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> NO MURDER CHARGE IN NEWBORN'S DEATH  </P> <P> A 15-year-old Garden Grove honors student whose newborn baby drowned in a high  school restroom toilet will not be charged with murder, authorities said. The  Santiago High School sophomore remained hospitalized in good condition. Orange  County Deputy Dist. Atty. John Conley said prosecutors have not decided whether  to press involuntary manslaughter or child endangerment charges, or bring no  charges at all. An autopsy showed the baby boy was apparently delivered into  the toilet, where he drowned. However, authorities say they found no evidence  that the girl deliberately drowned the child. Vietnamese culture frowns on  unwed mothers, and girls who become pregnant are usually thrown out of their  homes by their parents. "If it goes to court, it'll ruin her life for good,"  said Dr. Co Dang Long Pham, a Westminster obstetrician. "I feel she shouldn't  be charged," said Mai Cong, chairman of the Vietnamese Community Social Service  Center.  </P></p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / World Trade News: Philippine financing sets new pattern LOANS exceeding Dollars 700m (Pounds 444m) have been pledged by a group of international financial institutions to equip a 700MW coal-fired power station in the Philippines. Hopewell Power (Philippines) Corporation, a subsidiary of Hopewell Holdings of Hong Kong, will construct the plant under a build-operate-transfer (BOT) arrangement with the government. The Dollars 700m will be used to buy equipment, mainly from Mitsubishi of Japan and Westinghouse of the US. Costing an estimated Dollars 933m, the plant is described as the biggest single foreign investment ever in the Philippines. The financing deal was arranged by the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank arm concerned with private sector projects. The other main sources of finance are the Japanese and US export-import banks. It is the first time the latter have provided limited recourse co-financing without government guarantees for a large power project in the developing world. The IFC will provide Dollars 10m in equity and lend Dollars 60m on its own account, with up to Dollars 40m more to be syndicated with commercial banks. Financing is also being provided by Britain's Commonwealth Development Corporation and the Asian Development Bank. The financing deal is expected to become a model for infrastructure projects elsewhere in the developing world.</p>

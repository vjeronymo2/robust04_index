			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Ramco shares double SHARES OF Aberdeen-based Ramco Oil Services have more than doubled on market optimism over its involvement in a contract to develop a 1.4bn barrel Azerbaijani oil field in the South Caspian Sea, writes Walton Morais. Since the deal to develop the Guneshli field was announced on October 1, the USM-quoted stock has doubled from 36p, to Friday's close of 74p. Ramco, whose core activity is the supply of corrosion control and ancilliary services to the oil and marine industries, will develop the field with Pennzoil, the US oil group. Pennzoil will bear all development costs and operate the field while Ramco will enjoy a share of the profits thanks to its early role in lining up the deal. Ramco's share of profits will be 10 per cent in the initial stage rising to 17.5 per cent with a full participating interest after Pennzoil has recovered its costs. Mr Stephen Remp, the 45-year-old American chairman and chief executive who founded the company, explained that the favourable terms to Ramco stem from its pathfinding role in securing the contract from the Azerbaijani government. Current production in the Guneshli field was 130,000 barrels per day and should increase to 270,000 when the field was in full production.</p>

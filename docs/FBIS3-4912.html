At the upcoming Seoul-Tokyo summit, Japan is expected to  explain its efforts to settle past issues between the two  nations, Yu Pyong-u, director-general of the Asian Affairs  Bureau at the Foreign Ministry, told the National Assembly's  Foreign Affairs and National Unification Committee Wednesday.    He strongly hinted that the matter of arranging repatriation  of Koreans on the Russian island would top the summit's agenda,  along with the North Korean nuclear problem.    Tokyo mobilized around 150,000 Koreans for forced labor on  Sakhalin in the 1940s when Korea was under Japanese colonial  rule. About 42,000 first-generation Koreans and their  descendants still live on the island, with an estimated 13,000  saying they want to spend the rest of their lives in Korea.    Seoul holds Japan legally responsible for their repatriation  and insists that it should bear the cost of their return and  settlement and living expenses.    Repatriation of Koreans on Sakhalin could symbolize  Seoul-Tokyo attempts to finally put their past behind them, and  the two governments have already made such diplomatic efforts as  sending a joint study team in January, Yu said.</p>

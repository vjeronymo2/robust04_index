			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> RURAL ABORTION SERVICES DROP  </P> <P> It is becoming increasingly difficult for women in rural areas to find a  health-care facility offering abortions, according to a study by a  reproductive-biology think tank that has found a 51% drop in the number of  rural abortion providers since 1977. The study, released last week by the Alan  Guttmacher Institute, found that 93% of all rural counties in the United States  had no hospitals, clinics or physicians willing to do abortions in 1988.  </P> <P> One half of all urban counties were in a similar position. In the latest of a  series of abortion service surveys, the institute found a 19% drop in the  number of rural providers between 1985 and 1988 -- a decline the researchers  traced largely to decisions by rural hospitals to simply stop offering  abortions.  </P> <P> "The greater the distance from a physician or facility providing abortions, the  less likely a woman is to gain access to the service," the institute concluded.  Those women are more likely to have abortions later in pregnancy, when the risk  is higher, the researchers said.  </P></p>

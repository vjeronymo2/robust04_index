			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Progreso in Spanish at  1200 GMT on 2 February reports that Cuba "enjoys international  prestige for its policy against trafficking in and consumption  of drugs." Cuba's Armed Forces and courts severely sanction  anyone, Cuban or foreign, who tries to traffic in drugs in Cuba.  The radio notes: We know that our society is not perfect; a  number of drug-related incidents has been detected. However,  guilty parties have had to bear the full brunt of our laws. The  following case illustrates the effective action of our police  agents in the systematic fight against drugs.    When the Special Crimes Department of the Havana City  Province Police Operations Unit learned that "a certain amount  of" cocaine was "going to be sold and bought" at a home in La  Lisa Municipality, they set up an operation in which the  Investigations Technical Unit [Unidad Tecnica Investigativa] and  the provincial DTI [Department of Technical Research]  participated. Four citizens were arrested and cocaine seized.  Captain Angel Perez Ramos of the Havana City Province Police  Operations Unit was in charge of the investigation that revealed  that Giraldo Arzola Valdez, Aurelio Alfonso Bolanos, and Alberto  Machado Gutierrez--all with terrible social conduct records and  criminal records--were illegally buying and selling drugs. It  was determined that the drugs came from one of the eastern  provinces, where they had washed up on shore. Capt. Perez noted,  moreover, that although the citizenry knows that trafficking in  and using drugs is forbidden in Cuba, "there are unscrupulous  individuals who devote themselves to buying and selling drugs,  which is severely punished by our society." Despite this, Perez  added, the 17 people charged in this case had engaged in the  illegal activity without regard for the consequences.    Capt. Perez said that the accused in this case were tried at  the end of 1993 and that the public prosecutor has asked for  stiff prison sentences for them. Radio Progreso concludes: "Soon  we will announce the sentences given the accused by the judges  in accordance with the degree of criminal involvement of each."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikhil Chakravarty: "Unity in Militancy"] </F>   [Text] An important development in the handling of foreign  policy has practically gone unnoticed -- at least has not been  commented upon as much as it deserved.    This is the induction of the leader of the opposition in  Parliament as the head of the Indian delegation to the current  session of the United Nations human rights commission in Geneva.  Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee spoke at the Geneva meeting not as a  partisan leader but as the accredited representative of the  government and the public of this country.    It signifies there is a remarkable unity within the country  on the Kashmir issue as it stands today. But more important is  the Indian reaction to the exploitation of the Kashmir issue in  the strategic game of the big power. On the face of it, this  unity in approach is a Christmas gift from Mr. Bill Clinton and  his administration. Mr. John Mallot, Ms. Robin Raphel and Mr.  Clinton have spoken so volubly on Kashmir that even the most  obsequious among Washington's friends in India find it difficult  to accept the Clinton administration's attitude to India on the  Kashmir issue.    Criticism has not been confined to charges of human rights  violation by India's security forces in the Kashmir valley. The  U.S. administration has called into question the accession of  Jammu and Kashmir to India and tried to brand it as a civil war  on the lines of Afghanistan.    No criticism has been levelled against Pakistan's support,  both material and political, to the militants in the valley  demanding secession from the Indian Union. It is this blatant  abetment of armed secessionism that has now made New Delhi aware  of the basics of U.S. policy and helped to bring about a degree  of unity within the country.    The assumption on which New Delhi was working until last  year  was that after the Cold War, there would be a realisation on the  part of Washington on the need to accept India as the more  durable and reliable entity in south Asia.    It was also assumed Pakistan's geostrategic importance in  the  region had gone down with the disappearance of the Soviet Union.    For one thing, the huge, complex democracy that India  happens  to be is too difficult to manage and manipulate for any power  however formidable it may claim to be. Even the opening up of  the economy by the Indian authorities at the specific behest of  the International Monetary Fund-World Bank bosses sitting in  Washington does not provide that insurance for the policy makers  in the state department and the Pentagon.    Second, Pakistan's importance to the Pentagon has been  reinforced by the emergence of a whole cluster of central Asian  republics rich in mineral wealth. Also the two sensitive zones  of the Chinese strategic defence, namely, Tibet and Sinkiang are  contiguous to Pakistan and Kashmir as well.    As the entire drama of resumption of an elected regime  unfolded in Pakistan, it was clear the authority of the military  junta has not really been liquidated. It has assumed a fresh  significance in a changed context.    It is in this context one felt the repeated implorings by  New  Delhi with Washington to declare Pakistan a terrorist state was  both unreal and pathetic -- rather demeaning to the self-respect  of the country.    It is good to notice the Indian representative rebuffed the  offer of third party mediation in Kashmir by the Organisation of  Islamic Countries [OIC]. The OIC has long declared its support  for the secessionists in the Kashmir valley.    The key to the settlement of the Kashmir crisis lies in the  hands of the government and leaders of political parties. They  have to take the initiative in talking to the militant groups  and their fellow travellers in the Kashmir valley. They should  arrange a round table in which all the concerned parties --  including most certainly the representatives of the Pandits who  constitute a significant entity in the Kashmir valley -- are  invited.    Incidentally, it was a welcome move on the part of the  Pandit  community to place its case before the Geneva meeting. This move  makes it abundantly clear the alleged violations of human rights  in the Kashmir valley do not go along the Hindu-Muslim communal  divide.    For long, the Indian stand has been that Kashmir is an  internal matter for India. The reality has been this is true in  parts. The international aspect of the Kashmir question is  related to India having taken the Pakistani armed attack on  Kashmir on the very morrow of independence to the UN.    No doubt this aspect of the question has to be tackled at  the  international level and cannot be wished away.    If the burden of New Delhi's case is that all the trouble in  Kashmir is due to Pakistan encouraging the militants, then it  will be giving in to Islamabad's strident clamour for  internationalising the Kashmir question. It is therefore all the  more imperative the Indian leadership takes a bold initiative to  open dialogue with the militants, treating them as fellow  citizens however embittered they may be.    It is time the statesmanship displayed by the prime minister  in unifying Indian opinion for a common stand on Pakistan's  diplomatic offensive on Kashmir was projected at home. This way  a common approach towards the Kashmiri people, however  intractable the militants among them might be at the moment, can  be forged.  *</p>

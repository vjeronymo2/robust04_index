			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 2 Jun -- The charge d'affaires of the  German embassy in Belgrade was summoned to the Federal Ministry  of Foreign Affairs today. The reason was to deliver to him a  sharp protest in connection with the stances contained in the 31  May statement by the German Foreign Ministry concerning talks  between the German State Minister Helmut Schaefer and Ibrahim  Rugova, who was presented as "the most senior freely elected  representative of the majority Albanian population in Kosovo."    The statement of the German Foreign Ministry contains "false  information and an unacceptable assessment of Serbian policy in  Kosovo-Metohija, and sets out the positive assessments of the  German Government on Rugova's separatist movement," the demarche  notes.    The Yugoslav protest stressed that the stances contained in  the German Foreign Ministry statement "support in the most  direct way the separatism of the leader of the Albanian national  minority and are an impermissible interference in the internal  affairs of the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]." These  stances are in contravention of the principles of the UN charter  and the Final Act of the CSCE, the statement noted.</p>

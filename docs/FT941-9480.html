			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Bad press worries Scottish Enterprise Concern was expressed yesterday by Scottish Enterprise, the economic development network for Scotland outside the Highlands, that bad publicity would discourage businessmen from serving on the boards of local enterprise companies. The local enterprise companies have recently been under scrutiny from the Scottish media, with attention concentrated on potential conflicts of interest between directors' business interests and those of the Lecs. Mr Crawford Beveridge, chief executive of Scottish Enterprise, told the opening session of an inquiry by the Scottish select committee of the House of Commons that not one case of conflict of interest involving a director of a Lec had been found. Scottish Enterprise has been criticised by some observers for spending too much on marketing itself. However Mr Beveridge said marketing this year would cost Pounds 10m, compared with Pounds 13m spent in the last year of the Scottish Development Agency and the Training Agency, the predecessors of Scottish Enterprise.</p>

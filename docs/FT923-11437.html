			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Wales 'set to lead recovery' THE WEAK recovery expected in the second half of this year will be led by Wales, Mr David Kern, chief economist of National Westminster Bank, said yesterday. 'The Welsh economy will register a small rise in output of 0.2 per cent this year compared with fairly large outright declines in London and the rest of southern England,' he said. Mr Kern prediced that the resilience of the Welsh economy next year would be 'remarkable'. He pointed out that there had been an increase of just 2 per cent in unemployment in Wales over the past six months against a national rise of 7 per cent. 'Over the next year unemployment in Wales is forecast to rise by 2 per cent compared with 12 per cent in the UK,' he added. He also forecast that between 1993 and 1997 the Welsh economy would grow on average by 2.3 per cent a year - more than the 2 per cent forecast for the UK non-oil economy. He attributed the resilience to 'considerable restructuring' of the Welsh economy during the 1980s. 'The economy has become much more diversified than 10 years ago,' he said. There had been 'an increasingly competitive and enterprising manufacturing sector replacing more traditional industries, while a prominent financial and business-services sector has become a major source of employment.' Foreign investment had played a large role in this diversification, Mr Kern said. 'Wales has succeeded in attracting almost 20 per cent of all inward UK investment in recent years including substantial amounts of Japanese and US-owned manufacturing capacity.' Mr Kern said the outlook for the UK would depend on 'its ability to adjust successfully to the harsh discipline of convergence to a low-inflation environment in the European exchange rate mechanism'. He predicted that Welsh economic performance would comfortably exceed the national average over the next few years.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Sergey Zhirnikhin and Ivan </F> Ivanov]    [Text] Budapest, 31 March -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin, who is here on an official visit, had a meeting  this afternoon with Hungarian President Arpad Goncz.    The ITAR-TASS correspondent was informed by sources within  the Russian Governmental delegation that V. Chernomyrdin had  stated the intention of Russia to firmly adhere to the course of  developing friendly ties and cooperation, which accords with the  interests of the two countries' peoples.    The head of the Russian Cabinet informed the Hungarian  president of the main directions of the Russian Government's  policies, especially in the economic sphere. It was noted that  a deepening of practical cooperation and the finding of mutually  acceptable solutions to questions that arise should provide a  firm and stable basis for the further progress of  Russian-Hungarian trade and economic links.    V. Chernomyrdin said also that Russia highly appreciates the  level that has been achieved in bilateral relations, which are  no longer burdened by any fundamental problems and are  characterized by a fruitful political dialogue and constructive  interaction between the Russian Federation and Hungary in a  spirit of genuine equality and partnership.    Today Russia occupies second place among Hungary's major  economic partners. In its turn, Budapest is in sixth or seventh  place among Moscow's main foreign trade partners, Arpad Goncz  said. In the view of the Hungarian head of state, there is  every chance that the economic interaction between the two  countries can be made even more intensive. The legal and  juridical base for this has already been created.    In spite of the fact that "Western orientation" is  considered  a priority in the development of the Hungarian national economy,  Budapest cannot allow itself not to expand its Eastern European  links, above all with Russia. It is necessary to work out a  joint document on the mutual protection of investments and to  push forward cooperation in the financial sphere and in  interaction between banks, Arpad Goncz stressed.    After meeting the Hungarian president, Viktor Chernomyrdin  laid wreaths at the monument to Soviet soldiers in Budapest's  Freedom Square and at the monument in Heroes Square.</p>

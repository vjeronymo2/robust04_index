			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Yuryev: "What the Bankers Conferred </F> About"]    [Text] A meeting of the managers of a number of  Novosibirsk banks was held behind closed doors several days  ago.    This meeting was held at the initiative of the Novosibirsk  branch of the AKB [joint-stock commercial bank] Vostokinvestbank  and the Siberian commercial bank Aurum. All aspects of banking  activity were examined at the conference. The participants were  compelled to do this, in particular, by the recent decision of  the government to establish a minimal authorized capital in the  amount of 2 billion rubles [R], with subsequent quarterly  adjustments.    To date, more than 70 independent banks and branches have  been operating in our oblast. On the average, their authorized  capital is about R300 million. The level of work of the banks is  very different, which can also be judged by the rating that is  regularly established by the main administration of the Central  Bank of Russia for Novosibirsk Oblast. Lately, the demands on  the banks to provide services on an international level are  becoming more and more persistent. Also, competition is  increasing. Therefore, the problem of improving the quality of  banking services is becoming more and more critical, and it is  unattainable for many without bank mergers. This was also the  main question that the bankers discussed.    Two concepts of future development were proposed at this  meeting. Boris Dudarev, the chairman of the board of the Aurum  Bank, proposed an amalgamation under the aegis of Moscow  organizations. The second concept, proposed by Pavel Mityakin,  the director of the Novosibirsk branch of the AKB  Vostokinvestbank, was based on regional interests. But they, in  the opinion of the leadership of Vostokinvestbank, are closer to  the eastern regions than to the western regions (the main bank,  Vostokinvestbank, is in Vladivostok, and it has various ties  with states of the Asia-Pacific region; it is a member of the  global international financial telecommunications association,  and its capital authorization is more than R12 billion).    The bankers have not adopted a final resolution yet.</p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INVESTIGATION CLOSED IN CASE OF FROZEN HEAD  </P> <P> Prosecutors have quietly closed their investigation into the death of Dora  Kent, the elderly woman whose head was cut off and frozen by a Riverside  cryonics laboratory.  </P> <P> The Riverside County district attorney's office had hoped to file homicide  charges in the 1987 death of Kent, whose head was severed at Alcor Life  Extension Foundation and placed in a tank of liquid nitrogen in hopes that  science would one day reanimate her with a new body.  </P> <P> But Asst. Dist. Atty. Don Inskeep said the inquiry into the bizarre case, which  focused nationwide attention on the controversial freezing technique known as  cryonics, was hampered by a lack of evidence.  </P> <P> "We evaluated all the evidence there was and there simply wasn't enough for us  to prosecute," Inskeep said Wednesday. "There wasn't a likelihood that more  would develop, so the case is closed."  </P> <P> At Alcor, research director Mike Darwin called the decision "a wonderful  Christmas present that is long overdue."  </P> <P> "This was a terrible injustice and it has meant three years of fear and anxiety  for us," Darwin said, noting that investigators once threatened to thaw out  seven heads and a body stored at the laboratory. "Any time you are accused of  grand theft, homicide and other untruths it is damaging to you both personally  and professionally."  </P> <P> Still, it seems Alcor has not suffered financially. Darwin said the laboratory  has 16 "patients" -- 10 heads and six bodies -- in so-called cryonic suspension  today. That is double the number in storage in 1987.  </P> <P> Moreover, Darwin added, another 200 foundation members "have made full legal  and financial arrangements for suspension" at the time of their death.  </P> <P> The strange saga of Kent's head began in late 1987, when the ailing 83-year-old  woman was moved from a convalescent home to Alcor by her son, Saul Kent, a  devotee of cryonics. Alcor officials said that after Kent died a natural death  Dec. 11, her head was surgically removed.  </P> <P> After Alcor applied for a permit to cremate Kent's headless body, the Riverside  County coroner's office launched an investigation, noting that the woman was  not under a doctor's care at the time of her death.  </P> <P> Investigators sought the right to defrost and examine Kent's head, but a  Superior Court judge ruled that would be an unconstitutional infringement on a  person's right to choose how to dispose of his or her remains.  </P> <P> Even without examining the head, however, Coroner Raymond Carillo ruled that  toxicological tests on Kent's body tissues revealed her death was a homicide,  resulting from a lethal dose of a barbiturate.  </P> <P> Alcor officials conceded that the drug Nembutol was administered, but insisted  it was used after her death to help preserve brain cells.  </P> <P> They also called Carillo's investigation a "witch hunt" and "vicious smear  campaign." Carillo, who has come under fire for his handling of several other  prominent cases over the last several years, lost a reelection bid Nov. 6.  </P> <P> Advocates of cryonics believe that future technology will make it possible to  revive the frozen dead. When only a head is preserved, the expectation is that  a body will be cloned to match it.  </P> <P> Most medical experts dismiss cryonics as at best a fantasy, and at worst a  moneymaking scam.  </P> <P> Darwin said Alcor is pursuing a civil lawsuit against Riverside County over the  arrest of staff members and two raids on its facility.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sapporo, June 14 KYODO -- A pro-Pyongyang group of  Korean residents demanded Tuesday [12 June] that police  apologize for investigating a 24-year-old member of the group on  unsubstantiated suspicion of violating a stimulant drug control  law.    The Committee for the Protection of the Rights of Koreans in  Hokkaido, part of the Hokkaido Chapter of the General  Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyun), made the  demand at a press conference, claiming the investigation was  illegal. The accusation followed a recent mistaken raid on the  office of another Chongnyun chapter and related facilities in  Kyoto, where local police said earlier Tuesday it will issue a  statement expressing regret over the incident.    The committee said officers from the Chuo police station in  Sapporo raided the home of the unidentified Korean man, a  company executive in the city, on May 31 and forced him to give  a urine sample for testing, but could find no evidence he had  violated the law. The committee discovered the result of the  test when it asked the police about the investigation June 2.  The man, whose nationality is South Korean but who belongs to  the pro-Pyongyang group, told the committee he suffered mental  stress as a result of the investigation and his business had  also suffered, the committee said. The police gave the man no  explanation either before or after the investigation, it said.    Chae Hong-chol, head of the International Division of  Chongnyun's Hokkaido Chapter, told the press conference he feels  the police are hostile to Koreans and should have been more  cautious considering the recent controversial raids on Chongnyun  offices in Osaka and Kyoto.    Toshiaki Igarashi, deputy head of the police station, said  the raid was legal because it was done with the authorization of  the court.</p>

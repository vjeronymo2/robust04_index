			<p>BFN     [Text] In Lusaka, the government and National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] teams are looking for an  agreement concerning the specific principles that will govern  the second round of presidential elections. The negotiating  teams are slowly coming to an understanding, but there are no  indications that a general and definitive accord might be  written within the next few days. Alves Antonio, our  correspondent in the Zambian capital, reports:    [Begin Antonio recording] The government and UNITA teams to  the Lusaka peace talks continue to discuss the conclusion of the  presidential elections. Of the eight points in the section on  the specific principles governing the conclusion of the  presidential elections, six have already been dealt with. Two  remain and they are giving enough trouble. The negotiating  teams met on their own the whole day today. They have reached  no understanding yet, even though sources close to the talks say  consensus is around the corner. To that end, the advice of UN  Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye, the mediator at the  talks, has been asked. What is the source of disagreement, after  all?    Well, UNITA is insisting on Electoral Law amendments it  deems  necessary, but the government has its own formula and has  reservations about such amendments. The final source of  disagreement has to do with the role of the media during the  presidential elections, notably the role of national mass media  whose work is not linked to the specific work of the National  Electoral Council.

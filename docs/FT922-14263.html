			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / International Company News: Waste Management sets price for global issue WASTE Management, the Chicago-based waste disposer, yesterday fixed a price of about Dollars 10.24 a share on the 75m shares it is offering to investors in New York, London and elsewhere in a flotation of its international operations. Waste Management, the world's largest disposer of waste, is raising Dollars 770m through the offering of a 20 per cent stake in the international business. The offering involves a placing of 26m shares in the UK market; an offer for sale of 30m shares in the US, packaged as 15m American depositary shares (ADS), each representing two ordinary shares; and an offer of 18.75m shares in other markets. Last night in New York the ADS were priced at Dollars 20.475 each through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch. That implies a price of Dollars 10.237 for each share in the international offering. Of the 375m shares expected to be outstanding after the issue, parent Waste Management will hold 56 per cent.</p>

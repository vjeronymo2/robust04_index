			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AIRPORT TERMINAL NAMED AFTER RILEY  </P> <P> Despite a late protest from a Costa Mesa resident, the Board of Supervisors on  Tuesday named its new $57-million terminal at John Wayne Airport in honor of  Supervisor Thomas F. Riley.  </P> <P> "It is a great day again for Orange County to recognize one of our own,"  Supervisors' Chairman Don R. Roth said, adding that the tough negotiations  leading to the expansion would not have been possible without Riley.  </P> <P> Riley -- 77, the senior member on the board, who is running for reelection in  June -- will join former supervisors Ralph B. Clark, Ronald W. Caspers and C.M.  (Cye) Featherly who had parks or buildings named in their honor.  </P> <P> "I think he was humbled by the fact that the other supervisors would vote to  have the terminal named after him," one staff member said. "Not everyone  realizes how tough the negotiations and legal battles were between the county  and the residents of Newport Beach, whose homes are under the flight path.  Sometimes people forget that Tom lives in Newport Beach."  </P> <P> During a dispute over adding commercial flights, Riley's next-door neighbor  even put up a sign reading, "Dump Riley."  </P> <P> Near the end of the Tuesday meeting and after supervisors voted on the matter,  Linda Fiffer, a Costa Mesa resident, told the board that she objected to the  terminal being named after Riley. She had a petition with 647 signatures  supporting a move to drop all names from the airport, including that of John  Wayne. She said the airport should simply be called Orange County Airport.  </P> <P> The building that will bear Riley's name is a 338,000-square-foot, two-story  structure built in the likeness of an airplane fuselage. The terminal is part  of an overall $310-million expansion project, the largest county public works  program.  </P> <P> Roth said Riley, a retired Marine Corps brigadier general, has spent "time in  the trenches" to get the project completed.  </P> <P> "I can think of a no more fitting tribute to the man who is largely  responsible" for the airport expansion, he said.  </P></p>

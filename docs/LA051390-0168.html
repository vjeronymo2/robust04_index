			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO EASY ANSWERS TO ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES  </P> <P> Michael Schrage's use of "cyberpunks" to beat environmentalists over the head  strikes me as a bit nutty. Amusing yes, but nutty.  </P> <P> It's true that environmentalists range all the way from New Age Greens and  Earth Firsters to Sierra Club Orange County Singles and Wilderness Society  white water kayakers.  </P> <P> Most of us have high-tech cars, fax machines, Gore-Tex and modems that talk to  each other. But it is true we are suspicious of nuclear energy, malathion  spraying (which doesn't appear to work) and high-tech fixes such as messing  around with genes.  </P> <P> Actually, as Schrage sort of admits, technology got us into these messes (and  most of us environmentalists pump as much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as  the next guy). We can't turn the clock back. But we can't stop it from ticking  either.  </P> <P> Hey, Mr. Schrage, what are we going to do?  </P> <P> LU HAAS  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

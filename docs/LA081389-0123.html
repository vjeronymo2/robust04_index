			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: RICKY SKAGGS. "KENTUCKY THUNDER." EPIC. ** 1/2: ALBUMS ARE RATED  ON A SCALE OF ONE(POOR) TOFIVE(A CLASSIC) STARS  </P> <P> As a singer, Skaggs has always been a lot like Clark Kent: mild-mannered,  eminently likable -- and harmless. Lacking the powers of vocal Supermen like  George Jones and Randy Travis, Skaggs runs into trouble with many of this  album's hackneyed stories and allusions. "The Fields of Home" dredges up every  hokey, tear-inducing gimmick this side of Old Shep. The title tune, with its  compendium of cliches about the Bluegrass State, poses no threat to displace  Bill Monroe's "Blue Moon of Kentucky" as the state song. Skaggs is at his best  when he keeps it light and lively, as in Sonny Curtis' witty "He Was Onto  Somethin' (So He Made You)." The musicianship, as expected from Skaggs and his  top-drawer associates, is sterling throughout, but it's still not enough to  rescue most of these songs from the clutches of banality.

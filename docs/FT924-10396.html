			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Charity at one remove I PROPOSE, in certain circumstances to leave a large proportion of my estate to my brother, in trust for his use and enjoyment during his lifetime, and eventually on his death to be divided among several nominated charities. In view of their ultimate destination, will these funds escape inheritance tax (a) on my estate and (b) on my brother's? If you leave any funds to your brother on your death, then this will be charged to inheritance tax subject to the available nil rate band of up to Pounds 150,000. Similarly if you leave funds in trusts for your brother, an inheritance tax charge would arise. It would be normal to set out the terms of the trust in your will so that your brother may enjoy the income during his lifetime. You may wish to ensure that the trust enables the trustees to advance capital to him at their discretion. In this type of 'Life interest' trust you need to carefully consider who will be the trustees because if your brother is a trustee, this could lead to all the capital being appointed to him. The trust deed should state that on your brother's death, the funds would be left to nominated charities and this event would be free of inheritance tax.

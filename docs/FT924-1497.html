			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Survey of Zambia (9): Foreign interest mounts - While investments are as yet only intentions, figures look good A NEW investment code and a new government is doing wonders for Zambia's foreign investment performance. The country's one-stop investment centre, set up little more than a year ago when the 1991 Investment Act became law, approved more than 440 projects worth Dollars 650m in the first nine months of 1992. The new investment act targets five main areas - agriculture, non-traditional exports, import substitution, tourism and 'rural projects'. The value of investment figures look extremely high, but officials are quick to point out that this represents intentions rather than 'investment on the ground', and that approved projects might never be implemented. Furthermore, the numbers relate both to domestic and foreign investment. A more conservative figure is that for investment licences actually issued, which lag behind projects approved. But even here the figures are impressive  -300 licences issued during the first 10 months of 1992 for projects valued at Dollars 300m. Figures for the first half of the year, in which 130 licences were issued, show foreign exchange 'pledges', as one investment centre official calls them, of Dollars 128m or 95 per cent of the total value of licences, implying that the domestic component is only small. Investments in these five categories, including expansion projects by existing firms, qualify for a range of investment incentives, including a three-year tax holiday (followed by two years of 75 per cent tax exemption), a seven-year tax-holiday on dividends and selective employment tax, exemption from import and sales taxes and generous export retention allowances. The investment code also provides guarantees against expropriation and allows investors to remit up to 75 per cent of after-tax profits, along with the principal and interest on foreign loans, management fees and royalties and the proceeds of asset sales. The Investment Centre chairman, Mr Evans Chibiliti, makes no secret of the fact that his organisation has some way to go before he will be satisfied that it is fully effective. No structures were in place, he says, until early this year, and initially a backlog of project approvals built up, although this has now been cleared to the point where the centre is able to respond within 30 days of an application being received, as stipulated in the act. Investors are not required to submit projects through the centre, nor does it claim to be a fully one-stop operation. Even after acquiring his licence, the investor still has to do the rounds of the Ministry of Lands, the Bank of Zambia and the immigration authorities. The bulk of the inquiries come from medium and small-scale operators and not the big multinationals. South Africa has shown considerable interest, although much of it through the note-book rather than the cheque-book. White farmers from Zimbabwe have been taking a look at maize, tobacco and horticultural projects, while many existing Zambian firms are expanding and refurbishing manufacturing operations. Critics say existing investors are unhappy at an incentive package favouring the newcomers, arguing that Zambia would do better to cut its corporate tax, provide guarantees of remittability and abandon the idea of targeted tax holidays and other incentives. Centre officials reject this 'level playing field' argument on the grounds that changes to an investment code, launched less than 18 months ago, would send the wrong signals. 'What investors want is policy consistency,' says Mr Chibiliti, although he favours broadening the range of priority sectors to include healthcare, education and finance. In spite of this, the government will come forward with important changes to the code in the budget next month, with businessmen hoping for a lower rate of company tax and more generous remittability conditions, rather than targeted incentives.</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Government 'saves Pounds 26bn on pensions' Sales agents and independent financial advisers saved the government almost Pounds 29bn in 1992 through selling pensions, insurance and mortgages to individuals who did not then look to the state to make provision, according to a study published yesterday. The Henley Centre report - commissioned by IFA Promotion, which promotes independent financial advisers - says that by far the biggest element in this saving, Pounds 26.3bn, relates to pension provision.</p>

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / International Company News: Parametric looks to Asia for expansion PARAMETRIC TECHNOLOGY, one of the fastest-growing high-technology companies in the US, has begun a big expansion into Asia to tap the market for its mechanical Cadcam (computer-aided design and manufacturing) software. The Massachusetts-based Parametric, founded in 1985 and valued at about Dollars 1bn on Wall Street, has been rapidly developing its operations in Europe over the past two years. But in recent months it has stepped up its Asian presence, opening direct sales offices to complement existing distribution arrangements. Mr Louis Volpe, vice-president for marketing and operations, said in London that Parametric wanted to achieve a broad balance between its US, European and Asian sales over the next 10 years. With turnover doubling in the US each year, this would imply even faster growth in Europe and Asia. Parametric sees Japan as its biggest market in Asia. Along with other Cadcam vendors, it is keen to exploit the Japanese move from two-dimensional to three-dimensional mechanical design, which is occurring rather later than in Europe and the US. But Mr Volpe said Chinese companies had expressed much interest in its products. It had also just received the largest-ever Cadcam order from an Indian company, Tata Engineering and Locomotive. In Europe, Parametric is targeting electronics packaging and automotive companies. It is hoping to use its new Pro/Dieface software for complex body-panels as a way into the European automotive market. Parametric's sales surged from Dollars 11m in 1989 to Dollars 86.7m last year due to the popularity of its Pro/Engineer family of software products and their applicability to a number of different workstations. Net earnings over the same period rose from Dollars 2.24m to Dollars 21.1m. The company said in April its second-quarter earnings rose 109 per cent to Dollars 9.8m.</p>

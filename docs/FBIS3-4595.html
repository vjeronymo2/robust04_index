			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 28 (YONHAP) -- The government plans to  discuss not only the North Korean nuclear issue but also a  summit between Presidents Kim Yong-sam and Kim Il-song and  unification if the two Koreas agree to exchange special envoys.    The special envoys would also discuss problems related to  implementation of the basic inter-Korean accords reached in  December 1992, government sources said Monday.    The government plans to tell North Korea when working-level  officials of the two sides meet at the truce village of  Panmunjom on Tuesday that Seoul could show flexibility by  sending a special envoy to Pyongyang first, around March 15,  they said.    These decisions were made at a meeting Sunday morning of  government leaders concerned with unification, who agreed to  send an official letter in the name of Prime Minister Yi  Hoe-chang to his North Korean counterpart Kang Song-san.    Seoul's decisions would help break the impasse between the  two Koreas since a series of three working-level contacts last  October, they said.    In the previous contacts, Seoul proposed discussion of the  nuclear question and implementation of the basic inter-Korean  accords. But the North Korean side insisted on discussing Kim  Il- song's "10-point" proposals for unification and an  inter-Korean summit meeting.    With regard to the special envoy exchange, South Korea  maintained that since it was initially proposed by the North,  Pyongyang should be the first to send its envoy to Seoul while  the North asked the South to send its envoy first to Pyongyang.    "Taking the date for a third round of high-level talks  between the United States and North Korea into consideration,  the (Seoul) Government position is that an exchange of  inter-Korean special envoys will have to be realized around  March 15," one government official said.    At Tuesday's meeting, problems with exchanging special  envoys  would be discussed, the official added.    The official said there has been no change in the U.S.-South  Korean position that the envoy exchange must take place before a  third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks.    As long as that basic position was maintained, the official  hinted, other issues such as whose special envoy should visit  first could be flexible.</p>

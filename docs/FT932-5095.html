			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar surges against D-Mark STRONGER-than-expected US employment data caused the dollar to surge sharply yesterday, rising 3 pfennigs against the German D-mark, writes Gillian Tett. The US non-farm payroll figures for May showed an increase of 209,000, well above previous forecasts of 141,000. Coupled with a slight fall in the unemployment rate, from 7.0 per cent in April to 6.9 per cent in May, the data fuelled market confidence about the prospects for US economic recovery, causing the dollar to strengthen against most currencies. Though its movement against the D-Mark was slightly tempered by the announcement of better-than-expected German figures for manufacturing orders and unemployment, the dollar nevertheless rose against the D-Mark, piercing the DM1.62 resistance level. By the close of the day it stood at DM1.622, up from the previous day's close of DM1.602. Although its gains against the yen were slightly more modest, it nevertheless finished at Y107.7, up on its opening level of Y106.80. But while most dealers agreed that the dollar seemed set to strengthen further over the coming months, they were devided about how far it would be able to defend its gains against the D-Mark in the short term. Mr Avinash Persaud, economist at UBS, believed that yesterday's dramatic rise marked the beginning of a clear trend, in the light of Germany's economic weakness. 'The dollar will be well supported for a time to come,' said Mr Persaud. But as Ms Alison Cottrell at Midland Global Markets Research pointed out, relatively weak US manufacturing indicators suggested that the American recovery was still patchy. Coupled with the slightly better-than-expected German economic indicators, the D-mark might, she suggested, harden slightly over the next few days. 'The important thing about today's figures from Germany is not that they were good, because they weren't, but they weren't as bad as expected and that is helping the D-Mark,' said Ms Cottrell. Continued uncertainty over Spain's general election, caused the peseta to slip slightly against the D-Mark during the day, closing at Pta78.27 against Thursday's close of 77.89. With the markets fearing an inconclusive election result, many analysts predicted a turbulent time for the peseta next week. 'The peseta is very vulnerable right now,' said Mr Julian Callow, treasury economist at Citibank.</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: Bosch slips to record operating loss - Two leading forces in Europe's motor industry are struggling to regain ground Robert Bosch, the privately- owned German electronic and vehicle parts manufacturer, made an operating loss of more than DM100m (Dollars 61.3m) last year, the first time it has gone into the red since the second world war. The group refused to give any details of the loss, saying only that it ran into 'high three figures'. The loss reflected the combination of recession, pressure on prices from the car manufacturers which are Bosch's biggest customers, low capacity utilisation, the strength of the D-Mark and the costs of introducing swingeing rationalisation measures, Mr Hermann Scholl, the group's chairman said at a press conference in Stuttgart. There had been an improvement in the general economic climate during the current year to date, Mr Scholl said, with turnover up just 6 per cent to DM13.7bn in the first five months of 1994. This was mainly due to a pick-up in demand outside Germany, and the chairman predicted that sales for the current year would rise by 4 per cent and that there would be modest turnover growth in 1995. But in spite of the improvement in the economy and extensive rationalisation measures, Bosch would make an operating loss again this year, the chairman warned. The cluster of negative factors last year led to a 5.7 per cent drop in sales to DM32.5bn after DM34.4bn in 1992, the first fall in the group's turnover since 1967. Pre-tax profits dropped by 63 per cent, from DM1.36bn to DM510m, while net after-tax earnings fell 17 per cent from DM512m to DM426m. While economic conditions had improved since last year, the chairman warned that price pressures would not diminish and that measures to cut costs and improve productivity would have to continue. In 1993, 13,200 jobs were cut, and the plan is to reduce the payroll by a further 4,100 this year, bringing the total down to 152,500 by the year-end. Bosch said that it would be restructuring its communications technology activities: public communications technology, private communications technology and radio technology are to be brought together into one division as of July 1. The division, which generated turnover of DM5.5bn last year, will be divided into 12 product areas while the businesses will pool their research and development, marketing and other resources. The new structure is designed to strengthen Bosch's position in a growing but intensely competitive market, Mr Scholl said.</p>

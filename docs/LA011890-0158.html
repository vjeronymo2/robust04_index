			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LUCAS DUE TO TESTIFY TODAY IN NEW EPISODE OF 'EWOK WARS'  </P> <P> The first shots in what local wags are referring to as "Ewok Wars" were fired  at super-producer George Lucas this week in a Canadian federal courtroom where  Lucas himself will take the stand today as one of the defendants in a  $129-million copyright infringement case.  </P> <P> Lucas, his company Lucas Films Ltd. and 20th Century Fox Canada Ltd. have been  accused by Calgary writer Dean Preston of stealing the idea for the furry  outer-space creatures introduced to the world as Ewoks in Lucas' third "Star  Wars" film, "Return of the Jedi," in 1983.  </P> <P> Preston testified Tuesday that he created Ewoks for "Space Pets," a script that  he wrote in 1977 and mailed to Lucas at 20th Century Fox in 1978. Preston said  "there are many striking similarities in 'Return of the Jedi' and my script.  The most obvious is the Ewok and the name of the Ewok." Preston said he came up  with the Ewok name while phonetically fiddling with the phrase "He walks."  </P> <P> In depositions, Lucas has denied having ever seen Preston's script and during  his testimony, Preston acknowledged that he cannot prove the script was even  delivered to Lucas. After mailing "Space Pets," a children's adventure story  about four space explorers who land on a planet populated by the creatures he  called Ewoks, he said he never heard back from the either the studio or Lucas.  Nor was the script returned to him.  </P> <P> The 53-year-old Preston, who describes himself as a free-lance artist and  personal manager for singers, testified that the descriptions of his creatures  in "Space Pets" closely resemble the Ewoks as they appeared in "Return of the  Jedi," and that in his script he created for them similar homes, weapons,  traps, clothing, bikes and drums.  </P> <P> David Frederick Hurry, a British Columbia writer, testified this week that he  edited and enhanced "Space Pets" for Preston in 1978 before it was mailed to  Lucas. In the "defense statement" given to the court, Lucas maintains that he  created the Ewok as a small primitive version of the long-haired wookie that  was introduced as Han Solo's sidekick in "Star Wars" in 1977.  </P> <P> Preston told the court that he did not think much about "Space Pets" and the  fact that Lucas had not responded to it until 1982 when, during a trip to Los  Angeles, he saw a small Japanese car on the road with a vanity plate that read  "Ewok." He said he followed the car, and saw two small people, "either midgets  or dwarfs," get out and learned from the driver that the two people were actors  playing small characters known as Ewoks in George Lucas' next "Star Wars"  picture.  </P> <P> "I felt a funny feeling in my stomach," Preston testified. "I knew after the  conversation with the driver, my script had reached George Lucas. He had used  my name, Ewok, even my creation."  </P> <P> Preston said that when he returned to Calgary, he registered Ewok as a  trademark in Canada. The trademark was later revoked due to his failure to  financially exploit it. The "Space Pets" script was not copyrighted until last  year, but in Canada, copyrights are automatic if authorship can be proved.  </P> <P> So far, Preston's contentions have been supported by Hurry, by two of Hurry's  family members and by a former West Virginia municipal court judge -- an  associate of Preston's -- who testified that Preston had been talking about  writing a space story since the late '60s and first described to him the furry  creatures that resembled Lucas' Ewoks in 1974.  </P> <P> Canadian attorney W. Graham Dutton, who is representing all three defendants in  the trial, said Lucas would not have read Preston's script even if it had been  sent to him. "George Lucas has never, ever examined unsolicited material such  as this," Dutton said.  </P> <P> Preston characterizes the case as another example of the little guy being  ripped off and overmatched by a giant.  </P> <P> "It's a David-and-Goliath story," he quips. "It's not easy for someone like me  to take on someone like George Lucas."  </P> <P> Preston called the $129 million he is asking as "my fair share" of the billions  of dollars that have been spent worldwide on the "Star Wars" series,  merchandising and an Ewok TV movie.  </P> <P> The non-jury trial is expected to last another seven days before Justice Andrew  MacKay.  </P></p>

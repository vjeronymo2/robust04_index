			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Ireland poised for election as talks on coalition collapse Ireland was last night heading for an early general election after talks on the formation of a new coalition broke down. The impasse came amid fresh allegations about outgoing prime minister Albert Reynolds' controversial handling of a judicial appointment. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish Labour party leader, abandoned negotiations with Fianna Fail, the largest party, hours before yesterday's scheduled session of the Dail, which would have approved the formation of a new government. Last night Labour was trying to forge a left-right coalition with the main opposition party, Fine Gael, and one of the smaller parties in the hope of avoiding an election. However, MPs held out little hope for such a pact. If a coalition does not emerge in the next few days, Mr Reynolds will be forced to dissolve parliament and call an election. Mr Spring appealed to all parties to solve the crisis quickly because of its likely effect on the Northern Ireland peace process. 'A prolonged period of instability that could result from an election would do potential damage to the progress towards peace and reconciliation in Ireland,' he told parliament. The collapse of talks between Labour and Fianna Fail comes at a critical moment in the peace process, three days before the UK government starts exploratory talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. Speaking in Belfast, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, seemed keen to play down the crisis. However, he conceded that the delays would create a 'hiatus' in the negotiations to devise a framework document which the two governments hope will form the basis for talks on a constitutional settlement for Ulster. The judicial row that led to the collapse of the Irish government centres on Mr Harry Whelehan, the former attorney-general. Mr Whelehan allegedly failed to process UK extradition warrants for a paedophile Roman Catholic priest who was later convicted of child abuse offences in Northern Ireland. Mr Reynolds reiterated in parliament that he had not tried to mislead parliament over the affair. But the Irish Times newspaper reported on Monday that the prime minister had deliberately deceived parliament by not disclosing his attempt to persuade Mr Whelehan to resign as attorney-general a day before publicly defending him in parliament. On Monday, Mr Spring demanded that Mr Eoghan Fitzsimons, the new attorney-general, provide a written explanation of the sequence of events. Mr Reynolds hurried back from the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe summit in Budapest to answer parliamentary questions. 'We are not happy with the answers we got . . . We've broken off negotiations with Fianna Fail at this stage,' Mr Spring said as he left the Dail yesterday. 'It's very serious,' said Mr Bertie Ahern, the new leader of Fianna Fail. 'We were hoping we'd form a government. That's not going to be the case.' Mr Ahern seemed visibly shaken by the new set of allegations. He said the party was resigned to a period in opposition or a general election. 'We're living through one of the saddest episodes in our parliamentary history,' said Ms Mary Harney, leader of the Progressive Democrats, a former coalition partner.

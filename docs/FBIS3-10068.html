			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mario Chimanovitch] </F>   [Text] The aroma of vatapa [Afro-Brazilian mush], the  special of the day, drifts past the well-bred nostrils that  lounge, utensils in hand, around this immense hall that can seat  500 at a time. Both the food--cheap and served in ample  portions--and the air conditioning are perfect. Outside on  Avenida Rio Branco, in the heart of Rio de Janeiro, the  temperature on these dog days is nearly 40 degrees Celsius.  People eat well here at the Military Club, a venerable  association founded in 1887. This is its third headquarters in  its long history, but although the building has a more  modernistic appearance, the decor retains touches that are  somewhat rococo. The atmosphere is still closely identified with  the air that was breathed, politically and anthropologically  speaking, in the early 1960's, when it was the meeting place for  the officers who organized and commanded the so-called  "Democratic Crusade" that led to the coup of 1964 and the  deposition of Joao Goulart. The only difference from those  somber days is that the messmates, now in their sixties,  although they still employ a conspiratorial tone in their  conversations can bark orders only to the waiters that glide  around the large hall--gracefully and with alacrity, may we say,  but armed only with harmless knives and forks. More out of  professional duty than any ideological whims, they might venture  opinions on the virtues of certain salads, of leafy appearance  and well-suited to a carioca summer's diet.    Today, a Wednesday, the hall is full of members and their  guests, supplemented by those who, although they have never been  career military men, still have a deep affinity for the club and  participate with their hearts and minds. At almost all the  tables one hears debates, sometimes heated, especially when the  subject is Brazilian politics. They despise, as they have every  reason to, the blemishes that sully the National Congress. There  are references to "robbers of the people," (this from a retired  general, holding his fork aloft like a hypothetical trident from  hell and using it to jab at the air, gesticulating as if he were  ready to rummage through the entrails of corruption). "The  nation has run out of patience, it can no longer put up with all  these calamities and inertia. If that CPI [Congressional  Investigating Committee] of theirs ends up doing nothing, as  people say it will, it would be better to shut down the  Congress," added--no less emphatically--a colonel and former  member of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force. Brizola and Lula  are also mentioned. And so passionately! The former is held  responsible for the disastrous state of affairs in Rio de  Janeiro. The latter is held responsible for what might happen  after the presidential elections.    The discussions are interrupted by the sound of squealing  brakes and shattering glass from the avenue below. Everyone runs  to the balcony of the restaurant to see what happens. "That's  the third fender-bender today, the traffic lights are not  working...this is intolerable...Where's the g...d...governor?"  raved one colonel--unaware, surely, of the fact that the one who  is supposed to take care of traffic signals is the mayor, Cesar  Maia, not Governor Brizola. Short pause for dessert. The coconut  pudding, passion fruit mousse, and condensed milk custard are  all excellent. "As you can see, we here at the Military Club are  a living and dynamic organization. We have a lot of influence.  Those who think we are just a bunch of retired old men who come  here to eat and play snooker are wrong," said General Nilton  Cerqueira, club president and candidate for federal deputy on  the PP [Progressive Party] ticket in Rio de Janeiro. A  hard-liner, Cerqueira was the man who hunted Captain Lamarca  through the backlands of Bahia until he finally gunned him down.  He was also the man who when in command of the Rio Military  Police, inexplicably refused to beef up the police force at  Riocentro at the time of the famous attempted attack attributed  to sectors of the so-called "intelligence community." Despite  this background, the general, now 63, is an affable man. His  professional and ideological past is unequivocal, but Cerqueira  insists he is a legalist, although he acknowledges that Brazil  is now going through a crucial phase that in some ways resembles  the one that preceded the military movement of 1964.    "Yes, sir, there is indeed a rebellious sentiment among the  military. This has been manifested in high levels of the  military hierarchy, in professional contacts where senior  officers are being pressured by the junior officers and the  civilian public," General Cerqueira said, emphasizing that "one  feels that there is an expectation of a military reaction," in  the event the corrective measures demanded by the Budget CPI are  frustrated. But, despite the "climate," there are no practical  measures to be taken, at least for the time being. "After all,"  he pointed out, "if we were to overturn the tables at this  point, what would be the ideal model for Brazil? We also have to  remember that we don't have a Fujimori, and so...."    Cerqueira says it is in this direction that the Military  Club  is working, serving as a catalyst for opinions and influencing  things to the extent possible--only to the extent possible. In  other words, the "ideology" of the club is daring in theory but  cautious in practice. It seems the club is essentially an active  center for discussion. This means one should not be swayed by  the more radical opinions one hears there. "The people in the  reserve are more impassioned, but what we are really trying to  do is to open up the spectrum of opinions so that the broad  meaning of democracy can be discussed," Cerqueira insists.  Concerning Lula, the general made another categorical statement:  "Disapproval of the PT is strong among the officers and in the  Military Club. I can state without fear of contradiction that  the consensus within the Armed Forces repudiates his ideas."  Cerqueira is unmoved by the argument that the PT's platform  appears to be highly favorable to the Armed Forces; it is  against low pay scales and the "junking" of the institution. The  general almost leapt out of his chair, and responded vehemently:  "That does not mean that the PT and Lula are in a position to  fulfill it."    Before saying goodbye, the general insists on taking the  reporter and photographer into the Military Club museum. There  in the gallery hang portraits of military men who served as  president of Brazil, but no picture of General Ernesto Geisel. I  asked Cerqueira about this absence, and he gave me to understand  that it is intentional. The general opposed the political  opening [abertura] launched by Geisel because "it was  inopportune, done at the wrong time." Nothing more is said but,  as we left the museum, a museum staffer whispered that "General  Cerqueira does not like Geisel...."    Some of the members and regulars at the Military Club are  not  in tune with Nilton Cerqueira's ideas. General Diogo Figueiredo,  for example, brother of the general and former president, does  not think the Military Club speaks for the military. According  to Diogo, the club has a historical tradition but that does not  mean it can or should compete with political organizations.  "That would be the same as the bank workers' union attempting to  control the financial system." The general, incidentally,  confesses that he thought it very strange that the president of  Brazil would receive the president of the Military Club to talk  about matters that are not within its bailiwick. "In my opinion,  what is happening is a demoralization and a breakdown of  discipline, since the Military Club is creating a sort of  parallel hierarchy. The club is a nice place to meet old buddies  and have lunch, but the institution is not at all  representative."    Diogo Figueiredo is convinced there is no danger of a coup,  since the Brazilian military is legalist. He recalls that what  happened in 1964 was a breakdown of hierarchy and discipline in  the barracks. If a problem of that nature were to arise today,  then it would indeed be possible that the military chiefs might  mobilize for action. The general believes, furthermore, that the  Workers Party is a reality: "If Lula seeks out the military  leaders to hear what they have to say, wonderful. If he seeks  out the corporals and noncoms, then I would have to say I do not  think he will take office." As for the problem of low salaries  and junking of the Armed Forces, Diogo says that is no reason to  start thinking of insurrection, because the military are now  used to living with poverty. But they could never tolerate, for  example, seeing national sovereignty scorned, sold out. "I am  referring to the issue of the Amazon region," he concluded.    Another eminent representative of the hard line, General  Sebastiao Jose de Castro, former commandant of the Military  Region of the Southeast, takes a more moderate position now and  acknowledges that in the past, the Military Club achieved great  influence, but said this does not happen today. He said the club  should defend the interests of the military as a class, but that  the institution ought not become a sort of labor union. Like  General Diogo Figueiredo, General Sebastiao Jose de Castro  thinks the possibility of a coup is remote, and even less likely  to be fomented or inspired by the Military Club. "See here, men  who are in the reserve, as General Nilton Cerqueira and I are,  no longer command the troops and haven't the clout for stirring  up anything at all, much less carrying out a coup...such a  person could not even boot out the president of the condominium  he lives in...but...for the sake of argument, suppose we could?  We would carry out a coup to accomplish what? To seize a country  that is in worse shape than in 1964?"</p>

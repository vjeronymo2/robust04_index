			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _A statement of the part or parts of the specific (named) proposed RMP being protested. To the extent possible, this should be done by reference to specific pages, paragraphs, sections, tables, maps, etc. included in the document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _A copy of all documents addressing the issue or issues that you submitted during the planning process or a reference to the date the issue or issues were discussed by you for the record.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _A concise statement explaining why the BLM State Director's decision is believed to be incorrect. This is a critical part of your protest. Document all relevant facts. As much as possible, reference or cite the planning documents, environmental analysis documents, and available planning records (e.g., meeting minutes or summaries, or correspondence). A protest that merely expresses disagreement with the Oregon/Washington State Director's proposed decision, without any data, will not provide us with the benefit of your information and insight. In this case, the Director's review will be based on the existing analysis and supporting data.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the end of the 30-day protest period, the BLM may issue a Record of Decision approving implementation of any portion of the proposed plan not under protest. Approval will be withheld on any portion of the plan under protest until the protest has been resolved.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, CONTACT:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Phil Hall, RMP Team Leader Roseburg District Office; Phone (503) 440&hyph;4930. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The Proposed Resource Management Plan/Final Environmental Impact Statement describes and analyzes seven alternatives to resolve the following issues: (1) Timber production practices; (2) Old-growth forests and habitat diversity; (3) Threatened and endangered and other special status species habitat, including habitat for the northern spotted owl; (4) Special areas; (5) Visual resources; (6) Stream/riparian/water quality; (7) Recreation resources; (8) Wild and scenic rivers; (9) Land tenure; and (10) Rural interface areas. The issues are analyzed in seven distinct alternatives, with each alternative representing a complete management plan for the district.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Proposed Resource Management Plan responds to the need for a healthy forest ecosystem with habitat that will support populations of native species (particularly those associated with late-successional and old-growth forests). It also responds to the need for a sustainable supply of timber and other forest products that will help maintain the stability of local and regional economies and will contribute valuable resources to the national economy, on a predictable and long-term basis. BLM-administered lands are primarily allocated to Riparian Reserves, Late-Successional Reserves, General Forest Management Areas, and Connectivity/Diversity Blocks. An Aquatic Conservation Strategy would be applied to all lands and waters under BLM jurisdiction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Approximately 89,900 acres would be managed for timber production. The annual probable sale quantity would be 7.0 million cubic feet (45 million board feet). Standing trees; snags; and down, dead woody material would be retained to contribute to biological diversity,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management would provide for a wide variety of recreation opportunities, with particular emphasis on enhancement of opportunities for dispersed recreational use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Approximately 29 miles of river found eligible for designation and studied by BLM would be found not suitable for designation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most BLM-administered lands would remain available for mineral leasing and location of mining claims, but 28 acres would be closed to leasing for oil and gas and geothermal resources, and 5,070 acres would be closed to location of claims.  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

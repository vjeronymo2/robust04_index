President Illiescu provided his views on the situation on the  Korean peninsula, North Korea's nuclear development project, and  ROK-Romanian economic relations. Correspondent Yi Hong-ki has  more from Bucharest, Romania.    [Yi] President Illiescu of Romania, a country with  established diplomatic relations with both Koreas, while noting  that North Korea's efforts to develop nuclear weapons have  gained some results, predicted that North Korea will eventually  convert its nuclear development for peaceful purposes due to the  International Atomic Energy Agency's inspections.    [Illiescu] I do not think North Korea has great nuclear  capacity, but it is considerable. However, I really do not  think that North Korea's nuclear development represents a great  danger.    [Yi] In the interview with the KBS on his upcoming ROK  visit,  he assessed that relations have made great progress in various  areas since the ROK and Romania established ties four years ago.  He pointed out that it is very important to promote political,  economic cooperation between the two countries.    [Illiescu] We try to follow the great industrial  achievements of the ROK.    [Yi] President Illiescu repeatedly stressed how important  the ROK's economic cooperation was for the stability of  Romania's democracy and its market economic system.</p>

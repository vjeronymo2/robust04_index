			<p>BFN     [Text] New reactions have been recorded in Haiti following  the U.S. sanctions. On 10 June, Port-au-Prince Mayor-elect  Evans Paul asked General Raoul Cedras, head of the Haitian Army,  to resign to avoid the application of the new sanctions  announced on the same day by U.S. President Bill Clinton. The  basis of the solution to avoid those new sanctions, which are  very hard and very painful and which hit all Haitians, remains  the implementation of the Governors Island agreement, Paul  pointed out. Gen. Cedras must understand the necessity to  respect his commitment, he added.    President Clinton announced among other things the  interdiction of commercial flights between the United States and  Haiti as of 25 June and the suspension of private financial  transactions with Haiti.</p>

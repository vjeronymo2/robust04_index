In those years  the average annual rate of growth of the gross social product  fell from 3.0-3.5 percent to 1.5-1.8 percent. But beginning  1991, the rate of growth became negative (about 5 percent per  year), and after 1992 ailments of the crisis came to light with  the beginning of the structural, inflationary, and  monetary-financial stresses that forced hitherto slumbering  sociopolitical forces to stir.    The reasons for such a long-term crisis are the internal  contradictions of the system of economic management that was  built in the years of the Stalin-Brezhnev regime. The crisis  became an expression of the disparity between the macrostructure  of production and the macrostructure of consumption, the  disparity between the proportion of distribution of social  capital according to branches and the needs of its productive  functioning, disparity in the level of applied technologies in  small and large systems and the demands that the modern world  economy poses.    The crisis bares these disproportions and technological  backwardness, and gives society and the nation the chance to  engage in a search for a solution and to dismantle an obsolete  economy and transform it into a new and highly technological one  with a progressive structure. But this is only a chance. The  question is how and when we can take advantage of it.    For the time being, there is no answer to the first part of  the question. The crisis is proceeding as a destructive  phenomenon, wrecking enterprises and lowering the standard of  living of the population. It is an unprecedented phenomenon in  the speed of the drop in production, 9 percent. It is also  unprecedented in the depth of the decline (30 percent in these  years): This is 1.5 times more than in the great U.S. depression  at the end of the 1920's. According to the branch spectrum, the  drop in production was highest in the fuel complex  (approximately 45 percent, and something like this is fully  justified) and in the sphere of everyday services to the  population (more than 50 percent). Right after them come light  and furniture industries (40 and 37 percent, respectively), and  agriculture.    This assortment of the most injured branches makes it  possible to assume that not only structural disproportions and  technological backwardness are to blame for their crash, but  also other reasons that do not result from the objective  preconditions of the crisis.    If we are talking about the consumer goods and services  branches, the course of the crisis in them was essentially  deepened by a sharp drop in the effective demand of the  population. The level of real incomes of the population fell in  the last three years by a minimum of 35 percent. But inasmuch as  the people's monetary savings practically dwindled (the  remaining deposits in banks in real calculations were reduced by  a factor of no less than 10-12), the effective demand fell by a  factor of two.    The population's demand also has a structural cross-section.  While up to 1991 the majority of the population had moderately  low incomes that basically met the standards of "Soviet" goods  and services, by the end of 1993 the majority of the population  (most of all the unemployed and those working in state  enterprises) began to receive extremely low incomes with which  people were not in a position to acquire domestically produced  goods. This accelerated the drop in the latter, and commodity  turnover began to be filled by high-quality imported products  and items intended, however, only for 5-8 percent of the most  well-off people in our society.    Why did this happen? Why were efforts not made to support  the  incomes of our fellow citizens and support production and the  demand for products, which were not satisfied? Why were there  principal failures in these key points of our system? Moreover,  as we see, the drop in consumer incomes accelerates the drop in  the output of products for the population, and the reduction in  goods and services devalues people's money and incomes. In a  general case, this may be the answer: The organization of the  national economy was not reformed, and the organization of the  activity of individual enterprises was not reformed.    In the Soviet system, the main direction of financial  redistribution was for the benefit of branches of heavy  industry. This kind of organization of public financing, in  fact, continues to operate right now. Light industry and  agricultural branches remain the stepchildren in the family of  the state economy. But the organizational backwardness of the  enterprises predetermines excessive costs and the need for their  noneconomic and nonmarket financing (this is the root of the  escalation of inflation).    However, there is one more powerful factor. This is the  nonequivalence of turnover with countries that are not members  of the CIS. The payments balance in this direction is obviously  positive. Moreover, a large part of the hard currency earnings  of our exporters does not return to Ukraine. This has already  been going on for several years. In 1993 only 20 percent of the  expected foreign hard currency from exports came into the  country. The annual pumping out of billion-dollar sums reduces  the possible standard of living of the people by about 15-20  percent.    In aggregate, the financial-credit, export-hard currency  factors, and the monopolism of the commodity producers incite a  price inflation that is unprecedented in postwar Europe (it is  higher only in warring Serbia). In 1992 the level of inflation  reached 4,000 percent (up by a factor of 40 for the year,  averaging 35 percent per month), and in 1993--9,000 percent (up  by a factor of 90 for the year--45 percent per month).    We will note that in its nature, an economic crisis in the  downturn phase (that is, as we have now in Ukraine) lowers the  absolute price level, and only relative prices increase. The  inflationary dynamics of prices naturally is the dynamics of  relative prices. The question arises: How are the crisis and  inflation correlated? And does inflation not have an effect on  the ability to overcome the economic crisis?    If it is taken into account that the inflationary high price  dynamic does not permit the implementation of operations to  renew fixed capital, not to mention the new construction of  industrial or transportation facilities, it becomes clear that  inflation is a very serious barrier to structural reorganization  in social production on the path to pulling out of the crisis.  But if inflation is at an extremely high level (more than 50  percent a month), it is not only a barrier but also an  independently operating destructive factor.    In completing the picture of the economic crisis in Ukraine,  taking into account the hyperinflationary trends, it can be said  that the decline in production has still not reached its very  lowest magnitude. If it is not possible to defeat  hyperinflation, the minimum volume of production in the  long-term cyclical crisis we are experiencing will get lower and  lower. It is possible to suppose that by balancing between the  different interests the current government will be able to  maintain average rates of inflation in 1994 at the mark of 55-65  percent per month. Consequently, technological renewal and  structural changes will not be started. The introduction of new  organizational forms of economic management in enterprises,  evidently, should also not be expected from the government of  Kravchuk-Zvyahilskyy. Under such conditions, stabilization of  the volume of production will also become impossible--the drop  in the volume of gross domestic product for the year will to all  appearances amount to not less than 15-20 percent.    Thus, the crisis we are experiencing does not have some kind  of "bottom" (a low point in the decline) that is preset in  advance. We can achieve stabilization and begin the climb  earlier and from a higher point, or later and with an ever lower  and lower wrecked "production platform." The role of the  Government of Ukraine in curbing or aggravating the breakdown of  the economy is becoming increasingly significant.    A great deal depends on when the change in today's  government  will occur and whether its new staff will be capable of starting  anticrisis operations. Policy is again a millstone on the  economy. However, it is already clear now that the first half of  1994 in any case will inherit the inertia of the preceding  period (the very same government strategists are developing the  programs and budget). That is, the drop in production and the  periodic multiple jumps in prices will continue. In the second  half of the year, if the new unified reform budget of the  Cabinet of Ministers begins to work, the drop in the volume of  production will decrease somewhat (up to 8-10 percent), and  inflation can be reduced substantially--by a factor of two to  three. In addition, there will be an upswing in wages and  pensions. But by the end of 1994 and the beginning of 1995, the  economy should achieve a lower point of decline. After this,  stabilization and a rise in production will start. How long the  preparations and the beginning of the upswing will take will be  determined by the effectiveness of the reforms, and most of all  by whether the Ukrainian monetary unit will be convertible and  whether privatization of state enterprises will be implemented.    It should also be said that not all state enterprises will  be  able to survive the long-term economic blow (idle capacities,  departure of qualified workers, contraction of the assortment of  products, and the chronic credit indebtedness against the  background of hyperinflation). Some of them will not be restored  in their former capacity. This will create the preconditions for  high social costs--unemployment and inadequate budget resources  for large investment, ecological, or social programs. The  government will be obliged to provide for such consequences of  the crisis in its programs.    As for the private sector, after the economy reaches the low  point of the decline, and given price stabilization, it will  receive very favorable opportunities for growth in Ukraine.  Favorable conditions will be associated with difficulties in the  state sector and the absence of competition. For this reason  there will be a wide selection of manpower, and low prices for  equipment, building, and land parcels. Because of the totally  unsettled situation there will not be many foreign investments,  and it will be necessary to rely on our own capital. The  greatest opportunities will open up for multiprofiled private  firms and privatized enterprises that will engage in the  acquisition of new markets. Their faster development will also  become the main source of the economic upswing in 1995.

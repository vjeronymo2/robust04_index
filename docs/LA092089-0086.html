			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Federal officials were investigating the crash near Escondido of a  single-engine plane that may have come apart in flight, killing the pilot and  his passenger, authorities said. Names of the victims were being withheld  pending notification of relatives and the conclusion of a search through rugged  terrain east of Interstate 15, where the aircraft came down, San Diego County  sheriff's deputies said. Two men boarded the Beechcraft Bonanza at Brown Field  near San Diego on a flight to Chino Airport in Riverside County, the Federal  Aviation Administration said. The pilot did not file a flight plan and none was  required, the agency added. Witnesses said pieces of the plane were flying off  it as it plunged into a ravine about a mile north of the Deer Springs Road  freeway off-ramp.  </P></p>

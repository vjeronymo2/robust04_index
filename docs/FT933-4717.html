			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Appeal to Tapie on football club MR Bernard Tapie, chairman of Olympic Marseille, the top French football team now in disgrace over match-rigging allegations, was yesterday called on to rescue the team which faces financial ruin following its expulsion from this season's European Cup. Marseille, which in May became the first French team ever to win the tournament, faces a serious shortfall in gate receipts after Monday's decision by Uefa, the regulatory body for European football, to ban the club from this season's competition. Mr Tapie had threatened to file for the club's bankruptcy and resign if the ban was upheld. The tournament is worth up to FFr150m (Pounds 17m) in television rights, ticket sales and other revenues. The ban has drawn angry, sorrowful reactions from the French press and fans in the economically troubled French port, where the football team is one of the few success stories. The mayor of Marseilles, Mr Robert Vigouroux, yesterday urged Mr Tapie to keep the club alive. Mr Tapie, a former socialist minister and entrepreneur who made a fortune in the 1980s by buying up bankrupt companies, has invested heavily in Marseille since becoming chairman in 1986. However, his financial position is now considerably weaker as he has sold most of his business interests, including his stake in Adidas, the German sporting goods group. Meanwhile, a number of other French clubs appeared to be procrastinating over their pronouncements on Monday night that they would refuse to replace Marseille as France's representative in the tournament.</p>

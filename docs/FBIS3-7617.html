The Party of the Congress for the Independence, the Militant  Party for the Realization of Equality and nine other political  parties of Madagascar published a joint statement on March 23.    Noting that the United States is leading the situation of  the  Korean peninsula to the extreme pitch of strain after reversing  the agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New  York, the statement said: "The step taken by the DPRK to cope  with this is a just one for national sovereignty and security."    Eight organizations of Uganda including the Uganda-DPRK  Friendship Association, the Ugandan National Committee for the  Study of the Chuche Idea and the Teachers' Association of Uganda  said in a joint statement on March 22:    "The United States has set unreasonable preconditions  alleging that the inspection by the International Atomic Energy  Agency was unsatisfactory. This was motivated by their  insidious political aim to stifle socialist Korea by  intentionally aggravating the situation."    The Ghana-DPRK Friendship Association said in a statement on  March 22:    "We urge the United States to stop its threat and row of  `sanctions' against the DPRK and sincerely discharge its  obligation for a package solution to the nuclear issue and the  IAEA secretariat to take a fair stand, not following the will of  a big power."    Twenty-three political parties and organizations of Peru  including the Mariateguista United Party and the General  Confederation of Workers in a joint statement denounced the  United States for reversing the agreed conclusions reached at  the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York and scheming to stage the  "Team Spirit" joint military exercises and deploy "Patriot"  missiles in South Korea.    The statement called upon political parties, organizations  and public figures throughout the world to strengthen solidarity  with the Korean people in the efforts for peace and  reunification.</p>

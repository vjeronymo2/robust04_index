			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Japan urged to open up pension fund investment European and US fund managers are increasing their calls for Japan's ministry of finance to open investment of the country's vast state pension funds to asset management companies. Pressure from the US forced the ministry to liberalise partially fund management of corporate pensions and mutual aid associations in 1990. However, the Y20,000bn (Pounds 125bn) worth of state pension funds are still tightly guarded and allocated to trust banks and life assurers. The issue has also been debated among Japanese and US trade officials in the bilateral framework talks. The third round of the talks ended this week, but made little progress. The country's ministry of health and welfare, which holds jurisdiction over the state pension system, also wants to diversify its investments and is calling for the ministry of finance, which controls the way the pension funds are invested, to change the regulations. The welfare ministry is concerned that because of the sharp pension fund growth, the amounts allocated to any one fund manager are swelling. Laws covering the state pension system are reviewed every four years, and welfare ministry officials fear that if they cannot convince the finance ministry by next April, the rules cannot be changed until the next review in 1998. European and US investment advisers say the ministry of finance's tight regulation prevents money flowing to investments with the highest yields. However the ministry counters that as the government has to guarantee social security benefits, it cannot allow state pension funds invest in stocks, which most investment advisory companies specialise in. Mr Hitoshi Yamamoto, president of Morgan Grenfell Asset Management in Tokyo, objects that this stance goes against efforts by prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa to remove excessive bureaucratic regulations.</p>

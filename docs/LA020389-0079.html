			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Ducommun Inc. expects to report a fourth-quarter loss and is negotiating with  its bank, Security Pacific, to change an agreement that says Ducommun's  fourth-quarter net loss cannot exceed $600,000. Ducommun, a Carson-based  aerospace and electronics firm, said its fourth-quarter loss from operations  would be less than the $1.6 million it lost in the third quarter but that it  would be taking a $1.5-million writedown for excess inventory at its Jay-El  unit and a $2-million charge for cost overruns at its AHF-Ducommun unit.  </P></p>

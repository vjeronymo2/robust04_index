			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Tokyo Asahi Newstar Television Network  in Japanese at 1145 GMT on 8 May carries, during its weekly  "Sunday Project" program, a 20-minute live interview with  Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party of  Japan (SDPJ), by freelance commentator Soichiro Tahara.  Murayama is at the "ABC Studio" in Osaka. "Insider" magazine  chief editor Hajime Takano and Kyoto University Professor  Masaaki Kosaka also interview Murayama.    At 1145 GMT, Tahara asks Murayama about Justice Minister  Nagano's resignation over his remarks on the 1937 Nanjing  massacre. Murayama says: "This is a matter of course." He  adds: "We cannot say the prime minister has no responsibility  for the confusion caused by Nagano's remarks. In that sense, we  would like to ask the prime minister about his stance on the  issue." Asked about cooperation with Hata's coalition  government, Murayama says he has the impression that the Hata  administration is taking a different view from the Hosokawa  administration, noting recent remarks by ministers of the Hata  cabinet. He says: "If the Hata administration promotes the  reform line which it took over from the Hosokawa administration,  we will cooperate with them on some issues. However, if the  nature of the administration changes, then our position may be  different." Asked about SDPJ's stance as an opposition party,  Murayama says his party needs to take the initiative in  developing the political situation and promoting reforms to meet  public expectations.    Tahara asks whether the SDPJ will be bound in the future by  agreements reached among the previous coalition parties on the  eve of the formation of the Hata cabinet. Murayama replies:  "We should fulfill our engagements with the people. However,  since these agreements were reached during the tenure of the  coalition administration, we will not be bound by them regarding  our former position as a ruling coalition party. From this  viewpoint, the SDPJ will take its own stance on the issue."  Discussing the tax issue, Murayama says that the consumption  tax should be abolished and the issue of indirect taxes should  be newly discussed in the process of tax reform.    At 1157 GMT, Takano asks Murayama about cooperation with the  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). In reply, Murayama says: "At  the present, we have no ideas regarding the formation of an  LDP-SDPJ alliance." He also rules out the possibility of the  SDPJ returning to the coalition at present. Tahara asks: "With  what kind of LDP can the SDPJ cooperate?" Murayama replies:  "The LDP needs to sweep away its corrupt structure; to cut off  the comfortable ties existing between politicians, bureaucrats,  and businessmen; and to pursue politics in a democratic manner  from now on." He also notes the need for discussions with the  LDP regarding its views on the Constitution and what the state  ought to be like.    Asked about the next general election, Murayama says: "I  think the next election should be held under the new election  system. However, if the administration's policies come to a  deadlock and there is no choice but to dissolve the House of  Representatives, elections under the current system will be  inevitable." He says: "Because the draft budget was drawn up  with our cooperation, we will cooperate with the coalition in  passing the budget through the Diet. However, we will form free  and unbiased policies on other issues."    At 1203 GMT, Kosaka asks for Murayama's opinion on what the  latter believes the important issues in reform are. In addition  to political reform, Murayama cites measures to prevent  political corruption and the reform of Diet functions. Takano  questions the Hata administration on its stance regarding the  right to collective self-defense. Murayama says: "We would  like to firmly question the Hata administration on its stance  regarding this issue and the Constitution at an interpellation  at the Diet session." Tahara asks Murayama: "What do you think  of the remarks by Foreign Minister Kakizawa and Chief Cabinet  Secretary Kumagai that an appropriate legislative measure should  be taken in connection with North Korea's (DPRK) suspected  nuclear weapons development?" In reply, Murayama stresses that  it is inappropriate to create a situation in which North Korea  is forced into isolation from the international community. He  adds: "All countries concerned need to help persuade North  Korea on the nuclear issue. It is important for concerned  countries to make efforts to see to it that dialogue between  North Korea and the United States is smoothly put back on the  right track. I think the Japanese Government should stick to its  stance of seeking a solution through dialogue."    Finally, Tahara asks Murayama whether the SDPJ intends to  form a parliamentary group to confront the group "Kaishin,"  which has led to the SDPJ's secession from the coalition.  Murayama replies: "We have no such idea at present. However,  we would like to closely cooperate with Sakigake and other  forces which hold views similar to our own."</p>

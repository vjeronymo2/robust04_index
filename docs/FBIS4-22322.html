			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Lapik: "Cry for Gaydar"] </F>   [Text] The prime minister was clearly unlucky with  his last name. Indeed, what can be expected of a government  headed by a person by the name of Chernomyrdin? That is not even  funny. That is mockery....  <H5>  Make It Through the Day and Hold Out Through the Night </H5>   From the very beginning nobody believed in the reforms.  Yeltsin was a populist but not a reformer. It is one thing to  drive out the communists, to destroy the previous system, to  promise everything and anything, but it was something altogether  different to build something new in a country. A new economy,  new property relations, a new order. It is one thing to speak  about a transition to the market, at the mention of which the  hungry voter begins to salivate: 50 kinds of sausage, a lot of  meat and vodka. And quite another--to make the transition to  this same market--through increasing prices, property  stratification, and unemployment.    And here Gaydar appeared. Where he came from and why Yeltsin  trusted him--nobody knows for sure.    Possibly the president read one of his articles. But the  post  of prime minister could have been taken over with the same  success by Vasiliy Selyunin, Nikolay Shmelev, or Larisa  Piyasheva...    As early as a week before Gaydar's appointment leading  observers were asserting: Yeltsin is not capable of any  transformations in the economy. He simply does not understand  what needs to be done. And if it is explained to him he will  never decide to do it.    The same opinion was held by Yavlinskiy and Fedorov, who had  already worked in the Silayev government. Everything will go as  it goes. It will collapse and be plundered. Rot and decompose.  Until everything gets as bad as it can be. Until Russia ends up  on the brink of complete collapse, until it sinks amidst bloody  rebellions, hunger, and poverty.    The first to shut down will be the railroads. The cities  will  be deprived of light and heat. The peasants will hide grain from  the state and the workers' food detachments will be met with  axes.    The army will become insubordinate and try to seize power.  But it will be almost impossible to keep it. Hunger is stronger  than fear.    State institutions will collapse before our eyes. Everyone  will begin to try to save himself as best he can. Banditry,  crime, epidemics. War by everyone against everyone else.  Demarcation of territories, borders with machine gun bursts  along the roads, local money used for toilet paper....    Actually, everything was proceeding toward this. Every  little  town near Moscow was printing its own paper money--coupons for  sugar, tea, tobacco and vodka, for eggs and cereal, macaroni and  flour. In Moscow some things could be bought freely, but 50  kilometers to the south or north--there was almost nothing. They  would get in line to wait for milk at 0500 in the morning.  Cheese, meat, and sausage were not seen for months. Bread could  be bought only after waiting in line for hours. Canned goods  required a certificate. It seemed that there would never be an  end to it. But now three years have passed and who remembers it?  Nobody.    Now everyone puts on an intelligent air and discusses the  idea that the reform could have been conducted with lesser  costs: It was not necessary to rob the people, to destroy the  enterprises. That Gaydar's methods turned out to be flawed and  destructive. That "the whole country is shaken from these  experiments." And now everything will have to be done over  again, corrected, restored.    Others, conversely, reproach Gaydar for being too soft and  inconsistent. It was necessary to bring what was started to  completion: to decontrol all prices, to completely  refrain from subsidies, to destroy inefficient productions.    And each is right in his own way. But reflections about the  idea that what Gaydar did was not what he should have done and  what he should not have done emerge from the present-day reality  for some reason. And this is unfair, to say the least. Gaydar  did what he could do at the time. And we still do not know in  what kind of country and under what kind of authority we would  be living today if he had not managed to convince Yeltsin that  it was impossible to keep controls on consumer prices any longer  and, consequently, they had to be decontrolled.    True, we do not know what would have happened otherwise:  What  kinds of plans the government would have come up with today and  who would be in charge there if only Gaydar had managed to  persuade Yeltsin. What, for example, would have happened to  industry and agriculture if oil and coal prices had been  decontrolled all at once, during the first months of the  reforms, and not gradually? Collapse. Paralysis of the economy  and the social sphere. Hyperinflation which could not have been  stopped....    In a word, not everything is as simple as it seems: Gaydar's  reforms are market reforms, which are useful and correct, and  everything that is not included in these reforms is bad.    In general I do not believe that the country's economy has  been managed by anyone at all in recent years. All this time we  were being carried along on the waves; there simply was no  independent course and there could not be one. Ryzhkov, Pavlov,  Gaydar, and Chernomyrdin--all of them were just hanging on to  the helm and at best were checking to make sure that the ship  did not dive into the water and sink. Gaydar had to cut down a  couple of masts and throw superfluous items overboard. At least  he kept the ship afloat. That was his assignment. And that was  good.    Now, of course, we can regret the things that we lost or,  groaning, we can throw up some boards to take the place of the  masts. But this will not change the essence of things.    Whether it is with Gaydar or with Chernomyrdin, we are still  tossing about without a rudder until the winds bring us up to  some shore.    Of course this does not mean that we must grow weak and not  try to do anything. We must strengthen discipline, pump out the  water, swab the deck, or sharpen the anchor with a file--as long  as we do something. Otherwise, the inactivity will cause the  team to start to drink, to be depressed, and to hang the captain  and his assistants from the mast. Incidentally, this is already  psychology. But what is the difference?  <H5>  There Will Be No Anesthesia! </H5>   When Gaydar left the first time it was indeed perceived as a  tragedy. Leaving along with him were the hopes that life in this  country could change for the better at all.    For the first time people had been given at least some sign  of hope: Goods appeared, the waiting lines disappeared. That  alone could serve as a confirmation of the correctness of the  course that had been chosen. And if Gaydar had been allowed to  finish what he had started....    And in fact what could have happened if Gaydar had not been  interfered with?    Yegor Timurovich asserts that with a strict financial  policy,  inflation could have been curbed fairly quickly.    Against a background of financial stabilization, investments  in production would have been advantageous. There would have  been billions' worth of capital investments in the most  promising branches of the economy. Real money, dollars. As a  result--a construction boom, technical retooling of enterprises,  the introduction of new technologies, development of the  infrastructure....    It is another matter that it would have been necessary to  pay  a considerable price for all this. The only ones that would have  been likely to stay afloat would have been the extraction  branches, enterprises involved with initial processing of raw  material, an insignificant proportion of the defense plants, and  the agrarian sector, without which you cannot get anywhere in  any case.    And 20-30 million unemployed would have become a reality.  These people would have been discharged all at once, within a  half year. Even today, according to calculations of the Russian  Academy of Sciences, the proportion of enterprises operating at  a loss is 35 percent. If prices of energy sources were to be  raised just a little more, according to all canons, 60 percent  of the Russian enterprises would go bankrupt.    But these, as it were, are pure calculations--in terms of  profitability and production outlays. But in fact not only the  weak ones but also the ones they would grab hold of would sink.  It is sufficient for one bank to be destroyed in order for  hundreds of its clients to be left without money. It is  sufficient for one monopoly enterprise to go bankrupt for all  the recipients of its products to be on the verge of collapse.    But the ones that survived would be in perfectly good shape.  And, possibly, their profit would be quite enough to feed the  unemployed and to import a sufficient quantity of goods and food  products.    In time, and fairly soon, the first green shoots would begin  to appear on the scorched fields of reforms. Opening up in the  premises of the former shops and factories would be new private  enterprises which would produce products completely in line with  the world level--under licenses, using imported equipment and  technologies. In principle it is not so difficult to make vacuum  cleaners, refrigerators, and washing machines. And who these  enterprises would belong to--our capital or foreign  capital--does that make any difference?    The patriotism would lie in the fact that the economy was  finally working. So that foreign goods would gradually be  crowded out of the domestic market. So that domestic products  would be just as good and inexpensive. So that they would  penetrate into foreign markets and increase the influx of  currency and technologies to us.    A few small things, as they say, would be lacking: To live  through the first two years of mass unemployment, to quell the  dissatisfaction of millions of people who had been thrown out  into the streets, and not to allow theft, violence, and  rebellion. To create new jobs, organize social work, to pay  people for merely sitting quietly at home....    Are the government and president ready for this? Is our  entire system of social protection capable today of finding  jobs, retraining, or even supporting all 3 million people with  stipends. With full mobilization--5-6 million. What about the  rest?...  <H5>  Hypnotists and Horses </H5>   What is remarkable about Gaydar? He hypnotizes us with the  simplicity of his solutions. There is no need to invent anything  new. It is a typical three-move problem: Compress the money  supply--stabilize finances--attract investments. And that is it.  You can calculate the profit. It is very modern: Without doing  anything you can put together the capital. Today 10,000,  tomorrow--a million, day after tomorrow--a billion. It is not  important how. The main thing is the result.    Why waste your time on concrete producers? Let them solve  their own problems. Why regulate investments? Money knows where  to flow. There is no need to exercise the muscles of the state;  on the contrary, it must relax its grip--and the fear of ruin  combined with prospects for getting rich quick will do  everything for us.    We have tried it--it does not work. Fear, of course, is an  excellent motivater, but what if, for example, a person does not  become frightened the way he is supposed to, or he will not run  faster than a horse in any case--he cannot. The same thing with  enterprises: Whether you frighten them or not, using the  equipment they have and the technologies with which they are  armed, not to mention the qualifications of the workers, you  will not get far.    Things have not worked out with material incentives either.  If the administration had officially had a share of the profits  of its plants and factories, kolkhozes, sovkhozes, perhaps it  would have managed these enterprises differently. But as it  is--what difference does technical progress make? You quickly  democratize and jump ahead--and you sit there and wait for  subsidies.    For the first year and a half Gaydar struggled with the  consumers. With all its might the government stifled pensioners,  doctors, and teachers, and allotted no money for science and  art. It simply gave the enterprises no cash to pay wages. They  thought they had to restrict consumer demand. Then the prices  would stop rising as well.    Nothing of the kind. State enterprises could not care less  about consumer demand. There were mutual nonpayments, working  for the warehouse. Instead of lowering prices, they began to  curtail production.    Then they decided to approach from the other direction: To  drive domestic prices up to the level of world prices and let  foreigners have domestic monopolies. Anyone who could not  withstand the competition with foreign goods would perish. He  would be shown the door. And what difference did it make to the  consumer what he had: Russian cheese or Dutch cheese? The Dutch  cheese is even tastier.    For an entire year they were moving toward finally  decontrolling prices. By last autumn they discovered that  domestic prices might very well exceed world prices--and  nothing! The economy was operating just as inefficiently as it  was before. Domestic producers, instead of reducing production  costs and improving the quality of their products, demanded one  thing: protection from foreign goods, high customs duties, and  protectionism.    Theory is one thing, and how it is manifested is another.  Try  not paying wages to miners. Or put the automotive giants to  rest. In the former case they were unable to hold down consumer  demand, and in the latter they could not hold up under the  pressure from the producers. Gaydar failed in the social sphere  and the nonpayments crisis. Chernomyrdin raised customs duties.  How is the one better than the other? Gaydar's return to the  government last year was marked by nothing at all except a  scandal over the elections. He did not even try to do anything  in the post of first deputy prime minister. And they would not  have allowed him to do anything radical. All that time he was  something like a table decoration--some kind of stuffed pig  which nobody could eat, but they would stick a fork into him  from time to time out of ignorance.    Understandably, in order to conduct reforms or, rather, to  destroy domestic industry, Gaydar at least had to become a  majority leader in the State Duma and hold a position of deputy  prime minister. Then he could have looked to the president less  and conducted an independent policy. But apparently, he went  against logic here: A dentist who, without anesthesia, pulls the  teeth of everyone who ends up in his chair cannot hope for his  patients to love him. To them he is primarily a sadist, a  torturer. And although things will get better--they still had to  pay for this with their teeth. They cannot grow new ones.    And there is always a suspicion that there was no need to  pull them out at all, that it was possible to fix them....  <H5>  The Magic of the Circle </H5>   Chernomyrdin, as distinct from Gaydar, was convinced that it  was still possible to change things. Here is his logic: Let us  earmark the priority branches--the ones without which we cannot  live--transportation, energy engineering, communications, the  agro-industrial complex. We must help to support them. Not give  them money thoughtlessly, but for concrete projects. For  instance, we could buy imported equipment for the food industry.  Everyone knows that one-third of the agricultural products are  lost during processing and storage....    There are enterprises that need only the first impetus, to  be  put back in shape--and they will make their way to world  markets. Many need no help at all. Simply leave them alone and  do not oppress them with taxes. Do the petroleum and gas workers  not know how to increase their output?    It is necessary to increase the controllability of the  national economy. If an enterprise is financed by the treasury  it must be answerable to the state. Price restrictions. In a  year it was clear that if you raise transportation rates and the  cost of electric energy, all the other prices will increase  immediately. In a couple of months the energy engineers and  railroad workers will begin to operate at a loss again. The  situation reproduces itself. Only with each new spiral, more  enterprises become unprofitable.    We must sit down and reach an agreement: We will not raise  rates any more, it is better to let a couple of branches exist  on subsidies than all industry and agriculture. But you too,  gentlemen users, keep your prices within reasonable bounds, do  not crank up profitability, do not try to live well at someone  else's expense. The treasury is not made of rubber. If we get  rid of the subsidies it will be the worse for you....    But what do you say to this? Logic! But in reality?    Were the state enterprises not previously controlled by the  ministries and departments? The plan for the year, the quarter,  quotas, funds, statistical reporting--this will be harder than  the contract system to which Chernomyrdin wants to switch the  directors. What fool would live on wages now if he had untold  resources at hand?    And investments from the state pocketbook? So far the return  from 1 ruble invested has not exceeded 8 kopeks in the state  sector. Let us say that their conscience awakens--15 kopeks will  be returned from the ruble. For a million in  expenditures--150,000 in profit. Not very effective! No budget  in the world could take this.    And in general it is ridiculous to speak about "nonmonetary"  methods of fighting inflation. The agreement is worth more than  money where there is control and failure to keep one's words can  cost not simply money, but all the money. And it is  out of the pocket of the ones who make the agreement.    Monetary methods, incidentally, are not worth much either.  For the first half year or year they worked: Inflation depended  almost entirely on the amount of money in circulation. If we  constrict the money supply, do not pay for grain purchases, and  do not give wages to the miners--prices grow more slowly. Once  financing is opened up, there is a burst of inflation. But  today, whether you constrict money supply or not, prices will  grow anyway. Specialists say that inflation has manifested its  character. Nonmonetary.    Neither Gaydar nor Fedorov would achieve anything with his  devices today. They did as much as they could in the autumn--to  curb inflation for one month, until the elections. And they did  it shabbily: They simply did not pay money to the people to whom  it was promised. And then they left, shutting the door in such a  way that the dollar collapsed on Chernomyrdin. Let the winner  pay.  <H5>  The Heavy Hand of Invisible Reforms </H5>   I do not know, it seems to me that all these  reforms--Gaydar's, Chernomyrdin's--are useless busy work,  something to distract the people. Gaydar drove the money supply  here and there, Chernomyrdin intends to do selection work on the  enterprises. It is all the same--nothing will come of it.    As long as it stands as a monolith, the state  economy--monopolized, militarized, dull-witted, scarfing up  resources--you will not be able to do anything with it.    Gaydar wanted to break it--they would not let him. And he  could not have: The first to be ruined would be the government,  along with the president and the minister of internal affairs.  Chernomyrdin wants to cure it. But such a thing cannot be cured.  No matter how many trillions you throw into our agriculture--we  still will not receive a good crop. No matter how many benefits  you give the Volga Automotive Plant--the Toyota will still be  better than the Zhiguli.    Nothing will happen in this country as long as we rob the  state and tear it apart. As long as bureaucrats, bandits, and  businessmen divide it up among themselves. When all this stops,  everything will suddenly calm down.    As soon as chaos and the lawlessness cease to bring us  maximum profit--a strong power, a new order, and a government  with the people's trust will appear.    These invisible reforms have been going on for a long time  and soon will come to an end--according to all the signs there  may be five or six years left, no more. Then we will achieve  financial stability and vigorous economic growth. But until  then--expect nothing. We have had no other reforms, and we could  not have had them. Neither under Gorbachev and Pavlov nor under  Yeltsin and Gaydar. But there is also another viewpoint. Larisa  Piyasheva, for example, states that immediately after the August  putsch--two and a half years ago--it would have been possible to  conduct any ultraradical reforms. The people would have lived  through price increases and unemployment--if only to rid  themselves once and for all of the previous hated power, an  existence of semistarvation, and the unremitting hopelessness of  socialist realism.    The more so since in exchange people could gain economic  freedom, ownership of the means of production, and the land.    The breakdown of state monopolies; rapid, landslide  privatization; the land reform; decontrolling of prices;  reduction of taxes and halting of budget financing--this is what  was required of the authorities after the overthrow of the  communist regime.    But Yeltsin went only so far as to liberalize prices. This  is  actually where all the reforms ended. Gaydar became obsessed  with financial stabilization, perhaps letting go by his only  chance to carry out more radical transformations in the economy.  He limited himself to half measures, essentially changed  nothing, and as a result he was defeated.    But it is not even a matter of Gaydar himself. The problem  is  that over two years the social base for the reforms melted away.  Society was split. The president has no unconditional support  from the population. The people are disenchanted with the idea  that the results of the reform can never meet their expectations.    We no longer have a liberal option. There will be neither a  peaceful democratic breakthrough to the market nor even a  Chilean dictatorship.    Of three possible paths of development, Russia has only two  left, writes Larisa Piyasheva in an article entitled "There Will  Be No More Russian Miracle." Either the sluggish Yeltsin  dictatorship, step by step abandoning all its democratic  positions and being transformed before our eyes into Brezhnevian  timelessness. Or an out-and-out communist-fascist dictatorship,  at the end of which we can expect complete collapse of all our  hopes and illusions, more isolation from the world....    And in my opinion, all these changes of governments,  programs, and presidents, all these elections and putsches will  not change anything in principle. Global reform will go the way  it has been going. At best the advantage will be gained by  various groups of privatizers. Gaydar played into the hands of  foreign capital. Chernomyrdin--to the benefit of the directors  of state enterprises and big-time bureaucrats. If Zhirinovskiy  comes to power--he will help the bandits or someone else.    Relax, this has almost nothing to do with us. Work on  yourself.</p>

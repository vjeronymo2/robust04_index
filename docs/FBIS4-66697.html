			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ashraf Shams-al-Din, chairman of </F> subcommittee on trade in services, by Najla' Dhikri; place and  date not given: "Liberalization of International Trade in  Services Will Realize Export Surge for Egypt"--first four  paragraphs are AL-AHRAM AL-DUWALI introduction]    [Text] Liberalizing international trade in services will  bring Egypt the as-yet-undeveloped export surge that Egypt has  long sought to realize through goods exports. This is especially  so because Egypt preceded most developing countries, all the  Eastern European socialist countries, and China in following an  economic open-door policy that led to a relative development of  the services sector.    A report of the national committee monitoring the Uruguay  Round and the permanent committee on trade in services affirms  this. The subcommittee on trade in services will begin meeting  next week to arrive at a final report before the agreement is  signed this April.    Although many advanced and developing countries fear the  consequences of the agreement to liberalize trade in services  under the Uruguay agreement that is to go into effect in July  1995, experts in Egypt state that Egypt's service  sectors--especially finance, tourism, construction, and  building--are ready to deal with the world through import and  export.    Ashraf Shams-al-Din chairs a subcommittee of the permanent  committee on the international agreement to liberalize trade in  goods and services. He also heads the foreign markets and  international cooperation section of the Financial Market  Authority. He stated that Egypt's commitment to an economic  reform program has effectively speeded the growth of the service  sectors, so that they can compete on the international level. He  indicated that these sectors would be ready to operate under the  GATT agreement in only three years, although the agreement  allows developing countries a period of ten years to develop  their sectors to be consistent with GATT.  <H5>  Relative Advantages </H5>   [Dhikri] In light of reports that other countries at the  Uruguay Round of the international trade agreement failed to be  convinced to remove their barriers to foreign financial  services, how can Egypt benefit from joining the GATT agreement  as regards trade in services?    [Shams-al-Din] In many service activities Egypt enjoys  relative advantages that increase its competitiveness in  particular areas. The service sector has contributed greatly and  increasingly to national income and to improving the balance of  payments situation, particularly through the remittances of  overseas workers, tourism, and the Suez Canal. At the beginning  of the nineties, the service sector contributed nearly 76  percent to the balance of payments. Compare this to the  situation at the beginning of the seventies, when it contributed  only 13 percent. Thus, liberalizing international trade in  services will realize a great export surge for Egypt. The  service sectors rely basically on human capital and skilled  workers in many areas. The agreement allows the service sector  wider movement and a precise structure for exporting to foreign  markets outside the Arab and African regions. This is of concern  to us, according to a report of the permanent committee on trade  in services, in such areas as professional services, work force,  and building and construction--especially with regard to workers  organized as groups or in exercising the right to establish  service projects that rely on skilled workers.  <H5>  Opportunities for Egyptian Workers </H5>   As for the immediate advantages for Egypt, the  liberalization  commitments that the agreement's member nations have made will  provide opportunities for Egyptian exports of services,  especially in sectors that have reached a high stage of  competitiveness, such as banking services and insurance.  Egyptian professionals will be given an opportunity to work in  the advanced countries. The construction sector will be able to  carry on activity in the agreement's Arab member  countries--Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria--as well as in the  African countries. In addition, the services agreement allows  Egypt through its definite commitments to obtain modern  technology, to access communications channels and centers of  information about service activities and trade in various  countries, and to benefit from other countries' laws in  regulating and encouraging its service sectors.    [Dhikri] Are there to be further negotiations about workers?    [Shams-al-Din] Regarding the Egyptian work force (the  individuals necessary to provide services), in addition to the  commitments that have been made in this area, negotiations will  be held starting in May 1994 to make the advanced countries'  markets more open to organized, rather than individual, workers.  <H5>  Special Privileges </H5>   [Dhikri] Egypt played a prominent role in the grouping of  developing countries during the negotiations. What was the role  of the Egyptian negotiator? Did the developing countries succeed  in obtaining any advantages? Did any disagreement occur about  liberalizing trade in services?    [Shams-al-Din] There was no disagreement over the principle  of liberalizing trade in services, but there was disagreement on  definitions. A permanent committee on the agreement has been  formed in Egypt. It has seven subcommittees, including one on  trade in services. The role of each committee is to participate  with the Egyptian negotiator, so that the negotiating takes  place on objective principles that convince the nations of the  world that we are part of an international fabric whose goal is  to benefit from liberalizing trade in goods and services--but  also bears in mind the economic and social circumstances that we  must take into account while implementing our liberalization  program.    Egypt is part of the developing world. It stated its  position  from the beginning and played a prominent role in the grouping  of developing countries. It acted as a spokesman for Africa and  the Arab countries that have joined the agreement. Egypt also  spoke in the same way as India and Latin America. Egypt was  encouraged to play this role by its experience in its announced  program of economic reform, which has won the esteem of advanced  and developing countries alike. Our position was based on sound  economic principles. Egypt officially entered the Uruguay Round  in 1986 and announced that it was a party to the agreement. It  participated in the 1990 multilateral negotiations. As for the  developing countries, through their united stand in the  negotiations they obtained special treatment in view of their  weak competitiveness in most service sectors. The agreement on  services included provisions that give the developing nations  flexibility. Most importantly, they were granted a longer time  to establish national information publishing centers to comply  with the principle of full disclosure of local laws and  regulations governing the service sectors under negotiation.  Also, it was made easier for these countries to enter into  economic integration agreements among themselves to develop  trade in services or between themselves and the advanced  countries, provided that the subjects of these countries are  exempted from work and residence permits.    Safeguards include measures to enable a temporary  disengagement from particular commitments in case of a balance  of payments deficit or if the member country needs to take  certain steps to preserve its hard currency reserve. These  provisions allow one to request that certain commitments be  amended or withdrawn a year after the agreement begins to be  implemented, without being bound by the ordinarily specified  three-year period. In addition, the developing countries,  including Egypt, are given sufficient flexibility to subsidize  their production or exports in the services trade. At the same  time, the advanced countries are forbidden to use subsidies as a  means to increase their exports to the developing countries. A  developing country may retain a monopoly right to import certain  of its services during the time this agreement is in effect,  provided that the monopoly does not carry on its activity in a  way that does not accord with the provisions of the agreement.  There are many additional provisions that give the developing  countries, including Egypt, greater flexibility.  <H5>  Legislative Changes </H5>   [Dhikri] What are Egypt's commitments under this agreement?  Does its application require legislative or administrative  changes? Within what time period can we accomplish what is  required on the international level?    [Shams-al-Din] Egypt's general commitments accord with the  general commitments in the agreement. Most importantly, Egypt  commits itself to the most-favored-nation principle, under which  any member country of the agreement will enjoy any privileges  granted to any other member country. It also commits itself to  the principle of full disclosure--meaning that rules governing  trade in services are to be published, announced, and disclosed  to others. There are particular commitments in certain sectors.  Egypt has announced its desire to enter into the international  services trade in economic sectors that have already been  liberalized in the economic reform program. Lists of commitments  have been prepared in accordance with the regulations, laws, and  rules that govern these activities, especially in the finance  sector, tourism, and building and construction. The Egyptian  delegation at the negotiations demanded that other countries in  turn promise to open their markets to Egyptian service exports,  especially the organized and professional work force. The  definite commitments that Egypt made will allow foreign  investments in Egypt to set up companies in accordance with  Egyptian legislation in the sectors of banking, insurance,  reinsurance, capital market services, tourism services, marine  transport services, construction services, and engineering  consulting services. Commitments in one of these sectors were  made before the agreement; negotiations took place and an  agreement was reached. The remaining sectors must prepare  themselves philosophically in the framework of this agreement.  They must work out development programs with the assistance of  research centers and must engage in the necessary  training--especially in the transportation and communication  sector, the education sector, and the social insurance sector.  We have worked as a committee to encourage more sectors to study  the situation and to lay down a plan to mobilize the country's  economic and technical forces. In this way the country will be  able to announce its full position on the general framework of  the agreement to be signed this April.    As for the changes required, some pieces of legislation do  indeed need to be changed--not to be in step with the agreement,  but to serve the national economy. The nationalization laws have  still not been fully repealed. We have begun the process of  legislative change with the unified tax and the unified labor  law. Change begins with general law and proceeds to specific  law, specific regulation, and finally internal regulations--all  for a single purpose more important than any other purpose,  namely economic reform.</p>

Thai and Indonesian officials and their private  sectors in particular were delighted about the outcome of the  meeting. Their Malaysian counterparts, who before the meeting  were said to have difficulty joining the project, turned out to  be more willing than expected to make necessary adjustments.    The Indonesian, Malaysian and Thai governments will consider  all business councils' proposals under the growth triangle  project before submitting their decisions to the third  ministerial meeting in May, in Medan, Indonesia.    Ministers from the three countries agreed to accept the  private sector's proposals at the meeting yesterday. They also  signed "agreed minutes" as a record of what they discussed.    Thai and Indonesian private sectors have signed a memorandum  of understanding to jointly invest in the growth triangle. The  Malaysians need to sort out some problems before joining the  move.    Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Panitchaphak and National  Economic and Social Development Board Secretary-General Dr  Phisit Phakkasem as well as the Thai private sector were pleased  about the outcome of the meeting.    Dr Suphachai said the meeting agreed to endorse the Asian  Development Bank's [ADB's] study on the growth triangle, but  recommended the bank's study, which will be submitted to the  third ministerial meeting, should take into consideration the  following issues:    -- The ADB's report should emphasise the competitiveness of  this scheme with other projects;    -- it should look at the possibilities of investment from  investors outside the region;    -- it should have much more details of energy and power  investment    -- its comments should contain more details.    Dr Suphachai said the meeting also adopted the business  councils' proposals.    Before the third ministerial meeting begins, the governments  are to come up with decisions on the business councils'  proposals, if not all of them.    "I can say that the success of the project at this meeting  came as a result of sincerity shown by the three countries. In  the past we thought about our government first," Dr Suphachai  said.    Tun Daim Zainuddin, minister coordinating the project for  Malaysia, said he would submit all business council proposals to  the Malaysian Government as soon as possible. He thought the  Malaysian Government would come up with some decisions on three  joint proposals between Thailand and Malaysia.    These proposals are to open the border for 24 hours a day,  to  reduce from five cents to one cent a kilo the fee Malaysia  charges on marine product imports from Thailand, and use of Thai  packaging containers to carry Thai marine products.    He said although the Malaysian Government could not open the  border between Thailand and Malaysia for 24 hours, it might  lengthen the opening time.    Thai investors should join Malaysian investors to produce  packaging containers, Mr Zainuddin suggested.    Before reducing the fee on marine product imports, the  Malaysian Government would look at the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade because it was afraid that the change would  run counter to the pact. A cut would have to apply to all  countries not just Thailand. However, he said the border  opening hours and marine product packaging problems would be  resolved before the third ministerial meeting. Malaysia would  have answers on these issues for Thailand. If the Malaysian  Government could not accommodate such proposals, it would have  strong reasons.    Malaysia wanted to see tourists from the region require only  border passes, not passports, when entering one another's  countries.    Mr Hartarto, Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Industry  and Trade, said his Government would consider all proposals to  remove trade and tariff barriers for Thai and Malaysian  investors. But their removal would be within the framework of  the GATT agreement. He said Thais would be the first to invest  in Indonesia under the project.    Kasit Phirom, the Thai ambassador to Indonesia, said he  would  go to Medan to help Thais examine investment in Medan. He will  ask the Transport and Communications Ministry and Thai Airways  International to consider new flights for investors in the  region.    Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan, during his trip to  Indonesia on February 6 and 7, will discuss with him ways to  help Thais who want to invest in Indonesia.    Mr Kasit said he would look at the investment laws of the  two  countries, investment locations, promotion and transport. He  will discuss investment promotion methods with the Tourism  Office, commercial consultants in Indonesia, THAI, and companies  already involved in Indonesia such as Charoen Phokphan or  Bangkok Bank.    The Thai Embassy will hold an exhibition in Indonesia twice,  one in Surabaya and another in Medan. The exhibition in Medan  will be in the first half of this year.    Dr Phisit said the second meeting of the project was  successful because these countries had the same level of  development.</p>

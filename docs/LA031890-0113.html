			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADVENTURE TRAVEL: SEEING THE REAL NEPAL THROUGH CLOUDS AND FOG  </P> <P> It was February, and Katmandu was filled with sturdy-legged trekkers. "When you  get to San Diego we'll show you a good time," I overheard one American tell a  Sherpa during breakfast at Mike's, the charming garden restaurant where  Westerners gather daily for a $2 omelet-and-muffin feast.  </P> <P> It was my final city meal before starting an eight-day trek. I didn't know it  then, but those trekkers were the last I would see until my return to Katmandu.  Despite the surging popularity of hiking in the Himalayas, 50,000 of the 54,000  trekkers in Nepal in 1988 headed for just two destinations -- the Everest or  Annapurna regions.  </P> <P> To avoid the hordes, six writers were joining Steve Conlon, head of Above The  Clouds, a Massachusetts-based adventure travel company, to try a new route  along a ridge called Milke Danda in eastern Nepal, a region just recently  opened to trekkers by the government.  </P> <P> As we flew to the city of Biratnager, from which a bus was to drive us six  hours north to our starting point, I could not take my eyes off the thrilling  view from the airplane window. Cho-Oyu, Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Kanchenjunga  -- the snowy tips of some of the highest peaks on the planet poked through the  cloud bank below us.  </P> <P> I had waited 12 years to see these majestic mountains again. In 1978 I had done  an exhausting trek. Now my excitement at returning to the Himalayas was tinged  with nervousness. Had I trained hard enough? Would I be able to enjoy the  views, rather than slog along, panting, my eyes staring down at my boots as I  had the time before?  </P> <P> It was night when our bus dropped us off at the end of the paved road. We had  climbed from near sea level to 7,000 feet -- still the "hills" by Himalayan  standards. A row of green tents beckoned. We ate a quick traditional dinner  (including daal bhat, the rice dish that is the staple of the Nepalese diet)  inside a candle-lit dining tent and crawled into our sleeping bags.  </P> <P> Morning dawned clear and cold. Far in the distance, across row after row of  brown hills, we could just make out the tops of Makalu and Everest. I peeked at  the itinerary: This day would be "an easy one," Steve had written, "gentle  uphill along the ridge . . . with the Himalayas always before us. . . ." I was  so eager for a closer look at the mountains that I hardly noticed how steep the  "gentle uphill" was.  </P> <P> But for Nepal it was fairly easy. That's because the Himalayas are so vertical  that they make hiking in the Sierra or Rockies seem like a stroll in Central  Park. Nevertheless, my physical fears were unfounded. Smart companies realize  that not everyone wants to emulate Sir Edmund Hillary; a growing number of  treks require less than two weeks of walking and skirt the vertical climbs via  ridge trails.  </P> <P> What's more, the burgeoning number of adventure travel outfits are competing to  lure the experienced trekker back for a second or third Himalayan experience.  Thus, unusual routes in out-of-the-way places such as Milke Danda, the  primitive Dolpo region and the neighboring country of Bhutan, are showing up in  more and more trekking catalogs.  </P> <P> We climbed a rocky but well-worn path bordered by strands of huge rhododendron  trees. "In the spring the whole place is red with their blossoms," remarked  Maitalal, a Nepalese friend of Steve's. But it was not yet spring. Well before  our lunch stop, an ominous, clammy fog rolled in, obscuring everything more  than three feet in front of us.  </P> <P> And so began what we dubbed our "In the Clouds" trek. For the next eight days  the fog, unusual for February, enveloped the east Nepal Himalayas. It was just  our bad luck. October through April is considered prime time, weatherwise. But  the January "mini-monsoon," which causes fog and rain for a few days throughout  the country in mid-winter, had arrived late. It seemed as if the mountain gods  were pouring pea soup from the heavens. "Now I know why the book about  Shangri-La was called 'Lost Horizon'," I wrote morosely in my diary.  </P> <P> Each morning I would unzip my tent flap and see only mist, not Makalu. Frost  carpeted the trail in the morning. The bushes were coated with rime. Wind-blown  ice particles turned tree branches into eerie frozen feathers. At times I felt  I could well be in North Dakota, except for the herds of yaks that wandered  through our camp at night, the bells around their necks announcing their  presence.  </P> <P> For a mountain lover like me it was by turns depressing, surreal and comic.  When we got to our campsite, a broad meadow, on Day 4, Steve pointed east,  saying, "If it were clear you would see Kanchenjunga (the world's third-highest  mountain) right over there." We dutifully stared into the blankness.  </P> <P> Then at precisely 2:51 p.m. a patch of blue appeared in the sky. Something  white was on the horizon! Was it Kanchenjunga or merely an illusion?  </P> <P> I scurried up the nearest ridge for a better look. Within a minute the fog  pulled down the curtain again. Determined to catch whatever tiny glimpses  Mother Nature decided to offer me, I perched on a rock, scanning the void. For  two solid hours I sat there in a trance, imagining that at any moment  Kanchenjunga might appear through the shifting vapors. Perhaps, I thought, I  could become a Buddhist and see the mountains with my inner eye.  </P> <P> Somehow, my meditation cheered me up. And as the days passed I learned that  visiting an untrekked, unspoiled area could mean more than views.  </P> <P> For one thing, we were not surrounded by other tourists. One friend who had  made an Annapurna trek told me that some campsites looked like tent cities.  Writer Jeremy Bernstein came across a Mexican restaurant in that area, and he  described a town in the Everest region as "crawling with trekkers of every  size, shape and nationality."  </P> <P> Maybe east Nepal soon will be overrun, too. But during our eight days we did  not see any other trekking party. Indeed, the only Westerners we met were two  anthropologists who were living there.  </P> <P> Because I could not see the scenery I paid attention to the people. And they  returned the favor.  </P> <P> Some villages were desperately poor. (Nepal is one of the world's most  poverty-stricken countries.) Barefoot, begrimed, coughing children huddled  around smoky fires inside tiny wood shacks, yet their parents were consistently  welcoming, always ready to pour us cups of tea. Not a single child tugged at  our skirts begging for rupees, as many apparently do in areas more frequented  by tourists.  </P> <P> As we descended the ridge we saw classic scenes: water buffaloes pulling crude  plows through terraced planting fields, women washing their beautiful long  black hair at public water spigots.  </P> <P> We saw bizarre ones, too, such as a barefoot prisoner (we were told he had  murdered his mother) shackled to a policeman, being led on foot to the nearest  town. At one schoolhouse we visited tiny classrooms where elementary grades  children were learning to read. Then classes came to a halt as Steve spoke to  the youngsters in Nepali. At another, scores of children gathered around while  he pulled a paperback atlas from his pack and showed them where "America" is.  </P> <P> Outside the village of Chainpur we strolled through the weekly market. Rural  people, many of them women with elaborate gold rings through their noses, set  up shop in an open-air square selling all kinds of goods: huge cakes of brown  sugar, tasty tangerines, plastic bracelets. I bought what looked like a  grapefruit for 2 rupees (a fraction of a penny), sliced it with my knife and  took a bite. Surprise! It was a gigantic, very tart lemon.  </P> <P> At the final campsite our Sherpa cook baked a farewell cake. In whipped egg  whites on top was a message: "See you again." There's a good chance of that.  The most rewarding aspect of the journey was the one I did not train for.  Despite the fog this trek gave me a fascinating glimpse into a poor but proud  culture.  </P> <P> I had come to see the Himalayas; instead, I saw Nepal.  </P> <P> Getting Here: I flew Lufthansa from New York via Frankfurt to Katmandu, a trip  that happily avoids a night layover in the New Delhi airport. Lufthansa,  Singapore and Thai International are among the airlines that fly from the West  Coast to Katmandu. It is also possible to fly to Bangkok or Hong Kong and make  connections to Katmandu.  </P> <P> Documents: U.S. citizens must have a passport plus entry visa ($10), available  from the Nepal Embassy. Call (202) 667-4550 for details. Trekkers must have a  permit; major trekking companies will obtain one for you.  </P> <P> Companies With Off-the-Beaten-Path Treks in the Himalayas: Above the Clouds  Trekking, P.O.

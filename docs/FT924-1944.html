			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Eurofighter has lift-off but its flight schedule is uncertain: Questions remain about production of the aircraft which will sustain Europe's defence industry THE European defence industry's largest new collaborative project is back in business. The restoration of a partnership between Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain to press ahead with the former European Fighter Aircraft, now unimaginatively renamed Eurofighter 2000, promises work for their aerospace and electronics companies well into the next decade. But having examined last week's agreement between defence ministers there are still uncertainties about how and when production will be carried out. Over the next six months the partners have to work out changes in specifications, how to accommodate different requirements and how to reallocate production to achieve aimed-for cost reductions in the Pounds 20bn-plus project. Germany, after saying this summer that it would not go beyond development, is still not formally committed to production and is not due to decide, by vote of parliament, until 1995. This is after its next general election. 'There are really more questions than answers for the time being,' said Deutsche Aerospace (DASA). The Daimler-Benz subsidiary, with divisions involved in the airframe, engines and radar and electronic systems, is the company that would have suffered the biggest immediate impact if Germany had pulled out. The other main industrial participants are British Aerospace, GEC-Marconi, Rolls-Royce, the Italian Alenia and Fiat groups and Construcciones Aeronauticas (CASA) of Spain. According to the Society of British Aerospace Companies, 14,500-15,000 people are already engaged in Eurofighter work in Britain. BAe says it has about 1,000 directly involved in the programme; Rolls-Royce 2,000; and GEC-Marconi, described by its managing director Mr David Fletcher as having 'more at stake on that aircraft than any other UK company', about 3,000. Estimates of the number of UK jobs the programme will sustain at the height of production vary from 28,000 to 40,000. German industry reckons on direct employment of 20,000, with a similar number of indirect jobs. In Italy Alenia alone has 1,500 people engaged in development work on the airframe and electronics. This is expected to rise to more than 5,000 out of total Italian employment of 9,000. But all companies will have to cope with a slower build-up in the programme. BAe is pinning hopes on a Saudi Arabian order to enable it to resume production of Tornado bombers at its main military aircraft plant at Warton, Lancashire. Otherwise it will have to rely on upgrade work and assembly of Hawk light fighters to keep the plant going until Eurofighter production starts in four or five years. Two years ago, the expectation was that it would begin in 1994. Spending on development is being slowed down, even though the programme has already fallen a year behind. The first prototype is now expected to fly early next year. Britain and Italy both want their first production Eurofighters in the year 2000. This means they have to find ways to start setting up production before Germany has decided whether it will purchase the aircraft or how many  -a decision that will determine its final share in the programme. The fact that Germany and Spain do not want Eurofighters before 2002 means that the others will presumably have to take all the early production aircraft, complicating their spending plans. A study by the industrial partners in October identified possible cost savings of 13 per cent by centralising some production, reassessing logistic support costs and purchasing some equipment off the shelf. Further reductions - bringing total savings to the 30 per cent German target - were possible if partners wanted less sophisticated equipment. British officials insist that the revised project will bring some savings to the UK, against an earlier estimated 'flyaway' price - excluding the cost of development, tooling, spares or support - of Pounds 30m per aircraft. But how much will be partly determined by other partners' decisions. The current premise is that the 'basic' Eurofighter will keep the same airframe, engines and radar. But it is unclear whether Germany will want the joint ECR90 radar, a UK-led project which it endorsed reluctantly in early 1990. If it does not, the UK would have to assume a greater share of the ECR90's cost. Partners will in any case need to decide on new workshares for the production phase. Questions focus, for instance, on whether the wings should continue to be made by three countries - an Italian port wing and a starboard wing shared by Britain and Spain. Practices such as flying printed circuit boards around for different partners to do work on them are due to stop. However, none of the four countries is ready to abandon its claim to a final assembly line.</p>

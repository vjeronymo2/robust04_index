			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Private mines hope to win Pounds 300m damages Private opencast coal miners in the UK believe they could win more than Pounds 300m in damages after a recommendation to the European Court of Justice over a dispute with British Coal involving royalties and prices. The court's advocate-general, in a written opinion, has strengthened independent companies' belief that they have a strong case for arguing that British Coal's royalties and charging regime distort competition. Disclosure of the case in Coal UK, a Financial Times newsletter, came as British Coal announced plans to close Littleton colliery in Staffordshire, until recently considered one of its core pits, with the loss of more than 500 jobs. The European Court case arose after British Coal suggested HJ Banks and other companies could not seek remedy under competition rules of the EC Treaty where that treaty was more extensive than the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty. However the advocate-general has suggested that the EC Treaty may be applicable 'even though the products concerned fall in principle within the scope of the ECSC Treaty.' Banks and other companies have for several years been mounting a legal challenge to what they consider to be British Coal's excessive royalty charges and the alleged low prices it offers them for coal. The European Court is expected to rule on whether it accepts the advocate-general's opinion later in the year. If it agrees, the matter will be referred to the UK High Court, which asked for the European Court's judgment. Coal UK says some independent companies' fortunes would be transformed if the decision over royalties and charges went their way. For some, the claim against British Coal is their most valuable asset. The advocate-general says he can 'well imagine that the imposition of an unreasonably high royalty rate or an unreasonably low purchase price for coal extracted is capable of preventing, restricting or distorting normal competition'. Meanwhile the future of Wearmouth colliery in Sunderland was put in doubt when British Coal said a reconvened meeting would be held to discuss the pit's prospects. Wearmouth was one of 12 pits reprieved by the government in March and has been market tested in the past few months in an attempt to win extra sales. In addition managers told local union officials that efficiencies needed to be improved at Ellington colliery in Morpeth, Northumberland, if the pit was to secure its future.</p>

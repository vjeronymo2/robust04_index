			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / UK Company News: Huntleigh shares jump 43p on profits advance HUNTLEIGH Technology, the USM-quoted medical equipment manufacturer, yesterday saw its shares jump 43p to 503p after reporting a 42 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for 1991. The advance, from Pounds 1.62m to Pounds 2.31m, was achieved on sales up 19 per cent at Pounds 20.8m (Pounds 17.4m). The recommended final dividend goes up 1p to 2.75p, making a total of 4.5p (3p) for the year. Earnings per share came out at 17.15p (12.61p). Mr Rolf Schild, chairman, said that during 1991 the healthcare division had enjoyed strong sales growth in all products groups, at home and abroad. Talks had been completed, subject to contract, to merge the sensors and systems division with Tedea. The share structure of the venture is to be 65 per cent Tedea and the balance Huntleigh, reflecting the levels of investment. Mr Schild said the venture had made an encouraging start. Trading in the first half had begun well. Contributions from the UK, US and German subsidiaries were significantly above the comparable period.</p>

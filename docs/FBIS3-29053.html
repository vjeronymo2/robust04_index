			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Chon Taek-won] </F>   [Text] It has been learned that North Korea will open  Sinuiju and Nampo this year as special economic zones following  the Sonbong-Najin area, which was opened in December 1991 as a  free economic and trade zone. This was disclosed on 14 February  by a Chinese specialist on North Korean affairs who contacted  North Korean officials concerned in North Korean external  economic affairs. He added that the residents of the Sinuiju  area, to be opened as a special economic zone, were relocated  last year, and that harbor and railroad construction work is now  underway in this city.    The Chinese specialist said: An economic zone with an area  of  three square kilometers will be established in Sinuiju, and  another economic zone with an area of two square kilometers will  be established in Nampo, respectively. The opening of these two  cities will be officially announced on 9 September, the day of  the anniversary of the founding of the North Korean regime,  after being passed by North Korea's Supreme People's Assembly.    The specialist said: "I understand that there was some  objection to opening up among North Korea's highest leadership,  but the leadership decided to promote openness in a phased and  limited manner, believing that it is an inevitable trend of  history."    Stressing that "China has played a great role in leading  North Korea to openness" the specialist said that "with the  opening of Sinuiju, the industrial zone linking Dandong, located  on the opposite side of Sinuiju, and Shenyang, the central city  of the three northeast provinces of China, is ready to be linked  with Sinuiju. At the same time, North Korea also attaches great  importance to the opening of Sinuiju, which will contribute to  increasing trade with China.    The specialist said that a mutual cooperative system has  already been established between China and North Korea for the  opening of Sinuiju. Thus, he expressed a strong desire to  develop, through this cooperative system, a West Sea economic  sphere including North Korea.    The specialist also said that in addition to the 380  kilometer-long Shenyang-Dalian expressway, a direct  Shenyang-Dandong expressway is scheduled to open in October and  that the Shenyang-Fenghuangcheng-Benxi linking railway, which  was used as the main supply route for the Chinese People's  Volunteers during the Korean war; the second railway bridge on  the Yalu River leading to Chongsumyon in North Korea; and other  roads will be rebuilt to use as routes for transporting  underground resources.    The specialist said that Sinuiju, the second largest city of  North Korea with a population of 700,000, forms an industrial  zone in Puksinuiju [north Sinuiju] District, located in the  city's Yalu River riverside. He said that the depth of the water  of the present harbor located in the estuary of the Yalu River  is 20 meters, that the construction work of expanding this  harbor from the present facilities capable of anchoring only a  5,000-tonne ship to the facilities capable of anchoring a  10,000-tonne ship is underway, and that the construction of the  Sinuiju-Pyongyang railroad and an 8 km-long railway leading to  the harbor is also being accelerated.</p>

Many departments will install crossing devices upon individual request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 14.2.6&blank;Vehicular Ways and Facilities [14.4 in the NPRM] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section requires on-street parking, parking meters, passenger loading zones and motorist aid communications systems provided on or adjacent to a public right-of-way for pedestrian use by motorists to be accessible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 14.2.6(1)&blank;On-Street Parking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (1) requires accessible parking spaces where on-street public convenience parking is provided in commercial areas or at civic buildings. Technical requirements are also provided for on-street parallel, perpendicular, and angled parking spaces in such areas. Appendix notes provide examples of new on-street parking and describe parallel, perpendicular, and angled on-street parking spaces. Requirements for on-street parking along existing public sidewalks are addressed in ADAAG 14.3 (Alterations). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM required that new on-street parking in commercial districts include accessible spaces and sought comment on how the chart at ADAAG 4.2.1(5)(a) should be applied to on-street parking spaces. Most commenters supported use of the table and suggested applying it in a variety of ways, including block areas, block lengths (both one-sided and two), parking districts, commercial and central business zones, or the total inventory of on-street parking in a jurisdiction. Several comments suggested a scoping based on demonstrated need. Some commenters were concerned that applying the table to a series of small projects with a limited number of spaces might result in an overall requirement for more spaces. Persons with disabilities recommended applying the table to small areas in order to provide broad dispersal, maximum convenience, and the shortest possible routes of travel. Several commenters suggested that scoping be expanded to include parking at municipal buildings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In new development, parking will typically be provided as part of a larger project, such as the widening of a street, the improvement of a downtown commercial area, or the creation of a new subdivision. Therefore, the interim final rule uses project as a basis for scoping. A new on-street parking project may be established within a discrete area defined by several blocks and include both sides of a street or streets. Major street and public sidewalk reconstructions will have similar characteristics. An urban block may provide as many as sixty spaces around its perimeter; a block-long street length may average thirty for both sides together. The interim final rule requires that where new on-street parking is provided as part of a project in commercial districts and at civic buildings, accessible spaces shall be provided in accordance with the table at ADAAG 4.1.2(5)(a). Such spaces shall be reasonably dispersed throughout the project area. A provision has been added that requires accessible spaces to be located where street and sidewalk slope is minimal, to the extent that this is consistent with reasonable dispersal. A needs-based provision is not feasible in new construction, where use levels will be initially low until full development is achieved, at which time it might not be practicable to add accessible spaces where needed. A requirement has been added to include parking at civic buildings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many comments recommended that the length and width of accessible parking spaces be specified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A requirement has been added that accessible parking space length and width be no less than those provided for standard spaces in a jurisdiction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM proposed a 60 inch wide parallel access aisle and a 36 inch wide perpendicular access aisle connecting to a public sidewalk curb ramp. Two organizations representing the parking industry provided detailed recommendations on different designs of accessible parking spaces. Commenters were concerned about vehicle maneuverability in indented spaces, sufficient access space to use a public sidewalk curb ramp when spaces are occupied by vehicles, and provisions for rear-loading vans. Several commenters also recommended that angled and perpendicular on-street parking be addressed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The interim final rule provides technical provisions for parallel, perpendicular, and angled parking and requires a wider perpendicular access aisle. Where the public pedestrian right-of-way exceeds 12 feet in width, parallel on-street parking spaces require both perpendicular and parallel access aisles. A 60 inch wide perpendicular access aisle must be located at the head or foot of an accessible parking space and connect to a public sidewalk curb ramp. The perpendicular access aisle will allow unobstructed travel from accessible parking spaces to the public sidewalk and a more generous vehicle maneuvering space. Side-loading vans may use the public sidewalk area at a standard parking space, if unobstructed, or the public sidewalk at an accessible parking space to deploy a lift and thus are not specifically provided for here. Many rear-loading vans will be able to use the perpendicular access aisle to deploy a lift.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

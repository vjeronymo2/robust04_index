			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / International Company News: Fletcher Challenge in the red FLETCHER Challenge today announced a net loss after abnormal items of NZDollars 157.5m (USDollars 84.8m) for the year to June 30 compared with a profit of NZDollars 481.9m last year. The result was broadly in line with the forecast in May when the company, New Zealand's biggest, reported it was adopting new international accounting policies and that its operating earnings were under pressure because of problems with its interests in pulp, paper and building subsidiaries. The loss came after abnormal losses of NZDollars 462.6m (NZDollars 472.8m before tax and minority interests). The abnormals included the provision of NZDollars 400m for potential property write-downs relating mainly to its Australian subsidiary Jennings. Audited group earnings, excluding abnormals, were somewhat better than expected at NZDollars 305.1m. The dividend for the year is 14 cents a share, compared with 27 cents last year. Return on shareholders' funds was minus 3.2 per cent (11.1 per cent) and earnings per share was minus 16.6 cents (41 cents).</p>

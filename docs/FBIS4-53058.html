			<p>BFN     [Text] It was learned on 13 May that the Japanese  Government had presented a new plan to Washington to promote the  standardization of both countries' patent systems, which is an  important topic in the Japan-U.S. trade framework talks. The  plan proposes that: 1) The United States introduce an open  information system under which information on inventions is  disclosed after patents are applied for; and 2) Japan abolish  the system of allowing a third person to make objections to a  patent applied for in a period of patent examination. The  disclosure of information on inventions will reduce the number  of patent disputes between Japan and the United States, while  the abolition of the objection system will shorten the period  needed for patent examination. Tokyo hopes this mutual  compromise will lead to the resumption of the stalled framework  trade talks.    The plan was recently submitted in writing by Patent Office  Director General Aso to U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Chief  Lehman. In both Japan and Europe, information on inventions is  disclosed after patents are applied for. In the United States,  however, information is not disclosed during patent examination.  Under the U.S. system, it is possible that when patent  examination is seriously delayed, a patent is issued 10 or more  years after submission of the application. Such patents are  called "submarine patents."    When a submarine patent is given to technology after many  years, companies that have used the technology for a long time  are sometimes asked to pay huge patent royalties. This happened  in the past and caused international disputes over patents. For  example, an image-processing technique for automobile production  invented by an American was patented in 1992, although the  application for the patent was submitted in 1954. In a dispute  over the royalty of this submarine patent, Japanese automakers  had to pay 200-300 million yen to 2-3 billion yen each to settle  the dispute. The Japanese Government thinks if Washington  accepts its compromise plan, patent disputes of this kind can be  averted.    Under the objection system, the government receives the  objection, which should be made within three months after a  patent is applied for, from a third person who claims "a patent  should not be given to the invention" and the claim is used for  reference during patent examination. The abolition of this  system will simplify procedures for patent licensing and make a  prompt examination possible. However, to protect the rights of a  third person, the government plans to establish a new system  under which objection is accepted after a patent is issued and  if necessary, the patent is reexamined.    There are growing voices within U.S. industries calling for  introduction of an open information system. They say: "The  system will help increase the transparency of patent examination  and avert unnecessary disputes over patents." Moreover, a bill  to introduce an open information system has been submitted to  the U.S. Senate. These things led Tokyo to the conclusion that  popular opinion in the United States is greatly tilting toward  introducing an open information system. Based on this  conclusion and as a compromise, Tokyo has included in the new  plan a proposal to abolish its objection system, which has long  been criticized by Washington as being the cause of prolonged  patent examination in Japan. If the United States introduces an  open information system under which information on inventions is  disclosed after patents are applied for, there will be no  problems with submarine patents, and Japan and the United States  will begin to move toward standardization of their patent  systems.</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Dorling Kindersley shares fall on warning Dorling Kindersley, the publisher which became a glamour stock after its flotation last year, yesterday shocked investors by announcing the departure of its managing director and issuing its second profits warning in a fortnight. The shares plunged 89p to 221p, reducing the group's market value by Pounds 55m to Pounds 136m. They had already fallen from a peak of 351p in October - just a year after they were floated at 165p. The group, which produces illustrated reference books and multimedia products, warned that continuing problems at its Tiptree distributor and a projected shortfall at DK Education, which supplies teaching packages to schools, meant pre-tax profits for the year to next June would be less than the Pounds 9.65m achieved last time. Analysts had been expecting the group to make about Pounds 11.5m pre-tax until the first warning last month. Dorling Kindersley said yesterday that trading in the pre-Christmas period was being disrupted by a computer problem at Tiptree Books, owned by Random House, the US publisher. Its managing director Mr Richard Harman, 45, had resigned 'to pursue other interests'. He had a three-year rolling contract for which he would receive a nominal sum, but was being allowed to exercise options on 650,000 shares. Mr Peter Kindersley, chairman, said the departure was a mutual decision as Mr Harman's interest had 'begun to flag'. It was not fair to blame the company's problems on him. Mr Harman had been with the company for nine years but had seen his management role eroded after the appointment of Mr Peter Gill as finance director and Mr Rod Hare as operations director. Mr Kindersley said: 'His successor, Rod Hare, is a particularly effective hands-on manager, with a thorough knowledge of the business.' Dorling Kindersley has given three months' notice to Tiptree and will itself take over distribution of its DK Family Library, which sells to homes, offices and schools. It asked Arthur Andersen, the accountants, to assess damages and a claim will be made. Dorling Kindersley remained confident about its core businesses. One factor driving City enthusiasm has been the group's role in pioneering CD-Rom multimedia products. Lex, Page 20</p>

			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> SAYING YES TO PERSIAN FOOD AT GLENDALE'S YAAS  </P> <P> Once meat and potatoes, Glendale is now full of small, colorful ethnic  restaurants -- places where you can sample the world's cuisines at suburban  prices. Yaas Restaurant stands near the head of the list; it's one of the most  authentic Persian kitchens around. Many of the dishes here compare favorably  with similar ones served in Westwood, where the Farsi-speaking community is  concentrated. Prices do too.  </P> <P> Yaas (it means jasmine) bills itself as a Persian-Armenian dining room. On a  quiet downtown street, it looks more like a ski lodge than a restaurant. The  walls are paneled in stained wood, with plenty of disco-style mirrors hanging  on them. But look more closely, and you notice that a dark Persian rug hangs on  a back wall. Listen more carefully, and you hear mysterious music emanating  faintly from speakers. In Glendale, exoticism is understated.  </P> <P> </P> <P> American Heart Assn.  </P> <P> But what comes out of this kitchen certainly is not. Owner Madhu Gandhi's menu  offers most of the traditional Persian favorites. Yet unlike many of those  Persian restaurants in West L.A., several dishes are marked with hearts,  indicating that they have been approved by the American Heart Assn. This is  accomplished because Gandhi trims his meats religiously, using little oil in  preparation. Much of his food is light and lean.  </P> <P> The dishes that aren't marked with hearts are divinely heavy. In the best  Persian tradition, these dishes are full of nuts, oils and the bounty of the  region they represent. And despite the raised health consciousness of the  management, they are the better dishes in the restaurant.  </P> <P> Best of all is kashk budemjoon ($4.99), fried Japanese eggplant dripping with  kashk, a fragrant, thickened yogurt. Atop the kashk is minced garlic, a crunchy  fried spice topping made from dill, cilantro and plenty of olive oil. You dip  the eggplants into the wonderful, piping hot, sesame-topped house bread, and  sprinkle the whole thing with chopped fresh onion. If there is a more  soul-satisfying appetizer in town I don't know about it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Exotic Yogurt  </P> <P> Other starters are good too. Dolmeh ($3.89), stuffed grape leaves, are more  familiar to most, but these are dolmeh with a twist. Besides being far meatier  than those in Greek or Lebanese restaurants, they are topped with garlic  yogurt. Yogurt fanciers will be pleased to note that there are mint and shallot  yogurts on the appetizer list. Just try to find those in your dairy case.  </P> <P> The extensive kabob list is the heart of this menu, and probably what most  people come for. I found the kabobs rather hit and miss. Barg ($8.99), a fillet  steak in thin strips, had very little flavor, despite being lean and tender.  Other Persian restaurants must use more marinade, or tastier meat. Ditto for  the koobideh ($5.95), a long, tubular skewer of ordinary ground beef, which  tasted Middle Western, rather than Middle Eastern.  </P> <P> On the other hand, lamb chop kabobs ($11.95) were wonderful, meaty, juicy and  flavored just right, with the meat falling from the bone. Shrimp kabobs  ($11.99) were equally fine, eight large, slightly blackened shrimp, with a  pungent lemon-garlic butter as an inspired compliment.  </P> <P> Good kabobs notwithstanding, I would say the stews and specialty dishes here  make more pleasing main courses. They are homey and comforting, big enough to  share, and more interesting. My favorite of these is fasenjoon ($7.99), chicken  floating in an impossibly rich sauce made from walnuts, pomegranates and stock.  The sauce is sweet and grainy, the texture of pipian (a Mexican sauce made from  pumpkin seed). A few bites of it are enough to make anyone swoon. How one  person is expected to eat the whole thing is anyone's best guess.  </P> <P> Slightly lighter (but also plenty filling) is bagali pulo ($6.99), lamb shank  in tomato stock with a lima bean rice overwhelmed by a mountainous heap of  chopped dill. I'd personally choose the chicken cherry ($7.99), known in Farsi  as albaloo pulo. Yaas' version is a tasty rice reddened by the juice of sour  cherries that aren't really sour, flanked by an excellent flame-broiled chicken  kabob. The chicken kabob itself is not on the menu, but is the best kabob the  restaurant serves, tender, juicy and pleasantly spiced. The mild pungency of  the rice balances it well.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coffee and Dessert  </P> <P> Try to save a little room for those sticky desserts. Persian ice cream ($2.65)  is perfumed and creamy, loaded with pistachios and the scent of rose water. The  Heart Assn. wouldn't come within miles of it. I like zoolbiah ($2.45), swirling  rings of floured batter that are deep fried and drenched in honey; they remind  me of the Tunisian pastry shops in Paris. And there is always that thick,  sweet, muddy coffee, called Armenian coffee on the menu. I wondered why Yaas  billed itself as a Persian-Armenian restaurant. I guess it must be the coffee.  </P> <P> Recommended dishes; kashk budemjoon, $4.99; aashreshteh, $2.99; lamb chop  kabobs, $11.99; shrimp kabobs, $11.99; fasenjoon, $7.99; chicken cherry, $7.99.  </P> <P>  Yaas, 110 E.

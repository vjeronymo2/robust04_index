Gaydar's resignation should not be taken as an attempt to  bring down the president or his government, Pochinok told  INTERFAX on Monday. He pledged no opposition to Yeltsin or the  government on the RC's part, adding that Gaydar was in the mood  for constructive dialogue.    Pochinok sees Gaydar's move as the most honest option,  saying  that one must resign if unable to implement his ideas.    At the same time, Pochinok, who is a real contender for the  post of chairman of the planning and budgetary committee, says  he sees no replacement for Gaydar.</p>

The  government spoke highly of this decision and said: "The  decision prevented the current situation from intensifying and  no economic sanctions will be taken against North Korea,"  (according to a Foreign Ministry source). However, to earn time,  North Korea has been taking various measures such as delaying  the issuance of visas to IAEA investigators, even after the 15  February agreement with the IAEA on accepting inspections.  Because of this, the government intends to watch future  developments on the nuclear issue carefully.    The focal points at issue will be the shift to high-level  U.S.- DPRK talks and DPRK-ROK negotiations to be held in the  future. However, at the Diet session Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa stressed: 1) Special inspections by the IAEA on the  two facilities which were not included in the DPRK's list of  nuclear facilities; and 2) implementation of a North-South joint  declaration on denuclearization, are indispensable. Therefore,  the government has not changed its stance, saying: "It is far  from a complete settlement and Japan will keep watching the  situation to ensure North Korea fulfills its responsibilities,"  (according to a government source).    Since there is no prospect of resuming Japan-DPRK  negotiations on the normalization of diplomatic ties, which  Japan has been calling for, the government may make efforts to  solve the problem with "indirect support," and ask for China's  cooperation while maintaining contact with both the United  States and South Korea.</p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / UK Company News: Cronite receives Pounds 7.3m agreed cash bid from French engineer CRONITE GROUP, the Birmingham-based engineer and steel stockholder, has received a Pounds 7.3m cash offer from AFE, a quoted French engineering company. The offer is being recommended by most of the board, except for Mr David Pinsent, a former chairman of the company. He said the offer was untimely and did not fully value the company. It disregarded the potential benefits of closing loss-making subsidiaries and the reduction in debt following the Pounds 3.5m sale of Cronite Steels. He advised shareholders to reject the offer and said he would be writing to them. The majority of the directors said that there were limits to the growth which could be achieved on the back of an improvement in the UK economy and increasing exports. They added that it was likely that any large expansion would require investment. Becoming part of a larger group would enhance the prospects for development. AFE is offering 45p a share and has received undertakings to accept in respect of 2.4m shares or 14.8 per cent of the equity. Cronite's shares rose 15p to close at 44p. In the year to September 30 pre-tax losses were Pounds 1.96m (Pounds 1.22m profits) on turnover of Pounds 35.1m (Pounds 46.7m). Gearing at the year end was 117 per cent. Following closure of loss-making businesses the company expects to return to profits in the present year.</p>

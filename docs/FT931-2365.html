			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Food, petrol and clothing nudge up inflation rate SHARPER PRICE increases for food, petrol and clothing contributed to the small rises in headline and underlying inflation last month. Prices rose 0.7 per cent on the month, taking the retail prices index to 138.8 and the annual rate to 1.8 per cent. Underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage payments, rose to an annual rate of 3.4 per cent. Food price inflation remains low at 0.9 per cent on an annual basis, but in February food prices rose 1.1 per cent on the previous month, the biggest monthly increase for almost two years. The Central Statistical Office said the rise occurred mainly because of a sharp increase in seasonal food prices with retailers raising the prices of fresh fruit, vegetables and home-killed lamb by more than in 1992. As a result seasonal food prices fell only 9 per cent in the 12 months to February compared with 10.4 per cent in the year to January. In spite of recent reductions in interest rates, housing costs - mainly mortgage interest payments - rose by 0.3 per cent in February compared with the previous month. The CSO said the rise reflected a small continuing increase in the size of the average outstanding mortgage debt. The price of household goods rose 0.7 per cent from the previous month, as the cost of furniture and furnishings bounced back after the January sales. The annual rate of inflation for this category of the RPI continued to reflect the sluggishness of the housing market, rising only 1.4 per cent in the year to February, the lowest rate for six years. Clothing and footwear prices, which continue to fall on an annual basis, rose by 1.8 per cent month-on-month, reflecting price recoveries after the sharp reductions of the January sales and price increases as the new season's fashions entered the shops. The second phase of higher telephone charges boosted household service prices by 0.5 per cent on the month and 3.8 per cent in the year to February. Leisure service prices also rose. Increases in excise duties announced in the Budget will not affect the RPI until April. They are expected to add about 0.5 per cent to the index.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK INFLATION RATE (+1.8%) RPI: 138.8 IN FEBRUARY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Housing (172)                      -2.9% Motoring (143)                     +3.1% Food (non-seasonal) (130)          +2.5% Alcoholic drink (80)               +4.9% Household goods (77)               +1.4% Clothing &amp; footwear (59)           -0.2% Household services (48)            +3.8% Leisure goods (47)                 +2.1% Catering (47)                      +5.1% Fuel &amp; light (47)                  -0.5% Personal goods, serv.

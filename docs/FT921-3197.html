			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / International Company News: Reaping the benefits of an international strategy - How Bovis is escaping the ravages of the UK construction recession BOVIS, the UK construction group, appears to be on a winning streak. On Friday, it was confirmed that the company had been awarded the contract to manage the main building works, worth between Dollars 700m and Dollars 1bn (Pounds 408.7m - Pounds 583.9m), for the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia. The order would be a coup for any international construction company. For Bovis it comes in the middle of a remarkable three-month run of success, during which it has picked up management contracts for some of the world's biggest and most prestigious building projects. Since the beginning of December, Bovis, a subsidiary of Peninsula and Oriental Steam Navigation (P&amp;O), the British property and transport group, has been awarded contracts to manage construction work worth more than Dollars 3.5bn. The contracts, won against stiff competition, particularly from the US, have been spread as far apart as continental Europe, the Far East and the US. They include: a Dollars 700m second phase of the Euro Disney theme park in Paris; the first phase of a big city centre office and redevelopment worth between Dollars 800m and Dollars 1bn in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Dollars 700m of maintenance facilities for United Airlines at various US airports; and a Dollars 400m development for Kommerz Bank in Frankfurt. Other contracts include a Dollars 100m Court of Appeal building in San Francisco; a Dollars 150m hotel in Los Angeles; a Dollars 100m redevelopment of Navy Pier in Chicago; and refitting the London headquarters for the European Bank for Development and Reconstruction, expected to cost Dollars 90m. The awards reflect the success of the company's policy, established in the mid-1980s, of building a worldwide construction business to reduce its dependence on a home market which has suffered as a result of overbuilding in the late 1980s and the decline in the UK economy. By the end of last year, Bovis held contracts to manage projects worth Pounds 3.7bn - 8 per cent more than at the end of 1990 and in spite of one of the worst recessions for UK construction for half a century. According to Bovis, the combined value of its UK contracts last year fell by 41 per cent from Pounds 1.7bn to Pounds 1bn. The value of US work, however, increased by three-quarters from Pounds 800m to Pounds 1.4bn, while the value of continental European and Far Eastern projects rose by 44 per cent to Pounds 1.3bn. Sir Frank Lampl, Bovis's Czechoslovakian-born chairman, says: 'We decided in 1985 that the rise in UK construction output could not last and that we needed to find new markets. At that point more than 90 per cent of Bovis's turnover was generated in the UK.' The company does not carry out construction itself, but manages projects for a fee, subcontracting the work to others. Its domestic success had been based on establishing long-term relationships with UK customers, similar to the 'partnerships' between Japanese contractors and clients. Bovis, between 1927 and the mid-1980s, managed the construction of almost all of Marks and Spencer's stores. It still carries out more than 80 per cent of developments for the group. Bovis also has close relationships with Stanhope, the UK property developer, and with Safeway, the British retailer, for which it has built more than 200 stores. Sir Frank, who left Czechoslovakia in 1968, just before the Soviet invasion, says: 'We have tried to offer similar continuity and quality of service to international customers which regularly build overseas.' The breakthrough came with the purchase in 1986 of a 50 per cent stake in Lehrer McGovern, the New York-based construction management group, which was purchased outright by the British company in 1988. Bovis, through Lehrer McGovern, was able to offer US-style construction management, just as North American developers were seeking to invest in Europe. It is a mark of Bovis's success that it has won repeat orders for both Euro Disney (where it managed phase one of the project) and for Canary Wharf, where it is managing the construction of a multi-billion-pound office scheme being developed by Olympia &amp; York. In 1990, Bovis - previously based in the north-east and west coast of the US  -acquired McDevitt &amp; Street, a large US construction group working primarily in south-eastern states. This year, it bought Schal Associates, a Chicago-based construction management company covering the mid-west. McDevitt &amp; Street and Lehrer McGovern will mastermind the construction of sports facilities, accommodation, transport and communications for the 1996 Olympic Games. Bovis, which seven years ago only had overseas subsidiaries in Portugal and San Francisco, now has subsidiaries in Spain, Germany, France, Czechoslovakia, Portugal, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, Japan, Taiwan and the US.</p>

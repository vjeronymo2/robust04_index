			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Company nurses 'pressed to flout code' The Royal College of Nursing says there has been a disturbing increase in complaints by company nurses who are being pressed by personnel managers to release information on patients, Richard Donkin writes. Mr Graham Johnson, chairman of the RCN's occupational health nurse section, said that cases of company managers asking nurses to break their professional confidentiality code were on the increase. He said: 'Registered nurses have a professional duty of confidentiality to their patients, yet some of them are being faced with managers insisting that they disclose personal details of individuals.' In one case, featured in today's issue of Personnel Management Plus magazine, a nurse said she had been told by her human resources director that she would face disciplinary action unless she handed over information. Most of the problems were arising in companies with fewer than 500 employees, he said. Nurses were particularly vulnerable to employer pressure when they worked alone in companies.</p>

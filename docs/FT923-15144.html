			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Privatisation in Eastern Europe (2): 'Like the Foreign Legion' - Western advisers find the challenge exhilarating but stressful FOR hundreds of western bankers, accountants, lawyers and purveyors of other professional services, the opening up of eastern Europe introduced them to a new Wild West. The complexity of rebuilding capitalism has taxed their ingenuity and patience, and taken many to hitherto secret locations in the farthest flung reaches of the former Soviet empire. It is a stressful area. 'Our people in eastern Europe are a bit like members of the Foreign Legion, with more than a fair share of divorces and unhappy marriages among them,' says the eastern Europe manager of one large accounting firm, who wishes to remain anonymous. But it it is also a place which attracts the young and the adventurous. 'You are in the forefront of history, you are trying to make privatisation work, you are inventing things all the time - in a world without stock exchanges or banks or even application forms,' explains Mr Arnold Shipp, senior manager at Samuel Montagu which was one of the first UK-based merchant banks to plunge into the new area. City firms, were quick to spot the potential new markets, and were greatly helped by the UK Know-How Fund, which finances a broad swathe of privatisation-related projects from its Pounds 25m-Pounds 30m annual budget for the area. The greatest demand has been for accounting, auditing, evaluating, due diligence and other services, which has led the big six international accounting firms, and many smaller companies, to build up fast-growing practices in all east European capitals and other leading cities. According to a survey by Privatisation International, which specialises in privatisation news worldwide, Coopers and Lybrand tops the list of east European assignments, closely followed by KPMG and Price Waterhouse. In spite of the rapid growth over the last three years, the virtually zero starting point and desperate shortage of hard currency means that eastern Europe still represents only a fraction of most companies' overall business. 'There is a widespread belief that eastern Europe is the biggest thing that ever happened in the privatisation field. It isn't,' says Mr Richard Gledhill, head of privatisation services for Price Waterhouse. 'In terms of business and fee income the work generated by privatisation in Latin America, south-east Asia and Australia is much greater. Out of 800 partners worldwide only 10 or 11 are engaged full-time in eastern Europe which represents only around 5 per cent of total fee income and time.' 'The three big markets for accounting and other professional services in eastern Europe are governments, state-owned enterprises and potential investors,' he adds. While the area remains relatively small in global income terms for foreign advisers of all stripes, demand for their services is growing fast. The entire institutional and legal framework is having to be built up at the same time as deals are being negotiated to transfer property from often ill-defined 'state' ownership to private hands. This is the main difference between privatisation in the former centrally planned economies and elsewhere. The scale of the needs is the reason why 'it is easier to get a mandate in eastern Europe than most places, but 10 times more difficult to actually close a deal,' according to Mr Alasdair Dundas of Bankers Trust, who advised the Czech government on several early privatisation deals in the glass, cement and other areas. ' We have to do a lot of hand-holding' adds Mr Dominic Hollanby of Andersen Consultants, who is currently advising the Ministry of Privatisation in Lithuania. 'Ministers and senior officials are often bright but inexperienced and surrounded by men who ran the old system and want to preserve their own jobs. The best combination of skills required by management consultants in this area is a good accountancy background combined with practical industrial experience,' he says. One of the most difficult tasks is helping to bring about the revolution in attitudes needed to transform the authoritarian, production-first mentality of the old management structures. 'There are very few sales, marketing or finance people around to shift the orientation from production to satisfying consumers. If privatisation is to succeed power needs to be shifted from the production men and engineers to managers with skills which as yet hardly exist,' says Mr Hollanby. The influx of highly paid foreign advisers, accountants, lawyers and consultants is not without stress for the newly-liberated host countries either. Nationalist feelings are rising throughout the region. For some local officials and resentful citizens, the western adviser has taken over a similar role to that formerly played by the discrete but ubiqitous KGB-linked Soviet advisers. For over four decades they sat in the important ministries. Critics of the Know-How fund, for example, say it is more a form of outdoor relief for a London City financial establishment facing hard times than genuine aid to the east. Often the complainants are academics or local economists who are employed as sub-contractors, at low local pay rates, for western companies who then charge up to Pounds 200 an hour for producing the final product. Substituting the beady eye of the accountant or lawyer for the tyranny of the central plan is clearly not a painless process. The urgency of transferring practical and organisational skills however is now widely recognised, especially by governments. Time and again, the weakness of banking systems, shortage of capital and the uncontrollable increase in non-performing inter-enterprise debt emerge as mines set to explode under SOE's on the privatisation menu. That is why the World Bank, and other international institutions such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) or the European Community's Phare fund place top priority on funding programmes to train a new generation of central and commercial bankers. With German banks deeply pre-occupied in building up their networks in former east Germany other European, US and to a lesser extent Japanese investment banks, are busy establishing bridgeheads and advising on a wide range of privatisation issues. Credit Suisse First Boston appears to be the most active, setting up branches throughout the region to boost its agressive involvement in privatisation issues. CreditAnstalt is prominent among Austrian banks busily re-establishing their presence in an area with long histroical links. Among City-based banks Barclays de Zoete Weld has established offices in Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland while N. M. Rothschild, Samuel Montagu, Morgan Grenfell and SG Warburg are among other active players in markets which are increasingly perceived as requiring long term, and on-the-spot involvement. Thus far competition is intense, costs are high and profits are small for most western companies selling their skills in a crowded and poor market. But without these skills it will not be possible to build the vital inter-connecting tissue of long neglected services without which neither privatisation nor a market economy is possible.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               PRIVATISATION ASSIGNMENTS WORLDWIDE IN 1991  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Firm                           Countries    E Europe jobs    Total jobs  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ACCOUNTANTS Coopers &amp; Lybrand                 43             127             274 Price Waterhouse                  40              88             246 Arthur Andersen                   44              67             225 KPMG                              19              98             155 Touche Ross                       23              43             113 Ernst &amp; Young                     17              48              73  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INVESTMENT BANKS Credit Suisse First Boston        12              34              57 N.

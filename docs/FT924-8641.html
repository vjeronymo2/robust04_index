			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Henderson falls 26% to Pounds 6.5m HENDERSON Administration, the UK fund management group, reported a 26 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Pounds 6.5m for the six months to September 30 against Pounds 8.8m. The fall reflected a further shrinkage in assets under management, a drop in interest income and a slight increase in operating margins. The interim dividend is maintained at 12.5p. The company said the outlook for the second half of the year was 'unpredictable' but added that longer term prospects remained good. Mr Jeremy Edwards, managing director, said the company was close to finalising terms for its planned acquisition of Touche Remnant, the investment trust managers, from Societe Generale, the French bank. Mr Edwards said the entire acquisition is to be financed from cash, saying talks are underway to integrate the staff of the two firms. Henderson is reported to be paying close to Pounds 40m for Touche Remnant, to be offset by about Pounds 15m cash on Touche Remnant's balance sheet. Henderson will consider merging some of its smaller unit trusts with Touche Remnant's after the purchase and merger of some support operations. Assets under management to September 30 eased to Pounds 7.28bn from Pounds 7.35bn at the end of March 1992, reflecting lower investment returns and the loss of two pension fund clients, Mr Edwards said. However, he said the loss of pension fund clients over the past few years had almost ground to a halt. While investment performance for the first two quarters of 1992 had been below average, investment returns for the third quarter had been sufficient to raise performance above the market median. Improved investment performance, he added, should enable the firm to resume attracting pension fund clients.</p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART RAFFLE WILL BE HELD TO AID DAMAGED CENTER  </P> <P> Original works by local artists will be raffled Saturday at an afternoon buffet  to help the Westside Arts Center recover from a $75,000 fire and to provide  programs for children.  </P> <P> The event called "A Collector's Afternoon" will feature 21 prints completed  especially for the center. The works are valued at a total of $25,000.  </P> <P> A fire last August destroyed musical instruments, video equipment and art  supplies at the Westside center, a nonprofit group that offers art programs for  families. According to the event's sponsor, Diana Attias, the center also needs  help to continue to offer its services.  </P> <P> "We have a waiting list of schools wanting our low-cost art programs," she  said. "Because of government cutbacks, many of the schools are currently unable  to offer arts education for children. Increased community support will allow us  to bring excellent art programs back into the schools."  </P> <P> The prints are on exhibit at Michael's Restaurant, 1147 W. 3rd St., and will be  raffled at the restaurant between 2 and 5 p.m. Raffle tickets are $10 each or  15 tickets for $100. Lunch and 15 tickets are $125. For details, call Carlyn  Clark, (213) 453-3966.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Kresimir Zubak, the president of the Presidential  Council of Herzeg-Bosna, has sent a letter to Bosnian Prime  Minister Haris Silajdzic calling on him to urge the Muslim side  to fulfill all remaining obligations from the agreement on  exchange of prisoners. Zdenko Vranjes reporting.    [Vranjes] In a letter to Silajdzic, Kresimir Zubak says  among  other things, that the Bosnian Muslim side has not yet supplied  information on the fate of 26 Croats taken from Bugojno, as was  set out in the agreement on the exchange of all remaining  prisoners. The Croatian side has fulfilled all its obligations  from the agreement.    Zubak also notes that Bosnian representatives from Bugojno  did not come to a meeting yesterday, either. The Croatian side  was thus let down for the third time since the beginning of the  process of exchanging all remaining prisoners, the letter  stresses. Zubak also asks Silajdzic to exert his personal  influence to solve this problem that burdens Croat-Bosnian  relations. Zubak also informs Silajdzic in his letter that, in  line with an agreement, the Croatian side has appointed its  members into a joint expert group which is to deal with the  delineation of cantons.    At a session held today, the government of the Croat  republic  of Herzeg-Bosna demanded the Bosnian side fulfill its  obligations from the economic sphere, as agreed between  representatives of the Herzeg-Bosna government and the  government in Sarajevo. The need to elect as soon as possible  the leaders of the federation was also stressed. This would  finally create one of the basic conditions for the functioning  of the constitution [of the federation]. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRIVATE ELECTRONIC BUGGING GROWS, KOREANS SAY  </P> <P> Illicit eavesdropping by the government on private conversations, once a fact  of daily life in South Korea, is decreasing, but such activity by private  citizens is on the rise, the International Rights League of Korea is charging.  </P> <P> Lee Jong Mok, a member of the league's standing committee, said recently that  complaints filed with the league about private bugging have been increasing as  the lifting of authoritarian controls has helped turn South Korea into a more  assertive -- and argumentative -- society.  </P> <P> Business enemies are bugging each other, he said, and management is tapping  phones and eavesdropping on conversations in labor union offices. At the same  time, he said, politicians are listening in on their rivals, and foreign  investors, including American and Japanese businessmen, have been accused of  bugging their employees.  </P> <P> "Companies bug individual workers who have complaints against management to  find an excuse to fire them," said Kang Seung Hee, another member of the  standing committee.  </P> <P> Dealers in the Seun electronics market in downtown Seoul report that women are  buying the devices to check on their husbands. And some men, the dealers said,  appear to be checking on their wives.  </P> <P> Although sales of the devices are illegal, South Korea has no law against their  use, except by employees of the government-run telephone company, Lee said.  Worse yet, he added, the courts regularly accept as evidence information  provided by listening devices.  </P> <P> As a result of the increasing complaints, Lee said, the Human Rights League has  undertaken a campaign to outlaw bugging completely, along with the secret  recording of telephone conversations. A bill has been submitted to the National  Assembly but, contrary to the league's wishes, it would allow the courts to  authorize the police to eavesdrop on conversations if national security issues  are involved.  </P> <P> Kang said that police suspicions of national security violations have often  included virtually any anti-government activity, and he charged that the  independence of the courts is not assured.  </P> <P> "It's doubtful that the courts in Korea would turn down any request," he said.  </P> <P> Lee said the league received 32 bugging complaints last year and has received  10 so far this year, "but we believe those complaints represent no more than  10% of the actual cases."  </P> <P> Dealers in the Seun market say they sell all the bugging devices they can  obtain.  </P> <P> Most of the bugging devices are smuggled in from Japan or Taiwan, and most of  the customers, a dealer said, want Japanese models, which sell for around $225.  Korean-made devices cost as little as $42, he said, but "since buyers are  always in desperate need, we can charge four to five times the cost."  </P></p>

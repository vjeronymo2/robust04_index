			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Write-off behind 32% fall at Dow Jones DOW JONES, publisher of the Wall Street Journal, yesterday reported a 32.5 per cent decline in 1991 net profits, to Dollars 72.2m, a result in line with market expectations. The net income figure was struck after a previously-announced Dollars 32m write-off of development costs, goodwill and equipment associated with The Trading Service, a foreign exchange direct dealing service of Dow Jones' Telerate subsidiary. Consolidated operating income for 1991 was 5 per cent higher at Dollars 240.7m. Group revenues of Dollars 1.7bn were 0.3 per cent up on 1990. Group net profit in the fourth quarter was almost wiped out by the Dollars 32m Trading Service charge, having declined to Dollars 3.5m from Dollars 23.4m in the last quarter of 1990. But operating income in the last quarter of 1991 grew by 44.4 per cent to Dollars 78.7m on quarterly revenues that were 3 per cent higher at Dollars 456.1m. The final quarter of 1991 saw an improving trend in all three main divisions, with operating income 22.6 per cent higher in information services, to Dollars 37.6m. The business publications segment, which includes The Journal and Barron's, rebounded by 96.2 per cent, to Dollars 33.6m of operating income, although this was compared with a depressed 1990 fourth-quarter level. Operating profits in the quarter at the Ottaway community newspapers division was 12.7 per cent up at Dollars 9.4m. The Wall Street Journal's advertising linage fell by 10.3 per cent in 1991, but by only 0.7 per cent in the fourth quarter. The Journal's full-year advertising revenues fell 5.8 per cent, but rose by 3.3 per cent in the last quarter. Wall Street marked Dow Jones shares down Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 28 7/8.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Alain-Gabriel Verdevoye: "Germany: Car </F> Manufacturer Announces Losses of Seven Billion Francs [Fr];  Volkswagen Has Enough Resources to Rebound"--first paragraph is  L'USINE NOUVELLE introduction]    [Text] The announcement of heavy losses and the recourse to  the 28.8-hour workweek came as a shock. But the European leader  might come out stronger.    Car manufacturers are like politicians or show biz stars.  The  higher we praise them, the quicker we are to dismiss them. Only  two years ago, observers raved about the forced growth of  Volkswagen, the undisputed European leader; today, many promise  it the fate of dinosaurs.    True, according to Ferdinand Piech, the German group is  expected to lose Fr7 billion this year. True, the Wolfsburg  manufacturer is forced to cut its workweek to 28.8 hours  (instead of the present 36) in order to save 30,000 jobs. With a  10 percent wage cut. True, Volkswagen plants remained idle some  30 days between January and last October, Audi plants some 50  days over the whole year, and the Spanish subsidiary SEAT  [Spanish Passenger Car Company] is operating in the red.    True, the group's production dropped by 16 percent during  the  first nine months of the year--as much as the European market.  True, production costs are still 15 percent higher than those of  French competitors. True, finally, investments over the period  1994-1994 will be 20 percent below the fantastic forecasts of  the group's former president, Carl Hahn.    Yet, the position of the fourth largest manufacturer  worldwide is in no way desperate. Having little debt, it  launched a serious campaign last March to increase its  productivity; it is known by the quite unpoetic name of KVP2.  Already, 350 plants have been screened, with average  competitiveness gains of 27 percent within just a few months.    The group's models still enjoy a good reputation of quality,  and high-level technology. Besides, although it is hardly  represented in the United States, Volkswagen is the most  international of European manufacturers: it is strongly  established in East Europe and, during the first half of the  year, it achieved sales of 167,000 vehicles in Brazil, 64,000 in  China, and 75,000 in the Asia-Pacific area. Today, the patient  is suffering but after a long period of recovery it should come  out still stronger.  <H5>  All Indicators Point Downward </H5>     -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Period            |Sales (Billion Fr-|Net Result (Billi-|Production (Milli-|  |                  |ancs              |on Francs)        |ons of Units)     |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |January-September |220               |+1.9              |2.6               |  |1992              |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |January-September |195               |-5.2              |2.2               |  |1993              |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

As a result of this, some changes were introduced.  Vice Admiral Ricardo Villaran Tapia, the chief of staff, was  transferred to a "meaningless" post in the National Defense  Secretariat. In 1992, Villaran was in charge of the General  Command of Naval Zones (Congezonas), a key post with command of  troops. Villaran is the second most senior on-duty vice admiral.    Another Vice Admiral who protested, Luis Giampetri Rojas,  was  also punished. He was designated chief of staff, a bureaucratic  post with little power. Giampietri headed Congezonas in 1993.</p>

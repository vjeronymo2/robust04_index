			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / People: Olympian challenge Andrew Napier, corporate affairs director of Ford of Europe, is taking on the formidable task of improving the public relations of the International Olympic Committee. Napier, 45, plays down the difficulty of his new job and says that in some ways it is more of a homecoming. Before joining Ford's European headquarters in Essex eight years ago, he had been public affairs manager for Philip Morris' European head office in Lausanne, only a few minutes away from the IOC's headquarters. Napier will be in charge of a new department covering media relations, information and publications and will report direct to Juan Antonio Samaranch, the IOC's 72-year-old president. Although the last couple of Olympic games, in Seoul and Barcelona, have been great commercial successes, the Olympic movement, and in particular its president, have often been the subject of controversy. A recent book, The Lord of the Rings, alleged that there had been manipulation of the Olympic ideals for financial gain. However, Napier says he has no qualms about working for such a powerful figure as Samaranch who has dominated the Olympic movement for the past 12 years and comes up for re-election next year. He believes that Samaranch's critics fail to give the president sufficient credit for the positive contribution he has made in areas such as ridding sport of apartheid and negotiating with Russia's President Boris Yeltsin to ensure that former Soviet athletes were able to participate fully in this year's Barcelona Olympics.</p>

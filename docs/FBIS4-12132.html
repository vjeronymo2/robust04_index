			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] His Eminence Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Husayn  Fadlallah has stated that the enemy Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin's visit to the Vatican and his audience with the pope "is  an indulgence for the enemy absolving him of shedding the blood  of 56 worshippers."    In an interview, Fadlallah said that when Rabin visits the  Vatican and is warmly received, we want to ask: Is the Vatican  a West European country like the others or a Christian mission?  Is it operating in its capacity as the Church, guided by its  Christian values, or as a state operating according to  international balances? [passage omitted]    His eminence continued: The Vatican always spoke of  internationalizing Jerusalem first and the holy shrines second.  It also spoke of the freedom of religion and even regarded  Jerusalem as its very own cause. This time the pope did not  discuss Jerusalem with Rabin, as Rabin said. The Vatican did  not deny Rabin's story.    Fadlallah asked: If the pope did not discuss Jerusalem with  Rabin or the need to protect unarmed Palestinians by sending in  international forces and if Rabin did not ask him to mediate in  the negotiations, what was the visit about? The affair then  represents an indulgence for the Jews and a new recognition that  gives "Israel" new moral strength to add to the strength it  already has. [passage omitted]    He continued: We want Christianity and Islam to be value  systems that defend the wronged and oppose the arrogant  regardless of the consequences. When calculations enter the  issue, value is lost. If value is lost, what is left of the  meaning of Islam and Christianity? This is not a position  against Christianity and Christians. It does not deal with the  pope's planned visit to Lebanon. We do not oppose the visit.  We welcome some of its aspects. Undermining causes is a  different issue. It is not an issue of a papal envoy sent to  Tunis. A papal envoy should be sent to all those who lost their  fathers or children in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, because  it is these people who can utter the word of truth and ask:  What is the meaning of the Jews' existence in Palestine?</p>

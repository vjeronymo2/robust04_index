			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Police probe 'suspicious' death of Tory MP Mr John Major's government last night faced the prospect of a perilous by-election battle after the sudden death of Mr Stephen Milligan, the Conservative MP for Eastleigh in Hampshire. Police were investigating what they described as 'suspicious circumstances' after 45-year-old Mr Milligan was found dead in his west London flat. A post-mortem examination was being carried out last night. The unexplained death follows a spate of personal scandals which have hit Mr Major's government since the start of the year. Mr Milligan, who entered parliament in 1992, was regarded as one of the rising stars of the new intake of Conservative MPs. He had been appointed parliamentary private secretary to Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence minister, and could have expected a junior ministerial job later this year. Amid visible shock among his colleagues at Westminster, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, described the news as 'dreadful' and Mr Aitken spoke of his 'profound sadness'. Early today Mr Major, in a statement from Downing Street, expressed his distress at the death. Other colleagues said they were stunned by what had happened, and Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, went immediately to Hammersmith police station to be briefed. A former journalist and broadcaster, Mr Milligan was on the centre-left of the party and was an outspoken supporter of the prime minister. He was BBC TV's Europe correspondent from 1988 to 1990 and before that was foreign editor and Washington correspondent of The Sunday Times. Mr Milligan's death leaves the government facing an awkward test of its popularity in one of the areas in which it is most vulnerable to an upsurge in support for the Liberal Democrats. He won Eastleigh with a majority of 17,702 over the Liberal Democrats. But a government majority of more than 22,000 was overturned last autumn by the Liberal Democrats in the nearby constituency of Christchurch. The expectation at Westminster last night was that the by-election would be postponed to coincide with the local elections on May 5. Mr David Willetts, Tory MP for Havant and a friend of Mr Milligan, said: 'He was one of the best of the 1992 intake of MPs. It is a great personal loss.' Mr Andrew Mackay, a Conservative whip, added: 'He was a very able and popular MP who had a great future.' Mr Milligan was the third MP to die in recent weeks. The others were Labour MPs Mr James Boyce and Ms Jo Richardson.</p>

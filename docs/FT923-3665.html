			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: Nat'l Semi advances in first quarter NATIONAL Semiconductor, the US semiconductor chip manufacturer, reported slightly higher than expected first-quarter earnings and a 15 per cent increase in sales. Net earnings for the quarter were Dollars 21.9m, or 17 cents per share, compared with a loss of Dollars 168m, or Dollars 1.64 per share in the same period last year when the company took a restructuring charge of Dollars 149.3m as it consolidated manufacturing operations. Sales for the first quarter of fiscal 1993 rose to Dollars 472.4m from Dollars 411.0m in last year's first quarter. 'Earnings for the first quarter reflect on-going improvement in profitability as we continue our business turnaround activities,' said Mr Gilbert Amelio, president and chief executive. 'We have now had four consecutive quarters of profitability.' As part of its worldwide manufacturing realignment, National recently completed the transfer of one of its most advanced production lines to Greenock in Scotland. The company said that its manufacturing lines are now working at approximately 79 per cent of capacity, up from about 70 per cent a year ago. National said that the normal seasonal slowdown in business over the summer months was smaller than usual. New orders booked during the quarter were up substantially over the previous year's first quarter. 'Although we have seen some improvement in the semiconductor market, there are still few clear signals regarding trends in the worldwide economy,' Mr Amelio said.</p>

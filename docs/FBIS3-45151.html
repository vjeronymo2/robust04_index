The PLA opened its first army unit to foreign visitors in  1955. Since China introduced reform and the open policy, the PLA  has continued to open a number of ground force, navy, and air  force bases and barracks to foreign visitors. Many foreign  heads of state, government leaders, and military delegations  have visited PLA bases and barracks.    The Academy of Military Sciences and the PLA National  Defense  University have become important channels for academic exchanges  between PLA military academies and their foreign counterparts.  Since its founding in early 1985, the PLA National Defense  University has followed the principle of "looking toward the  world, the future, and modernization" advocated by Deng  Xiaoping. It has treated the principle as a principle for  developing itself and displayed enthusiasm in opening up. Up to  now the university has conducted academic exchanges with army  units and military academies of over 50 foreign countries.</p>

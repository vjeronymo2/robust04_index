			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Sport: The handicap of poverty - Golf I WENT TO a golf tournament in the Czech Republic. This, I suppose, is like going to watch snooker in the Andes. Eastern Europe is not exactly classic links-land. The nearest examples of seaside turf, pot bunkers and rolling sand dunes are hundreds of miles away. I was there to find out about the 'other half': the professional golfer who drives a battered Morris Minor, does not have a Greg Norman-size bank account and lives with his parents in east London. Golf can seem glamorous and alluring if you look at the White Shark and his 12 Ferraris. The other side is more about bald tyres, leaking radiators and five-footers for your own money. The tournament was the Corfin Charity Challenge, one of many events throughout Europe on what is called the Challenge tour - a satellite circuit for those who have not yet made it with the big boys. It was held on a course called Marianske Lazne, which is about three hours' drive along country roads west of Prague. Considering golf was suppressed for four decades under communist rule, it looked in remarkably good condition. What is more, this royal and ancient game was being played - appropriately but astonishingly - on a course opened by Edward VII in 1908. At first sight it looked like any other tournament. There were leader-boards, a press office, marshals with 'Quiet please' signs, a practice ground - even ropes to keep the crowds at bay. The professionals looked like any other professionals, squeaky clean, dressed immaculately. They behaved like other professionals, beating balls from dawn to dusk on the practice ground. And they seemed to hit just as straight and just as far as their more illustrious brothers. There were differences, not least the fact that I was the only spectator; the ropes down the sides of each fairway were there to keep me from charging on to the course hunting autographs. Most of the 118 players carried their own bags, unable to afford caddies. Occasionally, a father or a girlfriend would step in, pulling a trolley and offering consolation. For most, though, it was a lonely walk, a solitary existence. 'We all have a dream,' said one hopeful, Alan Saddington. 'We all think we are one day going to burst through and take the regular tour by storm. If we didn't, there would be no point in being out here. You have to have a vision. I would do this whether there was any money to win this week or not.' Only the top 15 in each tournament (out of 120 or so) will make a net profit at the end of the week. By the time Sunday night comes round, there are, inevitably, many more disillusioned and sad souls than celebrating ones. 'It's not depressing,' says Andy Stubbs, whose baby the Challenge tour is. 'We are providing alternative competition for those who haven't made it on the regular tour. 'Believe it or not, there are hundreds of guys out there, all over Europe, prepared to spend over Pounds 500 of their own money, every week, following their dream to be a professional golfer. Most of them don't make a living but, for those few who do, it's all worthwhile.' It costs about Pounds 20,000, in living and travel expenses, to play the Challenge tour for a season. Most of the players do not have sponsors. Many drive from event to event because it is cheaper than flying. They share jokes and sandwiches with each other even though they are in competition. They refuse to treat themselves to a meal in a restaurant unless they have had a good week. Before the last putt has dropped on Sunday night, most are on their way, in cars and caravans, to the next event. The Challenge tour has 51 events worth a total of Pounds 2.4m, which might sound a lot until you compare it with the Pounds 24m available on the star-studded Volvo European tour. It costs Pounds 150,000 to sponsor a Challenge tour event, compared with more than Pounds 1m on the Volvo tour. Nick Faldo says his dealings with the media corps are the most difficult part of being a superstar. After he won the Open at Muirfield last year, some of this frustration was evident when he thanked them 'from the heart of my bottom' in his victory speech. He says the endless requests from autograph hunters often get on his nerves. Those on the Challenge tour would give their back teeth for just a little of this harassment.</p>

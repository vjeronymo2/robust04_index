			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Profits warning clips 61p off FII shares SHARES in FII plunged 61p to 280p yesterday as the shoe manufacturer and scientific instrument supplier issued a profits warning just one day before its annual general meeting. FII said yesterday that it expected a Pounds 1m loss in its science and technical division, following the unexpected cancellation of a contract and the separate recall of one of its major products. The result would be a substantial reduction in profits compared with last year's Pounds 3.48m. Analysts had been expecting full year profits of about Pounds 5.3m. The future strategy relating to the science and technical division was now under consideration. However, the company sought to reassure investors with an optimistic statement over trading in its other divisions and in the second half. As a result, its dividend policy would remain unchanged, FII said. As one of the main suppliers of shoes to Marks and Spencer, FII has been unable to pass on the sharp increases in raw materials costs following the devaluation of sterling. The increase in costs was partly to blame for a 19 per cent tumble in annual profits to Pounds 5.2m.</p>

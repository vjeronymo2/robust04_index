The administration has  thus recovered the high level of support it enjoyed at the  outset of its inauguration last August. Political reform has  been a major political task which has been tackled for six  years, and failure to enact political reform bills has caused  the administrations of former Prime Ministers Toshiki Kaifu and  Kiichi Miyazawa to topple. Apparently, the public has reacted  favorably toward the Hosokawa administration for managing to  have the political reform bills enacted in the final moments of  the last Diet session. Although 70 percent of the respondents  supported passage of the bills, many objected to easing the ban  on corporate donations, among other points.    Meanwhile, the support rate for the Liberal Democratic Party  dropped 9 percentage points from that registered in a poll  conducted last December down to 15 percent. This is the first  time the party's support rate has dropped below 20 percent.  Results of the poll also showed that a record 46 percent of the  respondents supported no particular party.    The support rate for the Hosokawa administration registered  75 percent at the outset of the administration's inauguration --  the highest such rating ever recorded in MAINICHI SHIMBUN's  polls. In a subsequent poll conducted last September (by  interviewing voters), the administration's support rate dropped  to 65 percent. It further dropped to 58 percent in a poll  conducted in the same manner last December. Thus, the  administration's support rate has shown a rapid downward trend.    The latest poll shows that 74 percent of the respondents  support the Hosokawa administration, while 12 percent do not  support it and 13 percent have no opinion.    Supporters of the administration were also asked to give  reasons (more than one accepted) for their support. Of all the  given reasons, 49 percent was that "the administration can be  expected to come up with new policies"; 32 percent was that  "Prime Minister Hosokawa has a good personality"; 30 percent was  that "the administration is a coalition government which is not  dominated by a single party"; and 26 percent was that "the  administration can be expected to carry out political reform."  The last reason ranked second in the poll conducted at the  outset of the administration's inauguration.    Among reasons given by nonsupporters of the administration,  45 percent was that "Prime Minister Hosokawa's leadership and  abilities are doubtful"; 33 percent was that "the administration  cannot be expected to come up with new policies"; and 31 percent  was that "there seems to be a dual power structure within the  government." These three negative reasons have each increased by  5-6 percentage points over the initial poll last August. The  fourth reason, at 30 percent, was that "the government is  unstable because it is a coalition." This last reason has  dropped by 13 percentage points over the initial poll.</p>

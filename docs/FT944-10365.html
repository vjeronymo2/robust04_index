			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Zeiss workers in jobs protest Thousands of workers from Carl Zeiss plants in east and west Germany yesterday protested against plans to cut over 3,000 jobs. IG Metall, the steel and engineering labour union, organised the protests involving 3,500 employees at Oberkochen in Baden-Wurttemberg and 2,000 at Jena in Thuringia. Management at Carl Zeiss, manufacturer of optic and scientific instruments, wants to cut losses of more than DM140m (Pounds 57m). Some DM100m of the losses have accumulated at the Jena plant, which last year had a turnover of DM206m, while the remainder were at Oberkochen, which had a turnover of DM2.5bn.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] London, April 17 (XINHUA) -- British Defence  Secretary Malcolm Rifkind today criticized the people who have  advocated that more air strikes could halt combat in Bosnia.    Speaking on BBC Radio, the British defence secretary said  that air power could not determine the outcome of the Bosnian  war, although he denied that air strikes had failed and insisted  that air strikes had reduced U.N. casualties there.    Rifkind argued that only massive ground forces would have  that impact, but he maintained that the United Nations should  remain non- partisan.    Meanwhile, Lord Carrington, former U.N. envoy to Bosnia,  criticized today the West's policy failure in Bosnia.    Speaking on BBC TV, Lord Carrington said that with regard to  the U.N. peace efforts in Bosnia, "everything has gone wrong."    It would be "madness" for the United Nations to wage war  against the Bosnian Serbs, he stressed.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Form BE&hyph;10B BANK for reporting foreign affiliates that are banks with assets, sales, or net income greater than $3 million (positive or negative). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the survey is intended to cover the universe of U.S. direct investment abroad, in order to minimize the reporting burden, foreign affiliates with assets, sales, and net income each equal to or less than $3 million (positive or negative) are exempt from being reported on Form BE&hyph;10B(SF) or BE&hyph;10B BANK (but must be listed on Form BE&hyph;10A SUPPLEMENT or BE&hyph;10A BANK SUPPLEMENT).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The major rule change from the last (1989) survey to the 1994 survey is the raising, from $15 million to $50 million, of the exemption level for reporting foreign affiliates on the more detailed long form. In the 1994 survey, nonbank foreign affiliates for which assets, sales, or net income is greater than $50 million (positive or negative) are required to be reported on Form BE&hyph;10B(LF) (Long Form); nonbank foreign affiliates for which assets, sales, or net income is greater than $3 million (positive or negative), but for which no one of these items is greater than $50 million (positive or negative), are required to be reported on Form BE&hyph;10B(SF) (Short Form). In the 1989 benchmark survey, the long-form exemption level was $15 million. This change means that approximately 6,000 foreign affiliates that previously would have been reported on the long form will now be reported instead on the short form, thus reducing both reporting and editing burden from what it would otherwise have been. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Forms for the 1994 benchmark survey are scheduled to be mailed out at the end of February 1995. A completed report is due to BEA not later than May 31, 1995 for a U.S. Reporter filing less than 50 Forms BE&hyph;10B(LF), BE&hyph;10B(SF), and/or BE&hyph;10B BANK and not later than June 30, 1995 for a U.S. Reporter required to file 50 or more Forms BE&hyph;10B(LF), BE&hyph;10B(SF), and/or BE&hyph;10 BANK. A response is required from persons subject to the reporting requirements of the BE&hyph;10 whether or not they are contacted by BEA. Also, a person, or their agent, who is contacted by BEA about reporting in this survey must respond in writing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12612 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These rules do not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under E.O. 12612. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These rules have been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The collection of information required in these final rules has been approved by OMB (OMB No. 0608&hyph;0049).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to vary from 14 to 8,500 hours per response, with an average of 159.4 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Comments from the public regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information should be addressed to: Director, Bureau of Economic Analysis (BE&hyph;1), U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; and to the Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, Attention: Desk Officer for the Department of Commerce.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Counsel, Department of Commerce, has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration, under the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), that these final rules will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The exemption level is set in terms of the size of a U.S. company's foreign affiliates. If an affiliate is owned 10 percent or more by the U.S. company and has assets, sales, or net income greater than $3 million (positive or negative), it must be reported. Usually, the U.S. parent company (the one required to file the report) is many times larger. Also, to minimize the reporting burden on smaller U.S. businesses, nonbank foreign affiliates with assets, sales, and net income all below $50 million will be reported on the abbreviated BE&hyph;10B(SF), or short form, rather than the BE&hyph;10B(LF), or long form. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 15 CFR Part 806 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Balance of payments, Economic statistics, U.S. investment abroad, Penalties, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: November 10, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Carol S.

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Shattered nerves behind banks' bandit screens: How both employers and employees suffer from armed robberies NEXT TIME you visit your bank or building society branch, spare a thought for the people on the other side of the glass 'bandit screen' who live with the possibility that an armed raider may burst in on them at any time. Last year the number of armed robberies on building society and bank branches in the UK rose to 1,633 - six for each working day  - with the growth in raids being especially marked in London, where figures doubled. This year's trend so far is still strongly upwards. There were 93 bank and building society raids in the London area in the first three months, compared with 63 in the same period a year ago. The pattern of the attacks has also changed. The traditional target of raiders has been a small or lonely building society branch, where about two thirds of robberies have occurred. However, the figures for this year so far in London suggest that bank robberies are becoming more frequent. Nor is the familiar bank robbery the worst that can happen. Unpleasant refinements such as hostage-taking and attacks on the homes of staff have been reported. Banks and building societies are reluctant to discuss raids and refuse to say how much money is lost in robberies. Scotland Yard's Flying Squad, the police unit that deals with bank raids, confirmed that the amounts stolen are sometimes substantial and that many of the raiders are not isolated amateur criminalsbut sophisticated gangsterswhose moves are carefully planned. Although banks and building societies install internal security devices, such as cameras, alarms and protection screens that shoot up from the counter to seal staff off from the attack, they seem reluctant to swap information with each other about attacks. Mr Noel Howell, a spokesman for Bifu, the bank employees union, said: 'A branch may well not know that the branch of a rival just down the road has been raided.' One dismaying effect of the raids for banks and building societies is to make it more difficult to operate open-plan branches in which bank staff talk to customers in a relaxed environment across a desk - rather than through the traditional bandit screen - which helps to generate sales opportunities for insurance and other financial products. Nevertheless, the Flying Squad said it believed improved security could cut down successful raids. Another worry for banks is the effect on staff, who may be left traumatised by a raid. Nearly every attack on a branch is violent, involving the use of guns and knives or toy replicas. Large employers such as Halifax Building Society train their staff with videos to anticipate all the thingsthat are likely to happen in a raid. The Halifax said: 'Our videos recreate the sort of things they can expect in a raid in fairly graphic terms. We don't want to frighten them but to prepare them.' Even so, the aftermath of an attack on a branch may be difficult for employees to cope with. Two years ago Bifu was able to secure Pounds 1,500 from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board for an employee who was left permanently terrified by the sight of people in balaclava helmets. Mr Howell said: 'We have got people who are frightened to go back to a particular part of a building after a raid and a fifth of those affected feel it eight weeks later.' Bifu said some bank staff even quit their jobs so as not to face the risk of a further raid. It said poor staff morale, significantly reduced staff effectiveness, a rise in absenteeism and high staff turnover were the hidden costs of bank raids. The British Bankers Association described Bifu's attitude to bank raids as slightly alarmist. The BBA makes a reward of up to Pounds 10,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of bank robbers, but gave no indication of how many such rewards are actually paid. The association said: 'Out of a total of 21,000 bank and building society branches in the UK, 1,600 raids is not a very high prop-ortion.' However, some employers have taken steps to cope with the consequences of raids. Abbey National, which said there has not been an increase in the number of raids attempted on its branches in the last two years, has a team of three full-time employee counsellors. Midland Bank employs a specialist outside counselling service. On one topic Bifu and the BBA are in full agreement. They both want the government to outlaw the carrying of replica weapons used in the attacks. 'There is absolutely no reason for anyone to wander around in a bank with a replica gun in their pocket,' the BBA said.</p>

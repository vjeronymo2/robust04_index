			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE MONEY SOUGHT TO KEEP L.A. POLICE FOOT PATROLS  </P> <P> With a popular Los Angeles police foot patrol program in peril due to  unwillingness by police and elected city officials to pick up its $3-million  price tag for another year, a legislator announced Thursday that he will  attempt to raise the money in Sacramento.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles) said at a City Hall news  conference that he feels "encouraged" that his $8-million foot beat bill will  win state approval. The legislation, which would also provide $2.5 million for  foot patrols in crime-ridden areas of San Diego and San Jose, won support in  the Assembly Committee on Public Safety this week, but has not yet picked up a  sponsor in the state Senate.  </P> <P> The city's foot patrol program has been hailed by police officials as having  reduced violent crime in many of 13 "hot spots" from South-Central Los Angeles  to the San Fernando Valley, where officers have been deployed since the program  began last September.  </P> <P> "It has has had a tremendous effect on homicides, which is the ultimate crime  as far as we're concerned," said Deputy Police Chief Jesse Brewer, who joined  Friedman at the event.  </P> <P> Brewer distributed charts Thursday showing that during the program's first  three months, only three of 17 homicides in the targeted neighborhoods occurred  while foot patrol officers were present.  </P> <P> Despite the program's success, Los Angeles police officials have said that  proposed city budget cuts for police overtime would make it impossible to fund  the patrols for the new fiscal year beginning July 1.  </P> <P> The program is already out of money for this year, and the City Council today  is expected to debate whether to appropriate $500,000 to keep the patrols going  through the end of June.  </P> <P> At the news conference, City Council members Zev Yaroslavsky and Richard  Alatorre praised the patrols, the police and Friedman. They also indicated that  the program is apparently dead if help does not arrive from Sacramento.  </P> <P> "In order to continue the foot beat program in any meaningful way, it's going  to take some assistance from outside the normal city budgetary process,"  Yaroslavsky said. "Everyone here knows that this city is facing a major  financial crisis."  </P> <P> "It seems to me it's worthwhile to continue it," added Alatorre. "It's  unfortunate that it had to be cut out, but when you look at the fiscal picture  for the city of Los Angeles, certainly other problems that the Police  Department identified took a greater priority. There is nothing that is a  greater priority than to cut down on the response time to crimes of violence  and the like."  </P></p>

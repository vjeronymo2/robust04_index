			<p>940415 FT  15 APR 94 / Union in contempt over post strike The UCW communications union became in contempt of court yesterday after about 1,000 Liverpool members refused to end an unofficial and illegal strike over a disputed tea break. Royal Mail yesterday obtained a High Court injunction demanding a return to work, but strikers at Liverpool's main Copperas Hill sorting centre stayed out. Postboxes were sealed as work dried up at 11 delivery centres in Merseyside and parts of Cheshire. Liverpool Chamber of Commerce and Industry advised businesses to go to the Preston postal district for posting mail for delivery outside the area. The UCW, which has repudiated the strike, said it would probably make a statement in London today. The union is legally responsible for its members' actions and could face heavy fines if they continue to defy the court. The strike began on Wednesday when a worker was suspended for three days - under what the Royal Mail claims is an agreed disciplinary procedure - after a heated argument between the worker and his supervisor over an unauthorised tea-break. Royal Mail said its operations at Liverpool Airport were not affected.</p>

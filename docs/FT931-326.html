			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Hong Kong and Mexico lead the field JAPAN'S equity market slowed its rise last week and this, with both the US and Europe in negative territory, was barely enough to lift the FT-Actuaries World Index to a token gain in local currency terms. The top performers were Hong Kong and Mexico. Of Hong Kong, Mr Hugh Peyman of Kleinwort Benson is not bullish, in spite of last week's uptick on more conciliatory noises from Chinese officials. 'No quick solution is yet in sight,' says Mr Peyman, 'and the best guess remains that no accommodation will be reached until late second quarter at the earliest. By then another dark cloud will be looming ..in the shape of the overheating Chinese economy that will have to be brought under control with some brutish instruments that will send shudders through the economy.' Mexico resumed its recovery. Latin American Securities says that lower interest rates and improved sentiment on the North American Free Trade Agreement, prompted by positive declarations from Mr Richard Gephardt, the US house majority leader who had been generally perceived as opposing the agreement, seem to have sparked off an intensification in the buying plans of some investors. In Europe, politics moved German and French sentiment in opposite directions. Like Austria, the week's worst performer, Germany suffered on Monday and Tuesday from the previous week's Russian crisis, and a tacit acknowledgement that the market needed a correction left little scope for general recovery. France waited for last weekend's second round elections to confirm the crushing defeat of the socialists and responded, meanwhile, to stimuli like Thursday's comments by Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the successful Gaullist RPR party, that economic growth was essential for the country - suggesting to some investors that lower interest rates could be on the way.</p>

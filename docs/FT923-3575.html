			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Cadbury Schweppes Cadbury's interim results confirmed its status as one of the quality stocks in the food manufacturing sector. Items such as the Pounds 14m fall in working capital indicate strong management grip, and the digestion of the Aguas Minerales acquisition in Mexico seems to be progressing well. As well as adding new brands to the stable, the hope must be that such purchases will allow Cadbury to grow organically by selling existing products through the acquired companies. But there are problems. Competition in soft drinks is fierce and getting fiercer, as the 44 per cent fall in European beverage profits shows. The decline of the dollar is also likely to hurt in the second half, and full-year earnings may not be much higher than last year. Given the non-cyclical character of the sector, an economic recovery is unlikely to boost sales dramatically, so the outlook for earnings growth is sluggish. On top of that the much-vaunted prospect of a bid has receded with US predators hamstrung by the low dollar. Investors must thus decide whether Cadbury's premium rating to the market arises from its trading outlook or the scarcity of good food stocks. While the price is undoubtedly boosted by fund managers trying to avoid less successful food manufacturers, Cadbury's has a valuable portfolio of well-run brands. On that basis yesterday's 14p fall in the shares increases their attractions.</p>

BRIEFING;  </P> <P> GLOBAL NUCLEAR SAFETY GROUP FORMS  </P> <P> Leading nuclear power operators today formed a worldwide organization designed  to prevent nuclear accidents and improve their industry's public image.  </P> <P> Organizers said nearly all 150 authorities operating nuclear plants in 31  countries had gathered in Moscow to sign the charter of the World Assn. of  Nuclear Operators.  </P> <P> "The world would be a better place if we, the utilities, had set up this school  in earlier years," Lord Marshall, chairman of Britain's Central Electricity  Generating Board, told the meeting's opening session.

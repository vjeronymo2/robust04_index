			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US equities pick up ahead of jobs data Wall Street US share prices posted modest gains as the markets rallied from three days of losses yesterday. Sentiment, however, remained subdued as investors awaited today's key employment report, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 8.75 firmer at 3,845.88 and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 put on 1.41 at 467.91, while the Nasdaq composite edged up 0.28 to 772.10. NYSE volume came to 285m shares. Flat bond prices helped to steady equities, which had taken their lead from declining Treasury prices over the previous three days. The Dow snapped back 15 points at the opening, making up more than half of the ground lost at Wednesday's close, but then retreated gradually over the rest of the day. News that the Federal Reserve was continuing to shore up the value of the dollar also supported stocks by boosting investor confidence and stabilising prices in the Treasury markets. Volume was moderate as investors awaited key employment figures, due out today. Some analysts were predicting the non-farm payroll figure to rise more than 300,000, slightly above recent trends. Investors were wary that the Fed could lift interest rates before its November 15 open market committee meeting if the figure showed an increase much greater than expected. A smaller than expected drop in jobless claims eased fears that today's employment data will indicate a rapidly expanding economy. Several US retailers were up on stronger than expected sales for October. Sears rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 49 1/2 , the Gap Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 36 1/2 , Dayton Hudson Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 81 7/8 and May Department Stores Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 38 3/4 . Wal-Mart, which posted sales below analysts' expectations, shed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 23 5/8 . The Dow was pulled up by moderate increases among its biggest components. General Motors gained Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 39, McDonalds Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 29 1/2 and Bethlehem Steel Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 19. Financial services group Kemper declined Dollars 2 to Dollars 48 1/2 in the wake of Conseco's announcement on Wednesday that it wanted to lower its bid for the company, raising further doubts about the Indiana-based insurer's ability to complete the deal. Reports of a boom in its Latin American lending pushed Bank of Boston up Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 28 3/8. Some analysts, however, worried that the bank, which wrote off Dollars 200m in loans to the region in 1984, might have too much exposure to relatively unstable markets. United Health Care, one of the leading health care providers, fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 48 3/8 on profit-taking after a year of strong growth. Third-quarter results released yesterday were in line with analysts' expectations. Canada After two days of sharp declines, Toronto stocks were flat yesterday as investors remained cautious ahead of today's crucial employment reports. The TSE 300 composite index closed a mere 2.16 points softer at 4,226.82, while falls outscored advances by 416 to 316 after volume of 58.2m shares. As well as the US payroll report, seen as a crucial barometer for the strength of the US economy, the Canadian employment report will be released today. Venezuela Shares were only mildly lower in Caracas in slightly better volume than had been seen on Wednesday as the confusion surrounding Electricidad de Caracas's forthcoming share subscription appeared to have been resolved. The Merinvest index eased just 0.40 more to finish at 141.68. The National Share Commission's approval of the one-for-six, Dollars 65m share subscription in Electricidad saw the stock open at 292 bolivars, before slipping back 9 bolivars to close at 283. Brazil Sao Paulo dropped a further 4.1 per cent in light trading, led lower by a strong selling spree concentrated in the telecommunication, oil and electrical sectors. The Bovespa index finished 1,929 weaker at 45,080. Turnover totalled RDollars 267.7m (Dollars 316.4m), down 65 per cent from the previous session. Analysts said sentiment that November inflation is expected to rise in spite of a package of measures adopted by the government to contain consumption continued to prompt players to lighten positions.</p>

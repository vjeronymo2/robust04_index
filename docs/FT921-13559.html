			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / International Bonds: EC paper 'disappointingly small' TWO offerings in Ecu dominated the primary Eurobond market yesterday, although many traders' minds were still focused on the worsening state of the dollar sector. South Africa launched its expected Ecu bond issue, an Ecu250m five-year deal via Paribas. The deal, priced at an attractive spread to compensate for credit risk, appealed to continental retail investors, particularly in Germany. South Africa returned to the international capital markets last year, with a successful offer ing in the D-Mark sector. The European Community launched an Ecu190m seven-year deal via Warburg. The pricing of the deal was considered to be on the aggressive side, but strong demand for five-to-seven year Ecu paper, and appetite for the EC name, ensured reasonable demand. Dealers said the offering, like many EC deals which are onlent, was disappointingly small. In the Australian dollar sector, Swedish Export Credit launched a ADollars 300m three-year deal via Hambros Bank. The deal is the third in the sector to be structured as a global offering. In the dollar sector, Eurobond yield spreads remain wide, with corporate bonds generally under-performing sovereign and supranational paper. For example, ABB's four-year deal is now trading at a yield spread of 65 basis points above the Treasury yield curve, against 50 basis points at launch last week. The World Bank's 10-year global bond offering has also lost some ground. The deal is currently quoted at 9 basis points above the 10-year Treasury, compared with, at best, three basis points last week. However, the deal is still trading six basis points tighter than its launch spread. The Bank of Scotland has raised Dollars 230m of subordinated debt in the US market, through the SEC's rule 144A.</p>

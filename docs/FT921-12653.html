			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Letter: Why employers should have first call on any surplus in an occupational pension fund Sir, Mr Richard Clark's letter (January 17) leads me to comment that in the usual 'final salary' pension scheme it is the accrued pension benefits that are to be seen as deferred pay; not the fund which accumulates from the investment of contributions. Since the employees' contributions represent the first tranche of funding and the employer's obligation is to make up to the funding level necessary to meet those accrued benefits, the employer surely has the first call on any surplus, albeit that employers also frequently improve benefits under such circumstances. I would also suggest that there is a place for both personal pensions and company schemes, the main difference usually being that benefits from the former are not related to salary (and hence living standards) at the time of retirement. However, my main concern is that the arguments over pensions are progressively becoming more biased by socio-political beliefs. It needs to be emphasised that it is the security of pension funds that is of paramount importance. Other issues are surely of secondary concern.

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Arts: Twelfth Night WHAT the English Shakespeare Company mostly does is to tour, so Claire Lyth's trappings for its Twelfth Night are coolly plain and adaptable. A floor of green and gold tiles, some pretty, spidery screens, tall panels of curtains; moody lighting by Michael Bogdanov does the rest. Michael Pennington's production pretends not to be a 'production' at all, just the play itself played straight, with everything coming from the words  -and the songs too, which have a sharp dramatic point. Pennington tips his hand in a programme-note: he has definite, even tendentious readings of Shakespeare's characters and their situations. The players stick loyally to his recipes, and the net effect is a tonic: fresh, unblinking, direct. At some points it narrows the range of feeling in the comedy; but Twelfth Night has inexhaustible possibilities, and the specialised view here is quite happy enough to be going on with. Jenny Quayle's Viola (who speaks the verse better than anybody) is concerned with the 'lost' Sebastian, her twin and spirit-double. Whenever she remembers him, she grips one's heart - and after their rapt reunion, they go off embracing each other rather than their new partners. Her attraction to Michael Mueller's Orsino is an unexplained accident, and her romantic debacle with the gender-blind Olivia a minor inconvenience. Allie Byrne's Olivia is a crisp estate-manageress. For most of the play she deals with Viola-'Cesario'-Sebastian as with a raw junior. Like her gentlewoman Maria (Tracey Mitchell), she grows shrill in vehement passages, and her grip on the verse slackens. Malvolio (Timothy Davies) owes a great debt to John Cleese, but repays it with interest. Derek Smith's Uncle Toby is tough and truculent, more sour than roguish; Colin Farrell's jesting Feste offers authentic music-hall, practised routine with dead eyes. As for Sir Andrew Aguecheek, James Hayes' comic-cuts costume and wig make him a simple ass. The role of Clown has been redistributed, to the advantage of Sean Gilder's wry, friendly Fabian. Alan Cody brings a welcome, salty breath of passion to Antonio. For Sebastian himself, Vivian Munn's funny, boyish face and shy gaucherie twin him nicely with Viola, but scotch the virile contrast he should make. Richmond Theatre, box office (081)940 0088. In repertory to July 18.</p>

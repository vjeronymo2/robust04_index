			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Algerians to vote on new constitution ALGERIA'S acting head of state, Mr Ali Kafi, yesterday promised a referendum on the future of North Africa's largest country whose security forces have, for the past 12 months, been mired in ever bloodier confrontation with radical Islamic groups. The referendum would submit to the Algerian people a draft new constitution and seek their endorsement for a transitional arrangement before a new constitution was enacted. Mr Kafi promised that political parties would be invited to give their views on future strategy but added that 'all those who practised or supported violence' would be excluded. This was a clear reference to those Algerians who support the Islamic Salvation Front which was banned last February after Algerian leaders cancelled the second round of elections the party was poised to win. Other smaller Islamic parties such as Ennahda would, however, be asked to join in such talks. Mr Kafi is a founding member of the five-man High State Council (HCE) which has acted as the country's collective presidency since the former head of state, Mr Chadli Bendjedid, resigned a year ago. He has chaired the HCE since the slaying of Mr Mohamed Boudiaf, who returned last January from 28 years' exile in Morocco to become acting president. Mr Kafi did not suggest any precise date on which the referendum might be held, but most observers assume it is likely to take place later this year. The High State Council members have proclaimed on more than one occasion that they did not wish to hold office beyond December 1993, when Mr Chadli's third term of office was due to end, nor would any of them stand in any future presidential election. Meanwhile, the visit by Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, to Algiers last weekend, and Defence Minister Khaled Nezzar's present visit to Saudi Arabia, have helped to break the semi-quarantine the country's leaders have been held in since last January's events. Mr Dumas promised that France would 'express its friendship by other means than mere words'. This can be taken as a strong pointer that his government will extend a helping financial hand to a country whose foreign debt service ratio of 73 per cent leaves it scant room to import the raw materials necessary to increase industrial output.</p>

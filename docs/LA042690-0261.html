			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HE PLANS TO TURN SPORT INTO LEAGUE OF NATIONS;  </P> <P> VOLLEYBALL: EIGHT COUNTRIES COMPETING IN MIKE O'HARA'S EFFORT TO PUT SPOTLIGHT  ON ATHLETES IN NON-OLYMPIC YEARS.  </P> <P> Mike O'Hara, the sports promoter who helped develop the American Basketball  Assn., the World Hockey Assn. and professional track, has a vision:  </P> <P>  The United States is meeting the Soviet Union in the championship match of the  World (Volleyball) League and the Forum is sold out. A billion people, watching  on a worldwide TV network, see Scott Fortune hit the winning point for the U.S.  team.  </P> <P>  Hmm? Sounds as if O'Hara, a former UCLA volleyball star, got spiked in the  head one too many times. But they laughed when O'Hara devised the three-point  shot for the American Basketball Assn., the World Hockey Assn. began signing  underaged players such as Wayne Gretzky and Pro-Track started paying runners.  </P> <P> The ABA, WHA and Pro-Track were each making money when O'Hara left, and he  predicts that the World League, which begins play Sunday at the Forum, will  succeed.  </P> <P> "Of all the things I've been involved in, I've never seen a league that has  started with the credibility, experience and capital that this league has,"  O'Hara said. "Usually you sweat out the first year."  </P> <P> But O'Hara isn't sweating.  </P> <P> The World League has a $4-million budget, of which $3 million will be  underwritten by corporate sponsors and $1 million by TV contracts.  </P> <P> "The NBA didn't start out this well," O'Hara said. "The NFL didn't start out  this well. All those leagues started out real shaky, but people forget about  their humble beginnings."  </P> <P> Is the world ready for the World League?  </P> <P> It makes sense from a business and marketing standpoint. SportsChannel, which  will televise the U.S. matches, is a cable network hungry for quality  programming. And volleyball, which all but disappears in non-Olympic years,  needs the exposure.  </P> <P> Fortune, who hit the winning shot in the gold-medal match in the 1988 Olympics,  predicts success for the World League.  </P> <P> "I think it will be really big, especially in America," Fortune said. "The  world championships are big in a lot of countries, but Americans don't really  follow volleyball until the Olympics."  </P> <P> O'Hara has experience promoting volleyball, having run the Team Cup volleyball  league at the Forum since 1984. Team Cup matches average 2,000 fans with the  finals drawing 5,000. O'Hara hopes to expand on the base of Southland  volleyball fans.  </P> <P> Although the league has already met its budget, it could be be a hard sell in  Southern California because the six-week season, which runs from April to June,  conflicts with the NBA playoffs. Although the World League will move to the  summer next year, the initial season was set for this spring so it wouldn't  conflict with the World Cup soccer tournament.  </P> <P> "Even if we struggle this year, I think we'll be successful next year because  we won't be competing against the Lakers," said John Root, a member of the 1988  U.S. Olympic team. "All we have to do is go up against baseball."  </P> <P> O'Hara said: "The break-even point from a league standpoint has already been  assured. Each of the teams will look to gate receipts and local sponsorships.  The jury is still out on how we're going to do this year. I'd be delighted if  we broke even."  </P> <P> The brainchild of O'Hara and Laker owner Jerry Buss, the World League is  composed of the national volleyball teams from eight countries: the United  States, the Soviet Union, Brazil, China, France, Italy, Japan and the  Netherlands.  </P> <P> Sanctioned by the International Volleyball Federation, the league hopes to add  four teams next year: Cuba, Canada, Argentina and Poland.  </P> <P> The eight teams are divided into two divisions, with the United States grouped  with France, Italy and Brazil. Each team will play 12 matches, six home and six  away, during the season. The top two teams from each division will meet in a  four-match championship final in Osaka, Japan, July 14-15.  </P> <P> The teams will receive a total of $1 million in prize money. Teams receive  $1,500 for each match they win, $1,000 for each loss. The division champions  will receive $80,000, with second place worth $60,000, third place $40,000, and  fourth place $30,000. The playoff champion will win $140,000, with the  second-place team getting $110,000, the third-place team $80,000 and the  fourth-place team $60,000.  </P> <P> There are also individual prizes. The league's most valuable player will get  $15,000, with $10,000 prizes to be awarded the best spiker, best blocker, best  setter and best defensive player. The outstanding referee will receive $5,000.  </P> <P> Members of the U.S. volleyball team, who earn an average stipend of $1,500 per  month, like the league's monetary rewards.  </P> <P> The U.S. national team, which requires a full-time commitment, has been losing  its best players to Italian club teams, which offer six-figure salaries.  </P> <P> "The Italians have upped volleyball to a different level with the money they're  paying now," said Fortune. "It's real difficult for (the United States) to deal  with because we don't have the money or the sponsors to pay the players to stay  around instead of going to Italy."  </P> <P> The U.S. team is rebuilding after the retirement of Karch Kiraly and Steve  Timmons, who led the team to gold medals in the last two Olympics. Three other  players have left the national team to play in Italy: Jeff Stork, the starting  setter on the U.S. team since 1985; Bob Ctvrtlik, who was voted best defensive  player at the 1988 Olympics, and Adam Johnson, a former USC standout who was  voted 1986 NCAA player of the year.  </P> <P> Fortune, the youngest player on the 1988 U.S. Olympic team, and Root, a reserve  on that team, rejected offers from Italian teams to remain with the U.S. team.  </P> <P> How could that be?  </P> <P> "Some of us still have something to prove," Root said. "But in light of the  fact that they're (the United States Volleyball Federation) giving us the  option of going to Italy and coming back over (to join the 1992 Olympic team),  a lot of the guys are going to take advantage of that option."  </P> <P> Although Kiraly and Timmons were listed on the U.S. roster for the World  League, they will not compete this season.  </P> <P> "They were the heart and soul of the team," Fortune said. "I talked to Steve  and he said that before the U.S. became a good team they went through a real  difficult period, which is what we're going through now. We have a bunch of  young kids who are trying to come together as a team."  </P> <P> Said Root: "We have to find new players we can focus on and build a campaign  around. Scott and I have been around the longest and hopefully we can provide  the leadership that the coaches are looking for to bring the young guys  around."  </P> <P> Not all of the players are young.  </P> <P> With the departure of Stork, the U.S. team's biggest problem was finding an  experienced setter. The problem was solved by coaxing Rod Wilde out of  retirement. Wilde, 34, had coached at Pepperdine since suffering a leg injury  that knocked him out of the 1984 Games.  </P> <P> Wilde, who coached against many of the players on the team, is adjusting to  being a player again. He is 12 years older than the average age of the players.  </P> <P> The loss of Johnson also created a void at outside hitter, which will be filled  by Root, who has been used primarily as a middle blocker. The other starting  outside hitter is Troy Tanner, who led Pepperdine to NCAA titles in 1985 and  1986.  </P> <P> Fortune and Mark Arnold are expected to start at middle blocker, and Chris  Braun will start at opposite hitter.  </P> <P> The toughest competition in the United States' division is expected to come  from Italy, which won the 1989 European Championship and finished second behind  Cuba at the 1989 World Cup. The Soviet Union is favored in the other division.  </P></p>

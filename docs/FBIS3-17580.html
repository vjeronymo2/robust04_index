"I had a good rest, notwithstanding the fact that weather  was  rainy. I even played tennis and had swims in the sea, although  the water temperature was only 7-8 degrees. I worked for four  hours every day," Yeltsin told journalists before departure.    In response to questions as to what important matters await  him in Moscow, the president said: "We need to finalise work on  a mechanism for the enactment of the presidential message to the  Federal Assembly. I worked on it in Sochi, and a group of  experts did the same in Moscow. We shall now combine what has  been done and will discuss the mechanism together with the  Federal Assembly.    "Preparing an agreement on civil peace is also a matter to  which I attach much importance and which I was also preoccupied  with when in Sochi.    "I would like very much the agreement to be signed by all  parties, public associations, groups, factions, power bodies, by  the Federation Council, the State Duma, the government and the  president. This would bring about an auspicious and calm  situation throughout Russia", Yeltsin said.</p>

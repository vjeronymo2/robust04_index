			<p>BFN     [Text] Damascus, Syria June 1 (A.A.) -- A meeting of  conciliation held recently in Turkey between the representatives  of two rival northern Iraqi Kurdish groups was reported  successful today.    Jalal Talabani, Patriotic Union of Kurdistan leader,  described Monday's meeting [30 May] with Mas'ud Barzani,  Kurdistan Democratic Party [KDP] leader, as `very successful.'    However, representatives of the KDP claimed that their  problem was not discussed in full detail during the meeting.    Talabani told the Anatolian Agency in Damascus that claims  that they violated a May 17 truce with the KDP were not true.    `A joint agreement was made in Silopi to implement the  cease-fire,' Talabani said.    Talabani added that he would be happy to hold a planned  meeting with Barzani, in Turkey at the earliest opportunity.    KDP officials said that they wanted to bring an end to the  clashes in the region through democratic means and were hoping  that Talabani comes to their region to sit at the negotiating  table.</p>

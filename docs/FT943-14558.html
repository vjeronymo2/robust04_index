			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Status quo is proposed for Northumberland The Local Government Commission yesterday recommended that there should be no change in Northumberland's council structure. This is the first time this year the commission has recommended that a county's governing structure should remain intact, with no change to the two-tier system of districts and a county council. It said the county's sparse population was the main reason. Mrs Ann Levick, commissioner responsible for the area, said 48 per cent of people had supported unitary authorities - combining the functions of districts and counties - in principle, but 'when you give them something specific the principle fades slightly'. The commission also proposed yesterday that Northamptonshire county council should be abolished and split into three unitaries. These would be West Northamptonshire (merging the Daventry and South Northants districts); East Northamptonshire (merging Corby, East Northants, Kettering and Wellingborough); and Northampton. Start-up costs would be between Pounds 11m and Pounds 15m. These would be met 'over four years or less' by estimated annual savings of between Pounds 4m and Pounds 7m. An alternative of creating only two unitaries, merging Northampton with West Northants, would be cheaper, with annual savings of between Pounds 8m and Pounds 11m. Another option discussed by the commission was that of leaving the two-tier system intact, with the exception that Northampton should become a unitary borough. This would cost less to set up, at between Pounds 3m and Pounds 7m, but would generate few savings. In Northumberland one alternative - to abolish the county council and create two new unitaries - was proposed. One would cover the districts of Blyth Valley and Wansbeck in the county's southern industrial area. The other unitary authority would cover the rest, merging Alnwick, Berwick-upon-Tweed, Castle Morpeth and Tynedale. However, as the county and five of the districts support the status quo, this split is unlikely to happen. It would cost between Pounds 13m and Pounds 15m and generate annual savings of between Pounds 3m and Pounds 5m.</p>

			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Ferry port warns Pounds 7m loan vital for development PORTSMOUTH'S successful municipal ferry port could be in jeopardy if the government refuses its request to borrow Pounds 7m for expansion. The port needs to reclaim land, improve parking, port handling facilities and increase berths for the new super-ferries, if business is not to be lost to the trust port of Poole, Southampton and the Channel tunnel. The improvements would cost Pounds 20m by the end of the decade and Pounds 7m in the financial year 1994-95. Because the port is owned by the Portsmouth district council it is subject to constraints on local government spending and cannot borrow funds for capital spending without government approval. The port says the Ministry of Transport is cutting municipal ports' allocation in 1994-95 from Pounds 12m to Pounds 4m. Portsmouth's share would be Pounds 1m. About 255,000 freight vehicles a year use the port and the figure is growing by 20 per cent a year. With just under 3m passengers annually and 810,000 cars, Portsmouth is the second largest passenger terminal in the UK after Dover. The port fears that without the expansion its main users Brittany Ferries and P&amp;O Ferries could move elsewhere. Rear Admiral Tony George, port manager, said: 'The developments are vital if we are to expand. The new ferries which are coming on stream are like hotels. We have also to improve our freight marshalling facilities if the tunnel is not to take our business.' The port is scheduled to make an operating surplus of more than Pounds 3m this year from revenues of Pounds 14m. This goes to the district council and if the government continues to refuse extra funds, some of it could be used on the port.</p>

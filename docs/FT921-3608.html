			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: A fragile banking system takes root - Leyla Boulton examines Russian efforts to strengthen the domestic credit system in the face of inflation and political and economic instability For the casual visitor to Moscow, a proliferation of commercial banks would appear the most tangible sign that a market economy is taking root in Russia. With names such as 'Credobank' to inspire confidence, they promise big returns on investment and aspire to respectability with support for charity and the arts. But after 74 years of socialism under which, as one central banker put it, 'money was not money and credit was not credit', emerging commercial banks have a long way to go before they can provide the same sort of service as their western counterparts. The domestic credit system is in a mess. 'Our commercial banks are not capable of extending a loan with a maturity of more than 12 months,' said Mr Dimitry Tulin, deputy chairman of the Russian central bank. 'Inflationary expectations are very high and there is political and economic instability. Without investment credit, the economy cannot really exist.' Domestic lending to enterprises comes mainly from state-owned commercial banks. These banks' assets are likely to deteriorate over time, since their loans were more like state subsidies than commercial advances. Their problems are compounded by the fact that many of the banks are heavily exposed to a single borrower, whom they were set up to serve exclusively. This leaves the state the choice of allowing the enterprises to go bust or continuing to support the banks. The other category of commercial banks in Russia - the emerging private institutions - prefer to lend their money to other banks, lucrative joint ventures with foreign capital, or new-style commodity exchanges, rather than make long-term commitments to future industrial production. To get round this problem, Mr Alexander Titkin, the industry minister, said the government would soon offer tax incentives for commercial institutions to invest in industry. Russian officials would also like to see the direct involvement of foreign banks in the Russian banking market. Although most banks have long had representative offices in Moscow, only one so far, France's Credit Lyonnais, which had branches in Moscow and St Petersburg before the 1917 Revolution, has established a banking subsidiary in Russia. Another bank, International Moscow Bank, is a joint venture with 40 per cent foreign capital, established a year ago. Generally, foreign banks are staying well clear, scared off in part by the recent crash of Vnesheconombank, the state bank responsible for servicing the former USSR's foreign debt of more than Dollars 60bn. But they do not appear to have written the country off altogether. The efforts to build a banking system, though, are being hindered in part by a lack of adequate banking supervision. Mr Tulin said: 'We don't even believe in our ability to supervise properly. We are pretty sure we wouldn't be ready to read a balance sheet even in our headquarters. 'We desperately need qualified people,' he added. sia with some of the right qualifications is Mr Nikolai Domanov, the 32-year-old chief of the Russian central bank's supervisory department, who spent half of last year being trained at central banks abroad. He wants to present to parliament a special law on banking supervision, giving the central bank the unquestioned authority to lay down the rules. Mr Domanov has begun talks with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank on help in drafting new rules for the Russian banking system, including measures to protect depositors. He also plans to introduce western accounting standards so that the accounts of Russian banks are closer to reflecting the true value of assets. One focus for many of the efforts to strengthen the Russian commercial banking system is the planned Development and Project Finance Bank (DPFB) in Moscow, to be financed jointly by Russian commercial banks and international organisations such as the World Bank. Organisers of the project, based at the headquarters of the now-defunct Soviet central bank, are also hoping to attract shareholders among western banks. The aim of the DPFB, expected to start up in the first quarter of next year, is to spread skills on risk-assessment, collateral and market analysis, and to act as a catalyst for the provision of domestic project-finance funds. The Development and Project Finance Bank could provide a half-way house for western banks cautious about investing in Russia, but which would like a safe foothold in the market just in case it takes off. Another role will be to act as a conduit for the distribution of development funds from the World Bank and other shareholders which are expected to include the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Commission. Mr Sergei Konychev, the Russian banker who thought up the idea for the DPFB and is helping to organise it, said the bank would require an initial capital of Dollars 100m and a few billion roubles (the exact figure is difficult to predict because of uncertainties about what the rouble will be worth next year). Ten Russian commercial banks have agreed to provide the rouble funds for the bank and may be persuaded to become shareholders.</p>

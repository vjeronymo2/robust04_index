			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> KOCH SHOOTS 67 TO TAKE LEAD; RAIN ENDS PLAY  </P> <P> Gary Koch shot a 67 Friday to take a one-stroke lead over Mark O'Meara after  two rounds of the rain-delayed USF&amp;G tournament at New Orleans.  </P> <P> Rain delayed play for two hours and forced suspension of the second round with  23 golfers on the course.  </P> <P> They were scheduled to finish their rounds today before the start of the third  round.  </P> <P> Koch, who finished Thursday's first round a stroke off the lead at 70, parred  his first three holes Friday, then made the first of his five birdies on the  par-4 13th hole, his fourth of the day.  </P> <P> He was at seven-under-par 137 after two rounds.  </P> <P> O'Meara, one of four tied at 69 after Thursday's first round, shot another 69  Friday, overcoming a poor front nine with a 30 on the back side.  </P> <P> First-day leaders Brian Tennyson and Steve Elkington shot 70s Friday and were  tied with Corey Pavin at 139. Pavin shot a 67 Friday.  </P> <P> Fred Funk, one of the four first-day leaders, was among those still on the  course when play was suspended because of darkness. He was four under after 14  holes.  </P> <P> Curt Byrum shot a 66, the best round of the tournament, and was in a six-way  tie at 142. He completed his round during particularly bad weather in the  morning.  </P> <P> Tournament director Tommy Wulff said it was just typical New Orleans springtime  weather.  </P> <P> "It seems like if there's a tournament in New Orleans, and it's the Classic,  there's going to be rain," Wulff said.  </P> <P> "I can't remember a tournament where there hasn't been rain some time in the  week."  </P> <P> Frank Beard, battling wind and rain at Stonebriar Country Club in Frisco, Tex.,  shot a six-under par 66 to take the first-round lead in the Murata Reunion  Pro-Am. Two shots back were Bobby Nichols and Walt Zembriski.  </P></p>

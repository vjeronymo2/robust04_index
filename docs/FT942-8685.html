			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Sizing up the Fed Not long ago a half point rise in US interest rates would have provided secure support for the dollar. The currency's weakness yesterday shows the Federal Reserve is caught in a painful vice. It might have hoped that the prospect of a hiatus in rate rises would calm the bond market. Yet on the other side of the Atlantic financial markets are starting to take note of Germany's incipient recovery. Notwithstanding yesterday's cut in the Bundesbank's repurchase rate, the trough in German rates is now expected earlier. The prospective growth and interest rate differential has moved back in favour of the D-Mark. A weak dollar, though, is hardly a tonic for US bonds. Coupled with the fear that the Fed may still tighten further if the recovery remains robust, that thought was enough to reverse the initial satisfaction with which markets greeted Tuesday night's apparently decisive move. There can be no certainty that US rates have stopped rising until the economy has clearly slowed. Even then higher short-term rates may be needed to prop up the dollar and encourage overseas funds back into Treasury bonds. Such a prospect holds little comfort for global equities which remain in the shadow of bonds. Only in continental Europe, which is further behind in the cycle, is there much support left to come from earnings recovery. The UK market must be feeling increasingly uncomfortable after yesterday's earnings data. The Fed's example shows how difficult it is for central banks to manage the turn in rates.</p>

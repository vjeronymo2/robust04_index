			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Energy efficiency 'unlikely to rise' The government's plan to liberalise the domestic gas and electricity markets later this decade is unlikely to result in greater energy efficiency, says a report from the Energy Savings Trust and the Gas Consumers Council. The report's authors found in a survey that consumers and suppliers were sceptical about the concept of energy services packages, which are meant to meet customers' needs 'through efficient energy production and supply, and improved end-use energy efficiency'. The report concludes: 'Customers are sceptical about energy efficiency or energy services, or lack an understanding of the concept.' The survey also found that three-quarters of energy suppliers believed that competition would be based on prices. Most dismissed the notion that energy-efficiency packages would be a big feature of the competitive energy market, at least in the initial stages of liberalisation. One independent gas company said: 'Things will change as competition becomes more fierce and companies look to add value. But this is a long way off. For now the com-petition is about unit price.' The report recommends that the government and energy industry regulators continue to intervene in the market when it is fully opened to competition in 1998 to ensure that 'energy efficiency is not relegated to the sidelines'. It says any measures taken to reduce the market dominance of British Gas or the regional electricity companies should not hinder the ability of suppliers to offer a range of services and different energy supplies on a single contract and charge for them on one bill.

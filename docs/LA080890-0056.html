			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. NEIL SOLOMON: DORMANT VIRUS  </P> <P> Question: My brother has come down with shingles. I realize this is not major  news, but he never had chickenpox, and I'm positive I've been told that you're  not supposed to be able to get shingles unless you first had chickenpox.  </P> <P> Is there an explanation for this? And why does one depend on the other?  </P> <P> Answer: It is true that a person can't have shingles (herpes zoster) without  first having had chickenpox. In your brother's case, I can only guess that he  must have had chickenpox, but no one realized it at the time. This would be  possible, for example, if he had the virus but no clinical symptoms.  </P> <P> Once a child is infected with the varicella zoster virus, which causes both  chickenpox and shingles, he remains infected with it. Following a case of  chickenpox, the virus lies dormant. Why it remains latent and why it becomes  reactivated are not known. What is known is that the incidence of shingles  increases with age, and seldom occurs before middle age.  </P></p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Arts: Dance into a world of illusions /  Review of 'Antic' given its first London showing on Thursday night at Sadler's Wells - Kim Brandstrup identifies what led him to make this danced version of Hamlet. Not narrative, but 'what lies behind the words'. This has also been Brandstrup's concern in such significant pieces as his Peer Gynt and The Dybbuk, and may be understood in Mysteries, his commentary on Duke Bluebeard's Castle. Brandstrup's vision is refined, potent. His theatre is - thanks in part to what Karsavina called 'blessed poverty' - one where every effect is reduced to its mechanical or physical essence, and, like the dance, resonates with meaning. This is what I find so convincing about his work, and it is what makes Antic fascinating and powerful. As with Noh, or with the theatre dreamed of by Edward Gordon Craig, we enter a world of allusions, symbols. Appearances are essences; less is superbly more. And in Antic - as with his exquisite Orfeo for London Contemporary Dance - Brandstrup has looked to an earlier theatre form as frame for his choreography. (And he has been joined by the same magnificent Orfeo collaborators: Craig Givens for design; Ian Dearden for score; Tina MacHugh for lighting, who share Brandstrup's imaginative subtlety and economy). Antic owes certain of its attitudes to the 17th century Trauerspiel of Northern Europe, a melange of sentiment and melodrama. Craig Givens sets the stage with grand simplicity by means of panels of almost spectral tapestry, with chairs, a table, the only properties. Costuming is of the period, sombre save for warm earthy shades for three actors in the play scene. The 'look' is austere, very beautiful. And Tina MacHugh lights this world with ideal sensitivity to every dramatic point. Ian Dearden's score mixes electronic and instrumental sound to provide music both atmospheric and sustaining of the action. Like the choreography, it adjusts exactly to the idea of a baroque style re-cast for today. The choreography is that subtext Branstrup has discerned behind Shakespeare's words. Passions, motives, emotional unease, are exposed in dancing that is impressive in its perceptions as in its ability to explore feeling. We may identify incident and characterisation from the play - the closet scene; Polonius' death; Ophelia's madness - but more significantly, we are taken into the minds or memories of the characters, and see how obsessions repeat, how psychic wounds remain open, how Hamlet's sufferings hedge him in. Images are everywhere sure, vivid: the mad Ophelia moving from one frozen pose to another; Hamlet circling the stage in a swirl of action that tells of his indecisions; Claudius arranging the seated Gertrude in a pose, as he has earlier placed Ophelia; Hamlet, at the last, held like a child on the shoulders of his ghost Father. Branstrup's theatre is compact of such memorable dynamics and such visual coups. There are excellent performances from the ten members of Arc Dance: Jeremy James as Hamlet; Mark Ashman and Souli Yates as Claudius and Gertrude; Joanna O'Keeffe as Ophelia; Norman Douglas, Andrew Titcombe, David Scinto, Joy Constantinides, Daniel Belton, Patrick Mahoney. They provide ensemble playing of rare sensitivity. Antic was made possible by sponsorship from the Stanley Thomas Johnson Foundation; Daniel Katz; the Leche Trust; the Mathilda and Terence Kennedy Charitable Trust. It is lamentable that Branstrup's company does not receive full funding from the Arts Council. I would urge Arc Dance to the attention of commercial sponsors: Brandstrup's serious and beautiful work stands in splendid contrast to the mediocrity and vulgarity that is so industriously promoted and bank-rolled as modern dance in this country by official bodies. Antic receives its last performance tonight at Sadler's Wells Theatre</p>

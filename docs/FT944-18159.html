			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Strike tomorrow as Tube talks fail Talks between the RMT transport union and London Underground aimed at averting a Tube strike were abandoned last night without agreement and with no plans to reconvene, Richard Donkin writes. The union had already given notice of plans to hold a 24-hour strike among its 8,000 London Underground members starting tomorrow at 7.30pm. The RMT members who work as station staff, signallers and train drivers have rejected a 2.5 per cent pay offer which London Underground says is final. The company is expected to run more than half the normal number of trains if the strike goes ahead. The other five unions whose members work on the Underground have accepted the 2.5 per cent offer.</p>

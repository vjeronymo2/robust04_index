			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / European Property 9: Problematic issue of land restitution - Czechoslovakia / Confusion over land ownership is putting off western developers WHILE the majority of the former eastern bloc countries have decided to pay cash compensation to owners of land nationalised under communism, Czechoslovakia has taken the bold decision to attempt to restore land to its pre-1948 owners wherever possible. The last deadline set for submission of claims from former owners came and went late last year and some properties have now been restored. However, few of the new owners have yet carried out all the necessary formalities to enable them to prove title, according to surveyors Jones Lang Wootton. Indeed, the whole area of restitution of land is still 'problematic', says Mr Mark Heighton of solicitors Mcffenna &amp; Co. One of the possible problems is that in many cases there are likely to have been several claims to the same piece of land. Resulting squabbles could take years to resolve. In addition, says Mr Stephen McGairl of solicitors Freshfields' Paris office, restitution rights are limited to Czech residents - leading to not a little understandable ill feeling from some expatriate Czechs. And, although there is an official state property register, it has been poorly maintained over the years and is not reliable. This confused situation regarding land ownership is proving discouraging to potential western investors and developers. Another discouraging factor is the country's capital city itself. Prague offers few opportunities for new development. It is an exceptionally beautiful city, planning is tightly controlled - and demolition of existing buildings is highly unlikely. However, in common with the other former eastern bloc capitals, Prague suffers from an acute shortage of office space of the standard required by western companies. Rents of up to DM80 a sq m a month are being asked and in some cases being achieved. But it is doubtful if this level is sustainable in the longer term, says Jones Lang Wootton. More realistically, top rents in refurbished buildings are about DM60 a sq m a month, although a prime modern building - if such a thing existed - could command more. There is considerable interest in proposals to develop the city's main railway station next to the parliament building and Wenceslas Square. The state railway arranged for a development competition which again was keenly contested. The name of the selected developer should be announced shortly. French contractor CBC has acquired a large site known as Karline behind the new Atrium Hotel and a French and Dutch consortium has taken an option on a large urban renewal site, Smikov, adjoining the river. This latter deal has, however, raised eyebrows because no development competition or competitive tender was held. The citizens of Prague do not wish to be seen selling off the family silver too cheaply. Given the problems of the city centre, a few developers are now looking to peripheral locations. A new office development on the main access route from Prague's airport is due to start in April. To be known as Furopean Plaza, it will consist of a total of 18,000 sq m and will be built in three phases. The first phase of 6,000 sq m is due for completion in the late summer or autumn of next year. Finance for the development is being provided by a consortium of Austrian and Swiss banks and private individuals. UK architect YRM is also making an equity contribution. Joint letting agents Healey &amp; Baker and Ryden &amp; Partners consider that the new buildings - complete with obligatory central atrium - will prove attractive to international companies because they will offer a similar quality and type of environment to that from which they operate in other countries. Prague has seen an enormous growth in the number of visitors over the past two years - tourists as well as those looking to do business or to assess the business possibilities. And hotel development has been a feature in Prague as it has been in Budapest, Warsaw and Moscow. Leading international hotel operators have been to spot the potential of a market where room rates are high, as are occupancy levels, while labour costs are low - and hotel bills are payable in hard currency.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- ADDITIONAL PROPERTY COSTS  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Landlords costs in letting  Agents fees: 15 per cent-20 per cent of a building               of first years's rent Legal fees: variable  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Tenants costs in leasing    Agents fees: 15-20 per cent of first year's of a building               rent Legal fees: variable  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Sale costs by investor      Agents fees: 2 per cent-6 per cent or owner/occupier           Legal fees: variables  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Purchase costs by investor  Agents fees: 2 per cent-6 per cent or owner/occupier           Legal fees: variable  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Healey &amp; Baker  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

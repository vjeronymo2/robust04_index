During the  discussion, it was pointed out that the Russian Constitution  makes no provision for the existence of constitutional courts in  the republics.    It is interesting that, during the nine months of its  existence, the Constitutional Court of Mordovia considered only  three matters, while 44 million rubles of budget funds were  spent on maintaining the court.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Al-Shal's Weekly Economic Report: Kuwait Might </F> Resort To Liquidating Some of Its Foreign Assets"]    [Text] "Al-Shall's Weekly Economic Report" surmised that  hearing the embezzlement case of the Kuwaiti oil tanker company  in court would pave the way for some movement on the question of  Kuwaiti investments abroad. The report referred to a news story  in the British newspaper, THE SUNDAY TIMES, about Kuwait's  effort to liquidate part of its foreign assets ($3.6 billion a  year) so that it can meet its debt obligations. The report  indicated that "the news story was prompted by the fact that the  first payment on the $5.5-billion loan to the international  financial markets had become due." The report stressed that  Kuwait could resort to liquidating some of its foreign assets  every now and then. The text of the report follows:  <H5>  The Discount Rate </H5>   The Central Bank of Kuwait announced for the fourth time  this  year, 1993, that it was lowering the discount rate by half a  percentage point: from 6.25 to 5.75 percent. The Central Bank of  Kuwait had lowered the discount rate last April from 7.5 to 5.7  percent, and it had lowered it in July from 7 to 6.75 percent,  and again in September, to 6.25 percent.    We still believe that the bank's conduct has been proper and  consistent with the trend in the advanced world of lowering  discount rates to stimulate growth rates while inflation rates  are still under control.    The full benefit of lowering the discount rate could be  achieved if the Central Bank were to forgo its intervention to  set limits on interest-rate ceilings on deposits and loans.  Market forces can thus be permitted to interact, and banks would  be able to discriminate among their clients so they can realize  a higher profit margin. This is possible because the low cost of  borrowing as an incentive to borrowers and a stimulant for  growth is not one of the primary considerations in making a  lower discount rate in Kuwait beneficial. On the other hand,  lowering the discount rate could reduce the reliance of banks on  public financing.    It is known that in 1992 the Kuwaiti Government paid more  than 300 million Kuwaiti dinars [KD] to local banks in interest  on hard currency bonds, and it may have paid another KD140  million Kuwaiti approximately for treasury bonds and  certificates. The government's domestic debt amounts to KD7.4  billion Kuwaiti ($25 billion). It is believed that the debt  figure was reduced by about KD1 billion Kuwaiti as a result of  the fact that KD1 billion Kuwaiti from hard currency bonds were  paid to extinguish the debt. The fact that the discount rate  fell by about 1.75 percent during the current year and the  reduction in the magnitude of the debt in Kuwaiti dinars will  reduce obligations from public funds arising from interest  payments made on the debt. That could result in a slight  reduction in current and anticipated public budget deficits.  <H5>  Foreign Investments </H5>   The London newspaper, THE SUNDAY TIMES, published a news  story about Kuwait's efforts to liquidate some of its foreign  assets so that it could have $3.6 billion a year to meet its  needs and its foreign currency debt obligations. The  determination of that amount seems to have been the result of  the fact that the due date for the first payment of the $5.5  billion loan was approaching. Kuwait had borrowed that amount  from money markets worldwide after the liberation. Although we  believe that Kuwait may have to liquidate some its assets every  now and then unless it deals with the problem of the budget  deficit by controlling spending and laying the foundations for  increasing the volume of nonoil revenues and reducing the  government's role in economic activity, there is no policy, to  our knowledge, for the gradual liquidation of foreign assets.  There may be some resistance to these piecemeal liquidation  procedures, but the reorganization of the Foreign Investments  Department actually guarantees the survival of the London  office. That reorganization makes the office dedicated to its  specialization in liquid investments. The need for some  liquidity or for having some investments moved from one market  to another may have been behind the news story in the British  newspaper.    Kuwait's Council of Ministers may conclude this week its  review of the government's report on progress in confronting  investment problems and the uncertainty about infringement on  the effort that is being made to confront those problems. There  is a general feeling that the measures which should be taken  about investments are not being taken because investments  involve the inviolability of public funds during the time of  occupation, and an infringement on public funds has political,  social, and moral consequences. We believe, however, that this  is an extremely complicated and sensitive issue for anyone  dealing with it for the first time. We believe that we have to  wait for the government's report on this issue. The movement of  the entire case may lie in having the embezzlement case in the  Oil Tankers Company presented in court soon.</p>

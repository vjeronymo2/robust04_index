			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Intolerable `Drug Enforcement Agency'"] </F>   [Text] If there is -- as there is in reality -- an  agreement between our government and the United States  authorizing the presence and activities in Bolivia of an  organization whose mission is the struggle against illegal  drugs, the least that should be demanded from it is legality and  transparency in its operations. The country has the right to  know the name of the DEA director, where his office is, who his  immediate aides are, and, above all, demand that his  investigative methods abide by the country's current juridical  order.    But nothing like that happens. In the eyes of the Bolivian  people, the DEA is a mysterious and clandestine organization.  Not even the chief of its national counterpart -- the FELCN  [Special Antinarcotics Force] -- gave the name of the individual  responsible for that organization. It has been learned that the  DEA uses methods of intimidation and control over telephone  lines, and through them control over private conversations. It  has "safe houses" where, according to reiterated denunciations,  physical and psychological torture are used to get the testimony  of those under arrest, and where it can arrest any citizen going  over judicial formalities.    We know the DEA has the delicate mission of fighting drug  trafficking, and because drug trafficking is a clandestine and  illegal activity, its operations and personnel must be protected  with some degree of confidentiality. The National Police and the  FELCN also have that mission but their chiefs show their faces  because their task is legal, and any action they commit is  subject to the judgment of the people and the verdict of  judicial officials.    The methods used by the DEA in its operations are very  different. To start with, as more than one Bolivian jurist said,  that foreign organization uses methods that, if legal in its  country, are not in our country. Kidnapping, for example, which  according to the U.S. Supreme Court is admissible in some cases,  continues to be prohibited in our legislation and is considered  a crime even if the reason is to fight another crime. The same  situation is valid for the presumption of innocence, which is  the basic principle sustained in our entire juridical structure  in contrast to the presumption of guilt used by that  organization.    Another aspect that needs rectification is the one used by  the DEA that consists of offering all types of rewards --  including reduction of sentence or acquittal -- if a witness  offers testimony or evidence against another. Our juridical  system rejects this method, and it is against our tradition and  convictions. If this method is used in more developed countries  than ours it is their responsibility, but we don't have to  accept it.    What exists in essence is what the president of the Republic  dramatically stated in his latest public speech, when he said  our dependency is "terrible." And it is precisely that adjective  that makes it intolerable because dependency in the broad sense  exists in any country in the world, including the United States,  which in some way "depends" commercially on Japan. But we cannot  continue widening that gap; we should reduce it, and any effort  in this regard deserves the support of all the people.    Therefore, it would be good for a branch like the  legislative  to thoroughly investigate the activities of that foreign agency,  and to put it under strict legality with the possibility of  annulling the agreement that authorized its presence in the  country. If political organizations and the media provide full  support, this will no longer be a utopian situation.</p>

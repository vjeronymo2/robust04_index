Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> BRAZIL'S COLLOR UNHURT IN CRASH  </P> <P> Brazil's daredevil president, Fernando Collor de Mello, had a slight car  accident here Sunday, Brazilian newspapers reported today.  </P> <P> O Globo, a pro-Collor newspaper in Rio de Janeiro, published a photo on its  front page of a white Kombi that collided with a car driven by the president.  </P> <P> It quoted the Kombi's driver, Geraldo Reis, as blaming Collor for the crash.  </P> <P> Newspapers said the president turned to the right without warning and the Kombi  following behind him crashed into the back of his car. The reports said Collor  did not stop after the accident, which slightly injured two people in the  Kombi.  </P> <P> Collor has gained his daredevil reputation by piloting a jet, riding a  motorcycle and diving in a submarine among other exploits since he took over  the presidency in March.  </P></p>

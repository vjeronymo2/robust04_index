			<p>BFN     [Text] The JKLF [Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front]  president, Mr. Yasin Malik, had a narrow escape in a murderous  attack on his life by the militants of rival group Hizbul  Mojahedin in Srinagar today. Mr. Malik told a press conference  that the militants of Hizbul Mojahedin tried to kidnap him from  SMHS Hospital in Srinagar, but his supporters foiled the  attempt. The Hizbul Mojahedin then fired several rounds toward  Malik, but he escaped unhurt as the people surrounded him.    The attack on Mr. Malik comes in the wake of the killing of  three top functionaries of JKLF by Hizbul Mojahedin since last  night. Mr. Malik held a demonstration against these killings  and over 10,000 people participated in the procession, which  raised slogans against Pakistan and Hizbul Mojahedin militants.</p>

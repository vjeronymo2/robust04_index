			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Need for light over Europe yet already, over Europe, a pall of pessimism seems to be descending. To the problem-racked countries of eastern Europe, the western half of the continent is starting to look less like a beacon of light, more like a rock against which hopes founder. Beset by their own difficulties of slow growth and rising unemployment, the established European democracies are not doing enough to buttress the countries which after 1989-90 broke free from communism. The main EC members, Germany, Britain, France and Italy, are for a mixture of political and economic reasons entering a phase of introspection and indecisiveness, just at the time when global vision and leadership are required. The US during the next few months will have its ear cocked to the hue and cry of domestic politics. But Europe must not see US preoccupation with the hustings as an excuse for inaction. European problems require European solutions. If Europe's leaders fail to produce results, they cannot complain about growing American jibes at European impotence. There are three reasons for the setbacks: lack of preparation, lack of generosity, and lack of competence. Into the first category falls the EC's dithering over the Yugoslav war. By unlucky coincidence, an intractable crisis on the Community's borders has coincided with an upsurge in its ambitions of assuming a post-cold war defence role. The EC's inability to prevent the apparent carve-up of Bosnia must inevitably lower those ambitions, or at least postpone their realisation until the EC has mustered the political consensus to support a common foreign and security policy worthy of the name. After-shocks The EC's economic treatment of the former Soviet Union and eastern bloc comes into the second category. The Community's external trade barriers discriminate against the goods which countries like Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia are most adept at producing; and - with the exception of Germany - it has failed to provide the financial resources needed to dampen the after-shocks of communism's collapse. In the third area of shortcomings, EC governments agreed at Maastricht a far-reaching treaty on political and monetary union without having properly explained the implications for national electorates. The rethinking almost everywhere in the Community is welcome, and may, depending on how the French vote in next month's referendum, end up salvaging the treaty. However, part of the Maastricht rationale - along with the desire to fit larger Germany into a new European framework - was to present unity in western Europe as an antidote to instability in the east. Unfortunately, to the reality of fission in the east has now been added the threat of western fragmentation. Balkan refugees Britain, as a seasoned international operator taking the Community chair at a taxing time, has the task of steering the Community through the shoals. It is too early for a considered judgment on the UK's presidency. But, so far, the British government has shown a greater predilection for advancing its own interests than for encouraging an atmosphere for effective joint decision-making. One example would be its cautious reaction to calls from Germany for greater equality in sharing burdens caused by the Balkan refugees. There is a need both for principled leadership and for a spirit of compromise in which national goals can be put aside in pursuit of overriding aims. Mr John Major is still a long way from showing that he can fulfil the expectations vested in him; the 'flow of ideas' across Europe which his foreign secretary claims is turning in Britain's favour may end up causing them considerable difficulty. Western Europe will not properly cure its malaise until there is a pronounced upturn in the economy. That will not happen quickly. In the meantime, if governments look over their national parapets, they will recognise an urgent need for action to shape Europe's common interests. The Community aspires to the ranking of a global political player. If it fails now, at a pivotal moment of challenge in its own backyard, it will have tarnished the idea of concerted action by west European governments.</p>

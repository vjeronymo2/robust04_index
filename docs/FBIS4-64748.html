			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ulrich Rosenbaum report: "Scharping's Cabinet Casts a </F> Shadow"]    [Text] When the SPD [Social Democratic Party] holds its  marathon five-hour party congress in Halle/Saale on 22 June, one  topic will not be on the agenda -- the composition of the shadow  cabinet. For Scharping, this is not just a question of proper  timing, but also a question of principle. Just as the  chancellor decides on the guidelines of policy, so too will  Scharping as shadow chancellor decide on people, and when these  people should be presented to the public.    Scharping will not name his shadow cabinet until the second  half of August, following a brief vacation in southwest France  (President Mitterrand has already invited him for a tour in a  jeep). Whether public opinion will be amazed is an open  question, for Scharping has suggested several times that he will  reward those who have proven themselves in his government  program commission. Only one thing has been certain for the  past week: Transportation expert Christoph Zoepel is no longer  on Scharping's list.    The following can expect seat reservations in an SPD-led  government: Oskar Lafontaine (finance and industry), Ulrich  Mauer (internal affairs), Rudolf Dressler (social affairs),  Hans-Ulrich Klose (foreign affairs or defense), and Peter Glotz  (currently responsible for the entire future sphere of  education, science, communications, and the media). Contrary to  earlier considerations, Scharping has decided not to form an  independent European Affairs Ministry; European policy is to be  coordinated with a strong personality in the chancellery, such  as Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul. However, a Ministry of Female  Affairs, or at least "a separate slot for female issues," is  planned, even though Scharping wants to cut the number of  ministries from 18 to 15. The Ministry for Post and  Telecommunications will be abolished. Wolfgang Thierse, whom  several persons would like to see as the new Bundestag  president, is considered an "Ossi" worthy of the rank of  minister; the idea of "Ministry for Eastern Reconstruction" is  not yet extinct.    Contrary to earlier hasty reports, it is far from certain  whether faction general manager Peter Struck will be new faction  chief if the SPD wins the elections. He would be an ideal  Chancellery Office chief for Scharping. Scharping's current  efficient chief of the Office of the Minister-President in  Mainz, Karl-Heinz Klaer, who is also being considered for the  Chancellery Office post, must remain in Mainz to guarantee a  continuity under Scharping's successor Kurt Beck. Too great is  the worry that the majority in Rhineland-Palatinate could be  wasted in 1996.    Scharping's predecessor, Bjoern Engholm, tried to win over  Karl-Otto Poehl for Scharping's team. The former Bundesbank  president said he had spoken to Scharping, but evidently without  success. Poehl knows where the power in Bonn lies; in the  Finance Ministry, not the Economics Ministry. But Lafontaine  also knows this. Poehl has also not responded to the compromise  offer of including monetary policy among the Economics  Ministry's responsibilities, not yet in any case.</p>

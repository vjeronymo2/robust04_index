			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / FT Law Report: Travel rescue fund must be paid back to banks GIROZENTRALE UND BANK DER OESTERREICHISCHEN SPARKASSEN AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT &amp; OTHERS v THE TOSG TRUST FUND LTD Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Parker, Lord Justice Mustill and Lord Justice McCowan): January 28 1992 A TRUST fund incorporated by an association of tour operators to assist customers of failed members must repay bonded sums obtained from banks on the undertaking that monies not spent in exercise of the fund's powers would be returned, in so far as they are used outside those powers to assist customers of non- members, including a member's subsidiaries, in respect of which no bond monies were received. The Court of Appeal so held when allowing an appeal by the plaintiffs, Girozentrale und Bank der Oesterreichischen Sparkassen Atkiengelsellschaft and eight other banks, from a decision of Judge Diamond QC sitting as a deputy High Court judge, that the defendant, the Tosg Trust Fund Ltd, was entitled to use money advanced by the banks for purposes other than in connection with claims against members of the Tour Operators' Study Group. LORD JUSTICE PARKER said that on March 8 1991 administrators were appointed of a company called ILG Travel, a subsidiary of International Leisure Group (ILG). Travel had a subsidiary, Quest Leisure Group, which had a subsidiary, Skiscope Direct. ILG, which was a holding company, had a further subsidiary, ILG Leisure. Travel and the other companies all carried on business as tour operators. The result of appointing administrators for Travel was that Pounds 63.2m became payable to Tosg Trust Fund under a bond dated September 28 1989 as amended by a deed dated March 26 1990. The money was duly paid on March 11 1991. The bond was made between the Fund and 14 banks or financial institutions. The plaintiffs were nine of the 14. Tosg Trust Fund was incorporated in 1970 by members of an unincorporated association known as the Tour Operators Study Group (Tosg), the affairs of which were regulated by a set of rules. It was formed in 1967 by 24 of the largest tour operators. The bond was obtained under a facility agreement dated September 29 1986 between Travel (then known as Intasun Holidays) and ILG and the banks and financial institutions. Recital (B) of the bond stated that it covered 'the following companies, . . . all of which are tour operators and are members of the same group'. It set out one company only, namely Travel, followed by 33 names, none of which were legal entities but, save three, were names under which Travel traded. Three were names under which ILG Leisure traded but Travel did not. Clause 6 of the bond provided that in consideration of issue of the bond, 'the Fund hereby covenants . . . that upon payment of the bonded sum by the obligors to the Fund, the Fund will undertake in writing . . . that the Fund will repay . . . on demand, such part of the bonded sum as shall not be expended . . . in the performance and the execution of the rights, duties, powers and discretions set out in the Fund's memorandum and articles of association . . . ' On March 13 1991 the Fund gave the undertaking required by that clause. Thereafter the banks became aware that the Fund was using the amount paid under the bond to assist customers not only of Travel but also of ILG Leisure, Quest and Skiscope, all three of which had, like Travel, suffered financial failure. The banks considered that that was not a permissible use of bond monies. They issued a writ on July 12, claiming inter alia an injunction to restrain the Fund from expending the bonded sum other than in connection with claims by Travel customers, and a declaration that it was not entitled to do so. Judge Diamond QC sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge held that the Fund was entitled to make payments in respect of the challenged claims. As a result the banks' claim failed and the action was dismissed. The banks now appealed. In Barclays Bank Ltd v TOSG Trust Fund (1984) BCLC 153 the issues were different, but Lord Justice Slade said the banks had a contractual right to prevent the Fund from expending bond moneys other than in performance and execution of its rights, duties, powers and discretion. However, he said, subject to that limitation it was the Fund's choice as to how it should spend the bond moneys, and the banks could not complain about such expenditure, though it would prejudice their rights of obtaining recoupment of unexpended bond moneys. That passage was relied upon by the judge. Barclays went on appeal to the House of Lords ((1984) BCLC 259). At page 265 Lord Templeman said that on the terms of the bond and the memorandum of association, if the Fund did not employ the whole sum for authorised purposes, the balance was to be refunded to the bank. In the objects clause in the Fund's memorandum of association, the paragraph A object was 'to manage, utilise, employ and expend funds and monies paid and/or to be paid to the company under or by virtue of bonds . . . generally alleviating the consequences to each member's customers of the business failure of the Tosg member in respect of whom such funds are received by the company'. The paragraph K object was 'to make donations to such persons and in such cases as the company may think directly or indirectly conducive to any of its objects or otherwise expedient'. Paragraph A clearly confined the Fund to paying out to customers of the failed Tosg member in respect of whom bond monies were received. In the present case only Travel was a Tosg member. In so far as monies were expended in alleviating the consequences of failure to customers of Leisure, Quest or Skiscope they were not expended in the performance of the Fund's rights, duties, powers or discretions set out in the memorandum of association. As to paragraph K, the payments clearly could not be regarded as 'conducive' to the paragraph A object. Nor could they be regarded as 'otherwise expedient'. The words, although apparently unlimited, could not be construed to enable the company to use monies received for one clear purpose, to make donations to customers of other tour operators with no bond. The facility agreement, which came years after the latest amendments to paragraph A of the objects clause, could not influence or control the meaning of the memorandum of association. So far as the Tosg rules were concerned, rule 4 provided that members were to be companies or firms whose names were included in lists appended to the copy of the rules. Rule 8 provided that 'each member shall arrange for a bond . . . or similar arrangement in favour of the Tosg Trust Fund in respect of such member and/or its tour operator subsidiaries'. It was clear that Travel was, as a member, to arrange for a bond or to make a similar arrangement, not only in respect of itself but also in respect of its subsidiaries. It did not in fact do so because the Fund accepted that the bond in existence in respect of Travel was adequate for the protection of Quest and Skiscope. The fact that the rules imposed an obligation could not affect or extend the banks' exposure. When the banks issued a bond, they exposed themselves to the risk of failure of the Tosg member and, at least apparently, to the failure of any other company in the member's group as therein defined. That was specified and could not be altered by something of which the banks knew nothing. The Fund was not entitled to make payments to or for the benefit of customers of Quest, Skiscope and ILG Leisure. It was entitled to make payments so far as concerned names under which Travel was trading as a tour operator. The appeal was allowed. Their Lordships agreed. For the banks: Peter Leaver QC and George Leggatt (Clifford Chance). For the Fund: Alan Steinfeld QC and Christopher Moger (Norton Rose).</p>

			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> CONCORD;  </P> <P> CAPTAINS CLEARED OF BATHROOM SPYING  </P> <P> Two police captains implicated in a 1986 men's room spying incident have been  exonerated in a disciplinary arbitration, an attorney said Friday. Arbiter  Emily Maloney ruled that captains Robert Evans and Wayne Novinger are to be  compensated for lost wages and loss of seniority resulting from disciplinary  actions against them, Gary Lepper, an attorney defending the pair in a federal  lawsuit brought by their co-workers, said Friday.  </P> <P> Evans and Novinger were suspended without pay in the summer of 1989 by the city  manager after a three-month investigation. The probe was conducted after  charges were made that a video camera was installed in the department bathroom  to spy on officers using the urinal. The surveillance was part of then-Police  Chief George Straka's unsuccessful attempt to catch a vandal who had been  clogging the urinal with paper towels and flooding offices. More than 30  current and former city employees have sued the city, Straka, Lt. James  Jennings and the two captains in federal court, claiming their civil rights  were violated.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Lampertheim -- The Social Democratic Party of  Germany's [SPD] deputy chairwoman, Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul has  spoken out for a red-green coalition. A shift in power cannot  be achieved "with the parties that are responsible for the  desperate situation in Germany: Christian Democratic  Union/Christian Social Union, and Free Democratic Party," she  told the SPD Hesse South party conference at Lampertheim on  Friday [17 June]. As far as the Bundestag election campaign is  concerned, the Social Democrats must quickly draw the  conclusions from their defeat at the European election,  Wieczoerek-Zeul said.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek in an interview for  REUTERS explained the government views about a recent  Slovene-Italian conflict. He gave his assurance that our  country intends to persist in its views regarding its heritage  from World War II and expressed belief that the European Union  will support us in this. He warned that, if Italy continues to  exert pressure upon our country in the future, Slovenia will  demand compensation for the time of occupation by Fascist Italy  and protection for approximately 100,000 Slovenes in Italy. He  did not ascribe any major significance to a recent Italian move,  when at the Conference on Stability in Europe Slovenia was cut  from the list of countries that are potential EU members at the  insistence of the Rome authorities.</p>

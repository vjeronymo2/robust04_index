			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Near Pounds 1m turnround at Trace Computers Trace Computers, which provides consultancy services, continued in profit for the second half to produce an overall Pounds 502,000 pre-tax for the year ended May 31 1992, compared with a loss of Pounds 471,000. Although some of the operating centres were standing up well to the recession, others continued to be affected, said Mr Robert Carefull, the chairman. Turnover dipped to Pounds 19.3m (Pounds 19.7m) but actions to reduce costs and focus more on software activities led to an improvement of Pounds 1m in operating profit. Good performances came from core businesses of insurance broking, property, distribution, and stockbroking systems, and bespoke software. The chairman said Prospect, the recruitment and consultancy company, suffered from low demand and also incurred a significant loss on bad debt after the failure of a large customer. It should return to profitability this year. Earnings per share came to 2.94p (losses 1.98p). The final dividend is again 0.9p for a maintained 1.45p total.</p>

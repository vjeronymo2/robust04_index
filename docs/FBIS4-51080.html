			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Liang Chao: "State To Regulate Land Transactions"] </F>   [Text] The China Land and Real Estate Market, which opened  in Beijing on Wednesday [18 May], will regulate the country's  fledgling property trade, the government said.    The market, approved by the State Land Administration (SLA)  and the State Commission for Economic Restructuring, will be a  non-profit making agency controlling and servicing land and real  estate dealers.    The market will sell land-use rights, oversee commercial  transfers of the rights and regulate real estate sales.    The market is empowered to act as an estate agent,  evaluating  land, advertising land for sale and providing legal consultation  services.    The move will help set up "an open, fair and just allocation  mechanism of land," according to State Land Administration  director Zou Yuchuan.    Central and provincial government will be responsible for  working out the country's industrial and urban land-use plan, he  said.    Zou said that other agencies involved in land deals would be  put under State control.    The land management boss hinted that the government was  going  to stop handing out free land-use licenses for State-owned real  estate.    The government was planning to sell land or lease it to the  highest bidder, he said.</p>

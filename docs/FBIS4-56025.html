			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondent's report: "One Can Count on a Calm Election </F> Finish"]    [Text] The second round of the elections will be held in  less than a week. We asked the campaign heads of the parties  that reached the 5 percent threshold about their plans until 29  May.  <H5>  Balint Magyar, Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] </H5>   From the viewpoint of the election campaign, one cannot  count  on any special surprise in the coming period. Compared with the  campaign before the first round, the current campaign between  the two rounds is calmer, more meditative, and more  argumentative. The SZDSZ will focus on the television and radio  debates in the last week. In addition, the party will also  organize local talk shows. According to our experience so far,  the people came to like this political genre because it is more  interesting and faster paced than the usual political meetings.  Of course, just as until now, the SZDSZ continues to advertise  on billboards, flags, in the radio, on television, and in the  newspapers.  <H5>  Istvan Eszes, Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] </H5>   We have 12 candidates still running in the second round. In  places where we are not present, we will mainly support the  candidates of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] and the  Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP]. There is no sense in  holding national meetings; therefore, we concentrate on local  events popularizing our still running candidates, including new  billboards and leaflets. Some eight to 10 of our candidates  have real chances of obtaining a parliamentary mandate.  <H5>  Mrs. Nagy Agnes Maczo, FKGP </H5>   Our campaign continues to be a puritan one. We are the party  that spends the least, and we can prove this. Our  advertisements from the first round will remain on the radio and  television; we have no money for new ones, and we do not  advertise in newspapers at all. Until the end of the campaign,  we will hold at least two meetings, but generally four meetings,  naturally, in places where our candidates are still running.  The leading speakers at these festive meetings that attract  large number of people are FKGP Chairman Jozsef Torgyan and  myself. After the success of the first round, in addition to  its own large camp of supporters, the FKGP can justifiably count  on the votes of the members and sympathizers of the Agrarian  Federation, with the exception of the chairmen of the  agricultural cooperatives, as well as on the support of  followers of the succumbed Hungarian Justice and Life Party  [MIEP] and those who became disappointed in the MDF. Thus, we  consider all our 47 candidates to be potential winners.  <H5>  Karoly Herenyi [MDF] </H5>   In the remaining days until the second round, the MDF thinks  it is important to draw attention to the dangers of a possible  two-thirds majority government, where the role of the opposition  could become only formal. The MDF acknowledges the fact that  the voters sent this party into opposition, but the second round  will decide whether the society wants a strong opposition or  not. The campaign is also a period of promises and occasional  irresponsible promises as well. With four years of government  experience behind it, the MDF knows exactly what opportunities  the new government will have. Therefore, it is our obligation  to draw the voters' attention to the fact that there are quite a  few unrealistic promises among the many promises made now. We do  not want to change our campaigning style in the remaining  period. Instead of central events, we only regard as important  to support our 98 individual candidates still running in the  second round. We also want to see as many people participating  in the second round as in the first round.  <H5>  Imre Szekeres, Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] </H5>   In the remaining few days, the MSZP does not want to change  its current campaigning style. It will not deal with other  parties and their election results; instead, the MSZP will  concentrate on making people aware of the solutions that we  offer in case we form a government.  <H5>  Janos Ader, Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] </H5>   After the withdrawals from the cooperation agreement of the  liberal parties, there are Fidesz candidates in five individual  electoral districts. The Fidesz supports them with local  campaigns.</p>

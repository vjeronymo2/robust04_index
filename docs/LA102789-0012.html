			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BID FOR SANTA CLARITA GROWTH ZONE EXPANSION FAULTED  </P> <P> Officials of the agency that oversees municipal boundaries are recommending  that the agency's board reject Santa Clarita's bid to expand its zone of growth  to more than 160 square miles of the unincorporated Santa Clarita Valley.  </P> <P> The city is asking the Local Agency Formation Commission, or LAFCO, to extend  Santa Clarita's "sphere of influence" over one-third of the valley, including  the unincorporated communities of Val Verde and Castaic and two canyons  regarded by Los Angeles County sanitation officials as likely sites for garbage  dumps.  </P> <P> A sphere of influence designates the land eligible for annexation.  </P> <P> Santa Clarita's proposed sphere would include the 39 square miles within the  current city boundaries plus an additional 160 square miles stretching from the  Ventura County line on the west to Angeles National Forest on the east. If the  area eventually became part of Santa Clarita, it would create a giant city  equal in area to the combined cities of Lancaster, Palmdale, Long Beach and  Glendale.  </P> <P> But in a report to the LAFCO board released this week, the agency's executive  director, Ruth Benell, recommended that the city's total sphere be scaled back  to about 90 square miles. A public hearing on the city's request is scheduled  for Nov. 15.  </P> <P> The sphere recommended by Benell roughly equals the city boundaries proposed by  incorporation advocates two years ago. But LAFCO scaled back that request to  the 39 square miles that now include most of Valencia, Saugus, Newhall and  Canyon Country.  </P> <P> In her report to the LAFCO board, Benell said Castaic should not be included in  Santa Clarita's sphere because residents there opposed the city's expansion.  </P> <P> Santa Clarita's proposal is opposed by three county agencies hoping to preserve  Elsmere Canyon and Towsley Canyon as potential dump sites.  </P> <P> The Santa Clarita City Council wanted Elsmere and Towsley included in the  city's sphere to have some say over their future.  </P> <P> City Manager George Caravalho said Thursday that the city requested the large  sphere because it makes sense to create a unified plan to guide the valley's  overall growth. "We still think the proposal is sound and that the boundaries  make sense," Caravalho said.  </P></p>

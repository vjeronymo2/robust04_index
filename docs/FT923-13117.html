			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Jackson emphasises jobs drive THE Rev. Jesse Jackson galvanised the Democratic convention early today with an inspirational evocation of the party's close ties with organised labour, while barely mentioning the two men who will head the presidential ticket in November. The black civil rights leader called in his address for America to be 'put back to work', so as to reduce the totals of '10m unemployed, 25m receiving food stamps, 25m in poverty and 40m with no health care'. He called for US public funds to be diverted from defence, there being 'no Russian empire to fight', and said there was 'hope in the world tonight' because of the election in Israel of the new administration of Mr Yitzhak Rabin. Almost in passing, he urged the party to 'support the ticket', but his main reference to Governor Bill Clinton and Senator Al Gore, the presumptive presidential and vice-presidential candidates, was in the context of his approval for their support of statehood for the District of Columbia. Mr Jackson, as a non-voting representative in Congress of the District, is keen on the mainly black area being allowed full voting rights. Meanwhile, Mr Jerry Brown, former governor of California, kept fellow-Democrats in doubt over whether he would support Governor Clinton and Senator Gore. Democratic party officials said Mr Brown, who won the backing of 616 delegates during the primaries, had agreed to lend his support but a spokesman for Mr Brown denied there had been any such agreement, saying the Democrats were 'spinning political fluff'. Mr Jim Desler, the party spokesman, said: 'Jerry Brown said that he would work for a Democratic victory. The word 'endorsement' was never used.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vienna, Jan 20 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) has warned North Korea that it will not  send a team of inspectors unless Pyongyang meets its inspection  requirements at the seven declared nuclear sites.    In a fourth working-level meeting, the UN nuclear watchdog  agency Wednesday urged North Korea to submit to all inspections  as stipulated by the nuclear safeguards pact and explained why  they are required.    After the meeting, IAEA Spokesman Hans Meyer said that  although North Korea had agreed on many items of inspection that  the IAEA had proposed in a meeting Monday, it still balked at a  considerable number of items.    The IAEA told North Korea clearly that it would push through  the items it refused to accept, he added.    In order for the inspections to be meaningful, North Korea  has to meet the detailed and reasonable inspection requirements  of the IAEA, he stressed.    The position of the IAEA is that unless North Korea agrees  on  all the inspections of its seven declared nuclear sites under  the nuclear safeguards regime, the IAEA will not send an  inspection team to North Korea, and this position has been  clearly conveyed to Pyongyang, he said.    The IAEA hopes that North Korea will accept the inspections  of its declared nuclear sites as requested, Meyer said.    Commenting on inspections of two undeclared sites in  Yongbyon  that are suspected of being nuclear waste processing facilities,  he said access to these facilities for additional information  would be dealt with separately.    The IAEA and North Korea will have another working-level  meeting in Vienna next week, an IAEA source said.    North Korea has agreed, in principle, on inspections of its  seven declared nuclear sites but refused to accept some  inspection items at two problem sites, a radiochemical  laboratory and a five-megawatt reactor, such as examination of  chemical substances used there, other sources said.</p>

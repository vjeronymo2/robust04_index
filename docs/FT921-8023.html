			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / International Equity Issues: Global telecom sector set to expand THE GLOBAL telecommunications sector is expected to generate a flood of new equity issues - both domestic and international - over the next few years. According to Mr Richard Ryder, head of telecommunications research at Salomon Brothers in London, the market capitalisation of the listed global telecommunications sector may increase by between Dollars 80bn and Dollars 100bn from its current level of Dollars 445bn over the next three-to-five years due to substantial new stock issues. Privatisations and share sales in Telefonica de Argentina, British Telecom, STET of Italy, Telmex of Mexico and Telecom Corporation of New Zealand, raised over Dollars 13bn during 1991. Both Singapore Telecom and OTE, the Greek telecommunications group, are due to be floated this year. In the case of Singapore Telecom, investment bankers believe domestic investors will be able to buy the shares more cheaply than foreign investors. International equity offerings are also expected from the following: Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, the German state telecom monopoly; Telebras, the Brazilian state-controlled telecom company; Telecom Corporation of New Zealand (Ameritech and Bell Atlantic, two of the big US regional telephone companies, reduced their individual shareholdings to 34.17 per cent each last year after an international equity offering, and a further offering is expected since the New Zealand government requires Ameritech and Bell Atlantic to reduce their combined holdings to 49.9 per cent or less by September 1993); Telekom Malaysia, which followed its privatisation in November 1990 with a convertible bond issue last March (with Dollars 200m in bonds to be exchanged for 50m shares), may now be considering a tender offer; Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), the Japanese telecommunications utility, in which foreigners may be permitted to buy a 20 per cent stake. Telecom shares often appeal to international investors for a variety of reasons: they are utilities which investors find easy to understand, they often enjoy a monopoly position at home and they tend to be among the largest capitalised stocks in the domestic market. Fund managers often regard them as a suitable blue-chip substitute for the foreign stock market as a whole and capable of providing a good income stream. Telecom companies in the lesser developed countries are often considered particularly attractive because of their growth potential. 'It's clear that an international telecom sector is building up, what with Mexico, New Zealand and the UK last year,' said one banker. The factors which can deter international investors are the regulatory environment and the management - especially if the bureaucrats dating from the period of state ownership remain in place. Investment bankers point out it can be difficult to provide a valuation, especially in countries plagued by hyperinflation and where the accounting principles and the accountants do not follow international standards, although such standards are increasingly becoming more widespread.</p>

			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HEALTH DEPARTMENT STARTS ANNUAL FLU SHOT PROGRAM  </P> <P> Low-cost flu shots will be available beginning today and through the winter for  seniors and at-risk risk children and adults at seven public health centers.  </P> <P> The flu immunizations as well as pneumococcal pneumonia and tetanus-diphtheria  vaccines are $2 each.  </P> <P> But the fee may be waived if a person certifies an inability to pay, County  Health Officer Donald Ramras said.  </P> <P> The flu vaccine will be given to people 55 years and older; children 6 months  to 18 years on long-term aspirin therapy; people who are HIV positive, and  children and adults with chronic heart or lung conditions, kidney or metabolic  diseases, anemia, or an impaired immune system. People who live or work closely  with the at-risk groups also may receive the vaccine.  </P> <P> Children will receive the flu vaccine only by appointment because a more  detailed medical history is required and vaccine dosages differ from those  given adults, Ramras said.  </P> <P> Although the flu vaccine must be taken yearly to be effective, the pneumonia  vaccine is administered once in a lifetime, he said. It is recommended for  person 65 years and older and adults with a long-term illness or chronic health  problem.  </P> <P> The vaccines are available at the East San Diego, El Cajon, Escondido, North  San Diego, Oceanside, South Bay and Vista Public Health Centers. South County  residents may call the 24-hour, flu information line at 236-2350. North County  residents may call 940-1462.  </P></p>

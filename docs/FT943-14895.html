			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo pressured Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo saw its share price fall sharply in afternoon trading as a US takeover left the UK giant looking potentially stranded. Eli Lilly &amp; Co announced it was buying PCS, the pharmacy benefit management (PBM) arm of McKesson for Dollars 4bn. PCS is one of the last benefit managers to be available and the high price paid by Lilly was seen as reflecting the scarcity value. The move was seen as wrecking Glaxo's chance to make that kind of inroad into the US market and putting paid to speculation that Glaxo intended to buy McKesson itself. However, after the close one US commentater suggested Glaxo might enter a bid auction. Many analysts believe Glaxo will have to invest in a PBM - which negotiates bulk discounts with drug companies for user groups - if it is to be represented in an increasingly important area of the US market. Glaxo supporters said that the company had avoided paying what could be a top-heavy price and added that it was more likely to follow the course of Pfizer and go for strategic alliances. The shares which had been 3 higher, ticked back smartly to close 8 down at 563p. SmithKline Beecham was very heavily traded in the 'A shares as one house sold a block of around 8m just before the end of official trading. The deal was carried out at 398p a share, well below the mid price, and pulled the shares down from a high of 407p to close 5 lower at 400p. Traders said the stock was sold by Smith New Court, the house renowned for large aggressive market operations. Mirror Group was the most heavily traded share in the London market, rising 4 to 150p on turnover of 11m as the latest newspaper circulation figures for June showed that the Independent, in which Mirror has a stake of just under 40 per cent, had not been hit by the broadsheet price war. Brewing retail and leisure group Scottish &amp; Newcastle fell 3 to 495p on competition worries for its prestigious Center Parc's operation which generates around a third of the company's profits. Rival Rank announced plans to open a similar venture in Kent to S&amp;N's 'roam in a dome' operation but analysts said Center Parcs were well established and Rank would not be able to compete in the same way. Rank, which has first half figures on Thursday lifted 12 to 374p. Press speculation that the oft-mooted plan by Bass, Whitbread and Allied-Lyons to sell their Pounds 400m stake in Britvic had fallen through failed to affect the shares. The three brewers own 90 per cent of Britvic between them. Bass, the main share holder has consistently refused to comment on whether it is preparing to sell. Analysts said sources close to Pepsico, the company expected to buy the stake, had also suggested that the talks had cooled but they believed the deal was bound to go through eventually, it was just a question of when. Bass rose 4 to 521p, Whitbread 7 to 504p and Allied 6 to 555p. The prospects of demerging several of its businesses continued to boost Thorn-EMI. The shares added another 14 to 1053p. Rank Organisation were in demand ahead of Thursday's interim figures and the shares put on 12 to 374p. News of the departure of Forte's director of operations was another blow to the hotels group. The shares eased to 221p, after trade of 5.3m. Detailed sell notes from BZW and NatWest Securities hit sentiment in the stock last week. Great Universal Stores bumped up 14 to 567p ahead of the annual figures on Thursday as the market returned to its lingering fixation that the company is poised to buy back equity. Some analysts said that the company could buy back as much as 10 per cent or 100m shares and although the official offer price is unlikely to be much more than 590p a share the ACT tax breaks for pension funds would mean that, for them, the shares could have a nominal value closer to 700p. GKN jumped 15 to 603p as NatWest Securities became the latest house to recommend the stock to clients. Other statistics, Page 35</p>

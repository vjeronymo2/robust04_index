			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHARING BLAME OF 'MORAL MUTANTS'  </P> <P> According to the recent article in the Los Angeles Times about Michael  Josephson and his Institute for the Advancement of Ethics, Josephson sees a  very bleak future due to the lack of morals young people have today ("Did We  Rear a Bunch of Moral Mutants?" Oct. 11).  </P> <P> I am within the age group targeted by Josephson.  </P> <P> I consider myself to have very high morals.  </P> <P> Although I cannot dispute Josephson's statistics, I will argue with where he  places the blame. To put the blame on parents, teachers and employers isn't  fair. While it is true that our environment does influence our behavior, the  ultimate decision to do something morally wrong rests with the individual.  </P> <P> At a very young age, we are taught right from wrong. After our parents have  taught us the basics, it is up to us as individuals to act accordingly. There  is only so much parents and teachers can do to help shape individuals so that  they are acceptable in society.  </P> <P> Credit should be given to persons in this generation with high morals and  ethics. There are some of us trying to straighten up what previous generations  have done to the level of ethics.  </P> <P> DANICA DENISE VELKOVICH  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

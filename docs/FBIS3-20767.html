			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vojmir Tavcar: "Slovenia Gives Priority to </F> Cooperation With Italy"]    [Text] Bologna -- Yesterday's talks between Foreign  Ministers Beniamino Adreatta and Lojze Peterle serve as a  barometer indicating improved Italian-Slovene relations. Other  participants in the talks were Luigi Solari, Italian ambassador  to Ljubljana; Minister Plenipotentiary Pietro Ercole; Marko  Kosin, Slovene ambassador to Rome; and two department heads in  the Slovene Foreign Ministry, Stefan Cigoj and Franc Miksa.    They discussed the long-term foreign policy of both  countries  as a preliminary to Italy's more active support of Slovenia's  inclusion in the European integration process, especially the  Partnership for Peace and the European Union. It was also  necessary to remove Italian suspicions that Slovenia leans too  closely to central Europe, namely, to the Germanic world.  Peterle mollified them, emphasizing the priority Slovenia places  on its relations with Italy. The minority and the property  claims issues were also on the agenda. It was agreed that a  protocol on diplomatic and accelerated economic cooperation  would be prepared shortly.</p>

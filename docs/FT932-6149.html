			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Subdued departure for ICI THE extraordinary general meeting of ICI shareholders, called to vote on the Zeneca demerger, duly nodded through the break up of the old ICI company, albeit in the face of dissent by some shareholders, but was accompanied by a fresh bout of weakness across all classes of ICI/Zeneca shares. In their last trading session before the demerger ICI 'old' shares fell 11 more to 1244p, after turnover of 2.2m. and the 'new' a further 6 to 608p, after 605p, on 1.9m traded. Zeneca, ex-rights, lost 8 to 632p and the nil-paid 7 to 37p.</p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Brown in Brazil to boost US business Raytheon Company of Massachusetts yesterday received a boost in its hotly contested bid for a multi-billion-dollar Brazilian radar project with the visit to Latin America of Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary. The SIVAM project for the Amazon is a combination anti-drug, air traffic control and environmental scheme, also sought by Alcatel/Thompson of France. The first phase of the project alone is worth an estimated Dollars 1bn-Dollars 1.5bn. Mr Dennis Picard, Raytheon chairman, is among the 22 company heads accompanying Mr Brown on his trade and investment mission. Also in the delegation is Mr Arthur Pilzer, a vice president with the US Export-Import Bank. Mr Pilzer said the US was determined to offer a competitive finance package consistent with the rules agreed by the industrialised countries. At one point yesterday the delegation was in touch with Mr Kenneth Brody, Eximbank chairman, in Washington. Mr Brown, who successfully lobbied Saudi Arabia for two multi-billion-dollar contracts for aircraft and telecommunications, has made export promotion a key tenet of the administration's foreign policy. He was on the telephone yesterday with President Bill Clinton, who was also brought into the bidding effort for the Saudi contracts. Mr Brown has been telling his Brazilian hosts in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo the US 'intends to compete and win'. Part statesman, part preacher and part politician, Mr Brown is a powerful sign of US interest in a country which needs to get its currency under control. He races from meetings to receptions to briefings in a cavalcade of cars and vans, accompanied by sirens and leather-jacketed motorcycle police. To stress the importance of raising living standards, he visited two impoverished neighbourhoods. He headed two soccer balls at a neighbourhood centre, supported by Xerox. At a school he sat on a small chair listening to a boy stumble as he read to him. Mr Fernando Opitz, Rio Stock Exchange vice chairman, has seen US officials promote 'partnership' between US and Brazil for years. 'We've never seen anything like this before,' he said. Mr Pilzer announced that the Eximbank was ready to lend money to Brazilian state-owned companies. 'We view Brazil as a market we could do a lot of business in within a few years,' he said. The Eximbank has not lent Brazil or its state-owned companies money for at least eight years.</p>

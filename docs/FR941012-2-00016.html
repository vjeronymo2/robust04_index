			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The term ``electronic data'' has been defined in the ITA's current ``computer tape'' APOs. Because the ITA will no longer issue applicant-specific ``computer tape'' APOs under the proposed system, the definition has been moved to the application. The conditions that the ITA will require for the routine use and protection of ``electronic data'' will be in the application. The specific ``computer tape'' requirements to ensure protection of electronic information are discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Request for Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed application requires all parties to obtain an APO covering all business proprietary information submitted in the proceeding, but allows the applicant the choice of receiving hard copy information only, or hard copy and electronic information (Item 10 of the proposed application). Furthermore, parties may waive the right to be served with the business proprietary information of other parties in which they have no interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The statute and regulations provide for the release of all business proprietary information in a proceeding (19 U.S.C. 1677f(c)(1)(A) and 19 CFR &sect;353.34 or 355.34). In practice, however, the ITA has not always required parties to request all proprietary information, and has allowed parties to request only the information they wanted to receive. For administrative convenience, in the 1992 steel investigations the ITA asked parties to request access to `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> all <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  business proprietary information'' under APO. We have continued this practice in current proceedings, and most parties are now routinely requesting access to all proprietary information under APO. Furthermore, as in the steel investigations, parties may waive the right to be served with the business proprietary submissions of other respondents in which they have no interest. Respondents' counsel will, however, be required to accept submissions by petitioners that may contain business proprietary information of several parties. The adoption of this practice will allow parties to prepare only one APO version of business proprietary documents and will not require the preparation of multiple APO-specific versions for each party. Additionally, it will reduce the possibility of APO violations because all parties subject to APO will have access to all information. In order to ensure that parties are provided with a means of identification for multiple source data in submissions, the ITA will amend &sect;&sect;353.32 and 355.32 of the Department of Commerce's regulations to provide specific instruction concerning the identification of this information. This will greatly assist all parties in providing their clients with needed information to present their case while minimizing the risk of inadvertent disclosure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The APO application also provides the applicant with the choice of receiving hard copy information only, or hard copy and electronic information. Should the applicant choose to receive electronic information, the applicant does not need to provide any additional documentation to the ITA concerning this portion of the APO request. The ITA will no longer require an explanation of the applicant's computer system or the procedures that will be followed in working with information in electronic form because the applicant will now be required to establish its own procedures to ensure the protection of APO information in electronic and hard copy form. The Bar Committee emphasized that it was not necessary for the ITA to set forth specific requirements/restrictions in the application or the APO because they were unnecessary and overly restrictive, considering the experience that has been gained by the Trade Bar in working with business proprietary information subject to APO.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Internal Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A primary area of concern noted by the Bar Committee is the ITA's perceived micromanagement of the APO area. Under current APO practice, specific procedures are mandated by the application and APO. In our discussions, the Bar Committee frequently stressed the experience that has been gained by the Trade Bar in working with business proprietary information subject to APO. The Bar Committee emphasized that it was not necessary for the ITA to set forth detailed requirements or restrictions in the application or in the APO, such as the requirement that the use of APO data be restricted to the business office premises, the prohibition concerning the facsimile transmission of APO data, or the requirement that an APO Log be maintained. In response to this concern, we have removed these requirements and restrictions from the proposed application, and now require the applicant to establish its own internal procedures to protect the APO information, rather than have the procedures mandated by ITA (Item 13 of the application). To assist a party in establishing its own adequate internal procedures, the ITA will maintain guidelines concerning general procedures for protecting APO information and more specific suggestions concerning the establishment of written office procedures. The quality of a party's internal procedures will be taken into consideration by the ITA in an APO violation investigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

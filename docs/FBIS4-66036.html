			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yeoryios Karelias] </F>   [Excerpt] What is the most interesting question about the  12 June European Parliament elections?    While it may seem unusual, it is not the percentages of the  two biggest parties, which are more or less as expected. The  "unknown factor" is the percentage of the Political Spring  party, which could be decisive for political developments.    A top government official estimates that if Andonios  Samaras'  party [Political Spring] gathers a percentage in the double  digits (last October it gathered almost 5 percent), it will then  become a regulator in political affairs.    There are three reasons for government concern over such a  possibility:    1. It will become more difficult, if not impossible, to  realize [Prime Minister] Andreas Papandreou's goal of jumping  over to the Republic's Presidency.    2. Elections in the spring of 1995 will be inevitable, as  Samaras has every reason to seek them.    23. The government will be in a very difficult position  when it comes to accepting a compromise solution on Skopje [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], as the reaction  of a reinforced Political Spring cannot be ignored.    According to the estimates of government officials, the only  positive point from a possible big electoral increase for  Political Spring, is that the conservative faction will finally  be divided and in that way unable to seek the Presidency.  "First place for PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement in the  European Parliament elections] is certain," they said. These  calculations by government officials are mainly based on the  (hypothetical) certainty that Samaras' party will cause greater  damage to New Democracy, while PASOK will be first despite the  "logical and natural loss" expected by a party in power. A vote  ranging from 42 to 43 percent is considered a "good result" for  PASOK. [passage omitted]</p>

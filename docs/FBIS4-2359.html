At  present, China is in the crucial period of promoting socialist  modernization. In safeguarding this year's overall situation of  the whole party's and the whole country's work defined by the  party Central Committee and implementing the three major affairs  of reform, development, and stability, the propaganda and  ideological front has to shoulder a particularly important  mission and responsibility. It has to give play to its strong  and forceful guaranteeing role and its media supporting role.  He said: It is necessary to submit ourselves to and serve the  overall situation of the work of the whole party and the whole  country and to prominently grasp four major tasks well:    1. We should persist in regarding Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the  fundamental guiding principle of propaganda and ideological work  and the study of volume no.3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping as the fundamental ideology, and grasp them firmly and  successfully. The study must be carried out at all levels and be  specific. It is necessary to attend to the study work of  leading cadres at all levels, particularly the leading bodies at  and above the county level, and to rotationally train cadres at  above the county and section levels within this year.    2. We should uphold the party's basic line and do a good job  in media guidance. In press and media propaganda, we must  resolutely implement the party's basic line which takes economic  construction as the central task and upholds the four cardinal  principles, reform, and opening up, adhere to the principles of  unity, stability, and boosting of enthusiasm, and of conducting  propaganda with positive examples, and do a good job in guiding,  protecting, and giving play to the enthusiasm of the masses of  people and of all sectors, and inspire, encourage, and guide the  masses of people to display their talent and make contributions  to reform, opening up, and modernization.    3.

Party  committees at all levels must participate in propaganda and  ideological work, realistically strengthen and improve  leadership over it, and enable it to play a more important role  in reform, opening up, and modernization. It is necessary to  unswervingly implement the principle of taking a two- handed  approach and be tough with both, place propaganda and  ideological work high on the agenda, take active and reliable  steps to promote reform in propaganda and cultural work,  conscientiously implement the cultural and economic policies  defined by the central authorities, increase input in propaganda  and cultural undertakings, and exert strenuous efforts to build  the propaganda and ideological work contingents.

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News: Profits ahead 17% at Pacific Magazines PACIFIC Magazines &amp; Printing, the magazine associate of the Australian-based media group News Corporation, reported a 17 per cent increase in profit to ADollars 31.4m (USDollars 21.2m) for the six months ended December. Sales rose 11 per cent rise, to ADollars 334m. The company, which was floated in October 1991, paid two dividends totalling 20.4 cents for the half-year. Mr Ken Cowley, chairman, said the result was helped by a ADollars 76m reduction in debt to ADollars 225m. This allowed the group's interest expense to fall from ADollars 14.2m to ADollars 9.2m. Tax provision rose from ADollars 11.0m to ADollars 13.6m. Mr Cowley said the result comprised modest trading profit increases in both the commercial printing and magazine divisions. He said the magazine division was being reorganised in order to allow further staff reductions. Hongkong Bank of Australia, part of the Hongkong and Shanghai banking group, has reported its first annual profit in four years. The bank made an after-tax profit of ADollars 8.06m in 1992, compared with a loss of ADollars 37.8m the year before. In spite of the turnround, the bank had to make provisions.</p>

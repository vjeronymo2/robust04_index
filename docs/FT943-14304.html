			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / SIB slow to change its role as regulator The efforts of the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, to withdraw from direct regulation and concentrate on standard setting and supervising other regulators have achieved only limited success so far, its annual report says. The report, published yesterday, shows that at the end of March this year SIB was directly regulating 75 organisations - only five fewer than in March last year. However, it adds that 22 of these have now applied to the Personal Investment Authority, the new regulator to protect the private investor, and SIB expects some of the 20 others eligible to follow suit. SIB's costs for the year to the end of March totalled Pounds 17.7m - an increase of 25 per cent on the previous year, but Pounds 500,000 under budget. Annual report. SIB publications, Gavrelle House, 2-14 Bunhill Row, London EC1. Pounds 15.</p>

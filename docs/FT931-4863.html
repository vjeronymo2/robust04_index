			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Securities losses cut Barings to Pounds 21.3m BARING SECURITIES, the securities arm of Barings, the merchant banking group, returned to profit in the last quarter, though earlier losses and reorganisation costs were sufficient to halve profits for 1992. The outcome showed pre-tax profits of Pounds 21.3m (Pounds 42.5m) after Pounds 8.9m of reorganisation costs at its securities subsidiary in the second half. The problems at the offshoot emerged when the group announced interim figures and stemmed from losses in Japan and continental Europe. The return to profit in securities was accounted for in part by sterling's devaluation, said Mr Peter Baring, chairman. A large proportion of costs are in sterling, while much of its revenue is in foreign currencies. Also, a move to cut more than 100 jobs had reduced costs by about 20 per cent. Japan had remained a difficult market, though losses there had been more than offset by profits in south-east Asia and Latin America, Mr Baring said. The operation is thought to have remained in profit so far this year. Without the securities losses, Barings' profits would have increased in 1992, with asset management and corporate finance ahead and profits in the banking and capital markets division only just behind 1991 levels. The group does not provide a detailed breakdown.</p>

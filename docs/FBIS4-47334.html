Experiments were conducted at subsonic speeds.  Artificial turbulence was induced. Secondary eddy structures  were formed which are similar to Taylor eddies between coaxial  rotating cylinders. These structures lead to a laminar-turbulent  transition. Creation of turbulence in the eddy may occur without  altering the profile of the average speed, that is, without eddy  decay.

			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REWARD  </P> <P> After reading Sherry Potter's letter ("Reward", Jan.5) concerning lost wallets  and rewards, I'd like to describe my own recent experience. While on jury duty  in Glendale in December, I visited the main Pasadena City Library and found a  wallet (filled with driver's license and other valuable cards) in the parking  lot.  </P> <P> I drove over to the owner's address and left a note with my name and telephone  under his door. When I returned to my parked car, I discovered a $20 parking  ticket on my windshield. I drove over to Pasadena City Hall and paid the  ticket. Two days later, the owner of the wallet telephoned and I mailed the  lost wallet back to his Pasadena address. Lo and behold, the owner( Michael  Ackley) sent a letter of thanks and enclosed a $25 check to cover the $20  parking ticket and my expenses.  </P> <P> KENNETH LLOYD LARSON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

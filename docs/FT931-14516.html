			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Prudential The market was rightly impressed by full-year new business figures from Prudential. Even allowing for weak sales in 1991 while the sales force was being reorganised, maintaining regular premium business and increasing sales of single premium policies by one third must be counted a success. The Pru would doubtless prefer to sell more regular premium policies, which yield a higher margin and regular cash flow. But the reluctance of savers to make long-term commitments is a fact of recession. More important, the Pru seems to be holding its own against competition from bank assurance. Sales figures from the likes of Lloyds Abbey Life and TSB last week suggested that selling life assurance to bank customers is no less vulnerable to recession. Lloyds Abbey's sales of regular premium business to Lloyds Bank customers were up 7 per cent. That marks a notable slowing in the rate of sales growth. TSB must be disappointed with a small decline in sales, even allowing for the fact that its business is more mature. With NatWest starting to peddle life assurance and TSB promising a sharper focus, though, Prudential might expect stiffer competition. It remains an open question whether new products - such as the successful Prudence Bond - and better management will be enough to meet the challenge. Even so, the immediate outlook for earnings is encouraging. Having tackled the problems in overseas markets and general reinsurance last year, the performance of the Pru's core UK business was almost the last remaining reason for doubt. If lower interest rates and economic recovery encourage savers to be more adventurous, Prudential looks well placed to benefit.</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Greenacre ahead to over Pounds 0.5m GREENACRE GROUP, which last November changed its name from Brewmaker to reflect its concentration on nursing and residential care home activities, lifted taxable profits from Pounds 496,733 to Pounds 535,521 in the year to end-January. Turnover declined to Pounds 2.18m (Pounds 5.64m) due to the sale of the homebrew manufacturing business in August. Mr Tony Acton, chairman, said that nursing and residential homes had been firmly established as the group's main business, with more than 80 per cent of earnings coming from that source. The group expects to more than double the number of beds in its homes from 209 to 500 by the end of the year. It has already raised an initial Pounds 3.78m through a rights issue and a partly paid subscription of convertible preference shares. The sale of the brewing business resulted in a deferred extraordinary loss of Pounds 90,000 but the group expects this to be cancelled out by the sale of the related leasehold property, which is expected to result in an overall profit of Pounds 100,000. Group borrowings of Pounds 850,000 put gearing at about 11 per cent. Earnings per share were down to 0.47p (0.55p) and a recommended final dividend of 0.125p brings the total to 0.225p (0.2p).</p>

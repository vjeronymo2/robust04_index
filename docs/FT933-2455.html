			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / International Company News: Westinghouse warns of third-quarter fall SHARES in Westinghouse Electric softened on Wall Street yesterday after the diversified US group warned of a substantial downturn in third-quarter earnings. The stock shed Dollars 1 to close at Dollars 13 7/8 in heavy volume. Net income from continuing operations is expected to drop 50 per cent in the period, against last year's comparable figure of Dollars 91m, or 22 cents a share. The consensus forecast by analysts was earnings of 24 cents a share. For the full year, operating results were expected to slip 10 to 20 per cent from 1992 levels. The company, which has been struggling to recover from poor property investments in the 1980s, blamed the downturn on the deterioration of the market for environmental products and services, especially in Europe. Electronics systems, power systems, and broadcasting were also experiencing a lacklustre third quarter, it said. In an effort to reduce its heavy debt burden, Westinghouse has been gradually withdrawing from financial services - particularly from real estate investment. In August it agreed to sell its electrical distribution and control equipment business to Eaton for Dollars 1.1bn.</p>

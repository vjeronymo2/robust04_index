			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The elimination of the Commissary/Exchange rates in the four areas should have no effect on the COLA paid to any employee. Federal white-collar employees in these areas should be receiving the higher Local Retail COLA rate. Similarly, although OPM does not control access to commissaries and exchanges, OPM believes its action should not affect the commissary or exchange privileges that employees might otherwise enjoy. Therefore, if an employee in one of the four areas finds that his or her COLA rate or access to commissaries or exchanges is adversely affected by the elimination of the Commissary/Exchange COLA rate, the employee should contact his or her agency immediately, and the agency should bring the issue to OPM's attention as quickly as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with the terminology used in other areas where only one COLA rate is payable, OPM is retitling the ``Local Retail'' COLA rate as the ``All Employees'' COLA rate in the four areas affected. The retitling will not affect the COLA rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OPM is also clarifying the definitions used in appendix A to subpart B of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, because the previous definitions were subject to misinterpretation. The new definitions address this problem. The changes do not affect COLA rates or eligibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lastly, OPM is also removing from the regulations three locations listed as places where nonforeign post differentials are paid. The three locations are the Canton, Enderbury, and Christmas Islands. These islands are no longer territories or possessions of the United States and, therefore, are not covered by the nonforeign area post differential program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary and Analysis of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OPM received 127 comments on the proposed regulations and notice it published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on May 26, 1994. Nearly all of these were from employees on St. Croix who endorsed the consolidation of the Virgin Islands allowance areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OPM received one comment opposing the consolidation. The commenter believed the economies of St. Thomas and St. Croix were significantly different and that living costs are higher on St. Thomas than on St. Croix. The commenter also suggested that OPM survey St. Thomas twice a year, once in the ``tourist season'' and once in the ``off-season'' and average the results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although there may be differences between St. Thomas and St. Croix, OPM believes consolidation will improve the survey and the administration of the program. Living costs vary among and within many COLA areas, including the Virgin Islands. The issue is whether it is practical to differentiate among the living costs of certain places. Generally, the smaller the area surveyed, the more difficult it is to measure relative differences in living costs. By consolidating areas where appropriate, OPM can improve the surveys and reduce unwarranted fluctuations in COLA's that otherwise might occur. This is the purpose of the consolidation of the Virgin Islands allowance areas. OPM does not believe semi-annual surveys of St. Thomas are necessary. OPM plans, however, to review survey timing in all allowance areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter requested that St. Croix employees receive their increase retroactively to the date of the increase in the St. Thomas COLA rate. OPM finds no basis for a retroactive adjustment. The previous St. Croix living-cost surveys were conducted according to regulation and provided adequate measures of local living costs. Therefore, the St. Croix COLA rates set pursuant to previous surveys are appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters suggested that OPM review community selection in the City and County of Honolulu, Hawaii, allowance area. The commenters believed some of the communities surveyed were not typical of places where Federal employees live. OPM is reviewing community selections in all of the COLA survey areas in light of the results of the Federal Employee Housing and Living Patterns Survey. OPM revised community selections in several areas prior to the summer 1994 surveys. One of these allowance areas was the City and County of Honolulu.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter believed OPM had not complied with provisions of the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act, 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;141, as amended by Pub. L. 103&hyph;329), as these provisions apply to the COLA program. The law requires OPM to study living-cost issues and submit to Congress a report on possible changes in the COLA methodology. The report is due March 1, 1996. The commenter thought the law directed OPM to make changes in the COLA model before the report due date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As we stated in our response to comments received on an earlier proposed rule (at 59 FR 13844), OPM carefully reviewed Pub. L. 102&hyph;141 and the related Senate Appropriations Committee report. OPM determined that the law has two requirements: (1) COLA rates may not be reduced through December 31, 1995, and (2) OPM must submit a report to Congress on possible changes in the COLA methodology. The law does not direct OPM to implement methodological changes at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Senate Committee, however, asked OPM to research specific methodological issues. OPM is doing this and plans to include the results of its research in its report to Congress. Although the law does not require OPM to implement changes, OPM will continue to make improvements in the COLA program, as appropriate. We are implementing some of these changes with this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter said OPM regulations should describe the COLA model and survey in greater detail. OPM believes the COLA regulations are adequately detailed and that subjecting the survey process to a set of overly detailed and inflexible rules would impair, rather than improve, the COLA program. The flexibility results in a more accurate COLA model because improvements can be made from one year to the next. Such changes are made public because, before COLA rates are adjusted, OPM publishes in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a detailed report on the survey methodology and results. Employees have the opportunity to comment on any changes, and OPM takes these comments into careful consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter believed OPM violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by publishing details after the survey. He said OPM could not ``go back and replicate the data if it is subsequently determined that the changes were 'inappropriate.''' The APA does not require OPM to make a change for each comment received. Instead, the APA requires OPM to inform the public of certain proposals and actions, allow the public to comment on these, and take these comments into consideration. This we do.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As evidenced in this final rule, OPM implements recommended changes as appropriate. With this rule, OPM is correcting an error made in the calculation of the Maui index, implementing a new methodology for calculating the Miscellaneous Component index, and eliminating Commissary/Exchange COLA rates in areas where they are no longer payable. OPM also adopted, based in part on comments it received, community changes for the summer 1994 COLA surveys. Therefore, OPM is in compliance with both the letter and spirit of the APA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter said there was no basis in law for the pledge of confidentiality that is provided on the Background Survey information collection materials, which was part of Appendix 5 of the report. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), as codified at 5 U.S.C. 552, allows the Government to withhold information from public release if the information contains trade secrets or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. Generally, the information collected in Background Surveys is privileged commercial information. Background Surveys are used to identify items that will be priced and outlets at which the prices will be collected. To identify commonly purchased items and popular outlets, information on such things as sales volume and market penetration are collected. This information is protected from disclosure under FOIA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter believed the COLA model was unnecessarily complex and suggested that it be simplified to use only one income level. The commenter said this would reduce survey costs and the number of subjective assumptions required. As we noted in our response to similar comments received on an earlier proposed rule (at 59 FR 13845), OPM's regulations require the measurement of living costs at multiple income levels. This approach recognizes that relative living costs may vary by income level and that the distribution of employees by income level may vary among areas. The multiple income approach, therefore, yields a more accurate measure of overall living-cost differences than a single income approach. Nevertheless, to the extent that multiple income levels require additional subjective assumptions, we agree that the overall integrity of the model might not be impaired by using a single income level. OPM is examining this issue and plans to address it in its report to Congress.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter also objected to Runzheimer's recommendation that OPM include income taxes in the COLA model. He believed this would unduly complicate the model. As stated in previous  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notices, OPM is studying issues relating to Federal, State, and local income taxes and plans to include the results of this study in its report to Congress.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Shops and offices closed in much of Sri Lanka and transportation ground to a  virtual halt in a strike called on Indian Independence Day by Sinhalese  radicals to protest the presence of Indian troops, officials said. There were  no immediate reports of violence. President Ranasinghe Premadasa said a plan  proposed by India for a phased pullout of Indian soldiers from the island's  northeast section needs "further revision," as "no room should be left for the  slightest undermining of the sovereignty of Sri Lanka." India and Sri Lanka  have been embroiled in a dispute over the withdrawal of an Indian peacekeeping  force that was deployed to enforce a 1987 accord to end a war by separatists of  the island's Tamil minority.  </P></p>

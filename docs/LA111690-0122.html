			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ECONOMY;  </P> <P> INVENTORIES GROW 0.5% IN SEPTEMBER, RAISING JOB FEARS  </P> <P> Business inventories grew 0.5% in September, the government said Thursday,  leading some analysts to express concern the buildup could lead to further  production cuts and loss of jobs.  </P> <P> Economist Evelina Tainer of the First National Bank of Chicago noted that  industrial production in October already dropped 0.8%, its sharpest cutback in  nine months.  </P> <P> "It's consistent with the idea that the economy is sliding into a recession and  growth will be negative in the fourth quarter," she said.  </P> <P> Analysts said the inventory level itself had not reached a dangerous level  although continued vigilance was needed to prevent an even deeper reduction in  output.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said inventories held on shelves and back lots in  September totaled a seasonally adjusted $811.5 billion, up from $807.5 billion  the previous month.  </P> <P> But the accumulation slowed from a 0.7% gain in both July and August, the  largest increases since an 0.8% advance in July, 1989.  </P> <P> Business sales dipped 0.5% to a seasonally adjusted $548.7 billion, down from  $551.5 billion a month earlier.  </P> <P> It was the first decline in sales since a 0.4% drop in July and the largest  since a 1.0% decrease last April. August sales had jumped 2.1%.  </P></p>

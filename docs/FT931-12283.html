			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Flynn opts for a flexible approach: EC commissioner ready to set new priorities THE European Commission's new social affairs commissioner, Mr Padraig Flynn, comes across - rather deliberately - as the provincial Irish politician, nursing his stronghold in County Mayo, and unversed in EC policy. But it is possible the critics in Brussels and Dublin - who are comparing him unfavourably with his Irish predecessor at the Commission, Mr Ray MacSharry - may be repeating the mistake they made when Mr MacSharry took over as agriculture commissioner in 1989. Mr MacSharry was initially characterised as a 'rough diamond' without the intellect of his predecessor, the urbane competition commissioner, Mr Peter Sutherland. Yet Mr MacSharry was one of the undoubted successes of the last Commission, in a politically treacherous and technically arcane area of EC policy. It has been widely assumed that Mr Flynn will be more attentive to his prospects of succeeding Mr Albert Reynolds as Irish prime minister than to the details of Community social policy. Yet, after barely a month in Brussels, he is acquiring a reputation as a canny operator. He engineered this month's declaration of support by EC finance ministers for the Irish punt, still under speculative siege within the ERM. He also seems ready to set important new priorities in EC policy. Talking to the Financial Times last week he suggested that the prescriptive and detailed approach to the social dimension championed by his predecessor as social affairs commissioner, Ms Vasso Papandreou, had run its course. 'We've reached a hiatus, a natural kind of hiatus, with the social action programme,' he said. That programme, enforcing minimum standards across the EC's workplaces, grew out of Mr Jacques Delors' 1989 Social Charter - although Mr Delors himself opposed turning it into such legislation. Much of the programme has run up against a combination of recession and opposition from member states, although some elements, such as the directive which lays down strict controls on working time, may slip through the net. Mr Flynn is now calling for 'a year of consolidation' and a more strategic approach, with the Commission laying down a framework of minimum standards 'without getting involved in the details', which should be left to employers and unions. 'The detail should be worked out when the legislation passes through national legislatures, the flexibility must be there,' he says. His officials promise a review of social dimension goals and methods by the end of this year. They also say privately that the social dimension has been hijacked since 1989 by the European trade unions and it is time to return to the broader theme of a Citizens Europe. 'The Community has to be identified by ordinary people as having a direction,' says Mr Flynn. He says that means highlighting the issue of unemployment in the EC, which will reach 11 per cent this year: to which end an 'Employment Week' conference is planned for October. Mr Flynn says he also wants to make 'a big push' to allow EC citizens to work and live in other EC countries. Legislation on free movement and mutual recognition of qualifications is in place, but there are many practical and bureaucratic obstacles to living and working in other EC countries - currently only 2 per cent of EC citizens do so. His officials say that there are a few areas where further legislation is needed, such as on the mobility of occupational pensions, but what is really needed is a commissioner who is prepared to do battle with those countries that are not applying legislation. Mr Flynn, who was justice minister in the Irish government, brings to social affairs the two extra portfolios of immigration and justice: a combination that means he should be in a good position to engage in just such a battle. However, there is the danger that Mr Flynn will disappear into arguments about drugs, asylum and terrorism, as internal borders within the EC are dismantled. He will also be busy ensuring that Ireland continues to receive its relatively favourable treatment from the EC social fund. His officials are keen that he reforms the rather bureaucratic social fund to make it more like the user-friendly regional fund, but Mr Flynn points out that those countries, such as Ireland, which have made effective use of the social fund have few complaints. Many of Mr Flynn's aims will be welcomed by the British government, which was barely on speaking terms with his predecessor. However the 'liberalisation' of the social dimension which Mr Flynn appears to stand for may face resistance from his own government, which now includes the Irish Labour Party, and from his own officials, who are more used to friendly social democrats.</p>

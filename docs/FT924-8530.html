			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Survey of Sweden 4: Investor gets busy - The core of the Wallenberg family empire THE new Investor, Sweden's largest investment company and the core of the Wallenberg family's industrial empire, has made an impressive start this year in its role as a diversified industrial holding company, since the merger of the 'old' Investor with its investment twin Providentia . At a time when most of corporate Sweden is either reporting plummeting profits and even losses, Investor's performance underlines just how impressively the Wallenbergs have managed to prosper during recession. The new investment company has current assets totalling SKr80bn and an influential SKr22bn share portfolio. No wonder Investor agreed to a 22 per cent increase in its dividend to SKr5.25 per share this year. Investor's strategic holdings are a roll-call of Sweden's leading blue-chip companies. They include Astra, the highly successful pharmaceuticals group; Stora, Europe's largest forestry company; Asea, the engineering giant; SKF, the world's largest roller bearing maker; the telecommunications company Ericsson; Electrolux, the white goods manufacturer as well as Atlas Copco, Europe's largest air compressor company. It also has a wide range of interests in banking, hotels, civil aviation, television, newspapers and trading. In February last year Investor and Providentia acquired for SKr12.8bn all the outstanding shares in Saab-Scania, the Swedish vehicle and aerospace group. This gave them access to an operating business generating cash. As Mr Claes Dahlback, Investor's chief executive, explains: 'As an investment company - with a high net worth discount on the Swedish stock exchange - it was nearly impossible for Investor to raise risk capital through new share issues. The step to a diversified industrial holding company changed this.' The finance companies sold their controlling stakes in the dairy equipment company Alfa Laval to Tetra Pak and Skandia, the insurance company to raise capital towards the 100 per cent acquisition of Saab-Scania. But half the acquisition was financed through a SKr6.5bn issue of convertible debentures. The 'new' Investor is going to be one of the most powerful players on Sweden's corporate scene during the 1990s with an increasingly high international profile, though at present it is consolidating. The company hopes to increase foreign ownership of its capital stock from a current 5 per cent to between 15 and 20 per cent within five years. The emergence of the Investor represents a crucial strategic shift by one of the world's oldest industrial dynasties as it seeks to strengthen its position in a more open competitive global economy after the removal of the regulations and controls that protected its position for more than 50 years. By creating one single investment company at the heart of their industrial federation, the Wallenbergs are seeking to enhance their power and influence on international markets while at the same time tightening control of their most vital assets at home. 'We have built up a defensive position over the past two years but it will form the base for an offensive in the 1990s,' says Mr Dahlback. Investor has launched a new international investment strategy under the direction of Mr Jacob Wallenberg, the 36-year-old son of the present head of the family, Peter. He represents the fifth generation in a family that has played a dominant role in Sweden's corporate life since its industrial revolution at the end of the last century. 'You will see an expansion in our strategic holdings in the years ahead. Our assets will grow. We will be making foreign acquisitions but some of our companies will be trimmed down,' explains Mr Dahlback. The breadth and strength of the Wallenberg empire is based on a distinctive sense of family obligation. 'I believe you should only do what you know something about,' he explains. 'I am an industrialist by training, not a financier.' Peter also remembers the wise advice he received as a young man from his family seniors. 'Stay out of property, they told me. Don't touch oil. You have to play the ball where it lies on the field - my father Marcus used to say'. Like them, he believes the Wallenberg interest must remain at the heart of Sweden's manufacturing industry. During the booming 1980s the family did not join in the rush into real estate speculation or plunge into new unchartered sectors such as electronics and high technology. Instead, the Wallenbergs launched an active stock market trading strategy combined with an industrial acquisitions offensive first in Sweden and increasingly after 1986 in western Europe. The results nearly 10 years later have been staggering. The value of the Wallenberg stock portfolio has climbed from SKr900m in 1980 to over SKr18bn. Not only did Peter take full advantage of the bourse boom of the 1980s but he showed some grit and flair in fending off threats to his position from a number of potential raiders. 'My attention is focused on the company balance sheets. I'm looking at them all the time for sparks that catch my eye but I'm a hands-off manager and not involved in the detail,' he explains. At the same time Peter encouraged the expansion of the key companies in the Wallenberg empire. Stora, the forestry group, is the example that he likes to give. Its expansion was devised and directed from Investor's office in Stockholm's banking district. First it bought Billerud, Papyrus and Swedish Match at home and last year 15 per cent of Korsnas. In 1990 it acquired the German industrial giant Feldmuhle Nobel. But Asea's highly successful merger with the Swiss engineering group Brown-Boveri made in the autumn of 1987 and the aggressive acquisitions of Electrolux after 1986 with the purchase of Zanussi in Italy and White in the US were also crucial developments in the growth of the Wallenberg interest in Europe. The dynamic changes of the 1980s transformed Investor. Mr Dahlback recalls the company he joined nearly 20 years ago as staid and sleepy. He likens it to the 'sacristry of an old cathedral'. Now he says it is a 'humming workshop' with over 70 mainly young brokers and finance experts on the payroll. The Wallenbergs seem pragmatic about their future intentions. 'In terms of our ownership, we will always face difficult alternatives,' Peter admits. 'We can sell, keep what we have or buy. There is no single solution. We have to make our decisions depending on circumstances as they arise.' But the creation of the new Investor suggests Jacob Wallenberg and his cousin Marcus will inherit a formidable industrial federation after Peter goes that will continue to flourish despite more open competitive conditions, just as the family did for so long behind Sweden's protective walls.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          THE NEW INVESTOR  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                               % of      % of                                  Bourse       Port-    Voting    % of                Sector            value        folio    shares    Equity  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Astra          pharmaceuticals   SKr6.823bn   30.9     12.5      10.4 Stora          forestry          SKr3.645bn   16.5     22.6      18.9 Asea           engineering       SKr2.788bn   12.6     10.4       7.7 Incentive      gen. industrial   SKr3.225bn   14.6     31.1      23.7 SKF            roller bearings   SKr2.274bn   10.3     38.4      15.3 Atlas Copco    compressors       SKr1.662bn    8.0     22.7      16.1 Ericsson       telecoms          SKr 586m      2.7     22.2       1.9 Electrolux     white goods       SKr 337m      1.5      5.2       1.3 Sila           civil aviation    SKr 306m      1.4     26.1      26.1 OM             options           SKr 140m      0.6     20.6      20.6 SE Banken      banking           SKr 112m      0.5      1.4       1.4 Garphyttan     metal, wood       SKr 90m       0.4     19.4      19.4  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

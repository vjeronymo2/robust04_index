			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Money Markets: A less bullish tone MONEY market dealers started the week believing that another cut in German rates was certain to come before the spring, but the tone of yesterday's trading was noticeably less bullish than last week's, writes James Blitz. Last Thursday's 15 basis-point reduction in German money market rates has led many operators to believe that the Bundesbank could aggressively ease policy as early as next month. However, even before Christmas the market was pricing more than 100 basis points off three-month money by the end of the first quarter of this year. There were limits, therefore, to the extent that last week's small easing by the Bundesbank could boost sentiment in markets. In a day devoid of any news in terms of indicators or policy, the March Euromark contract fell back 16 basis points, bottoming out at 92.05. It later closed at 92.06. At this level it prices three-month money at 7.94 per cent in mid-March, some 60 points below the current level. One London-based dealer was not at all surprised that the market had failed to consolidate last week's rally. 'We were setting a new high of 92.32 for the March contract last Tuesday,' he said. 'Yet, when the Bundesbank cut money market rates on Thursday, the contract failed to break through to a new level.' He suggested that the contract had failed to go any higher for want of any news. The fall in Euromarks had a depressive effect on French franc futures. The March contract declined 14 basis points to finish at 90.45, a level that assumes that three-month money in March will be at 9.55 per cent. French cash rates were softer for the third day running. Three-month money ended at 11 7/8 per cent, down from a previous close of 12 per cent. In the sterling market, the Bank of England's forecast of a shortage of Pounds 200m was far smaller than some dealers had expected, although it was revised to Pounds 300m in the afternoon and was fully removed. Three-month money closed slightly softer at 7 1/8 per cent, from 7 1/4 per cent on Friday night. The March short sterling contract finished 4 basis points down at 93.29. Dealers said the market remained uncertain about the timing of the next move in UK rates.</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Post Office unrepentant over sell-off campaign The Post Office faces 'crippling uncertainty' after the cabinet's decision to abandon its privatisation, Mr Michael Heron, Post Office chairman, warned last night. He added it was 'in danger of going into decline' without the fast introduction of the changes the Post Office needed to compete commercially. Mr Heron - with the backing of the Post Office board - also said that the nationwide network of post offices and delivery of letters to every address at a uniform and affordable price would now be 'undoubtedly threatened'. The board reaffirmed yesterday that it would be pressing 'for the commercial freedom needed to secure the future of the business'. The Post Office management is unrepentant about its aggressive public campaign to secure privatisation. 'We cannot wish our problems away,' said one senior manager. 'We will now be pressing the government to go as far as possible to the furthest perimeters of what is permissible to get in private investment through joint ventures and partnerships.' Mr Heron said: 'The Post Office needs to escape from a government system of cash-driven management to gain access to external finance and to develop its business through whatever commercial means are most appropriate.' He added that it was crucial that the Post Office must be free to meet 'the growing competition in the UK and ensure technological change in the communications world would be an opportunity and not a problem'. Mr Alan Johnson, general secretary of the UCW postal workers' union, said the cabinet's climbdown was a vindication of the union's 26-month campaign of opposition. He said: 'This is a real victory for the British people. It is heartening that the overwhelming views of the public have been heard. What we must now do is work hard to deliver real commercial freedom in an integrated Post Office while (it is) in the public sector.' Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, said the union's campaign had been 'modern trade-unionism at its best', showing 'the effectiveness of modern campaigning methods for trade-union causes'. The National Consumer Council said the decision was 'a victory for commonsense'. It added: 'We were concerned none of the options considered by the government would safeguard rural post offices.' Mr Keith Bill, secretary of the Protecting Postal Services group - a coalition of 3,090 charities and voluntary organisations - said that 'the threat of privatisation was a monster that should never have been let loose'. He added: 'We knew that offices in rural areas would have closed and services we take for granted would have been eroded despite the assurances of Mr Heseltine and Post Office management.'</p>

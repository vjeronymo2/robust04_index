			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities easier after turbulent session AN EXPECTED bout of profit-taking in the London stock market was overwhelmed yesterday by a series of unforeseen developments elsewhere in the global markets arena. A very sharp increase in the US trade deficit in June, a bombing raid on Iraq by American aircraft, and a warning on the economic outlook from Hang Seng Bank, Hong Kong subsidiary of HSBC, prompted a turbulent session for share prices. But all ended well, with the FT-SE 100 Index rallying to close a net 8.1 off at 3,065.5. London market strategists professed themselves satisfied with the final picture, pointing out that the fall on the Footsie was of little significance when measured against the upsurge of the past month. Equities opened higher, largely on the back of US buying orders laid down overnight by Wall Street investors celebrating the record close on the Dow Industrial Average. Within half-an-hour of the official opening, the FT-SE 100 was 15.6 points ahead at a new trading peak of 3,089.2, and traders were hoping to see the 3,100 mark challenged before the end of the day. In the banking sector, Barclays rose sharply on the announcement that the bank has appointed the new chief executive for which it has been seeking. However, neither UK government bonds nor stock index futures would give support and the market began to soften. The report from Hang Seng Bank, expressing some caution on the outlook for global economies, cast a cloud over the London market's newly inspired confidence. Share prices turned off smartly and market traders began to take some of the large paper profits already chalked up in the equity trading account which opened on Monday. The hardest blow, however, came just before Wall Street opened, with the news that the US trade deficit had jumped by about 44 per cent in June. The Footsie quickly dropped to 3,054.8, a turnround of 33 points since the early part of the trading session. London feared the worst, but was proved wrong when the US bond market held up relatively well and the Dow Jones Industrial Average also held steady to show a gain of 3.08 points in UK trading hours. The Footsie staged a good recovery to close on a buoyant note in good turnover, but restrained by substantial falls in HSBC and similarly Far Eastern-orientated stocks. Seaq volume remained high at 836.9m shares, if slightly below Wednesday's 887.1m; retail, or customer, business jumped to Pounds 1.92bn on Wed nesday as overseas investors bought heavily into UK equities. Traders said that foreign investors had held back yesterday, while UK funds had switched their attention to the second line stocks. Non-Footsie shares made up around 62 per cent of the Seaq total, although the FT-SE Mid 250 Index dipped 8.9 to 3,486.0. The international blue chip stocks had a difficult session as the US dollar came under pressure before finding support from the Federal Reserve. The drug sector held firm but saw little evidence of the renewed support from the US which has stimulated the sector's rally from its heavy setback. Domestic interest-related issues moved erratically as a weaker session in the UK bond market challenged some of the optimism for base rate cuts.</p>

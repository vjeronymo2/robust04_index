			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  editorials and articles from ROK vernacular newspapers published  on 3 and 4 January on DPRK President Kim Il-song's New Year's  address delivered on 31 December 1993 at the Kumsusan Assembly  Hall in Pyongyang.    The moderate Seoul CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean on 3 January  publishes on page 3 a 700-word editorial on Kim Il-song's New  Year's address titled "The North's New Year's Address, Which  Fails To Mention North-South Dialogue." Elaborating on the  characteristics of Kim's address, the editorial notes that the  address was nothing different from the previous addresses and  that no mention was made in it regarding the North-South  dialogue. The editorial concludes that while stressing the need  for holding dialogue with the United States, Kim Il-song is not  interested in holding the North-South dialogue.    The editorial reports that Kim Il-song's remarks denouncing  the civilian-led Government of South Korea indicates Kim is not  interested in holding a dialogue with our government. Expressing  disappointment over the address, the editorial concludes:  "Judging by North Korea's attitude and President Kim's New Year  address it is most likely that North Korea will utilize  North-South dialogue as a means for dialogue with the United  States. Therefore, we should renounce our optimistic view that  we can improve North-South relations under circumstances  favorable for us and should seriously grasp North Korea's  intent. Thus, we should take countermeasures against it."    The conservative Seoul CHOSON ILBO in Korean on 4 January  publishes on page 2 a 700-word article by An Hui-chang  commenting on Kim Il-song's address. The article notes that  Kim's address revealed North Korea's intent "to recover from its  backward economic situation and to improve relations with the  United States and other Western countries." Noting the strongly  worded denunciation of the South Korean government in the  address, the article reports that the address "has cast  pessimistic prospects on improving `bona fide' North-South  relations."    Elaborating on North Korea's new economic policies indicated  in the address, including the development of external trade and  the increase in production of export goods, the article reports  this reveals North Korea's intent to make a partial opening  within the framework of maintaining its self-reliant economy in  a bid to overcome its present economic difficulties.    Noting Kim's remarks on building up its defense capability,  the North Korean nuclear issue, and the improvement of relations  with the United States and Japan the article predicts that this  year, too, North Korea will continue to use its nuclear card for  various purposes, such as in maintaining its political system  and enhancing its position in the international arena.    The article concludes: Kim's address "has revealed an intent  to follow the basic line North Korea has taken so far and,  accordingly, North-South relations, as well, are expected to  repeat a `tedious war of nerves'."    The moderate Seoul HANGUK ILBO in Korean on 4 January  publishes on page 3 a 800-word editorial on Kim Il-song's New  Year address titled "Substantial North-South Dialogue Is a Key  Factor." The editorial notes Kim's address offered nothing new  and nothing different from his previous new year addresses and  that it was a "long-winded talk" to stress communist ideology  and motivate the North Korean people to work harder.    The editorial summarizes the address into five points: 1.  The Third Seven-Year Plan, which ended in failure; 2. The  North Korean Workers' Party plenary meeting's designation of the  next three years as a readjustment period in which North Korea  will reportedly place emphasis on agriculture, light industry,  and external trade; 3. The strongly worded denunciation of the  civilian-led South Korean Government; 4. The provocative  remarks on the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, which are  aimed implicitly at the United States; and 5. The reunification  policy. The editorial stresses Kim's address is basically  similar in content to previous years' addresses, though  expressions and phrases used are different to some extent.  Noting ongoing U.S.-North Korean contacts and anticipated  improvement in relations between the United States and North  Korea and between Japan and North Korea, the editorial stresses  that "the utmost task facing us this year is how to realize `de  facto dialogue' between North and South Korea for human and  material exchanges and cooperation, which depends on Kim  Yong-sam government's policy toward North Korea."    Seoul HUNGUK ILBO in Korean on 4 January publishes on page 4  an 800-word article by Yu Sung-u commenting on Kim Il-song's New  Year address. The editorial cites key points of the address and  elaborates on their background and implication. The article then  notes that the address "is characterized by the revelation of  North Korea's strong intent to concentrate greater efforts on  recovering from its difficult economic situation and, at the  same time, to improve relations with the United States and other  Western countries."    The pro-government Seoul SEOUL SINMUN in Korean on 4  January carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "We Are  Disappointed in Kim Il-song's New Year Address." The editorial  begins: "We expected North Korea to try to explore a new  breakthrough this year to overcome the difficult problems it is  facing, such as international isolation and economic failure."  The editorial then notes, "Kim Il-song's New Year address,  however, proved that Kim Il-song's objective of maintaining the  anachronistic system called `our-style socialism' remains  unchanged." The editorial continues: "Stressing that the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula should be resolved through  U.S.-North Korean talks, Kim Il-song did not show any interest  in inter-Korean dialogue. This reveals that North Korea is  trying to press forward for the establishment of diplomatic  relations with the United States, using the nuclear issue as a  negotiating card, but that it is not interested in improving  inter-Korean relations." The editorial concludes:  "Inter-Korean relations, as well as the nuclear issue, should  be resolved through dialogue between the parties concerned of  the North and the South. North Korea should not disappoint us  and the world anymore."    The pro-government Seoul SEOUL SINMUN in Korean on 4 January  carries on page 6 a 600-word article by Ku Pon-yong entitled:  "The Meaning of Kim Il-song's New Year Address Regards Improving  Relations With the United States as a Matter of Vital Interest  for the Survival of the North's System." The article notes that  judging from Kim Il-song's New Year address, the North Korean  foreign and domestic policy will concentrate on resolving its  economic problems, and reports: "Kim Il-song declares in his  New Year address that North Korea will develop `good-neighborly  relations' with capitalist countries as well, thus hinting that  North Korea will pursue practical economic interest through  improvement of relations with the United States and Japan. Kim  Il-song insisted that the nuclear issue be resolved through  negotiations with the United States. This eloquently manifests  that North Korea regards the improvement of relations with the  United States as a necessity of vital interest for the survival  of its system." The article then notes: "It is noteworthy that  Kim Il-song mentioned nothing about the inter-Korean dialogue in  his New Year's address. This reveals the North Korean scheme to  carry on dialogue only with the United States, bypassing us.  Nevertheless, the government authorities are of the opinion  that the context of Kim's New Year's address does not  necessarily mean that the inter-Korean relations will continue  to remain in a stalemate in the New Year as well." The article  then cites the remark by Song Yong-tae, vice unification  minister, "The North Korean attitude toward inter-Korean  dialogue will change depending upon the progress of the  U.S.-North Korean unofficial contacts in New York."    The left-leaning Seoul HANGYORE SINMUN in Korean on 4  January  carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "President  Kim's New Year Address and Inter-Korean Relations." The  editorial notes Kim Il-song's New Year address gave the  impression that the North Korean nuclear issue, which showed  signs of a breakthrough, might turn, though temporarily, into a  complication. The editorial notes the reason for this is that  the New Year address did not mention the inter-Korean dialogue,  but severely criticized the South Korean Government. The  editorial then reports: "We are curious to know how the  government, particularly President Kim Yong-sam, will react to  this. During a meeting conveying New Year greetings on 3  January, President Kim stated: `Since the North Korean nuclear  issue is directly connected with our nation's existence, we  should resolve it early this year without fail.' We feel both  expectations and worries about the fact that President Kim  Yong-sam set `early this year' as a deadline for the resolution  of the nuclear issue." The editorial then adds: "We hope  President Kim Yong-sam's deadline of `early this year' for the  resolution of the nuclear issue will not be a signal of a  hard-line offensive toward North Korea."    The left-leaning Seoul HANGYORE SINMUN in Korean on 4  January  carries on page 3 a 700-word article by Kang Tae-ho entitled  "What President Kim's New Year Address Signifies: Negative on  Inter-Korean Dialogue, Stresses Resolution of Nuclear Issue  Through North Korean-U.S. Talks, Details Trade Issue, Stresses  Acceleration of Economic Construction."    The article notes: "President Kim Il-song's New Year  address,  in short, regards the Kim Yong-sam government as nothing  different from the preceding military regimes. This is in  contrast with his expectations of the Kim Yong-sam government  expressed in his 1993 New Year address. This negative view of  North Korea toward inter-Korean dialogue was culminated during  the ROK-U.S. summit talks held last November. North Korea  thinks the South is laying an `artificial obstacle' to the North  Korean-U.S. talks, which are heading toward the resolution of  the nuclear issue." The article then notes that the New Year  address placed greatest emphasis on the economy, economic  construction, agriculture, light industry, and particularly  trade. The article concludes by citing the view of North Korean  experts, who find it unusual for the New Year's address to place  so much emphasis on trade and exports in so much detail.    The moderate Seoul KYONGHYANG SINMUN in Korean on 4 January  carries on page 3 a 900-word editorial entitled "Let Us Clear Up  Uncertainty." After elaborating on the dim North-South  relations caused by North Korea's closed-door policy against the  trends of the world, the editorial notes: "North Korea, which  claimed that the issues concerning the North and the South  should be resolved by the parties concerned, assumes the  attitude to hold negotiations with the United States over the  issues concerning the Korean peninsula. This clearly shows  North Korea's double-dealing attitude." Referring to North  Korea's nuclear issue, the editorial notes: "We should not have  hasty expectations and excessive pessimism about the issues  concerning the North and the South. To settle the nuclear  negotiations, measures should be taken to resume the essential  North-South dialogue." Referring to the North Korean- U.S.  negotiations, the editorial reports: "The United States and  North Korea have focused their negotiations on the international  inspection team's entry into the North, thus ignoring the issue  of developing a method to effectively inspect North Korea's  nuclear facilities." The editorial then stresses that "under  such circumstances, if the United States unilaterally announces  the discontinuation of the Team Spirit exercise and the  scheduling of the third round of the North Korean-U.S.  high-level talks, this will result in ignoring the essence of  removing suspicions about North Korea's nuclear development.  Our repeated demand is that it be a prerequisite to ensure  North Korea's nuclear transparency."    The editorial notes: "Even though the United States and  North  Korea have agreed upon a principle, it is not desirable to  assume an excessive optimistic attitude toward overall  North-South relations. Kim Il-song strongly denounced the  civilian government in his New Year address. This clearly shows  that North Korea has still not changed. Worse still, Kim  Il-song repeatedly revealed the attitude that the nuclear issue  should be resolved through negotiations with the United States  and that reunification should be achieved by means of a  confederation. This is the attitude that shows North Korea has  obtained almost everything through negotiations with the United  States." The editorial concludes: "If North Korea adheres to a  line of isolation, it is impossible for North Korea to exist.  The world will not sit back and watch North Korea go against  peace and the trends of the times. North Korea should become a  member of the international community and participate in the  North-South dialogue and exchange by ensuring its nuclear  transparency."    The moderate Seoul TONG-A ILBO in Korean on 4 January  carries  on page 3 a 900-word editorial entitled "The Difference in Views  Between the Two Heads of the North and the South" and notes the  desire of the people to solve North Korea's nuclear issue and to  improve North-South relations. After comparing the new year  addresses of President Kim Yong-sam and President Kim Il-song,  the editorial quotes President Kim Yong-sam as stressing that:  "Resolving North Korea's nuclear issue early this year is an  absolute and vital task" and President Kim Il-song as saying:  "The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula must be resolved  through DPRK-U.S. talks" and "The South Korean civilian regime  is only so in appearance and is actually not different from the  preceding military dictatorial regime." After noting North  Korea's silence about the North-South dialogue, the editorial  notes: "North Korea should decide on its position toward the  North-South dialogue." The editorial then raises questions  about the government's position toward the solution of North  Korea's nuclear issue and the issue of exchange of special  envoys. The editorial concludes by reporting that North Korea  is full of distrust of South Korea.    The moderate Seoul TONG-A ILBO in Korean on 4 January  carries  on page 4 a 1,400-word article by Pak Che-kyun entitled "The  Meaning Contained in Kim Il-song's New Year Address." The  article notes that "in his New Year address, President Kim  Il-song strongly emphasized improving relations with the United  States and on strengthening friendship and cooperation with  Western countries, including Japan." After noting that  President Kim Il-song stressed that North Korea's nuclear issue  should be resolved through talks with the United States, the  article notes: "This is the first time President Kim himself  stressed the nuclear negotiations with the United States. This  proves that North Korea puts great efforts into improving  relations with the United States." Referring to economic  development, the article notes that Kim Il-song admitted great  difficulties and obstacles in economic construction and  mentioned agriculture-first, light industry-first, and  trade-first policies. After elaborating on Kim Il-song  emphasizing strengthening military power, the article notes:  "Experts view Kim Il-song's emphasis on military power as  consolidating its inner system, which may easily slacken as a  result of opening up and economic development." After noting  that Kim Il-song strongly denounced South Korea and placed the  responsibility for failure of exchange of special envoys on the  South side, the article comments: "It is expected that North  Korea will attach importance to nongovernmental dialogue led by  experts of South Korean affairs, including Vice President Kim  Yong-chu, rather than dialogue between the authorities."</p>

			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: POP MUSIC  </P> <P> Ratt, the first San Diego heavy metal band to be signed by a major label, has  released its fifth album on Atlantic Records.  </P> <P> "Detonator" is much lighter and more commercial-sounding than their last album,  1988's "Reach for the Sky," which went gold but didn't sell nearly as well as  their previous albums. That's because all the songs on "Detonator" were  co-written with executive producer Desmond Child, who has penned hits for the  likes of Bon Jovi and Alice Cooper.  </P> <P> It was a good move, bringing in some outside help. Ever since their  double-platinum Atlantic debut, 1984's "Out of the Cellar," the members of Ratt  have been having an increasingly tough time coming up with new ideas. Yet they  persisted in writing their own material, repeating themselves over and over  again, until someone apparently convinced them a change was in order.  </P> <P> Hard-core head bangers might sneer at this new "Ratt Lite," but as far as I'm  concerned, the change is for the better. For once, there are actually songs  with distinct melodies, songs with hooks, songs that sound like songs instead  of a beer bottle cap stuck in a garbage disposal. "Lovin' You's a Dirty Job" is  a particularly radio-ready track; "Hard Time" is a great rock 'n' roll song  with some spectacular lead guitar work by Warren DeMartini.  </P> <P> Atlantic has also issued a Ratt video, "Detonator: Videoaction 1991." The  half-hour tape includes two tunes apiece off "Detonator" and "Reach for the  Sky," as well as an interview conducted by Little Richard.  </P> <P> Ratt began life in San Diego in the late 1970s as Mickey Ratt. It regularly  played the Spirit in Bay Park and various teen clubs, such as the long-gone  Journey in Kearny Mesa. In 1981, lead singer Stephen Pearcy moved the band to  Los Angeles and shortened its name to Ratt.  </P> <P> Several personnel changes later (which saw fellow expatriate San Diegans  DeMartini and guitarist Robbin Crosby join the group), Ratt was signed by  Enigma Records, which released the eponymous debut in 1983; a year later, Ratt  was picked up by Atlantic, for whom it has recorded ever since.  </P></p>

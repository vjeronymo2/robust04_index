			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: BABYFACE "TENDER LOVER." SOLAR ***: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF  ONE(POOR) TO FIVE(A CLASSIC) STARS  </P> <P> The best track here, "Soon as I Get Home," is an idealized "good man" answer to  Karyn White's "Superwoman," the crossover smash that Babyface and his producing  partner L.A. Reid wrote for her. Babyface comes off as the answer to every  girl's prayer: caring, generous to a fault, true blue and too good to be true.  With his matinee-idol looks and suave way with cool tunes like "My Kinda Girl"  and "Whip Appeal" (which is far tamer than the title implies), Babyface -- who  also records as the lead singer of the group the Deele -- stands poised to make  an impact as this year's black music heartthrob. Some of the cuts on his debut  LP are as chart-worthy as hits he and Reid have supplied for Bobby Brown, the  Whispers and Pebbles -- listen to the way he goes for broke and sings as if  he's got a point to prove on "Where Will You Go," the closing track. Babyface  doesn't sound like someone content with being a mere group member or a producer  of hits for other singers. Image intact and armed with a few good songs, he  appears ready to go the solo distance. CONNIE JOHNSON  </P></p>

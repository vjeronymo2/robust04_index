			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Thais plan drive against traffic The Thai government plans to force drivers to leave their cars on the outskirts of Bangkok, as the number of vehicles joining the traffic jams in the capital grows by 500 a day. The government had been hoping that three new elevated or underground urban railway projects would relieve the traffic crisis, which is costing the country millions of dollars. But it is clear that none of these alternative systems will be operating this century. The aim of the traffic scheme, says Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, would be to force commuters to leave their vehicles in one of two dozen special car parks on the edge of the city and take an improved bus service into the business and government district. However, finding a way to keep some drivers out while others are allowed in could prove difficult. One scheme the government is considering would only allow cars into the city when they were carrying two or more passengers. But a similar scheme introduced in Indonesia, where cars needed to carry four people to enter the city, saw a new industry take off as boys began hiring themselves out as passengers on the city outskirts. In Singapore, a scheme which allowed cars with number plates that ended with an even number and those ending with an odd number to enter the city on alternate days led to a rise in car sales as people made sure they had the appropriate plates. Thailand may try to get around these problems by making private car owners purchase special stickers to enter Bangkok. But many doubt the government will find a way to force Bangkok's burgeoning middle class to abandon the airconditioned safety of cars for the dubious comforts of a Thai bus. 'It'll never, ever happen. It's impractical,' says Mr Neil Semple, a research manager at brokers HG Asia. The government's transport planner argues the scheme will work as 'everyone agrees the current situation cannot go on. Maybe the super-rich will still take their cars - but they will be made to pay for the pleasure'. Mr Khunying Chodchoy Sophonpanich, who has led the campaign for an underground railway system, believes Thais use their cars far too much. 'This is the only was to ensure that there are fewer cars on the streets.' Meanwhile, the prime minister has vowed the government will press ahead with the rail projects, but bureaucratic infighting, technical and environmental problems and political opposition continue to block progress.</p>

			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Yeltsin's deputy quits as shake-up continues THE shake-up in the Russian cabinet continued yesterday with the resignation of Mr Genady Burbulis, first deputy prime minister and number two to Mr Boris Yeltsin, who is both president and head of government. This leaves Mr Yegor Gaidar, who was removed on Thursday from his post of finance minister, as the only first deputy prime minister, and thus as Mr Yeltsin's deputy. It confirms that Mr Gaidar remains very much in charge of economic reform - even though its pace is to be slowed through a loosening of credit policy. At the same time, however, a senior World Bank official said he was convinced the Russian government would continue radical economic reforms despite the easing of financial policies. Mr Wilfried Thalwitz, vice-president for Europe and Central Asia, also warned that enterprises would sooner or later have to suffer a credit crunch to force them into making structural adjustments. 'We will see an attempt to allow some temporary expansion of credit. . . but very carefully tailored not to lead to hyperinflation,' he said before a meeting with Mr Yeltsin yesterday. But he said the quicker the crunch came, the more likely the reform programme would succeed. Mr Burbulis, a long time associate of Mr Yeltsin, resigned 'at his own request', according to a statement from the president's office. He keeps his post as state secretary, and is expected to take over as head of Mr Yeltsin's administration - probably replacing Mr Yuri Petrov - when he vacates his government office on April 14. The statement also said Mr Burbulis would oversee domestic and foreign policy and the political aspects of the government's reform plan, as well as looking after personnel policies and relations with political partries. The wide nature of his duties points as much to a promotion as a demotion, though he is removed from the immediate fire of the deputies, who may try to reassert their power to veto cabinet appointments - a power they surrendered last year at the request of Mr Yeltsin. A government official told Russian journalists that he 'will be in charge of all presidential structures and will co-ordinate the work of the police force, security and foreign intelligence'. Such a post would carry immense power, and brings together under one man oversight of agencies which Mr Yeltsin had wished to unify in one ministry, only to be thwarted by a decision of the Constitutional Court. His sacrifice from his government post, together with Mr Gaidar's symbolic surrendering of the Finance Ministry to Mr Vasily Barchuk, a long-time finance official, is designed to deflect some of the criticism which the government expects at the sixth Congress of Peoples Deputies, which begins on Monday. Meanwhile Mr Yeltsin is to appoint two deputy defence ministers to the recently formed Russian Defence Ministry, which he heads. They are General Pavel Grachev,a deputy to Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the head of the Commonwealth armed forces, and Mr Andrei Kokoshin, deputy director of the USA-Canada Institute. Aides to Mr Ruslam Khasbulatov, the Russian parliament's leader, said last night that the parliamentary changes had been designed to placate his opposition, and hinted there might be more to come, even including the resignation of Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister. The government also announced more generous social protection to accompany the market reforms. Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister responsible for social affairs, said the minimum wage would be increased to Rbs900 from Rbs342, while minimum pensions would rise to Rbs800 from Rbs500. Wages would be regularly reviewed.</p>

Witnesses, who praised the pilot's evasive action, said the plane missed a home  by about 50 feet and plowed through a white picket fence.  </P> <P> Palmer said the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation  Administration advised the city Tuesday that they are "sifting through  everything" to determine what caused the plane's loss of power.  </P> <P> Neither agency could be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Pilot John Otey, 30, of Anaheim, and instructor Mike Simmon, 21, of Norwalk,  are both with Aviation Facilities Inc., of Fullerton, Buena Park police said.  "They are not making any comments to the press," a company employee who  answered the phone said.  </P></p>

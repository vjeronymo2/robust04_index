			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Denmark's hobby farmers may reap benefits of CAP reforms MR RAY MacSharry, the European Community's agricultural commissioner, is not about to become the Robin Hood of Europe - taking from the large, rich farmers and giving to small, poor farmers - according to a report published here. On the contrary, in Denmark's case the primary beneficiaries of Mr MacSharry's proposed reforms of the EC's common agricultural policy will be those relatively wealthy people who run farms as a hobby, the so-called tarmac farmers from the towns, and they are estimated to account for about half of all Danish farmers. Mr Niels Groes, head of research at the local government research institute (Amternes og Kommunernes Forskningsinstitut) in Copenhagen, who is the author of the report, believes that his findings could be relevant to many other parts of the European Community as well. He concludes that the effect of the proposed MacSharry reforms will be that 'the EC's farm support will go to university lecturers, company directors, postmen, teachers and other part-time farmers. These are not the kind of people who need a hand-out form the EC's coffers'. By a big reduction in the cereals price and through land set-aside programmes, the reforms will have a very serious adverse effect on the large, intensively-operated cereals and dairy farms, however, which means that they will have a second perverse effect. The large farms are found especially in the poorer parts of Denmark, which will thus be made poorer by the effects of the reforms, although Mr MacSharry's intention is that the reforms should benefit poorer regions. Instead, support will go to part-time farmers, who are found in the largest numbers around the big cities, such as Copenhagen and the Jutland capital of Arhus. Many part-time farmers, Mr Groes believes, will be able to achieve a substantial improvement in their incomes from land which at the moment they do not in fact cultivate. 'All they will have to do in future is to pretend they are cultivating the land, drive the old Ferguson tractor over the fields when they have the time and the sun in shining, and then drive past the bank to draw their subsidy,' he says. The perverse effects to which Mr Groes draws attention arise with Mr MacSharry's proposals for a drastic reduction in cereal prices and the extension of land set-aside programmes, which will be combined with direct subsidies to small farmers.</p>

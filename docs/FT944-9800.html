			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / NPC to reveal buy-out proposals National Parking Corporation is set to reveal details of a leveraged buy-out by venture capital institutions, expected to value the business at about Pounds 650m. The deal, due to be announced at NPC's annual meeting on December 5, is likely to be the largest UK venture capital buy-out so far this year. Prudential Venture Managers should unveil the agreed purchase of around 72 per cent of NPC's shares, primarily owned by founders Mr Ronald Hobson and Sir Donald Gosling, and charitable foundations of which they are directors. NPC owns National Car Parks, the biggest operator of car parks in the UK. Prudential has brought in backers Charterhouse Development Capital, Cinven, Electra, Montagu Private Equity, NatWest Ventures and Royal Bank Development Capital. They are expected to put up about 50 per cent of the cost as equity. The remainder will be funded by bank debt, to be arranged by a syndicate led by National Westminster Bank. The founders sold 28 per cent of the company to a number of financial institutions in 1986, and these are likely to be offered shares in the new company, as an alternative to the cash offer. It is understood that no final agreement on pricing has been reached. However, due diligence is complete, and NPC has written to shareholders saying: 'We hope to be able to give shareholders further information at the AGM', when the final offer should be revealed. Shareholders will also be asked to approve the adoption of new Articles of Association, paving the way for a change in ownership. The letter to shareholders accompanied NPC's latest set of profit figures, for the year to March 1994. Profits before exceptional items rose from Pounds 48.6m to Pounds 50.4m. However, total pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 50.5m (Pounds 53.3m). NPC was set up by Mr Hobson and Sir Donald in 1949, but for the past year the founders have been keen to sell. The joint chairmen were keen to ensure continuity for the existing management and turned down the option of a share disposal, via flotation. Other offers were received by their advisers, Morgan Grenfell, but the venture capital consortium put forward the highest bid. The attraction for the new investors is the strong and predictable cashflow from the UK's largest car parking group, and the potential earnings growth offered by its more dynamic subsidiary, Green Flag, which controls National Breakdown. Green Flag has been aggressively expanding National Breakdown into Europe, as well as setting up Home Emergency Service, a domestic repair group. A separate flotation could be launched once these businesses have matured. The share price of NPC, which trades on a matched bargain basis, has tailed off in recent weeks, closing at 537 1/2 p on Friday, compared with a 1994 high of 630p, which followed suggestions of a potential price tag of up to Pounds 800m. At Friday's closing price, NPC has a market capitalisation of Pounds 632m.</p>

			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Management: Why Chapter 11 does not tell quite the whole story - Nikki Tait assesses the pros and cons of sending in the cavalry to corporate casualties On a cold winter morning, the rust-belt town of Erie goes quietly about its business. Only the local court seems abnormally active as flurries of besuited lawyers hurtle up its steps. Inside, a marathon session is getting under way. During the next 12 hours, Judge Warren Bentz will hear how Wheeling-Pittsburgh, the nation's ninth largest steelmaker, plans to haul itself out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. He will snap at lawyers who raise long-winded objections to a package agreed between the company, its workers and major creditors. He will return for an unscheduled weekend sitting. And finally, several weeks later, he will sign an order which returns the company to the land of the living after five and a half years in corporate purgatory. This unwieldy, yet ultimately effective, proceeding could only occur in the US. Had Wheeling-Pittsburgh been a British company, it would almost certainly have gone into receivership in 1985, when slumping demand for steel coupled with heavy debts taken on to fund modernisation crippled its finances. Assets would have been sold off and the proceeds given to creditors. In the US, by contrast, the notion that corporate casualties should be rehabilitated is deeply ingrained. As one bankruptcy lawyer puts it: 'Our founding fathers wanted to start a new life, and that attitude is still at the heart of the legislation.' Even the American Constitution makes reference to bankruptcy laws. Accordingly, the 'Chapter 11' process has developed. In essence, this allows an ailing company to ask the courts for protection from its creditors while it reorganises its affairs. If granted, such protection prevents a company's assets being seized; allows a debtor to suspend certain interest and debt repayments; permits the debtor to cancel certain contracts; and means that suits against the debtor can only be pursued as a claim through the courts. Creditors, meanwhile, organise their own 'committees', which in turn gain access to information about the company's finances. The aim is to negotiate an agreement which either repays creditors (in part or in full), or gives them some stake in a revitalised company. To UK eyes, this arrangement is usually viewed with envy; earlier this year, for example, critics of the ILG collapse have claimed that the travel company's demise was needlessly swift. Indeed, in the last overhaul of UK bankruptcy legislation, the 1985 Insolvency Act introduced an 'administration' procedure modelled on Chapter 11, although its successful use has been limited. But from a US perspective, matters are not so simple. Thanks to the corporate leveraging rife in the 1980s and to the recessionary climate of the 1990s, bankruptcy has been a growth industry. Coupled with the demise of the takeover business, top law firms - like Skadden, Arps - have been beefing up their presence in this area. So what are the pluses and minuses of the process? On the first score, Chapter 11 can obviously work - preserving jobs, manufacturing capacity and so on. Wheeling-Pittsburgh is a good example. Today, the company still employs over 6,000 people, has annual sales of around Dollars 1bn, and forecast profits of Dollars 32.5m after-tax for 1991 - although, given the present climate in the steel industry, analysts' expectations are significantly lower. Unsecured creditors, meanwhile, have been repaid 71 cents in the dollar. True, the company sold off major facilities in Monessen, a small steel community outside Pittsburgh, while in Chapter 11. Although these operations were largely acquired by other steel manufacturers, the town wears a depressed air. But Wheeling-Pittsburgh itself boasts a newly-modernised facility at Steubenville on the Ohio-West Virginia border, and has generally adjusted production to higher value-added items. That, suggests Leonard Wise, who chaired the company through the final throes of the Chapter 11 process, could only be done under its protection. 'The cost of terminating Monessen would have lead to defaults on existing debt anyway,' he says. More generally, figures for the success rate of the process are hard to come by. According to Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the financial information group, around 60,000 companies failed last year and about one-fifth entered Chapter 11, but it does not track subsequent performance. Academic studies are limited in their scope. One, conducted at Tulane University, New Orleans, looked at American or New York Stock Exchange companies which went bankrupt between 1979 and 1986, and had their cases handled in seven major jurisdictions. There were 51 filings altogether, and by mid-1989, 30 companies had been rehabilitated. Chapter 11 is time-consuming and costly. Periods spent under this protection vary enormously from company to company, but Wheeling's 69-month sojourn is by no means a record. The Tulane study, for example, suggested that the average time taken by the 30 firms to reorganise was two and a half years and the longest over eight years. This means that the direct costs attached to the process can mount and eat into the debtor's estate. It only takes a brief visit to a bankruptcy court to see why. At the first Pan Am bankruptcy hearing, for example, at least five airlines were represented. So were suppliers and lessors, like GE Capital. So were government agencies, such as the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. So were unions, ranging from the airline pilots to the Teamsters. Most of these organisations employed outside counsel and, as lawyers announced their credentials, the packed courtroom listened to a roll-call of New York's most prestigious law firms. Generalising about costs - even if the indirect impact on the business of a bankruptcy filing is ignored - is difficult. However, at least one study has suggested that the direct expense of an 'average' Chapter 11 proceeding may be ten times that of a debt restructuring conducted outside the courtroom. Judges, aware of this criticism, have made some moves to cut back fees. Last month, for example, a judge in the complex Southmark bankruptcy case chipped Dollars 3m off the Dollars 54.2m demanded for work in the year-long proceedings. There is also much debate over whether, and how, the process can be shortened. One major bone of contention is a provision which gives a debtor the exclusive right to propose a plan of reorganisation for the first 120 days after a Chapter 11 filing. 'Exclusivity' can also be extended - and, in the case of the Manville bankruptcy, the debtor succeeded in doing so ten times. Only when this period ends can other parties make suggestions. Many lawyers argue that a more restricted period of exclusivity would accelerate, and enhance, the process. But in reality, it is often down to a judge - like the one who dealt with Wheeling - to keep matters on track. This can lead to some brutal bullying. As claims in the Drexel bankruptcy rose to a ludicrous Dollars 20bn-plus, for example, Judge Milton Pollack threatened to liquidate the investment bank unless the lawyers pared their claims. But here a second concern comes into play - namely, the extent of the judge's discretion. Although the aim is a negotiated settlement, it is often up to the judge to maintain the balance between debtor's and creditors' interests. This is no easy task, and a suspicion that courts bend towards the debtor is widespread. The point was made forcibly in the case of Eastern Airlines. Back in November, creditors were sufficiently alarmed at the rate of losses made by the bankrupt carrier, to suggest that it should should be forced into liquidation before all their money was lost. The judge decided otherwise (supporting Eastern's management), but three months later, the carrier grounded its fleet anyway. That decision may have cost the creditors Dollars 135m. Another difficult area concerns the extent to which claims can/should be traded. At present, the situation is relatively permissive, and in practice trade claims, as well as publicly quoted stocks, change hands. On the one hand, this introduces practised 'bankruptcy investors' into the process. On the other, it raises the question of how closely bankruptcies should be monitored for possible 'insider trading'. In Wheeling's case, for example, a group headed by New York-based businessman, Ron LaBow, acquired most of the bank claims, making it the principal secured creditor and, under the reorganisation scheme, the largest single shareholder. This investor group then played a pivotal role in pushing through a critical agreement between the company and its steel unions. While this may bring short-term advantages - such investors tend to be good negotiators - it is questionable whether they always act in the long-term interests of the company. Wheeling's 'rebirth' has been untimely in terms of sector conditions, and Wise, a well-respected steel industry veteran, has departed. This leads on to the broader management question. When a company files for Chapter 11, the incumbent directors are left in place - a clear contrast with the UK's administration procedure, which introduces an independent trustee. Yet, in many cases, these are the very managers who have played a part in the company's demise. It has been reckoned that only half the directors of a financially distressed company are likely to stay with the business throughout reorganisation. But the process of dislodging recalcitrant executives often depends on the energy of the creditors' committee and the leanings of the judge. But perhaps the most fundamental worry about the process is that it keeps ailing firms in business - and even offers them some additional operating advantages. All too easily, the bankrupt company's need to chase cash flow can produce business strategies which are detrimental to healthier competitors. This has been particularly noticeable in the airline industry. Eastern Airlines, for example, drove down prices on some East Coast routes last year. This, in turn, forced relatively successful rivals, like Delta, to match such fares. Similar arguments could be made about the retail sector, where distressed companies have exacerbated price-cutting. At the end of the day, then, it is endlessly debatable whether the pluses of Chapter 11 outweigh its minuses. But before European eyes glance jealously at the American bankruptcy system, it might be wise to remember that corporate rehabilitation does have its price.</p>

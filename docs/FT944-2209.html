			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Mercosur set for January 1 The four South American countries in the Mercosur trade group yesterday settled all their differences and said they were ready for the trade area to become a full customs union from January 1 as planned. Foreign ministers from Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay reached agreement on a number of outstanding problems after a hectic night of negotiation. The agreements will be included in the document, to be known as the protocol of Ouro Preto, which is to be signed by the four presidents today and will give Mercosur a similar legal status to the European Union. The protocol also sets out rules for the Mercosur institutions such as an arbitration system for disputes and rules to promote competition and ease customs procedures. The four countries agreed the final lists of products, mainly those considered unready to face full competition, which will be allowed to keep domestic tariffs for four more years rather than cut them to zero immediately.</p>

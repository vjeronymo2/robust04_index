			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> PUBLIC HEALTH GROUP RECEIVES $38,000  </P> <P> The Ventura County immunization program for infants and children will get  $38,000 in state funds, the Board of Supervisors decided Tuesday.  </P> <P> The allocation is $1,000 more than Public Health Services received last year,  but still is not nearly enough, said Carol McSorley, supervising public health  nurse.  </P> <P> "We're grateful for what we do get, but it barely even covers the salaries,"  she said.  </P> <P> The county has documented 25 measles cases so far this year, more than double  the 12 cases in all of 1989.  </P> <P> "The measles epidemic in the state and the county is a big problem. . . . It's  a disgrace to public health in this day and age, since it is a preventable  disease," she said.  </P> <P> The state also supplies $300,000 worth of vaccine, and the county contributes  money from the general health fund.  </P> <P> The county's goal is to immunize 98% of children entering kindergarten and 95%  of infants and preschool students.  </P></p>

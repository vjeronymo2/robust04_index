			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FREEZES IN FLORIDA, TEXAS LIKELY TO GIVE CONSUMERS A CHILL  </P> <P> The South's rare white Christmas weekend, which brought subfreezing  temperatures all along the Gulf Coast, will be felt by consumers across the  country in the form of higher food prices early next year, farm experts  predicted Tuesday.  </P> <P> The cold snap devastated the citrus crop in Florida and Texas, destroyed  budding strawberries and wiped out whole fields of winter vegetables destined  for East Coast supermarkets.  </P> <P> The freeze also created strong demand for fuel at the same time the cold  weather shut down refineries and froze natural gas wells in the Gulf of Mexico,  resulting in prices that shot up by record amounts.  </P> <P> On the other hand, Florida's major industry -- tourism -- scarcely missed a  beat, at least once jet liners were able to drop off vacationers at airports  unequipped for snow removal.  </P> <P> Crop Damage  </P> <P> Along with higher food prices for shoppers early in the new year, there was  fear, too, that the cold snap may have a more lasting effect on growers in both  Texas and Florida, many of whom were hard hit by two other crop-destroying  freezes in the past six years.  </P> <P> "This is the kind of freeze that puts people out of business," observed Freddy  Strano, who grows 2,000 acres of tomatoes near the Everglades.  </P> <P> In Texas, state agriculture officials estimated that 70% of the citrus crop and  80% of the winter vegetable crops were destroyed when temperatures plunged into  the low 20s and upper teens Saturday and Sunday. Florida wrote off 40% of its  $1.4-billion citrus crop, which fuels a juice industry that normally generates  $3.5 billion a year for the state's economy.  </P> <P> One immediate result was to delay the start of trading in orange juice futures  at the New York Cotton Exchange, where the contracts are bought and sold.  Trading limits were imposed, but Bill O'Neill, director of research for Elders  Futures, said it was "impossible to tell" how high prices might soar. The most  active January contract closed 16.10 cents a pound higher at 153.10 cents.  </P> <P> Also hard hit were unprotected fields of tomatoes, strawberries, eggplants,  green peppers, sweet corn, lettuce and cucumbers, destined mainly for markets  east of the Mississippi River. Major damage was reported to avocado, lime and  mango crops. Florida horticulturists also reported heavy losses of ferns, which  will mean a shortage of traditional greenery to accompany bouquets of roses  next Valentine's Day.  </P> <P> The freeze will impose a six-week delay in the flow of fresh strawberries to  market that was to begin in January. Production gaps of varying length for the  other crops will show up in supermarkets until replantings are ready for  harvest in spring.  </P> <P> For citrus growers in both states, however, the true measure of the loss will  not occur until next month when they will know whether their trees survived.  Many hoped that colder-than-normal weather earlier had prepared the groves to  withstand the below-freezing temperatures that left much of the South with its  first white Christmas in decades.  </P> <P> "If the freeze damages just the oranges, there is a real chance to recover and  produce another crop next year," said Rick Bush, spokesman for the Florida Farm  Bureau Federation. But previous freezes in 1983 and 1985 killed whole groves of  orange and grapefruit trees, and some growers moved from central Florida  farther south where their new groves were only now reaching full production.  </P> <P> Tuesday's warming spelled more bad news, since ice-laced oranges can still be  made into juice concentrate if they can be harvested before they rot. "Now we  prefer that the temperature stay in the 40s and 50s for a month to allow us to  get the fruit off the trees," Bush said. "The longer it stays cool, the more  that can be processed."  </P> <P> Fruit growers in both Florida and Texas' Rio Grande Valley said temperatures  appear to be rising too fast to salvage much. The fresh-fruit market, which  offers growers the best prices for their crop, is a total loss, they said.  </P> <P> Loss of winter fruits and vegetables from Florida and Texas will also cause  some brief gaps in availability of fresh produce in the West, predicted Jan  DeLyer of the Fresh Produce Council in Los Angeles. Eastern crops allow markets  to maintain supplies until Mexico reaches peak production in mid-January,  followed a few weeks later by California.  </P> <P> But reduced supplies from Florida and Texas will increase demand -- and  therefore prices -- for California and Mexico produce, DeLyer said.  </P> <P> A U.S. Department of Agriculture official said orange juice price increases may  be tempered by record stocks being exported by Brazil.  </P> <P> Energy Demand  </P> <P> Fuel-price shocks were exacerbated by fears of short supply in the wake of a  Christmas Eve explosion at Exxon Corp.'s refinery at Baton Rouge, La., and  smaller refinery fires elsewhere. January heating oil contracts spiked 10.74  cents above Friday's level to close at 92.48 cents a gallon on the New York  Mercantile Exchange, a record one-day movement.  </P> <P> Partly in sympathy, February contracts for West Texas Intermediate, the  benchmark U.S. crude, rose 62 cents to close at $21.91 a barrel.  </P> <P> "The whole heating system is under pressure because this cold wave is so  widespread," said John Lichtblau, president of the industry-funded Petroleum  Industry Research Foundation in New York. He said heating oil prices were les  than 60 cents a gallon a month ago. Demand for distillates, including home  heating oil and diesel fuel, was up 15% to 20% nationwide and as much as 25% to  30% on the East Coast.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Exxon's 450,000-barrel-a-day Baton Rouge refinery will remain shut  indefinitely after an explosion that killed one worker and burned storage tanks  holding millions of gallons of heating oil and other fuels. A second Exxon  refinery, in Baytown, Tex., slowed production because of unusual cold weather  in the Houston area. A spokesman said enough heating oil remains in inventory  and pipelines for Exxon to meet contracts at least through the first week of  January.  </P> <P> A Phillips Petroleum Co. refinery in Sweeny, Tex., damaged by a fire Friday,  will remain closed for at least a week. A fire also damaged an Amoco refinery  in Casper, Wyo.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, the cold was wreaking havoc on Gulf Coast refineries. Marathon Oil  Co.'s 250,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Garyville, La., was expected to remain  closed for at least a few more days after equipment froze. Mobil Corp.'s  280,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Beaumont, Tex., similarly had a weekend  shutdown because of the cold.  </P> <P> Heavy demand for natural gas along the frigid East Coast was squeezing supplies  even in balmy Los Angeles. On Saturday, when Southern California Gas received  about 60% of its normal supply, the utility alerted its nonresidential,  industrial customers about a possible curtailment of supply, but that turned  out to be unnecessary, said utility spokesman Ralph Cohen.  </P> <P> Federal officials met Saturday in Washington with about 80 state and industry  representatives and agreed to waive certain rules to ease the transportation of  home heating oil, natural gas and propane to hard-hit areas, said Mary Kayne  Heinze of the Department of Energy.  </P> <P> Frozen Gulf of Mexico gas wells were expected to be back in operation now that  gale-force winds have subsided and crews can get to offshore platforms to thaw  equipment, said Mack Price, spokesman for Panhandle Eastern Corp. in Houston.  </P> <P> Tourism  </P> <P> The freeze did not affect Florida's $20-billion tourism industry -- mainly,  said industry observers, because vacationers consider such weather aberrations  as just that. Temperatures in the 70s and 80s are expected to return to Florida  by this weekend.  </P> <P> Moreover, many vacationers make their plans far in advance, often purchasing  airline tickets that are nonrefundable. In addition, Florida's busiest vacation  period doesn't start until February, running into April.  </P> <P> "We have not seen any cancellations," said Carlos Giraldo, general manager of  the Central Reservation Service, a company that helps vacationers needing to  find space in Florida. "In fact, there is a shortage of rooms, especially the  two busiest destinations, Miami and Orlando, beginning Wednesday through New  Year's Day."  </P> <P> Some people were prevented from getting to Florida and other destinations such  as Charleston, S.C., and Savannah, Ga., because the airports there and in some  other cities were closed for much of the Christmas weekend because they lacked  equipment to remove snow.  </P> <P> Delta Air Lines was forced to cancel about 30 flights during the weekend.  United Airlines reported a higher-than-normal number of "no-shows" for flights  over the weekend. But only people with tickets having no restrictions were able  to make such last-minute plans, and United's advance bookings for the busy  Florida tourist season are heavy, a spokesman said.  </P> <P> However, the closed airports may have increased business at some resorts. "We  probably trapped more (travelers) than (those) we didn't get," said Jean  McComb, director of communications for the Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce.  Jacksonville is not a big destination point for Christmas weekend travelers.  Moreover, the area had more sleet than it had in the last century, she added.  </P> <P> The Sea Turtle Inn &amp; Hotel also had a captive clientele for a while, said  Dodie Jones, sales manager of the inn, which is on the beach near Jacksonville.  "We had a lot of people . . . stuck at the hotel because the airport was shut  down," she said. Jones added that guests who had planned to visit families on  Saturday were unable to do so, packing the inn's restaurant, she said, while  others, unable to get out of Florida, extended their stays.  </P> <P> Times Staff Writers Patrick Lee in Los Angeles, Robert E.

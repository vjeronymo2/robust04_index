			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by the ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Excerpts] Kishinev [Chisinau] 31 March -- The parliament  of Moldova has today elected Andrei Sangheli, one of the leaders  of the Agrarian-Democratic Party, which won the parliamentary  elections, the Republic's prime minister. Voting in favor were  82 deputies; 15 were opposed. [passage omitted]    The new prime minister supports the joining by Moldova of  the  CIS and the economic union, as well as restoring and  strengthening ties with the commonwealth countries since the  lion's share of Moldovan economy is oriented toward their market.    In an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, Andrei  Sangheli said that the former Cabinet of Ministers had not been  a team of like-minded persons because it consisted of  representatives of various parties. In his words, the victory  of the agrarians in the elections makes it possible to form a  new government, made up of professionals with a pragmatic  approach who will speed up the economic reform and bring Moldova  out of the crisis.    The prime minister will submit the list of members of the  new  cabinet to the parliament as soon as next week.</p>

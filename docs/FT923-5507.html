			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / UK Company News: S African bank in talks to buy H Ansbacher THE FIRST National Bank of South Africa, one of the republic's largest banks, yesterday said it was at an advanced stage in talks to buy Henry Ansbacher Holdings, the small UK merchant bank. If the negotiations prove successful it will be the first time a South African bank has acquired a British bank. The takeover would need the Bank of England's approval. Mr Barry Swart, managing director of First National said 'We have had in-depth talks with Ansbacher and hopefully we will reach a conclusion within the next several weeks.' First National was formerly an associate of Barclays before the British bank disinvested from South Africa in 1986. Ansbacher said discussions about being taken over by the British merchant bank Singer &amp; Friedlander had ceased. Its shares remained unchanged at 26p. The talks, along with the recent decision of the Standard Bank of South Africa to open an office in London, mark the beginning of the republic's attempts to re-establish itself in Europe with a view to earning hard currency and attracting European investment into South Africa. Senior directors of First National's merchant banking arm, First Corp Merchant Bank, which acquired the merchant banking operations in South Africa of Citicorp of the US five years ago, are leading the negotiations with Ansbacher in London. The British merchant bank specialises in South African and third world debt. 'We have found that we are unable to service our multi-national clients satisfactorily without a European presence', Mr Swart said. 'We have therefore been looking to expand into Europe and London is an obvious first port of call.' He said his proposed takeover of Ansbacher was also motivated by the need to extend its dealing services and trade South African securities in London. Two of Ansbacher's main shareholders - Pargesa, the Swiss investment group controlled by Belgians and Canadians, and Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, which together own about 62 per cent of the shares - have backed the decision to talk to First National Bank. The shareholders had been in talks with Singer &amp; Friedlander. Ansbacher recently unveiled interim pre-tax profits ahead from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 1.9m for the six months to end-June. For the year to end-December Ansbacher incurred a Pounds 8.2m loss after making heavy loan provisions. The half-year profit increase was driven mainly by strong performances from the off-shore operations and asset trading.</p>

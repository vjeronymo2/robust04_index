			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Mortgage lenders to identify charges Borrowers should be given clearer information about the valuation and administration fees which mortgage lenders charge, the Council of Mortgage Lenders said yesterday, Alison Smith writes. The council's decision followed pressure from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which reported in the spring that competition was being distorted by the failure of some lenders to tell borrowers about the administration fees that might be included with valuation fees. Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, said lenders would now identify separately their charges for arranging a mortgage and the payments to surveyors to valuations. The MMC inquiry began more than two years ago after complaints that lenders refused to take valuations from independent surveyors and used only small lists of approved valuers. Sir Bryan said that in a separate move the council had also adopted an MMC proposal that where a lender would accept valuations only from certain valuers this should be made apparent at an early stage.</p>

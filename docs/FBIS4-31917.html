			<p>BFN     [Text] The government spokesman has sent us a communique  with the following content:    During the evening hours, negotiations continued between the  government commission -- consisting of Dan Mircea Popescu,  minister of state and minister of labor and social protection;  Florin Georgescu, minister of state and minister of finance;  Viorel Hrebenciuc, general secretary of the government; and  Octavian Partenie, state secretary and head of the office for  relations with the employers and trade unions -- and the  delegation of the Alfa Cartel national trade union  confederation, headed by its Chairman Bogdan Hossu.    During the last round of negotiations, which concluded today  at about 2000, the government negotiators and the Alfa Cartel  representatives signed a convention that contains, among other  things, a number of solutions to the basic problems formulated  by the union party.    They established, in mutual agreement, new ways to implement  Government Decision 13, which refers to that part of salaries  for which no additional taxes are to be paid. It was accepted  that new efficiency indicators will be recognized other than  those established by Government Decision 171 of 1994, such as  increases in physical labor productivity, increases in the  weight of the income earned from exports in the balance of  companies' total income, and others.    Referring to the conclusion of the collective labor  contracts, the parties agreed that before 22 June 1994 the  divergent points between the Alfa Cartel and the employers is to  be mediated by Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu.    They also agreed upon the finalization of certain draft laws  with a union connotation and the government pledged to forward  them to Parliament in emergency procedure.    They found solutions suiting both parties on the observance,  in the case of retirees, of the salary grades acquired between  1990-1994, as well as a new mechanism of indexing salaries and  minimal salaries throughout the whole economy. According to the  convention, minimal salaries are to be increased beginning 1  July 1994 to 65,000 lei per month, and every three months the  government, together with the trade unions and the employers,  will reestablish its level in accordance with the evolution of  macroeconomic indicators and average salaries in each economic  branch.    The conclusion of the negotiations between the government  and  the trade unions, with results that both parties termed  satisfactory, proves once more the government's readiness to  dialogue and its realistic way of approaching the problems  raised by the trade union confederations. The idea ought to be  reiterated that open dialogue, rather than the pressure of the  street, represents the sole way of solving all hardships that  emerge in the evolution of society, concludes the communique  sent to us via fax by the government spokesman.    After the aforementioned convention was elaborated, the  union  representatives who had attended the negotiations with the  government read out the text of that document in Victory Square;  it was then approved, point by point, by the persons in that  square.    At about 2120 the government party and the union delegation  signed the convention. According to Alfa Cartel leader Bogdan  Hossu, the trucks that have been parked in front of the  government headquarters for the past three days are scheduled to  leave Victory Square at this time.</p>

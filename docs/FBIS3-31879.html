			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Peter Boross by Joseph </F> Pozsgai; place and date not given: "We Need Calm"]    [Text] [Pozsgai] What are the chances of the Hungarian  Democratic Forum [MDF], the leading party of the government  coalition, of keeping its position at the parliamentary  elections in May?    [Boross] I cannot give you a percentage. I believe that it  has a chance -- undoubtedly, after a series of unpopular  measures. A question mark always hangs over a chance like this.  However, it is certain that the public view of the MDF has  improved. This is, somewhat, also supported by the economic  situation and the hopes based on this, therefore, if this  continues, we might reach a better result in May than has  previously been predicted by many people.    [Pozsgai] Can you expect a strong shift to the left in  Parliament as happened in Poland, Lithuania, and Russia?    [Boross] Certainly not as strong, in my view. In addition,  the left wing is rather divided. Certain coalition versions  exist on the left wing but, I dare say, I do not think this will  actually happen when the time comes. Hungary does not have a  party that is so clearly committed to the successor party that  it would also be suitable for coalition. As far as I can see,  some of its members would welcome this, while other would not.  Therefore, the Polish analogy does not apply to us. In the  meantime, we also have to consider that the non-compliance with  left-wing needs has its consequences in Poland and the Hungarian  public is informed about this through television.    [Pozsgai] In 1993, we received unfavorable economic news  from Hungary: Export reduction, agricultural decline, and the  continuation of a restrictive monetary policy that reduces  production, demand, and thus state revenue. It is self-evident  that this monetary policy leads to further increases in the  state's foreign debts. What is the justification for continuing  this economic policy?    [Boross] In my view, the Hungarian monetary policy is not  restrictive. This statement is certainly not true. Anyone who  is familiar with the Hungarian economic conditions knows very  well that Hungary is forced to be part of international trade.  The ratio of exports and imports in the Hungarian economy is  extremely high. The problem arose mainly from the fact that the  Western economic recession induced reduced demand for Hungarian  export products, and the often mentioned motor of Europe,  Germany, did not show its best side with its economic growth  being around zero percent instead of being higher. Evidently,  all this is supplemented by the fact that we convert the economy  at a certain speed and this is impossible without temporary  losses, including the uneconomic export bases.    [Pozsgai] If the European Union continues to refuse the  increase of imports from Eastern Europe, would it not be  possible at least for the "Visegrad countries" to create a  "common market" for themselves the way the six Western European  countries began to set up the EEC in 1957? This could even  accelerate gaining membership of NATO.    [Boross] Those were six developed West-European countries  with very well developed economies. We once were part of a bloc  based on an undeveloped economic basis, which destroyed the  Hungarian economy. All Visegrad countries are in a state of  change. Therefore, it is in their vital interests that they not  only coordinate affairs between themselves (where, of course,  practical relations do exist that have to be used and even  improved), but they also adjust to the most developed region of  the world that draws the Hungarian technical level, product  quality, and therefore, many factors, toward its level. It  makes demands against the Hungarian economy. We need these  demands so that one day we will become suitable for common  market membership, which, naturally, is one of our ambitions.    [Pozsgai] How are relations between Budapest and Bonn just  now? I am asking this on the occasion of your forthcoming visit  to Bonn. According to our information, relations were excellent  at the time of the change of the regime, during the fuel crisis  [not further specified], and even after that, but later they  became more quiet.    [Boross] Fortunately, events do not always occur that would  specially highlight good relations. During these crises,  Germany did indeed support us, but this is continuing.  Chancellor Kohl and former Prime Minister Jozsef Antall had a  special relationship. I think that this is widely known. When  Chancellor Kohl was here at the funeral, I had an opportunity to  meet him and I was glad to see that he applied the same intimate  style with me. This gives me hopes that this good relationship  will continue on the same level. It is self-evident that, in a  relationship, it is not possible only to ask for things and  request donations. This is not my goal. I would like a  cooperation that has more advantages for us -- simply because of  the power conditions -- but I am certainly not thinking of  relations that would embarrass Germany because we might not be  able to keep within the limits. We are. I will be talking to  the chancellor on these terms.    [Pozsgai] In the German television and press, it is mainly  the Hungarian left wing that represents Hungary and it often  gives a distorted picture of the domestic situation. Why is the  Hungarian center passive in this area?    [Boross] Because we are lagging behind in communication.  This communication is essentially the heritage of the former  regime, including a large section of its personnel -- mainly in  the first two years of our operation. The result is that a keen  political battle is going on here. The left wing suffered a  great disappointment at the 1990 elections because it had been  almost certain of its victory and, because of this, it often  oversteps the limits that are adhered to by the communications  experts of other countries' oppositions.    Indeed, these actions that damage our image are very  disturbing for us. Many of our domestic political battles are  also on this issue. Occasionally, astonishing news can appear  in Germany, and I can read striking distortions of my words in  newspapers. Similar images are shown on television, for  example, on the Gypsy issue. As far as I can remember, this did  happen, although it has nothing to do with the truth. We are  not in a good position regarding communications.    [Pozsgai] So the media war is still on. In my view, the  main reason for this is that the change of the regime has not  been implemented in the area of the media. The daily newspapers  had largely been privatized before the change of the regime,  therefore, they avoided the change of the regime.    [Boross] First of all, I would like to say that I can  remember that the Springer concern was a main enemy in the  previous, socialist-communist system in the West because of the  level of its anti-communism. Then Springer bought six communist  newspapers, and these are still edited by the same people as  before. I can only placet a large question mark next to this,  nothing else. This kind of problem did not exist in Germany.  The staff of the East German television was fundamentally  changed, and the Czechs did the same. This did not happen in  Hungary. There are many reasons for this, and we are now  suffering the consequences. The Hungarian transformation  insisted on legality and this prevailed during the changes. In  fact, as opposed to the eastern part of Germany, this change  actually began in the previous regime. Therefore, here, the  government never made any illegal or anti-constitutional  measures and was always moderate. This has many advantages, but  some disadvantages too, as is shown by the media issue.    [Pozsgai] The political developments in Russia  understandably worry the West. What do you think about  Zhirinovskiy? Can he become Yeltsin's successor?    [Boross] I dare not predict this, because political  personalities sometimes appear and then disappear from public  life. However, I dare say that the imperialist view and the  slogans corresponding to this may bring lasting popularity in  Russia, and this might mean a special advantage in politics --  even its extreme version. Therefore, in Russia, the imperial  mentality is stronger than the Russian mentality in people's  general views. A nationalist version of communism appeared  there -- I am now talking about the left wing.    [Pozsgai] Was Foreign Minister Jeszenszky's visit to  Belgrade unavoidable right now when the Bosnian conflict has  become more tense and the Serbs have been internationally  isolated?    [Boross] Let us be precise! Jeszenszky's visit and the  state secretary's visit preceding it took place before the  events you mentioned. Certain factors could have been taken  into consideration if communication in international politics  had been adequate. However, we also had to remember after all  that 400,000 Hungarians are living in fear in Vojvodina. I  think that we waited long enough. The foreign ministers of  other countries, for example of the NATO member Greece, had been  to Belgrade long before our visit was made. Hungary's interest  in putting the Vojvodina Hungarians at ease was expressed in  this visit -- some 100,000 members of this community have  already left, some of them to Hungary, others to all parts of  the world. In these circumstances, and recognizing that we will  still be living next to each other for centuries, and historical  experience also shows that it is dangerous to live in hostility,  especially with Serbia, therefore, I believe that we had to make  this step. We need peace here, on our southern border, and  peace is needed for the Hungarians in Yugoslavia. We do not  want to struggle with the problems of masses of refugees. They  should stay at home and the feeling of danger that they have  been living with for years should be reduced. Therefore, rump  Yugoslavia is our neighbor and it will remain so. It is, of  course, possible to give various pieces of advice. However, the  advice is coming from many thousands of kilometers away from  here. In such a case, we always have a strange feeling that  they might not be living the situation as we have to live  through it.</p>

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y to seek suspension of debt repayments OLYMPIA &amp; YORK is expected to ask its banks for a formal suspension of repayments on its debt, which exceeds Dollars 20bn, to provide time for an agreement to be reached on a permanent reorganisation of borrowings. However, O&amp;Y has been forced to postpone a meeting of all its banks which had been scheduled for Monday. The task of condensing information on all its borrowings, provided by more than 100 banks, proved too great in the time. O&amp;Y said yesterday that it now plans to hold the meeting on April 13. The company said in a statement that it will put forward an interim proposal at the meeting while it negotiates a longer-term plan. In addition, it plans to provide detailed information about what it described as its 'legal and organisation structures', and its financial condition. Last week, O&amp;Y was given an informal promise by 20 banks with the biggest loans to it that they would suspend debt repayments in advance of a meeting of all the banks. A complete reorganisation of O&amp;Y's debt is expected to take two years. O&amp;Y hopes its banks will suspend principal repayments until the reorganisation is completed. A steering committee of O&amp;Y's banks is being led by Citicorp, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. One item on the agenda at the full bank meeting is likely to be a request for funds to allow work to continue at the Canary Wharf development in London's Docklands.</p>

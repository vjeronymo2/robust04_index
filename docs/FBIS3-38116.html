			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Deric Henderson, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>   [Text] Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams tonight offered fresh  hope for peace in Northern Ireland.    Just hours after the Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick  Mayhew said he believed there could still be a positive response  by the provisionals to the Downing Street declaration, the man  who leads the political wing of the IRA said he was prepared to  go "the extra mile."    An end to the violence was now his personal and political  priority and he added: "I am willing to seek to persuade the IRA  to make a definitive decision on the conduct of its campaign."    Earlier at an Anglo-Irish Conference meeting in Dublin Sir  Patrick said there was still a chance of peace.    He said: "We believe we may yet see a positive response from  the provisionals. There are rational grounds for hope because  it is so much the will of, and the demand of the people of this  island."    Although Mr Adams did not renounce the use of IRA violence  --  the White House has sought that assurance before the State  Department allows him in to America to attend a major conference  in New York on Tuesday [1 February] -- the tone of his remarks  tonight were the most conciliatory since Mr Major and the  Republic's premier Mr Albert Reynolds signed the historic peace  initiative six weeks ago.    Mr Adams said: "I want to see an end to all violence and an  end to this conflict. I do not advocate violence. It is my  personal and political priority to see an end of the IRA and an  end to other organisations involved in armed actions.    "This means an end to the British Army presence and the  disbandment of the IRA. It means an end to Loyalist death  squads. In other words a demilitarisation of the situation.    "I am willing to seek to persuade the IRA to make a  definitive decision on the conduct of its campaign.    "I have said on a number of occasions my willingness to go  to  the IRA with a proposition when such a proposition is  forthcoming from the peace process."    Pressure on Sinn Fein mounted today when the U.S. government  effectively refused party president Adams his visa.    A statement in Washington said the White House would only  consider his application if he publicly renounced violence and  threw his support behind the Downing Street declaration.    At the same time, the first of four Sinn Fein "peace  commission" hearings to gauge reaction to the London-Dublin  statement within the republican movement was being held in  Londonderry.    Sir Patrick -- speaking after a meeting in Dublin of the  Anglo-Irish intergovernmental Northern Ireland Conference --  also appeared to offer greater scope than before for  clarification for the republicans of the December 15 document  signed by Prime Minister John Major and his Irish counterpart  Albert Reynolds.    Sir Patrick claimed that a letter sent by Mr Adams to Mr  Major amounted to a request for negotiation rather than  clarification.    He emphasised: "We will continue to make clear what the  document does and does not do. We continue to make speeches  that do just that.    "I do not believe there is anything between the two  governments on this and I certainly don't wish to see anybody  under any genuine misapprehension as to what the declaration  says.    "What I am not prepared to do is to negotiate. I am not  prepared to unravel something that has taken as long as this has  to put together, and which is very clear and comprehensive."    The conference meeting, initially set to end early this  afternoon, went on for more than six hours.    In a joint statement afterwards, Sir Patrick and joint  chairman Dick Spring, Ireland's deputy premier and foreign  minister, condemned recent violence in Ulster and said a range  of issues had been reviewed.    Sir Patrick relayed British disappointment at the Irish  government's recent decision to scrap a 20-year-old ban on  broadcasting interviews with members of the IRA, Sinn Fein and  other groups with paramilitary links. A similar ban continues  to operate in the UK.    Mr Adams said he was now actively engaged in developing an  unarmed strategy.    The Sinn Fein president added: "It should be encouraged, not  discouraged. Indeed, despite all the difficulties, Sinn Fein  has now moved to a position where our main function as a  political party is to build a peace process."    He said the development of that process, which included the  Downing Street declaration, was a response to his party's peace  strategy and the initiative undertaken between him and SDLP  leader John Hume.    Sinn Fein, he said, was committed to a peace settlement.    He added: "I am concerned, I am indeed anxious to be  persuaded that the Downing Street declaration can provide a  basis for us. And even if this is not the case, even if there  is a gap between what is required and what is on offer then we  should all move to bridge that gap. I am persuaded to go the  extra mile."    Apart from the Downing Street declaration, Mr Adams tonight  clearly had America on his mind when he spoke.    The White House is seeking a form of words which would  enable  President Clinton to issue a waiver of a long-term visa ban  imposed by the immigration authorities because of the Sinn Fein  president's alleged involvement in violence.    Mr Adams has been invited to address a conference in New  York  on Northern Ireland next Tuesday. It is being organised by the  National Committee on American Foreign Policy.    Senators Edward Kennedy and Christopher Dodd are among those  campaigning for a lifting of the ban, but the Speaker of the  House of Representatives, Mr Tom Foley, one of the most powerful  Irish Americans in Washington, is apparently opposed to it and  there is pressure from the British as well to resist any moves  to allow the Sinn Fein president in.    The leaders of the four main constitutional parties have  been  invited but it is understood the two Unionist leaders, Mr James  Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, have declined.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Zhengzhou, June 25 (XINHUA) -- China's major coal  producer, Henan Province, plans to invest 1.84 billion yuan  (about 220 million U.S. dollars) in the construction of a large  gasification network.    The project, approved by the State Council, is scheduled to  start late next year and be completed in three years.    The network will be centered in Yima city, a key coal  production base in the province. It will consist of a  gasification plant and a pipeline network.    Pithead coal gasification plants will be built at the Yima  coal mines.    The first phase of the construction will be aimed at  producing 1.2 million cu m of coal gas a day, 290,000 cu m of  which will be used to make petrochemical products and the rest  supplied to Luoyang and Zhengzhou cities for household use.    The second phase aims at a daily output of 2.4 million cu m  of gas to ensure supplies to the other key cities of Kaifeng,  Sanmenxia, Xuchang and Xinxiang.    Local officials predict that the construction of the network  will also help improve pollution control and spur local economic  development.    The province plans to use foreign funds and import advanced  technologies and equipment from other countries for the project.</p>

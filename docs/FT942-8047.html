			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Legal challenge to dam funding The government is facing a challenge in the High Court over its funding of the Pergau dam in Malaysia, Robert Rice writes. The World Development Movement, a lobby group for the Third World, will today launch an application for a judicial review of the decision taken in 1991 by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, to fund the dam. The group claims that 'the purpose for allocating the funds for the Pergau dam project was not a purpose permitted by the 1980 Overseas Development and Co-operation Act'. The group wants Mr Hurd's decision overturned and an order prohibiting him from 'making further payments out of aid funds for the Pergau dam project'. The UK has so far spent Pounds 24m on the dam. The remaining Pounds 200m is due to be paid to Malaysia through a soft loan over the next nine years.</p>

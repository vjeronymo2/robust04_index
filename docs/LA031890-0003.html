			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICHARD EDER: THE GREATEST WOMAN POET SINCE SAPPHO;  </P> <P> THE COMPLETE POEMS OF ANNA AKHMATOVA TWO VOLUMES TRANSLATED BY JUDITH  HEMSCHEMEYER, EDITED AND WITH AN INTRODUCTION BY ROBERTA REEDER (ZEPHYR PRESS:  $85; 1,530 PP., ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> The ship dwindles to the horizon and disappears; it is the watcher on the shore  whose heart is shrunk by absence. The sailor, for better or worse, is where he  is, life-size.  </P> <P> The night of Stalin's repression has been told in all kinds of ways, most  famously by Alexander Solzhenitsyn's books about the prison camps and their  inmates. But in the literature of Soviet suffering there may be no pages more  powerful than the cycle of poems by Anna Akhmatova entitled "Requiem."  </P> <P> Nothing inside the prison walls so fiercely expresses deprivation and injustice  -- with such a large intensity that it stands for an entire order of human loss  -- as her chronicle of the women who stood, year after year, outside those  walls. After the death of both hope and despair, they waited for word of the  fate of those within, and for the chance to hand a knitted cap through, or a  pair of shoes. Like the mothers of Argentina's Plaza de Mayo, years later, who  turned the "disappeared" into a visible presence, the Russian women, by  standing outside the city's jails, jailed the entire city:  </P> <P>  "That was when the ones who smiled  </P> <P>  Were the dead, glad to be at rest . . .  </P> <P>  And like a useless appendage, Leningrad  </P> <P>  Swung from its prisons."  </P> <P>  It is quite reasonable to think of Akhmatova, who died in 1966 at age 76, as  the greatest woman poet in the Western World since Sappho. In a monumental  endeavor, seemingly poised upon the frailest of underpinnings, the tiny Zephyr  Press of Somerville, Mass., has brought out the first complete collection of  her poems published anywhere in the world.  </P> <P> With original Russian versions and a supple translation that all but turns the  facing pages warm to the touch, the two-volume edition, more than 1,500 pages  in length, includes more than 700 poems -- some previously unprinted -- copious  notes, several introductions, prefaces and memoirs, and about 75 photographs  and drawings.  </P> <P> Among the introductory materials are recollections by the poet Anatoly Naiman,  one of Akhmatova's proteges, and Sir Isaiah Berlin, whose visit to Akhmatova in  1945 stirred up a mix of platonic and prophetic passions. Her poems reflecting  the visit are firestorms:  </P> <P>  "For a while you were my Aeneas --  </P> <P>  It was then I escaped by fire.  </P> <P>  We know how to keep quiet about one another.  </P> <P>  And you forgot my cursed house.  </P> <P>  You forgot those hands stretched out to you  </P> <P>  In horror and torment, through flame,  </P> <P>  And the report of blasted dreams . . ."  </P> <P>  Sir Isaiah's memoir, in almost comic contrast, is a mixture of awe and  reticence.  </P> <P> Roberta Reeder, who edited the collection and the notes, contributes a  monograph placing the poems in their historical and biographical context.  Judith Hemschemeyer, the translator, provides additional commentary. Among her  perceptive remarks is the point that Akhmatova's poetry, unlike that of many of  her contemporaries, nearly always addresses a second person, explicitly or  implicitly. The reader receives this burning gaze face to face.  </P> <P> Hemschemeyer's translations are not simply a work but a pilgrimage. A poet, she  read a few of Akhmatova's poems in translation about 25 years ago. She then  learned Russian so that, with the help of word-by-word literal versions, she  could translate them all. "I became convinced that Akhmatova's poems should be  translated in their entirety and by a woman, and that I was that person," she  writes.  </P> <P> Akhmatova's imperial largeness of spirit is catching, clearly. So is a portion  of her art. Hemschemeyer chose a very direct rendering, stressing clarity,  intimacy and an unforced syntax over any effort to pursue the original's rhymes  and sonorities. But she uses assonance and slant rhyme, and her seeming plain  style is governed by a lyrical ear. In truth, her translations are not so much  plain as transparent. If I did not know English, I would learn it to read them.  </P> <P> Akhmatova's life and her poetry were brutally cut in two by history. Born to a  well-to-do family, living a privileged childhood, she became a glittering  figure in the Bohemian literary world of pre-revolutionary St. Petersburg. She  was a member of the Acmeist circle of poets -- Osip Mandelstam, her lifelong  brother in poetry and suffering, was another -- and her first husband was a  poet.  </P> <P> She was a flaming creature. Taking into account her bipolar candle-burning, and  the long purgatory she underwent later on, one thinks of Edna St. Vincent  Millay turned into Mother Courage. Except that the poetry of her youth, hugely  successful, was also incomparably better. She wrote of childhood, of the  countryside, of the city, and of all varieties of love from girlish to adult  and adulterous.  </P> <P> She had a blinding sense of place and time. She fused the richness of things  and passions with a premonition -- and later, the memory -- of their  transience. Thus, an early poem evokes her sumptuous childhood garden together  with a stone bust, toppled beside the water:  </P> <P>  "He has given his face to the waters of the lake/And he's listening to the  green rustling./And bright rainwater washes/His clotted wound . . ./Cold one,  white one, wait,/I'll become marble too."  </P> <P>  There is the young girl considering her new-found sexuality:  </P> <P>  "In my room lives a beautiful/Slow black snake;/It is like me, just as  lazy,/Just as cold . . ."  </P> <P>  The quick desolation of an early marriage:  </P> <P>  "The heart's memory of the sun grows faint./The grass is yellower./A few early  snowflakes blow in the wind,/Barely, barely . . ./The willow spreads its  transparent fan/Against the empty sky./Perhaps I should not have become/Your  wife . . ."  </P> <P>  The excitement and insomnia of an affair:  </P> <P>  "Both sides of the pillow/Are already hot./Now even the second candle/Is going  out, and the cry of the crows/Gets louder and louder./I haven't slept all  night/And now it's too late to think of sleep .../How unendurably white/Is the  blind on the white window./Hello."  </P> <P>  There was the pride of a woman and a poet in her prime, addressing a no doubt  not imaginary lover:  </P> <P>  "Oh it was a cold day/In Peter's miraculous city./Like a crimson fire the  sunset lay,/And slowly the shadow thickened./Let him not desire my  eyes,/Prophetic and fixed./He will get a whole lifetime of poems/The prayer of  my arrogant lips."  </P> <P>  The revolution came, and suddenly poverty gnawed away her life and, worse, her  writing went out of favor. Poetry had to be hard and elevating. By 1925, the  literary leaders were saying that she should have had the intelligence to be  dead.  </P> <P> Hardship and the impossibility of publishing; expulsion from the Writers Union.  Worse was to come. The purges of the mid-1930s spared her, but her only son,  Lev, was arrested. For a year-and-a-half, she joined the lines outside the  Leningrad prison. And, in "Requiem," she found a voice again: harsh with  knowledge, powerful with anger, yet with all the lovely particularity of her  youth. Here, for example, comes word of the sentencing:  </P> <P>  "And the stone word fell/On my still-living breast./Never mind, I was ready./I  will manage somehow./Today I have so much to do:/I must kill memory once and  for all,/I must turn my soul to stone/I must learn to live again --  </P> <P>  "Unless . . . Summer's ardent rustling/Is like a festival outside my  window./For a long time I've foreseen this/Brilliant day, deserted house."  </P> <P>  The introduction to this molten cycle is a paragraph of prose.  </P> <P> A woman in line behind her, she writes, "woke up from the stupor to which  everyone had succumbed and whispered in my ear (everyone spoke in whispers  there):  </P> <P> " 'Can you describe this?'  </P> <P> "And I answered: 'Yes, I can.'  </P> <P> "Then something that looked like a smile passed over what had once been her  face."  </P> <P> Bowed down with personal tragedy that is the tragedy of a nation, perhaps of  the world, the poet answers: "Yes, I can." She could.  </P></p>

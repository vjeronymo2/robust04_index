			<p>BFN     [Text] San Salvador de Jujuy, 15 Apr (NA)--Jujuy Province  Governor Jose Carlos Ficoseco, who was on a six-month leave of  absence, resigned his post early this morning after Judge Mario  Gonzalez issued a writ depriving Ficoseco of his rights.    Ficoseco's resignation was submitted early today to Oscar  Perassi, parliamentary secretary of the local legislature.  Perassi, who assumed the governorship on the night of 13 April,  will now remain in his post until 1995, when a new governor will  be elected in the general elections.</p>

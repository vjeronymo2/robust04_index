			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUNS  </P> <P> John Hurst says in "Why I Own a Gun" that "statistics indicate that owning a  gun is a deadly gamble." He contrasts the number of guns stolen (which has  nothing to do with the "deadly gamble"), the number of suicides (which is also  not a gamble, but a purposeful act that can be committed by any number of  means, all equally deadly), the number of willful homicides (a legitimate  number), the number of accidents (also a legitimate number), with the number of  justifiable homicides by citizens of criminals. What was neglected here is the  number of crimes prevented by firearms without a shot being fired and usually  not reported. The national figures show that more than 1 million instances of  crimes are thwarted every year by private citizens (reported in the journal  Social Problems in February 1988). California's population is about 10% of that  of the United States; that means about 100,000 crimes did not happen because of  firearms, compared to Hurst's total of deaths committed with guns -- 3,740  (that includes suicides). Perhaps it is not such a gamble after all?  </P> <P> LEE F. MELLINGER, Van Nuys  </P></p>

			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Eurotrack has worst fall since November 1991 THE 2 per cent fall in the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index by the London close yesterday was the worst since November 18 last year, when it dropped 2.3 per cent after a pronounced drop on Wall Street, writes Our Markets Staff. A higher German discount rate, a weaker dollar and domestic disasters in Amsterdam and Milan all contributed to the malaise. FRANKFURT extended Thursday's post bourse declines with a 8.02, or 1.2 per cent fall to 679.88 in the FAZ index at midsession stretching to a drop of 37.87, or 2.2 per cent to 1,702.66 in the DAX at the close. Falls on the week were 2.0, and 3.0 per cent respectively. This was the biggest one-day fall since August 19, 1991, when the then Soviet president, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, was briefly ousted in a coup and German equities fell by 9.3 per cent. A 'triple-witching' day for the DTB, which saw the expiry of share options, options on DAX futures and DAX options added to the volatility and contributed to a late sell-off. Allianz, the insurer, the heaviest share by far in the DAX index, fell DM66 to DM2,150. Turnover rose from DM4.1bn to DM6.9bn. Banks were weaker than most, and dealers said that a sudden weakening in the bund contract in London yesterday may have contributed to their decline. AMSTERDAM sold Philips heavily on rumours that its HDTV programme might be in difficulty following the redeployment of a key executive. The group, which also announced that another executive involved with CD-I had left, saw its shares fall to a year's low of Fl 24.00 before recovering to end down Fl 3.20, or 11 per cent at Fl 25.60. The CBS Tendency index closed down 2.8 at 119.0, off 2.4 per cent on the week. The expiry of July contracts on the options and futures exchange also contributed to the market's weakness. Analysts felt that the steep fall in Philips, with many US and UK investors selling, was overdone. However, there is generally negative feeling about the group and widespread concern that the European HDTV programme is in doubt. MILAN's domestic concerns included the Bank of Italy's discount rate rise and the arrest of the prominent industrialist, Mr Salvatore Ligresti, in connection with the Milan corruption probe. The Comit index closed 8.87 lower at 437.78, down 2 per cent on the day and 1 per cent on the week. Banks were heavily sold, Credito Italiano plunging L104, or more than 6 per cent to L1,506 and several blue chips, including Montedison and Olivetti, slid through key resistance levels. In the Ligresti group, the worst performance came from Autostrada Torino-Milano, down L950, or 12.5 per cent at L6,650. PARIS was buffeted by a sharp drop in bond futures and the CAC-40 index fell 49.45 to 1,801.78, 3 per cent lower on the week. Turnover was estimated at FFr3.1bn. Weakness in New York contributed to the unease, while Axa's disappointing public offering there of shares in Equitable Life saw its own shares in Paris lose FFr34 to FFr771. Other notable losers included banks and financial services with Suez down FFr17 at FFr255 and Societe Generale off FFr27 at FFr457. Radiotechnique, a subsidiary of Philips, was affected by its Dutch parents' fall, losing FFr24 or 5 per cent to FFr453. ZURICH saw a late wave of Wall Street-inspired selling, and the SMI index fell 33.5, or 1.8 per cent to 1,805.2, down 2.7 per cent on the week. Bourse activity centred on industrials, although a bank share, UBS bearers, topped the active list. They fell SFr12 to SFr687. MADRID fell sharply with foreign institutions seen selling heavily. The general index closed down 5.34 at 223.54, a 5 per cent fall on the week. Volume was some Pta12.5bn. Banks were weak with Popular down Pta500 or 4.6 per cent at Pta10,250.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JUL 17                            Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Open    10.30am   11 am    12 pm     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1112.91  1110.29  1109.67  1107.46  1104.48  1105.72  1100.27  1097.57                 Day's High  1112.91    Day's Low  1097.57              Jul 16    Jul 15      Jul 14     Jul 13     Jul 10             1120.48    1122.53     1124.22    1121.63    1129.14  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Delors welcome for Sweden MR Jacques Delors, the EC Commission president, said yesterday he was confident that Swedish entry to the European community would take place on schedule at the start of 1995. But Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister, said a decision would not be taken until 'the latter part of this year' on when to hold a vital referendum on membership. With public opinion in Sweden running against membership and negotiations on entry facing difficult issues such as Stockholm's high agricultural subsidies, Mr Delors made a strong defence of the community in a speech to the Swedish parliament. He played down local concerns that EC rules would slash subsidies to northern rural communities, saying Sweden's philosophy of helping poorer regions was exactly the same as the community's. 'We can assist remote regions in particular in a way no individual nation state can do,' he said, adding that negotiations - begun in January along with Finland and Austria - were 'progressing well'. At a press conference with Mr Bildt, Mr Delors, who will visit northern areas today, said: 'I remain confident that it is possible to maintain the schedule and have practical entry to the Community at the beginning of 1995.' However, Mr Bildt struck a more cautious note. He said Sweden's intention was to join by 'roughly' January 1, 1995. But he would not say when a referendum would be held and added that no decision on the timing of a vote would be taken until late this year when the outcome of negotiations was clear. If the original timetable for holding a referendum well in advance of the September 1994 general election slips, entry to the community could be delayed because of constitutional requirements that membership be ratified by two successive parliaments. Mr Paavo Vayrynen, Finnish foreign minister, resigned yesterday to prepare his campaign as the Centre party's candidate for the presential election next January.</p>

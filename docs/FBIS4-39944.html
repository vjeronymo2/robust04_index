			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Spiridonov, president of Komi </F> Republic, by ITAR-TASS political observer Gennadiy Bocharov; in  Syktyvkar 8 June: "I Do Not Intend To Make a Revolution"]    [Text] Yuriy Spiridonov granted an interview 8 June, the  day after the inauguration of the first president in the history  of the Komi Republic.    [Bocharov] You are the first president of the Komi  Republic....    [Spiridonov] Head of the republic. I believe that there  must be one president in Russia. There is.    [Bocharov] Good. Today is the first day after your official  inauguration. Which concern of this day -- as of the 100th day,  which is traditional for summing up the first results -- will be  the chief and most important concern for you?    [Spiridonov] Both today and on the 100th day, and maybe also  on the 200th, the budget will constitute this concern.  Although, in connection with the Russian president's recent  edicts, maybe the situation will yet improve. I very much hope  so.    [Bocharov] How many days out of the first 100 will you spend  in this office, and how many traveling around the republic?    [Spiridonov] The first three days. The rest traveling  around the republic. In parallel I will be forming the  government. I do not intend to make a revolution, but serious  changes are needed.    [Bocharov] Personal or structural?    [Spiridonov] Mostly structural. The aim is to combat the  omnipotence of officials. Our chief enemy, as well as the enemy  of all Russia, is the petty official and the big official. The  most brilliant projects and undertakings are ruined precisely at  the level of the official. A Mariya Ivanovna or a Vasiliy  Petrovich, unknown to anyone, possess a power which is  frequently out of all relation to that of a minister or even the  president.    [Bocharov] Komi is known to be a veritable storehouse of  natural riches. In this connection Syktyvkar is constantly  being visited by representatives of very serious and  world-renowned firms and corporations. By which criteria do you  intend to be guided in your approach to cooperation with the  West in this sense?    [Spiridonov] There is one criterion: the good of the cause.  For the republic and its people. We will rely on the great  experience of the federal structures. We will also support our  own structures in every way.    The republic's foreign economic activity is growing daily. A  lot of mistakes are being made and criminal actions being  committed. But a positive process is already evident. The task  is clear in this sense too. The republic's enterprises must  work. Production must grow, not fall. People must earn well.  We have no reason to fear joint projects or, to put it more  simply, access for businessmen to our expanses and our riches.  Here is an interesting thing. Back in 1928, in one of the  rayons of Komi, the raykom [rayon party committee] bureau  examined the question of allowing the raykom secretary's son to  head a British concession. At that time people were not afraid  of these words, but today we continue to fear these words, such  as the word "concession."    I wish to say that we are ready to deal not only with  recognized authorities in the West but also with our own  businessmen with capital. There is no need to blush and hide  our eyes. Money must work. This is a principled approach. It  is irrational to waste efforts on a debate over the nature of  the accumulation of primary capital, unless, of course, it is a  question of obvious piracy. I repeat once more: Money must  work, enterprises must build up capacity, and people must earn  well. Today we cannot allow a negligent or frequently simply  even a foolish leader of one enterprise or another to go on  taking a freeloading approach to the budget and to state funds  and to demand that they be taken from invalids, children, and  pensioners instead of introducing these funds into the state's  budget.    [Bocharov] The election showed perfectly clearly the level  of your authority in the republic. In what way do you intend to  maintain it?    [Long silence]    [Spiridonov] If it has to be done artifically, then in no  way....</p>

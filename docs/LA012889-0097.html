			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS;  </P> <P> FREEWAY LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> LA HABRA CLOSING IN ON PLAYOFF BERTH  </P> <P> Tim Moore scored 25 points as La Habra High School took control of its own  playoff destiny with a 66-47 victory over Sonora Friday in a Freeway League  basketball game at La Habra.  </P> <P> The victory gave the third-place Highlanders (10-9, 4-2) a 2-game lead over  Sonora in the league standings with 4 games remaining. La Habra hasn't  qualified for the playoffs in 5 seasons.  </P> <P> "If you go by percentages, Sonora should not beat Sunny Hills and Fullerton, so  they will probably have six losses (at the end of the season)," La Habra Coach  Frank McCarroll said. "If we go 5-5, we're in the playoffs. This was a big, big  win for us."  </P> <P> Sonora (7-12, 2-4) led, 10-9, at the end of the first quarter, but La Habra  held the Raiders without a field goal in the second. The Highlanders outscored  Sonora, 20-7, to take a 29-17 lead. All of the Raiders' points came on free  throws.  </P> <P> David Stevens scored 13 points and Anthony Ortiz 10 for La Habra. Anthony Choe  scored 14 points for Sonora.  </P> <P> In other Freeway League games:  </P> <P> Sunny Hills 42, Troy 29 -- Marcus Hopkins scored 17 points as Sunny Hills  (13-7, 5-1) overcame the Warriors' slow-down tactics at Troy. The Lancers led,  6-0, at the end of the first quarter and 15-6 at halftime. They put the game  away by outscoring Troy, 15-7, in the third quarter for a 30-13 lead. Chris  Inman scored 9 points for Troy (5-13, 1-5).  </P> <P> Fullerton 72, Buena Park 38 -- Pete Bach scored 20 points, all in the first  half, for host Fullerton (13-5, 6-0). Lee Green added 10 points and 6 rebounds  for Fullerton. Bach also had 6 rebounds. Prentiss Johnson scored 12 points for  Buena Park (0-15, 0-6).  </P></p>

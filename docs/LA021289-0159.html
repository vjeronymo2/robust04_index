			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DANNEMEYER'S STANCE ON GAYS AND LESBIANS  </P> <P> I stand in awe of Dannemeyer's ability to express in writing the kind of drivel  that is usually spoken hurriedly at political functions. His cockeyed logic and  garbled "facts" are a tribute to classic demagogism.  </P> <P> Demagogue he is. Demagogues simply cannot function without an "enemy of the  people." Where would Hitler have been without the Jews, or McCarthy without a  Commie under every bed? How could they have functioned without fear, blind  prejudice and followers willing to swallow all their twisted logic and blatant  lies?  </P> <P> I won't bother to list or repudiate all of the stupidities apparent in the  Letter to the Editor of Feb. 5. It is all crystal clear to every intelligent,  right-thinking person who read the hateful thing and none of it will ever be  questioned by sick, fearful people who see danger to themselves everywhere.  </P> <P> It is so sadly true that those who will not learn from history are doomed to  repeat it.  </P> <P> WALTER WOOD  </P> <P> Dana Point  </P></p>

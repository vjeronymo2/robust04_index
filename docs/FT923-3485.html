			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: Management team may buy Spanish store chain A MANAGEMENT team has emerged as the most likely buyer of Galerias Preciados, the Spanish department store chain owned by Mountleigh, the UK property group in receivership. The buy-out team, led by the Galerias's financial director, the chief planning executive and the head of its legal department, is believed to have reached an underwriting agreement with Caja Madrid, a leading savings bank, . Peat Marwick, the receiver, said 'several offers' had been received for Galerias and there would be 'no fire sale'. A decision is expected in 'weeks rather than days'. Mr Michael Babcock, Galerias' general manager, who was appointed by Mountleigh in February last year, resigned last week and was replaced by Mr Jaime Uya, a former head of Galerias' marketing division, who is understood to favour the management buy-out. The withdrawal of a bid made jointly by Parques Urbanos, a leading developer of shopping centres in Spain, and by Zara, a domestic textile manufacturer and retailer, has also stirred speculation of a management buy-out. Mr Carlos Bardon, chairman of Aserinvest, a Madrid consultancy that advised the joint bid, said the offer had been withdrawn because Peat Marwick failed to provide details of an audit on Galerias within the time specified by the bid. A feature of the management buy-out offer is that it would be endorsed by unions representing Galerias' 8,000 employees. The unions have staged several protests recently, to press for a quick sale and the security of their jobs. It is understood that should the managers win control of Galerias, it was likely at least two stores could be subsequently acquired by Marks and Spencer, the UK retailing group which is operating in Madrid and Seville and is seeking to expand further in Spain.</p>

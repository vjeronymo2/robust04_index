			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / White House in search of budget votes: Gore says plans will create 8m jobs in four years THE White House yesterday stepped up its efforts to win votes for its budget plan with a pledge that it would create 8m jobs during President Bill Clinton's first four years in office. 'We have set the 8m figure as a benchmark and we'll be judged by that,' Vice President Al Gore said yesterday as the administration published a state-by-state breakdown of where it believes jobs will be created by the budget plan. Congressional negotiators have made headway this week in producing a compromise budget bill that reconciles the differences between the House of Representatives and the Senate over taxes and spending. Negotiators agreed to Mr Clinton's proposal to raise the top rate of income tax from 31 per cent to 36 per cent for incomes above Dollars 115,000 (Pounds 77,000) for single taxpayers, or Dollars 140,000 for married couples, with an additional 10 per cent surtax on incomes above Dollars 250,000. But they applied the new rates from March 1, edging slightly closer to the House's wish to backdate them to the beginning of January than to the Senate's proposal of July 1. This will produce a little extra revenue to help meet the goal of trimming the federal budget deficit by Dollars 500bn over five years from its current projected path. But the hard negotiations over the energy tax, one of the core elements of Mr Clinton's original plan passed by the House but excised from the Senate bill in favour of a more modest petrol tax, are yet to come. The fight is expected to get tougher as August 6, the day Congress intends to recess for the summer, approaches. Mr Clinton has this week renewed his drive to build support for his proposals both in Congress and in public opinion, with a round of meetings on Capitol Hill and a series of TV and radio interviews across the country. Yesterday, he said he had 'very positive feelings about the progress made' by negotiators on the budget bill. 'There is not a serious alternative, and there is no question that the failure to pass the budget would be a destabilising effect on the economy,' he told reporters before flying to Arkansas to deliver the eulogy at the funeral of Mr Vincent Foster, the White House deputy counsel and his childhood friend, who apparently committed suicide this week. Mr Gore reinforced the message, arguing on a morning television show that a proposal to replace Mr Clinton's broad energy tax with an increase in petrol taxes of around 7 cents a US gallon was necessary to tackle the budget deficit. 'Less than a dollar a week is not a bad price when you look at what you get in return - a deficit reduction package that reclaims our economic future, has already brought interest rates down and allowed millions to refinance their home mortgages,' he said.</p>

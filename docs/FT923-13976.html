			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Observer: Game set Campbell Anderson, managing director of Renison Goldfields Consolidated, the big Australian mining company, is wincing his way through meetings in London this week. He is suffering from repetitive strain injury which, he explains, is very much like a bad case of tennis elbow and makes shaking hands very painful. 'I thought it was something only typists and journalists suffered from,' says Anderson. So how did he come by his RSI? From playing with a Game Boy - a hand-held electronic toy - on long-distance flights. 'It's very addictive,' he points out.</p>

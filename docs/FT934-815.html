			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (7): Deficit casts shadow over growth / Assessing  prospects in the banking sector Whichever way you measure them, Saudi Arabia's banks are in robust shape. Consolidated profits for the country's 12 commercial banks were up by more than a third in 1992 over the previous year and figures for the first three quarters of 1993, from those which have so far released them, are 24 per cent ahead of the same period last year. Indeed, Saudi British Bank is 50 per cent up on the period, while Saudi American Bank looks poised this year to become the kingdom's first bank to report annual profits over SR1bn. Gross bank lending was up 27 per cent in 1992 over the preceding year, assets rose more than 13 per cent and the consolidated capital of the 11 listed commercial banks, after a spree of recapitalising issues on 1992's bullish stock market, rose by half. The overall capital-to-assets ratio of the commercial banks at the end of June this year was a secure 8.7 per cent. Liquidity also remains high - with more than 30 per cent of consolidated assets of SR298bn by the end of 1992 being held as cash and due to banks. Overall, based on 1992 results, the gross profile of bank assets showed a near-exact split of bank assets of a third in highly liquid assets, a third in loans and a third in investments, including both domestic bonds and overseas bills and other investments. Added to this, National Commercial Bank, the kingdom's oldest and biggest, has rejoined the fray refreshed. After a SR6bn injection of capital from the bin Mahfouz family, the predominant of the private bank's two family owners, the bank finally issued results this year for 1991 and 1992 after a troubled few years off the reporting map. The results showed a 168 per cent rise in profits for 1992 to SR427m and are the first approved by the bank's auditors since the bank's accounts were qualified in 1987, 1988 and 1989 in a dispute over bad debts. Mr Abdulhadi Shayif, NCB's deputy general manager, offers only a coy 'no comment' when asked if 1990, for which figures have not been released, was a loss-making year. But he says that damaged confidence in the bank after the US indictment last year, on charges connected with the BCCI scandal, of Mr Khalid bin Mahfouz, who later resigned as chief operating officer, 'has long been behind us'. So, there is almost unalloyed good news all round, apparently. But while the profitability of the kingdom's banks looks secure for the foreseeable future, some in the industry are starting to counsel caution. Although deposits continue to rise - they are up 12 per cent in the first half of this year - some economists and bankers point out that the banks have now enjoyed the bulk of an estimated Dollars 30bn which Saudis repatriated after the Gulf war. From now on, some economists and bankers suggest, banks are likely to raise their deposit bases substantially only by competing with one another for market share through sharp marketing and improved services - such as the recently introduced electronic point of sale technology springing up in the kingdom's still flourishing shopping malls. This will be an increasingly tough scrap. In the past couple of years the leaders in the consumer market have been the tightly managed joint venture banks such as Saudi Hollandi, Saudi British - which estimates it has swelled its deposit base by 20 per cent already this year - Saudi American and Saudi French banks. But the country's two biggest banks, NCB and Riyadh Bank, are gearing up to take on their generally nimbler competitors. Although NCB denies it has in any way fallen behind the field during its last few troubled years, it has seen its share of assets slip from a third to just over a quarter of the banks' total assets. The arrival earlier this year of Mr Michael Callen, former head of Citibank's worldwide finance sector, as special adviser is part of a thorough rationalisation of NCB's retail operations, combined with an attempt to increase automation and slim the bank's staff - by at least 500 to 6,400 by the end of next year. 'Our 1993 figures will show a rise in our share of deposits,' says Mr Shayif. Riyadh Bank is also undertaking a Dollars 100m revamp of its services and automation with the aid of consultants contracted from Ernst &amp; Young's Los Angeles offices under a strategic shift towards improved customer banking introduced by Mr Suleiman al-Mandeed, who took over as general manager in the spring. But outside the drive to win over more of Saudi Arabia's increasingly sophisticated banking public, economists and bankers are mixed over prospects for profit centres elsewhere. The great unknown, and potentially the darkest shadow over the banking sector's growth beyond 1993, is the government's sustained budget deficit and what it plans to do about it. As for financing the present deficit, bankers have few doubts about their ability to mop up the supply of treasury bills and government development bonds required. The flood of quasi-government borrowing, particularly associated with Sabic's huge petrochemical expansion plans, has ebbed since 1991 and early 1992 - though bankers view this with mixed feelings. Further borrowing associated with new power projects, expansion of the country's telephone capacity and water projects is likely over the next year, but according to some bankers the government will be under some pressure to improve margins on such borrowing. More troublesome is the prospect of government spending cuts and the likely effect this will have as it trickles through to the still booming private sector. Bankers already report numerous ministries to be delaying - sometimes by as much as a year - payments to their private sector clients. Delays in some previously planned state-backed expansion projects, such as those to upgrade the country's main oil refineries, are also likely to depress private sector growth next year. Some economists, however, suggest it would be wrong to worry too much. As Mr Henry Azzam, chief economist at NCB, argues, the private sector has increasingly stopped relying on the public sector in recent years. Despite a 10 per cent fall in oil prices over the past year, the private sector has grown by 6 per cent. Mr Azzam says that most Saudi banks have 'barely scratched the surface' of possible fee-based services they could offer the kingdom's top companies. 'It remains an unsophisticated market in that respect. Very few banks do advisory services, the full range of treasury services and hedging instruments.' Others, though, are gloomier - particularly about the prospects for a fall in private sector growth. One chief economist of a leading Riyadh-based bank suggests that the headlong rush in the construction sector is already overdone. 'It's clearly going to burst,' he says. 'People have yet to realise that the party is over.'</p>

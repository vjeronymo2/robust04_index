			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Hong Kong Politics and the Jardine camp will be the key features in the market this week, writes Louise Lucas. However, last week's resilience in the face of a renewed outburst from China  -this time directed at the Jardine group, which Beijing wishes to see withdrawn from the port extension project - suggests the impact may be limited. Investors will be watching for further developments on the Container Terminal 9 contract from the Joint Liaison Group meeting. The market also took in its stride the delisting of Jardine subsidiaries, which was announced last week along with the results of the three companies: Hongkong Land, Mandarin Oriental and Dairy Farm. Parent Jardine Matheson announces its results today and Jardine Strategic follows tomorrow. These are likely to yield few surprises as they come after their subsidiaries. This broadly winds up the reporting season, leaving just the property developers to announce their interims. Compiled by Michael Morgan</p>

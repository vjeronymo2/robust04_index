			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUMMER AND SMOKE: TIPS FOR BBQ GRILLING  </P> <P> The National Pork Producers Council has the following tips for grilling safety:  </P> <P>  -- Always read the owner's manual before using a new barbecue grill.  </P> <P>  -- Never use gasoline or other highly volatile fluids as a starter; they may  explode.  </P> <P>  -- Barbecue grills should not be used within 5 feet of any combustible  material.  </P> <P>  -- For fewer hazardous sparks, experts recommend using a covered grill.  </P> <P>  -- Never use a barbecue grill unless all parts of the unit are firmly in  place.  </P> <P>  -- Barbecue grills should be kept at a level position at all times; an  unstable unit can easily be tipped over.  </P> <P>  -- Infants, children and pets should never be left unattended near a hot  barbecue grill.  </P> <P>  -- Never add liquid starter to hot or even warm coals.  </P> <P>  -- After unplugging, remove a hot electric starter carefully and remember  where you placed it.  </P> <P>  -- Always use flame-resistant barbecue mitts and barbecue tools with long,  heat-resistant handles.  </P> <P>  -- Barbecue mitts should be worn to adjust hot vents. Wear a heavy apron to  protect clothing from grease and sparks. Never wear loose clothing around a hot  barbecue grill; it could inadvertently catch on fire.  </P> <P>  -- Never touch charcoal or grill to see if it's hot.  </P> <P>  -- Electric cords should be placed away from walkways.  </P> <P>  -- Charcoal grills should never be used indoors; toxic fumes could be fatal.  Starter fluid should be capped immediately and placed a safe distance from the  grill.  </P> <P>  -- Never attempt to move a hot barbecue grill.  </P> <P>  -- Never discard hot coals where someone may step on them or where they could  start a fire.  </P> <P>  -- Make sure coals are cold before putting the barbecue grill away.  </P></p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / ICI adds to its explosives division IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, the UK's biggest chemicals concern, has reinforced its presence in the civil explosives industry by acquiring a 51 per cent stake in AECI Explosives of South Africa. The deal is an asset swap in which ICI exchanges a 25 per cent stake in AECI, a South African petrochemicals, paints and agricultural products company, for majority control of AECI's explosives business. ICI retains a 13.3 per cent stake in AECI. Mr Bob Clarke, chief executive of ICI Explosives, described the deal as 'the most important step in ICI Explosives for many years'. The deal adds a business with sales of Pounds 150m-Pounds 200m to the division which last year had a turnover of Pounds 573m. AECI's explosives operations, which supply the construction and mining industry, have trading margins just below the 10 per cent achieved by ICI's existing explosives operations. The swap adds 5,000 people to ICI's workforce. Mr Rob Margetts, ICI board director, said: 'Now sanctions have been dropped we expect to export significant quantities from South Africa.' The deal was part of ICI's strategy to focus resources on global businesses in which the company could be a leader, said Mr Margetts. It reinforced ICI's position as the leading manufacturer of civil explosives, he added. The petrochemicals operations which the British company has divested in the swap are not core activities. The new holding company of AECI will be Anglo American Industrial Corporation which previously held a 38 per cent stake. Mr Mike Sander, AECI managing director, said the joint venture would be strengthened by an enhanced capability to meet international competition and by improved access to foreign markets and investment opportunities. Mr Sander added that the deal would also help AECI in its effort to create strong, self-standing businesses. AECI is South Africa's leading supplier of chemicals and related products. After difficult years in 1991 and 1992, AECI lifted net profits in the first half of 1993 by 50 per cent to R75m (Pounds 14.5m).</p>

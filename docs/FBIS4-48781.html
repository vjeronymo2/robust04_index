			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] President Daniel arap Moi said today that it is  extremely difficult to resolve the internecine civil war in  Rwanda by force of arms. He therefore pleaded with the Rwandan  Patriotic Front and the Government troops to lay down arms and  resolve their differences amicably for the good of all Rwandese  people. President Moi said continued slaughter of people would  only deepen hate and vengefulness.    He was speaking at State House, Nairobi, when receiving  credentials from the new high commissioner of Zimbabwe, Mr.  Lucas Pande Tavaya.    Noting that attempts to solve the problem militarily would  only kill more people, President Moi proposed that the African  way of peaceful negotiations be adopted. He expressed his  sorrow at the continuing blood-bath in Rwanda.    Welcoming Mr. Tavaya, President Moi said he would continue  working closely with President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe for the  good of the two peoples through such organizations as the PTA  [Preferential Trade Area] and COMESA [Common Market for East and  Southern Africa] [passage omitted]    The new high commissioner applauded President Moi for his  efforts and personal initiative in promoting peace and economic  cooperation in the region. Later President Moi bade farewell to  the outgoing Ambassador of Argentina Mr. Rafael Gowland.  [passage omitted]</p>

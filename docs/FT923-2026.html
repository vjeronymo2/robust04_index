			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / French jail crisis deepens THE crisis in French prisons deepened yesterday when the army was sent in to a number of jails and a policeman was injured as picketing prison officers tried to stop a squad of riot police from entering Baumettes prison near Marseilles. Tension mounted during the day after an incident early in the morning when an escaped convict from Clairvaux high-security jail was shot dead by police. The man was one of seven inmates who broke out of Clairvaux last Friday in a shoot-out during which a warder was killed. The Clairvaux shooting sparked the strike by prison officers which has wrought chaos in the French jail system this week. Only 60 of France's 182 prisons were operating normally yesterday, despite the government's attempts to negotiate a settlement with warders who are demanding more staff and better security, Riot police have been installed in a number of jails. Police unions have protested against the use of their members to supplement staff.</p>

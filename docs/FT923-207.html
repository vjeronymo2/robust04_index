			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: Italian steel group in deal with Lucchini ILVA, Italy's state-owned steel group which lost L498bn (Dollars 407.6m) last year, yesterday announced its long-awaited joint venture for its loss-making long products division. The deal marks one of the biggest privatisation measures in Italy and should go some way towards reducing Ilva's losses while reassuring the European Commission that the group's rationalisation strategy is on track. Earlier this year, Sir Leon Brittan, the EC commissioner in charge of competition, questioned two recent Ilva capital increases and warned the commission might open a formal procedure against the company. Ilva is selling 60 per cent of the companies which control its big Piombino and Turin works to the private sector Lucchini group. Under the transaction, which is still subject to precise valuations, Ilva could receive around L150bn from Lucchini, which will take on L280bn in debts from Piombino and L24bn from the Turin plant. Ilva's current group debt stands at L6,300bn. Bringing in private-sector participation to Piombino, Ilva's second-biggest works, has been a crucial part of its strategy to staunch losses, expected to reach around L1,000bn in 1992. The new joint venture, which is still subject to approval from the commission, will have sales of around L1,200bn and have annual output of almost 2.5m tonnes. The transaction had been under discussion for many months, but failed to progress owing to the growing crisis in the European steel industry. Under an original proposal, three private-sector steel groups would have come in as shareholders. The venture with Lucchini, will have around 20 per cent of the Italian market, and will be Europe's fifth-biggest steel maker of long laminates. Lucchini, which may launch a capital increase to help finance the deal, currently has sales of around L1,000bn.</p>

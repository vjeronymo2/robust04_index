			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Money Markets: No change in rates RATES in the sterling cash markets were shaved yesterday morning after the Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 900m which was quickly taken up by the discount houses. But the currency's weaker performance on foreign exchange markets in the afternoon forced traders to take a gloomier view of the outlook on base rates in the afternoon. As a result, rates ended the day at roughly the same levels as the night before. Three month money, a key indicator of how the market thinks base rates are likely to move, dropped to 10 per cent in the morning after closing the previous day at 10 1/16 , as the shortage was easily taken up. But the rates ended the day at the former figure of 10 1/16 per cent as sterling weakened in the foreign exchange markets in the afternoon. Further out, the rates for everything from 4-month money to 1-year ended the day slightly lower at 10 per cent, suggesting that the market does not expect a cut in base rates before September. The futures markets were mostly indifferent to the news that headline inflation in April had jumped by less than expected. The June short sterling contract ended the day four ticks higher at 89.95, suggesting that base rates in one month's time will be at 10.05 per cent. Once again, volumes of trade in the September contract were a good deal higher than in the front month, reaching 14,283 lots on the day. But the contract ended up only one tick on its previous close, at 90.25. Once again, the Bank of England's operations in the discount market were straightforward. At the start of the day, the Bank forecast a shortage of Pounds 900m. In early operations, it purchased Pounds 900m of bills for resale to the market on 3 and 4 June at an interest rate of 9 15/16 per cent. The forecast was revised to a shortage of Pounds 1.1bn, and later Pounds 1.15bn, before taking account of the early operations. In the afternoon the Bank purchased Pounds 250m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. Dealers said that, once again, the shortage on a Friday had been mopped up quickly to push the overnight rate down as far as possible before the weekend. At one stage, the overnight was down to 6 per cent but ended the day at 9 3/4 - 1/2 per cent.</p>

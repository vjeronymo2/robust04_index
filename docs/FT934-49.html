			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Options scramble behind FT-SE moves The expiry of some Pounds 4bn of over-the-counter options (OTCs) has been one of the main factors behind sharp movements in the London stock market over the past two days. A prime reason for the surge which took the FT-SE 100 index to a peak of 3,480.8 yesterday was share buying by investment funds and banks to cover their OTC positions. Many funds have been buying 'bespoke puts', which give an option to sell the underlying market at a fixed time and price, and selling calls, to lock in profits made earlier in the year. Few fund managers, however, were able to allow for the latest rise which has lifted the stock market by about 9 per cent since the November 30 Budget. The principal expiry yesterday involved an institution which had bought a 'zero cost collar', an OTC covering call options and put options in about 30 leading Footsie stocks. It was one of a number of OTC deals, mostly carried out by Swiss Bank Corporation, which have expired this week. Once the positions were covered, buying pressure eased yesterday and profit-taking took the FT-SE 100 to 3,428.8, down 33.2 on the day. Mr Chris Salter, head of UK trading at SBC, said: 'The OTC market has really picked up in London this year and we have carried out a large percentage of the recent transactions.' Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Salomon Brothers and UBS have also been providing OTC insurance against falls in the market for US income funds, UK investment funds, UK life assurance funds and some pension groups. Mr Guru Ramakrishnan, derivatives specialist at Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, said: 'I am continually astounded by the increasing number of accounts using OTCs, but they do offer considerable flexibility and anonymity at a fair price.' The main difference between traded options dealt on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and OTCs is that OTCs are secret - only the seller (writer) and buyer are aware of the details because they are not traded through an exchange. They are also more flexible than traded options having an expiry price and maturity date that can be agreed by the two parties involved. The main criticism is that it is difficult to make a market, but supporters say that for any one OTC there are around half a dozen participants prepared to make a price. Awareness of OTCs has grown considerably this year, along with the use of derivative products generally. Although there are no figures available because of the anonymous nature of the market, dealers estimate that the nominal value of OTCs on the FT-SE 100 index runs into billions of pounds. Some derivatives analysts say there could be further volatility in today's end-of-year half session as another large OTC option expires. European futures, Page 17; London market, Back Page</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, June 8 (XINHUA) -- After hard bargaining  over the past three days, the warring factions in Bosnia agreed  here today to a month-long cease-fire that will take effect at  noon (1000 GMT) on Friday [10 June].    Speaking to reporters after the agreement was signed,  Yasushi  Akashi, the U.N. envoy to the former Yugoslavia, said the  cease-fire includes an exchange of prisoners and information on  those still listed as missing.    The agreement was inked by top representatives of the  Bosnia's Muslim-Croat Federation and the Bosnian Serbs.    Akashi described the agreement as a "first step" toward the  full-scale cease-fire in Bosnia.    Under the agreement, the parties will resume negotiations in  near future to seek a full-scale cease-fire.    Akashi had been pressing for a four-month cease-fire, the  Bosnian Serbs had demanded a one-year halt of hostilities and  the Muslim-Croat Federation had wanted a month-long agreement.</p>

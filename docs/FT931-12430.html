			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: United Biscuits The optimistic interpretation of UB's management reshuffle at Keebler is that it will enable the parent to impose stricter discipline over its wayward child. The depressing one is that it highlights just how little control UB has over its own destiny. No matter how well the new chief executive performs, Keebler will continue to be hampered by the brutal reality of the US biscuit and snacks markets. Despite being number two in its chosen fields, Keebler remains a comparatively small player with few easy expansion routes. Market terms are largely dictated by the dominant Nabisco. As yet, there is little sign of a truce in the biscuit price war, which has so disfigured Keebler's margins, although economic recovery will clearly help. A similar problem applies to Ross Young's, UB's frozen foods business in the UK, which shows a dismal return on assets despite severe rationalisation. In both cases, UB's energetic new management must be sorely tempted to cut and run. Yesterday's moves, though, imply a renewed resolve to struggle through. That may be the only viable option given the difficulties of disposing of such assets in current markets. But it also suggests UB's share price will limp, no matter how fast the other half of the business runs. UB's style will be further cramped by high borrowings, which limit the scope for acquisitive growth.</p>

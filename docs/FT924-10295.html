			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Letter: University research outlook Sir, The recent report by the Royal Society, The Future of the Science Base (Technically Speaking: 'Time to act on careers in research', October 27), raises many timely questions about the future of all research in British universities. The lack of a sustainable career structure coupled with the constant search for new funding and the effects of this on researchers' productivity are all features of the social sciences as well as the natural sciences. Like the natural sciences, the current system promotes high turnover. This severely impedes the development of long-term research programmes as highly experienced researchers leave full-time research in higher education and the cumulative knowledge from past research is lost. While these points are obviously critical to individual researchers attempting to build careers, the current problems also have significant implications for the financial well-being of educational institutions. Under new funding arrangements, university income is increasingly tied to research standing. There is clearly an urgent need for a radical overhaul of the position of contract research in higher education. It is imperative that the universities and the major funding bodies embark on a joint investigation into the future of research in the natural sciences, social sciences and the humanities.

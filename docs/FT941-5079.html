			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / International Company News: Goldstar Goldstar, South Korea's second biggest electronics company, increased net profits by 147 per cent to Won65.8bn (Dollars 81m) for 1993. Sales for the year climbed 14 per cent to Won4,320bn, writes John Burton. Earnings growth was largely due to exports of consumer electronics, which were helped by the Korean won's fall against the Japanese yen. Exports rose 17 per cent to Won2,330bn, with sharp growth in China and south-east Asia. Domestic sales increased 11 per cent to Won1,990bn.</p>

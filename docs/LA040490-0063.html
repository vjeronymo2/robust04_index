			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HE MADE MASTERS A SCRAMBLE;  </P> <P> GOLF: IN 1980, BALLESTEROS HIT SHOTS FROM PLACES FEW HAD EVER IMAGINED AS HE  BECAME THE YOUNGEST WINNER AT AUGUSTA NATIONAL.  </P> <P> Three white golf balls -- where there should have been only two -- dotted the  seventh green of Augusta National as Andy North and David Graham approached the  hole during the second round of the 1980 Masters.  </P> <P> Alongside the elevated green stood a scowling Severiano Ballesteros, who saw  nothing funny when Graham said, "Are you playing through, or would you like to  putt out for an eagle?"  </P> <P> The scowl deepened when North began to laugh as he realized what had happened.  Ballesteros had teed off on the 17th hole and hit a towering hook that carried  over a stand of majestic Georgia pines and pastel-shaded dogwood and dropped  onto the putting surface of the adjacent seventh hole.  </P> <P> "Nice drive, Seve, you're closer to the hole in one than I am in three, so how  about if I play your ball?" the former U.S. Open champion kidded. North's  second shot had landed in a bunker and his blast out fell short of the green.  </P> <P> Ballesteros never smiled. He had been seething since before he teed off after  taking three putts on the 16th green.  </P> <P> "I swing too hard, I am very mad," he explained later.  </P> <P> After more than 10 minutes, while North chipped up and he and Graham putted  out, a green-coated Masters committeeman arrived and showed Ballesteros where  he could drop his ball on the fringe of the seventh green for his second shot.  </P> <P> Between the ball and the flagstick, in addition to the towering pines, was a  20-foot high scoreboard and a grandstand full of Masters patrons (In  Mastersland, there are no fans, or spectators. All the paying customers are  patrons). Another long delay ensued while the gallery was moved to make way for  Ballesteros' shot.  </P> <P> Once he knew where his ball lay, Ballesteros walked through the pines and  halfway down the incline toward the 17th green, where his playing partner,  Larry Nelson, waited patiently, and somewhat curiously. He had seen  mini-miracles by the youthful Spaniard earlier that day and he almost expected  another one.  </P> <P> He got it.  </P> <P> Ballesteros returned to his ball, took a seven-iron from his bag and after his  caddie stepped aside, lined the club up with the corner of the scoreboard. Then  he took his stance over the ball, his dark eyes darting first to the  scoreboard, then back to the ball and then to the scoreboard again. He waggled  his club head a couple of times before drawing the club back and driving the  ball high into the blue Augusta sky.  </P> <P> It disappeared from sight behind the trees, but its direction and subsequent  landing were identified by a mighty roar that went up from the crowd around the  green.  </P> <P> Ballesteros scrambled down the hill, through the pink, red and white azalea  bushes that make Augusta National what it is. He saw where his ball had landed  only when the crowd parted at the green's edge and he stepped into the  spotlight to the crescendo of another thunderous cheer.  </P> <P> The brooding scowl disappeared as he saw the dimpled Titleist only 15 feet from  the pin.  </P> <P> "I line up (the ball) with right side of scoreboard," Seve said later. "It give  me the line. It good place for scoreboard, give good line."  </P> <P> When he sank the birdie putt moments later, the legend of Ballesteros was  taking form. He had celebrated his 23rd birthday only two days earlier.  </P> <P> The three shots that Friday on No. 17 were only a small fraction of the 275 he  took to become the youngest winner in Masters history, but Ballesteros'  flamboyance, style and pizazz set him apart from the generally bland  shot-makers around him. When Fuzzy Zoeller, the 1979 champion, helped him on  with the green jacket emblematic of a Masters victory, the Spaniard had became  a world force in golf.  </P> <P> That birdie, plus five others that day, gave him a four-stroke lead after 36  holes, and he extended it to seven in the third round and to 10 after the first  five holes of the final round -- only to lose eight of those strokes before  rallying to fend off Australian Jack Newton and American Gibby Gilbert and win  by four.  </P> <P> From the birdie he made on the second hole -- a 555-yard par-five -- of the  first round, Ballesteros was never out of the lead. He shot a 66 that day, but  everything took second billing to the plight of Tom Weiskopf on that windy  Thursday.  </P> <P> Weiskopf, the 1973 British Open champion, had won 13 tour events and more than  $1.7 million in the 15 years since leaving Ohio State with one of the sweetest  swings in golf. As he approached the dazzlingly beautiful 12th hole, he was  even with par. It was only 155 yards from the tee, across Rae's Creek, to the  green, backdropped by an amphitheater of multicolored azaleas, white and orchid  dogwood and yellow jasmine.  </P> <P> Weiskopf's tee shot, with a seven-iron, landed on the fringe of the green but  too much backspin made it back up and roll tantalizingly down the embankment  into the creek. The tall, erect Weiskopf -- four times a runner-up in the  Masters -- walked briskly to a drop area about 20 yards from the water and  dropped a second ball over his shoulder.  </P> <P> His sand wedge shot looked like a mini-version of the first. It, too, hit the  fringe and then backed up into the creek. Another drop. A desultory shot that  plopped into the water. Another drop. A worse shot that almost didn't reach the  water. Another drop.  </P> <P> Finally, hitting what was his 11th stroke on the scorecard, Weiskopf's ball  cleared the creek and landed left of the shallow green. A chip and a putt gave  him a 13. No one else had ever shot a 10 over par on a single hole in the 44  years of the Masters.  </P> <P> "It was embarrassing," a surprisingly calm Weiskopf said later in the locker  room. "I thought I hit the first one good, but I had too much (backspin) on it.  Then I took a drop and the drop area was still wet from yesterday's rain and  the grass was thin. I should have gone back a few yards, but all I could think  about was hitting it and getting out of there."  </P> <P> Weiskopf, who had a reputation for storming off courses, even in mid-round,  when things didn't go well, not only finished his round with an 85, but also  came back the next day and shot 79 -- thanks in part to two more watery shots  at No. 12.  </P> <P> He missed the cut by 18 strokes.  </P> <P> The swirling winds of Augusta National took their toll of favorites Tom Watson  and Jack Nicklaus at the same hole, the one Bobby Jones called the Golden Bell  when he built the course for the inaugural 1934 Augusta National Invitational  Tournament. It wasn't until 1938 that the tournament became known as the  Masters.  </P> <P> Watson, the tour's leading money winner the previous three years, bogeyed No.  12 on Thursday and then put two balls into Rae's Creek for a triple bogey on  Saturday, falling from contention.  </P> <P> Nicklaus, winner of five previous Masters, found the water for a double bogey  in the first round and was never a factor after taking three putts on six  greens in the second round.  </P> <P> Ballesteros teed off late in the afternoon of the first round, when the wind  was gusting a bit stronger than earlier, but he shot a six-under-par 33-33 --  66 and shared the lead with David Graham, a touring Australian, and Jeff  Mitchell, a 6-foot-2, 200-pound rookie. Craig Stadler, playing with  Ballesteros, had a 74.  </P> <P> Many higher scores -- 76s by Lanny Wadkins and Sandy Lyle, 77s by Curtis  Strange and Billy Casper and, of course, Weiskopf's 85 -- were blamed on the  capricious, ever-changing, winds.  </P> <P> Ballesteros, hitting the fairway off the tee on all but one hole, was boringly  consistent.  </P> <P> "If I hit the ball well, it doesn't matter if the wind is blowing or not,"  Ballesteros said. "I play more in England than anywhere else and that is where  I practice and the wind is always blowing.  </P> <P> "Players should not be concerned too much with the wind. If you think too much  about it, you lose your swing."  </P> <P> When the putter is working as well as Seve's was that day, it also tends to  make one feel better about the wind. He sank birdie putts of 15, 12, 15, 10 and  25 feet, plus a pair of two-putt birdies on par-five holes.  </P> <P> Friday was a different day for him off the tee. He was as wild as he had been  straight the previous day, but he had a logical reason: "Yesterday was Thursday  and today is Friday and you know, that's a difference."  </P> <P> The heroics started early. He hooked his tee shot into the dogwood on No. 2,  but the ball caromed back into the fairway, from where he ripped a one-iron  second shot into a greenside bunker. He blasted out and sank a 10-foot putt for  his first of six birdies.  </P> <P> On No. 14, a 420-yard par-four, he hooked his drive so far left that he had to  loft a pitching wedge over a stand of pines to the green. Twenty feet. One  putt. Another birdie.  </P> <P> Seve summed it his round succinctly: "All hooks, all birdies, I think they good  drives. It is very boring if just fairway, fairway, fairway. It doesn't matter  where you hit the drive if you make the putt."  </P> <P> Rex Caldwell, happy-go-lucky product of San Fernando Valley State College, now  Cal State Northridge, shot a second-round 66 and moved into second place, but  he was four shots shy of the leader.  </P> <P> On a gloomy, muggy Saturday that turned into a day-long drizzle, Ballesteros  kept the patrons interested with four bogeys, an eagle, six birdies -- and only  seven pars.  </P> <P> He got the eagle on the 530-yard eighth hole when he followed a long drive with  a 245-yard three-iron shot that stopped five feet from the pin.  </P> <P> He need a stroke of good luck to salvage a bogey on No. 5, a 450-yard par-four,  where he drove his tee shot so far into the woods that he hit a provisional  ball in case he couldn't find the first one.  </P> <P> "I was saying to myself when I was looking for my ball, 'Seve, you're going to  take double bogey here, but even if you do you'll still be one shot ahead so  keep calm and don't get mad.' Then I found my ball, I know I save a stroke."  </P> <P> The shot went up, as he had planned, and dropped over the pines onto the  fairway, from where he chipped up and took two putts for his bogey.  </P> <P> "That's very good, make bogey and go on. Everyone makes bogeys at the Masters.  What difference does it make when you make them? Just go on to next hole."  </P> <P> On the next hole, 190-yard No. 6, he demonstrated what he meant. He hit a  seven-iron shot that landed on the green and rolled across a corner of the hole  before stopping less than a foot away for a tap-in birdie.  </P> <P> "I was disappointed when it didn't go in," he said, only half joking. "I  thought it was going to be a hole in one, and I have never had one."  </P> <P> The 68 pulled him seven strokes ahead as Caldwell dropped back with a 72 and Ed  Fiori, another Southern Californian who learned his golf on public courses  around Downey, took over second with a roller-coaster round of 69.  </P> <P> Sunday morning, before Ballesteros teed off, he was all smiles.  </P> <P> An early morning downpour turned Augusta National into a 365-acre hothouse and  Ballesteros turned the heat up another notch with birdies at the first, third  and fifth holes to go 10 shots up on Newton and Gilbert, who admitted they were  playing for second money.  </P> <P> The only excitement was whether Seve might shoot 67 and earn a $50,000 bonus  from Golf magazine for breaking the tournament record of 271 set by Nicklaus in  1965 and equaled by Raymond Floyd in 1976.  </P> <P> "The way Seve was playing the front nine, Houdini couldn't have caught him,"  Newton, his playing partner in the final round, said. It was one of the last  times Newton appeared in a major tournament. Early in 1983 he lost his right  arm and eye after walking into a spinning propeller of a private plane in  Sydney, Australia.  </P> <P> But Ballesteros' magic was turning to ashes. He bogeyed No. 10 with three putts  but hardly anyone noticed. At No. 12, the breezes that often change direction  in a ball's mid-flight caught Seve's six-iron tee shot. The ball looked as if  had been struck perfectly when it left his club, but it hit a swift gust and  fell short of the green and bounded from the embankment into Rae's Creek.  </P> <P> A sand wedge from the drop area -- the same one where Weiskopf had suffered  three days earlier -- reached the green for a two-putt double bogey.  </P> <P> Strangely, Seve was still smiling.  </P> <P> "I was not worried. I always make double bogeys. I think I make pretty good  swing so I go on to the next hole. Thirteen is my lucky number. I was glad it  was thirteen that was next."  </P> <P> The race was tighter than Ballesteros knew. Newton, the Australian Open  champion and one of Seve's best friends on the European tour, had birdied Nos.  11 and 12 and the 10-stroke margin had been cut to five.  </P> <P> Ballesteros, who had birdied the short par-five 13th all three days, put his  tee shot in the middle of the fairway and took out a three-iron for his second  shot to the green. He hit it fat. He knew immediately it had no chance to cross  the water.  </P> <P> He managed to salvage a bogey, but when Newton countered with a third  consecutive birdie, the margin was a precarious three shots.  </P> <P> Good fortune, which had seemingly turned its back on the Spaniard, returned to  his side on No. 14, where his drive hit a tree and bounded down a steep incline  onto a patch of pine needles. When he got to his ball, he surprisingly found an  open shot to the green, from where he hit a six-iron 25 feet from the hole,  saving par.  </P> <P> "That shot from the woods was the turning point," Newton said later. "He could  have been in the woods without a shot, and even after he hit it out he was far  enough away to three-putt but he hit a great first putt. If he had bogeyed that  hole it might have been a disaster for him."  </P> <P> Ballesteros said that his next two shots, a drive of 310 yards down the right  side of the fairway and a four-iron over a pond to the 15th green, were his  most important of the day. Both were on the hole where Gene Sarazen made his  legendary double-eagle 2 with a four-wood in 1935. To reach the hole, players  must walk across the Sarazen bridge to the left of the green. "I'm in the water  two times already. If I put the ball in the water again, it's bad, very bad,"  Ballesteros said.  </P> <P> Ballesteros got his two-putt birdie on 15 and parred the final three holes,  becoming the youngest Masters champion. He was 23 years 5 days old when he  first wore the green jacket. Nicklaus, at 23 years 2 months, had been the  youngest when he won in 1963.  </P> <P> Now he is back, looking for a third green coat in the Masters, which will start  Thursday.  </P> <P> Golf Notes  </P> <P> Jack Nicklaus, fresh off a senior tour victory, hit a spectator with a golf  ball Tuesday during a practice round at Augusta National. Nicklaus, a six-time  Masters champion, hooked his second shot on the 555-yard second hole and the  ball hit the spectator below the right eye. Nicklaus came over and apologized.  The man, who was not identified, left the course to receive medical treatment.  </P> <P> 1980: A NEW MASTER AT AUGUSTA  </P> <P> Seve Ballesteros was all over the course, once even hitting the wrong green,  but he led by 10 shots early in the final round and became the youngest winner  of the green jacket. Here are the top finishers in that tournament of a decade  ago.  </P> <P> SEVE BALLESTEROS...66-69-68-72 -- 275  </P> <P> GIBBY GILBERT...70-74-68-67 -- 279  </P> <P> JACK NEWTON...68-74-69-68 -- 279  </P> <P> HUBERT GREEN...68-74-71-67 -- 280  </P> <P> DAVID GRAHAM...66-73-72-70 -- 281  </P> <P> GARY PLAYER...71-71-71-70 -- 283  </P> <P> BEN CRENSHAW...76-70-68-69 -- 283  </P> <P> ED FIORI...71-70-69-73 -- 283  </P> <P> TOM KITE...69-71-74-69 -- 283  </P> <P> LARRY NELSON...69-72-73-69 -- 283  </P> <P> JERRY PATE...72-68-76-67 -- 283  </P></p>

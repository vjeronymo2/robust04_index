			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["cr"-signed report: "Pawlak Demands Opening of German </F> Markets for Construction Companies"]    [Excerpts] Bonn/Warsaw -- Poland's 17 creditor states,  which are associated in the Paris Club, have reduced Poland's  debts by $8 billion, Deputy Finance Minister Krzysztof Krowacki  announced in Warsaw on Friday [14 April]. This puts into  practice the 21 April 1991 decision to reduce by 50 percent the  $33 billion debts. [passage omitted]    Speaking before representatives of industry at the  Federation  of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce [DIHT], Poland's  Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak acknowledged the role that German  banks have played in speeding up this agreement. Pawlak is  convinced that the agreement could considerably reduce the  financial risk involved in trading with Poland and allow an  opening of normal credit lines for financing trade and  investment projects.    The Polish head of government was, however, less pleased  with  bilateral conditions for investment and market access. Pawlak  said that there is not enough willingness in Germany to invest  in Poland. The situation is especially serious in the  construction industry. Poland's supplies in this field have  declined from 2.5 billion German marks [DM] to DM500 million.  Pawlak said he hopes that Polish companies will be given free  access to German markets in the future.    Although Poland had a DM1.5 billion deficit in trade with  Germany last year, Pawlak is optimistic about the future,  because the volume of trade has tripled to DM18 billion over the  past four years. This has made Poland Germany's number one  trading partner in Central and East Europe. As Poland's most  important trading partner, Germany provides one-third of  Poland's entire foreign trade volume.    One of the reasons for Pawlak's optimistic view is the  realization of new forms of institutional cooperation of entire  border regions that "contribute to a deepening of cooperation in  almost all fields." The newly established society for  industrial promotion intends to support this development. It  will be the task of this society to help establish contacts  between partners in the fields of trade and investment,  establish contacts with national and international banks, and  provide advice. Business will also be promoted by the  Warsaw-based Polish-German Chamber of Commerce and Industry that  has now been "put into practice."    Poland, which is associated with the European Union [EU],  has  formally applied for full EU membership. Pawlak was pleased  with the political support that Bonn has promised to give Poland  on its way into the European Union, and he pointed out that all  the legal and structural reform measures that are currently  being enforced are market-oriented. Parallel to the changes in  the system, the Polish economy shows clear signs of recovery,  with an inflation rate that is decreasing comparatively quickly.  Thus, industrial production in the first quarter of 1994  increased by 10 percent over December 1993, while prices only  went up by 5 percent.</p>

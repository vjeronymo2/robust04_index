			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE PERFORMERS WANT TO PIERCE THE CONSCIENCE OF THE AUDIENCE  </P> <P> Things start out innocently enough for Brenda Varda's character in Timberlake  Wertenbaker's "The Love of the Nightingale" (L.A. Theatre Works at the Edgemar  Complex in Santa Monica). But then her brother-in-law takes a brooding fancy to  her during a long ship's voyage.  </P> <P> His lying that he's suddenly single does little to arouse her ardor. Nor does  his murdering her beloved. When all else fails, he rapes her. Later, when she  confronts him with her desperation and fury, he cuts out her tongue.  </P> <P> "The more distance she has to go from innocence, the more horrible that moment  is," said Varda, who is stunning as Philomele, from a giddy, fresh-faced  teen-ager to a middle-aged madwoman. The moment after the attack -- when  Philomele is reeling in agony and disbelief, choking on her blood -- "gets very  silent in the audience," she said. "But the way we do it isn't nearly as  violent as it'd be if you really had your tongue cut out. The amount of blood  would be insane. And you can't swallow; you can't breathe."  </P> <P> The story (set in ancient Greece and freely adapted from ancient myth) is  indeed less concerned with graphic bloodletting than with larger issues of  chauvinism, censorship, sisterhood, slavery, rape and revenge.  </P> <P> "It should be disturbing," the actress said of the violence upon her character,  "because that kind of thing is not something that doesn't happen today. There  are death squads in innumerable countries that eliminate people or make them  silent or cut off their hands. So what we're doing here is not divorced from  the real world. It also has a lot of resonances with what's happening now with  the National Endowment for the Arts, our artistic voices being silenced."  </P> <P> Director Peter Mark Schifter recalls that upon reading the play, his immediate  response was: "Intelligence! Ideas! Theatrical power! Not commercial!"  </P> <P> "I did it because it's an important play," he said. "It has important things to  say for contemporary society. And Brenda brings a real ingenuousness to her  part -- and a piercing intelligence."  </P> <P> Varda believes that intelligence applies to the piece as well, taking exception  to some of the criticism, which labeled "Nightingale" heavy-handed and  didactic.  </P> <P> "Sometimes the force of words and images that shock you and scream at you, that  say 'Are you listening?' are necessary," she said. "This is no museum piece.  Most women have been subjected to some sort of harassment. If you live in New  York, chances are you've been mugged. I lived in Chicago; I got mugged, my  apartment was broken into, my car was stolen. Now those aren't necessarily  crimes against women," she added, laughing, "but since I'm a woman and the  crimes were against me. . . ."  </P> <P> The ability to slip-slide from serious to silly is one of the actress's most  charming qualities. Lissome and long-limbed, she swears to having been an A-1  nerd growing up ("thick glasses and frizzy hair"). She entered the University  of Minnesota as an engineering major but switched to acting after playing piano  for the theater classes, figuring, "Hey, I can do that." She also studied  journalism and interned in television news and on a morning radio show.  </P> <P> "I have stopped acting many times," said Varda, who returned to the university  for her master's in communications ("doing research on creativity, how to  stimulate people to be more creative"), but left before graduating.  Distractions included tours with the St. Louis Repertory and Chicago's Second  City, managing an art gallery, serving as creative consultant for a  prank-playing company in Palo Alto, and -- when times were lean -- paying dues  in waitressing and the secretarial pool.  </P> <P> "The activities seem sort of disparate," she said. "But I like to think of it  as a continuum; things always end up feeding each other. Some of what I've done  on the business side has been totally invaluable in creating an acting life in  Los Angeles."  </P> <P> Not having a regular job, she says, is liberating: "I like to do different  things. I write, I play piano, I sing, I've written a couple of musicals. It  doesn't do wonders for your pension, but as far as what I get to feed myself  with, it's worth it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> "The Love of the Nightingale"  </P> <P> L.A.

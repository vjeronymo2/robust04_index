			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report] </F>   [Text] If the recent failed attempt at elections is  accepted, the Conservative Party [CP] wants to make it very  clear that it regards the new government as the illegal product  of an invalid election. It is unthinkable that in a civilized  country a government should be elected fraudulently and  thereafter expect recognition and to be treated with respect.    This is how the president of the People's Representative  Council and CP leader, Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg, reacted even  before the ballot boxes had been locked and large-scale election  fraud and irregularities had been exposed.    Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg had at that stage already been  insisting that the election be declared null and void, "as a  result of the more than desired number of atrocious  irregularities; because of the fact that the Independent  Electoral Commission proved to be totally inefficient in doing  the job; and that most of the parties have expressed their  dissatisfaction. In such circumstances an election cannot be  labelled free and fair, especially if measured by Western  standards as has always been the case thus far in South Africa.  Hence the intended and anticipated peace will also not  materialize."    According to Dr. Hartzenberg, this process has only been  intended to put a communist ANC government in place,  irregardless of the methods employed or how irregular the  process has been.    "Because the future of 13 nations is at stake, the cost of  the recent abortive election must not be regarded as a  restraining factor when a further election is deemed necessary.  The CP therefore demands that the legitimate demands of all  interested parties and nations be considered all over again, so  that a satisfactory compromise can be reached before any other  election is convened. The constitution's shortcomings must also  be eliminated and the incompetent IEC be replaced by the  Department of Home Affairs. An election must then be arranged  on an ethnic basis for those nations which so prefer."    According to Dr. Hartzenberg, the events during the election  prove that the CP was right in its decision not to participate  in it. "The CP's predictions relating to the forced time scales  and the warnings regarding the incompetence of the IEC seem to  have been correct."    Meanwhile, leader of the HNP [Reformed National Party], Mr.  Jaap Marais, has threatened to challenge the validity of  elections in court. He said in a statement that the  authenticity of the election was out of the question, since the  lack of proper administration led to corruption and fraud. "The  result can definitely not be accepted in South Africa, neither  can it be recognized internationally.    Mr. Marais added that the statement by the IEC on the  legality of the election is invalid.</p>

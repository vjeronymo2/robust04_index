			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has declared that the  German Government's decision to suspend military aid to Turkey  was made in the current election atmosphere in Germany and under  the influence of various circles and under the mistaken  impression created by the public.    In a statement to TRT, Cetin stressed that the German aid  extended within the framework of NATO is not used for internal  security purposes, adding: We regret this decision. Pointing  out that he sent a letter to German Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel on this matter, Cetin remarked that the military  equipment, which was allegedly used for internal security  purposes, is similar to that acquired from the Russian  Federation some time ago. The military equipment received from  Germany is used only for its original purpose, Cetin stressed.  He said that he conveyed the issue to the German foreign  minister in a telephone conversation this evening.    [Begin Cetin recording] I spoke to him on the telephone a  while ago. I related to him that this is very wrong, that  Turkey and Germany are good friends, and that they have  important ties. I remarked that various extremists are engaged  in efforts to disrupt Turkish-German relations, that this is  wrong, and that in its struggle against terrorism Turkey  definitely cannot accept such actions, which could lead to  misunderstandings on the part of its allies and friends. I told  him that decisions to be made in this vein will damage our  relations.    I believe that the German Government should also attach the  necessary importance to Turkish-German relations; and I conveyed  this to him. The German foreign minister noted that he attaches  great importance to Turkish-German relations, that he is  dwelling on the subject, and that he will exert every possible  effort to resolve the problem. He stated that the government  will discuss the issue again.    I would like to take this opportunity to say the following:  Turkey is facing a serious terrorism problem. In this regard,  Turkey is determined to exert every possible effort and wage  every struggle to preserve its unity and integrity within the  rules of a state of law and democracy. Any indirect  encouragement accorded by our friends and allies to circles  which desire to disrupt our relations will adversely affect our  relations. The Turkish and German peoples and countries will  certainly not benefit from this.    I hope that in the current election atmosphere in Germany,  such issues will not be used to serve internal political aims,  because they are too sensitive and important to be used for  internal politics. Moreover, it is very easy to damage  relations. You can disrupt relations with the use of one  sentence or one word, but it will take a long time to repair  them. I hope that our German friends will realize this fact and  demonstrate the necessary understanding for Turkey's justified  cause and position. [end recording]</p>

Any attempts to separate southern Sudan from its northern  part, whether by the north or the south of Sudan or by foreign  quarters, will be faced by a clear Egyptian opposition, he said.    Musa was commenting today on reports of attempts to separate  the south of Sudan.    On the escalation in Yemen, especially after signing the  agreement between the Yemeni president and his deputy, the  foreign minister said: This is unfortunate, especially as it  comes after the signing of an agreement between Yemeni President  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid. This  indicates that the situation is serious. After only a few  hours, the signed document had failed to achieve its purpose.  Egypt hopes the contents of the Pledge and Accord document will  be respected and implemented.    Musa asked: If a document is not respected, then what is the  point in arranging celebrations and protocols for signing  agreements that are not implemented?    On the situation in Bosnia, Musa said all reports reaching  the Foreign Ministry, as well as the NATO statement, show that  the overwhelming majority of heavy weapons have been withdrawn  and that some other weaponry has been placed under UN  supervision. There is no longer a threat there.    He said NATO had reaffirmed that the ultimatum and all other  decisions stand, in case any of these guns or missile batteries  return to their positions or if Sarajevo is fired on, even if it  is not hit. NATO also stressed its commitment to protect the  seclusion zone, the besieged area, and the UN forces, Musa noted.</p>

			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEATRICE A. BEHRMAN; DOLL DESIGNER  </P> <P> Beatrice Alexander Behrman, known as Madame Alexander for the collector's dolls  she created for little girls and museums around the world, has died in Palm  Beach, Fla. She was 95.  </P> <P> Mrs. Behrman died Wednesday of natural causes at her home.  </P> <P> She founded the Alexander Doll Co. in New York City's Harlem in 1923 and sold  it in 1988, remaining a consultant until her death.  </P> <P> The daughter of a Russian immigrant toy shop proprietor, Mrs. Behrman first  designed and made "Red Cross Nurse" rag dolls for her father during World War  I. After the war cut off shipments of European dolls to the United States, she  started her own doll company.  </P> <P> Her Madame Alexander dolls began as rag dolls with hand-painted features.  Adding such lifelike details as eyelashes and rooted hair over the years, she  moved to plastics after World War II.  </P> <P> In the early 1950s, Mrs. Behrman won the Fashion Academy Award for her doll  clothing designs, and was commissioned by the British government to design  dolls representing Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Margaret.  </P> <P> The company has produced more than 5,000 different dolls based on characters  from historic events, literature, music, art and movies.  </P> <P> "I made dolls for children to play with and learn from of life and art," she  said.  </P> <P> Each hand-made doll requires three weeks' work. New ones cost from $40 to $500,  while older collector's models range as high as $5,000.  </P></p>

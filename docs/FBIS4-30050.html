			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 23 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has invited  South Korean sports officials to a meeting this weekend to  discuss the second East Asia games slated for Sept. 20 next year  in Pyongyang.    An official at the Korean Amateur Sports Association (KASA)  said on Thursday that the Pyongyang East Asia Games Organizing  Committee extended the invitation to KASA, informing that the  Pyongyang games' eighth consultative meeting would be held in  Taipei on June 26-28.    The message dated May 25 was delivered through the Taiwan  Olympic Committee. A copy of the message was later sent to the  Korean Olympic Committee [KOC] via the Chinese Olympic  Committee, the official said.    Originally North Korea planned to hold the eighth meeting in  Japan during the Hiroshima Asian games period. But, at the  suggestion by games member countries that it would be too late,  North Korea advanced the time of the meeting to this weekend, a  sports source said.    In response to the invitation, KASA would send three  delegates including Pak Sang-ha, KOC International Committee  chairman, to the Taipei meeting, the official added.</p>

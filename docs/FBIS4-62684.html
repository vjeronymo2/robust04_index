			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Sevindzh Abdullayeva and </F> Viktor Shulman]    [Text] Baku May 17 TASS -- Azerbaijan denounced Armenian  statements that Nagorno-Karabakh can be proclaimed a republic  and join Armenia in future and qualified such plans as a "rude  distortion of the essence of the negotiating process, an actual  appeal to the resumption of combat activities."    The press service of the president of Azerbaijan said in a  statement on Tuesday that "the sides directly involved in the  conflict should by their practical activities and statements  promote the creation of a political atmosphere for a further  development of the negotiating process which has just begun."    Also on Tuesday Azerbaijan refused to sign a cease-fire  protocol in Moscow and its defence minister left for Baku for  additional consultations.    But the press service of the leader of Azerbaijan said the  "republic stands for a just and peaceful settlement of the  conflict, as well as for constructive Russian proposals."    "Azerbaijan proceeds from the fact that the mentioned  efforts  and proposals should be implemented in the framework of  generally-recognised norms and principles of international law,  first and foremost, in the context of ensuring the sovereignty,  territorial integrity and inviolability of frontiers of the  Republic of Azerbaijan," according to the statement.</p>

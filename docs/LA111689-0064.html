			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE PANEL STUDIES BAN ON PESTICIDES  </P> <P> With everything from house paint to body deodorants under siege for their  air-polluting emissions, regulators are turning to agriculture, one of the last  bastions of control-free operations in the state.  </P> <P> As a result, local and state growers may lose the use of some pesticides, which  emit ozone-causing hydrocarbons. At the very least, manufacturers will likely  have to reformulate their California-sold products to use bases other than  petroleum products, and their costs will rise.  </P> <P> With Ventura County under federal order to clean up its air, and with  pesticides accounting for up to 28% of reactive organic compounds that  contribute to ozone pollution, something had to be done, said Richard Baldwin,  the county's air pollution control officer.  </P> <P> "If I can't touch 28% of emissions, I've got an impossible task to attain the  federal ozone standard," Baldwin said. "I probably can't do it." Baldwin heads  a new statewide panel charged with devising methods to decrease pollution in  agriculture and other businesses that depend on pesticides.  </P> <P> Baldwin's panel, composed of representatives from federal and state agriculture  and environmental agencies, the  </P> <P> chemical and farm industries and air pollution control districts, will  recommend new rules to the state Air Resources Board or the state Department of  Food and Agriculture.  </P> <P> Ventura County, along with the Los Angeles area, meets neither federal nor  state clean air standards for ozone pollution. Ozone, the gas that makes up 95%  of smog, is formed when reactive organic compounds mix with nitrogen oxides in  sunlight.  </P> <P> As in paint and spray deodorants, the petroleum solvents in some pesticides  emit ozone-forming hydrocarbons. Solvents are ingredients in which the  pest-killing chemicals dissolve, so they can be applied.  </P> <P> Baldwin previously had been unwilling to act alone to impose regulations on  county growers because that would have made their prices uncompetitive  statewide. But since the state Air Resources Board recently brought pesticides  under its jurisdiction, growers in all counties would be hit with the same  restrictions.  </P> <P> And that could be catastrophic, said Merlin Fagan, environmental affairs  director for the California Farm Bureau Federation, an association of 90,000  growers statewide.  </P> <P> Fagan estimated that more than 80% of pesticides used in California are  petroleum-based.  </P> <P> If pesticides had to be reformulated or were simply unavailable, the  $16-billion agricultural industry could be strapped with production costs well  above its competitors in other states, Fagan said.  </P> <P> "We're not afraid do our share for air pollution, but if we're going to shift  the cost curve to make us not competitive, it might become more cost-effective  for growers and ranchers to subdivide and develop," he said.  </P> <P> Despite grower opposition, Baldwin sees now as the time to act. Growers  question the accuracy of the 28% figure. They say more accurate reporting of  petroleum-based pesticide use is needed before new regulations are issued. And  they protest the loss of any weapons in their fight against pests. Still, they  realize the economic importance of reducing crop-damaging ozone pollution, said  Rex Laird, director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau, an alliance of growers,  and a member of Baldwin's panel.  </P> <P> "There is no question in anybody's mind that pollution harms agriculture," he  said. "We have a vested interest in this."  </P> <P> Studies by the Air Pollution Research Center at the UC Riverside show that  ozone pollution reduces yields and stunts growth in plants and trees. Just as  it attacks the tissue of human lungs, ozone attacks the cell membranes of  plants and trees and thwarts the spreading of tree roots.  </P> <P> The effects are obvious.  </P> <P> "On Labor Day or Memorial Day when the cars are bumper to bumper, any lettuce  planted near the 101 gets burned because of the smog, and the effects lessen  the farther away from the roadside you get," said Phil Phillips, a farm adviser  with the University of California extension office in Ventura.  </P> <P> The benefits of reducing the emissions that cause air pollution are clear, but  the solution may be more elusive. Among the challenges Baldwin's panel faces is  devising rules that will eliminate or reduce the use of oil-based solvents in  pesticides without creating new problems. For instance, one solution being  considered is to require manufacturers to reformulate pesticides, using water  as their base instead of the popular solvent, xylene.  </P> <P> That presents at least three serious problems, said Pradip Mookerjee, a chemist  with Chevron Chemical Co., a major pesticide manufacturer based in Richmond,  Va.  </P> <P> First, only about one-third of the pesticides most widely used will dissolve in  water, and to reformulate is very expensive, he said. But if the pesticides are  soluble in water, they will break down when their particles leach into the  ground water, as well.  </P> <P> "If the product is water-soluble, there is a high probability that it will  leach through the soil and contaminate water," he said.  </P> <P> Mookerjee, who is also on Baldwin's panel, sees a potential problem if the  rules apply to the pure petroleum oil that citrus growers spray directly on  their orchards to fight various pests. The oil, which contains no added  chemical poisons, is applied before the fruit appears on the trees, spreading a  suffocating film over the insects.  </P> <P> "In the modern ecological sense, this is an ideal pesticide," Mookerjee said.  "But the volume of use is quite high."  </P> <P> But because the oil vaporizes far more slowly than the solvents used in  standard pesticides, it may well be left out of the new rules, Mookerjee said.  </P> <P> After the panel has done its work and the new regulations are in place, the  real problem may come in enforcement, said John Taylor, manager of Puregro of  Oxnard, which sells and applies pesticides.  </P> <P> "You've got one or two guys running around the whole county to enforce the laws  that already exist," he said, referring to the pesticide enforcement agents  with the county Agricultural Commissioner's office. "I'm all for cleaning up  the air, but when they are just blowing smoke, it's depressing."  </P> <P> The big agribusinesses will comply with the rules voluntarily, he said. "But go  out to the farm and see if they comply now. I know they're not."  </P> <P> POLLUTION FIGHT -- Computer study finds county must reduce smog by 40%. J7  </P></p>

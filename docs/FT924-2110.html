			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / W Midlands manufacturers' orders continue to fall TRADING conditions for West Midlands engineering companies, whose experience acts as a barometer for the UK manufacturing sector, continued to deteriorate in the three months to November, with a growing proportion of companies reporting a decline in domestic and export orders. The quarterly business survey of the Engineering Employers' Federation West Midlands, covering 475 companies, showed that the percentage of companies reporting lower domestic orders rose to 51 in November from 36 in August. Those reporting lower export orders rose to 31 per cent from 26 per cent. The Autumn Statement and its associated interest rate cut came too late in the November quarter to affect the immediate commercial prospects of companies covered in the survey. Mr David Botterill, chief executive of the EEF West Midlands, noted that 'the next two quarters will provide critical evidence of the future direction of the UK economy'. But the shift in the government's economic policy failed to ignite commercial confidence. The proportion of companies cutting capital investment was 24 per cent, scarcely changed from August. Nearly half of the engineering companies reported that utilisation of capacity and profits were both lower at the end of November, compared with 33 per cent at the end of August. Companies expecting capacity utilisation to decline in the next three months rose to 28 per cent from 21 per cent three months ago. That points to a further reduction in jobs and 32 per cent of companies are expecting a cut in the number of their employees over the next three months. Only 10 per cent of companies intend to take on more people, the lowest proportion recorded this year by the federation.</p>

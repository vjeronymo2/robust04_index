			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hans Dieter Sauer: "Recycling Improves PVC's </F> Image"]    [Text] [First paragraph is editor's summary] VDIN,  Duesseldorf, 18 Feb 94((Curse or blessing))no artificial  material is a source of such vehement discussion as polyvinyl  chloride. The economy has built up a comprehensive  infrastructure for recycling and is thus removing a portion of  PVC from critical environmental discussion. PVC is everywhere.  It is found as window frame, drainpipe, floor covering, cable  sheathing and automobile part, but also as transparent wrap,  record, check-cashing card and ring binder. Every year the  chemical and plastic processing industries put 1.4 million tons  of new PVC in circulation, and approximately 360,000 tons are  discarded annually as used products. Producers and processors of  PVC praise its resistance, durability, and versatile  applicability. Environmentalists, on the other hand, see it as  particularly environmentally harmful material: during production  the carcinogenic gas vinyl chloride is employed, and PVC also  contains toxic materials as softeners, as well as lead and  cadmium for UV stabilization. Not least, burning the artifical  material can create dioxins and fusanes.The great majority of  old PVC is still deposited as trash or burned. But the material  is more and more often becoming part of a cycle. Werner  Preusker, chief executive of the Bonn working group PVC and  Environemnt (AgPU), a coalition of PVC producers, processors and  users, private individuals and institutes, emphasizes: "There  are functioning recycling possibilities today for the most  important PVC products."    For windows, floor coverings, pipes and gutters  (quantitatively these products make up half of all PVC products)  the organization of comprehensive collection systems is in full  swing in Germany or has already been completed. The first major  plants for reprocessing the used material have started up. Six  manufacturers of PVC windows have joined forces in the "Window  Recycling Initiative" (FREI), which has reached agreement with  numerous window and facade companies about returning used  windows. FREI members in turn have committed themselves to using  recycled PVC products in the production of new window profiles.  The windows are taken for reprocessing to Dekura GmbH in Rahden,  in Westphalia. As a rule the recycled material is processed into  a profilejnucleus which is surrounded by a layer of new material.    Reprocessing is done basically in three steps. After rough  shredding and the sorting out of glass splinters, a shredder  chops up the frame pieces along with fittings and steel frames.  Then magnets and separators separate iron and nonferrous metals  out of the mixture, and a socalled heavy goods selector picks  out any fragments of glass and metal which remain. The material  is then ground into small grains, sifted, extruded at 150  degrees Celsius and finally granulated in pill size. The plant  can process 1.5 tons of used windows in an hour. At present it  is running a single shift -- not enough material is being  supplied for more.    Because numerous depositories still accept used windows,  according to Dekura's chief executive Horst Detering, "recycling  is having the ground cut away under it."Besides FREI, the  profile producer VEKA in Sendenhorst also takes back old PVC  windows. In the Thuringian town of Behringen, north of Eisenach,  VEKA Environmental Technology GmbH has constructed for about  DM30 million the "most modern recycling plant in Europe for  windows, roller blinds, plates and profile remnants made of  PVC." The fully automated plant also uses their different  physical properties to separate the window components))glass,  metal, rubber and PVC.    According to the oprators, 97.5 percent of the material  provided can be recovered in reusable quality; only 2.5 percent  is unusable waste. Production leader Erich Schulz emphasizes as  a particular advantage that soon it will be possible to sort the  recycled product into white and colored. For this purpose every  grain of PVC is subjected to a flash of light; if it is a white  grain, a puff of air from a jet is released by its greater  reflectivity and the grain is blown off the conveyor belt, while  the colored grains are unaffected and stay where they are. The  plant can also reprocess the wooden windows with plastic coating  typical of the GDR, socalled plasta)windows. Since the wood is  untreated, according to Schulz it is suitable for the  manufacture of chip boards. To ensure supplies, VEKA has made  agreements with 300 processors of PVC frames to supply  dismantled windows, roller blinds and profiles in Behringen.    Floor coverings have been collected since 1990 by the  working  group PVC Bodenbelag Recycling (AgPR) in selected test areas and  processed in a plant in Grossefehn in East Frisia. However, it  took some time to master the technology. "We needed to find out  that you have to proceed quite differently in the reprocessing  of used coverings than in the reuse of production residue,"  reports Hans Juergen Nettelnbreker of the company Huels AG,  which developed the procedure for AgPR.The solution they found  was socalled cold grinding. The soft PVC is hardened by liquid  nitrogen so that it can be reduced to very fine grains with a  diameter of 200 micrometers.    In this way not only is the quality of the grind improved  but  a significantly higher throughput is also achieved. The plant's  present capacity is 4,000 tons per year according to  Nettelnbreker, more is not available at the moment on the used  PVC market. The recycled material is reused by the member  companies of AgPR as an underlay for floor tiles.    After being dismantled last autumn, the plant is now being  rebuilt in a more favorable location in Troisdorf near Bonn. A  plant is being planned at the same location for the recycling of  PVC roof guttering.    PVC tubes are collected under the guidance of the Artificial  Materials Association (KRV) in Bobb. From the dealers the  material goes to four regional centers, where it is sorted and  cleaned. The processing is scheduled to begin soon on the  premises of the Wavin company in Westeregeln near Magdeburg. A  total of approximately 5 percent of PVC waste is now being  recycled, in the estimation of Walter Toetsch of the company  Huel AG.    In the case of pipes and windows, because of their long  life,  at present there are only minimal quantities of less than one  percent. In the case of floor coverings, approximately 20  percent is reprocessed. Recycling stands or falls with the  collection system.  The purity of the various types and the soiling of the  material, and thus ultimately also the quality of the recycled  product, are determined by the method of collecting.    Since different PVC types are used for different products,  the basic rule is: window profiles are made into window  profiles, floor coverings are made into floor coverings, and  pipes are made into pipes.When collection is carried out by  professionals, good results are achieved.    Experience has proved, however, that collection in  unsupervised containers yields unusable mixtures even when the  user is given extensive information.In any case, collection is  associated with high costs. That is why recycled products are  usually more expensive than raw materials. Toetsch confirms that  "the recycling of artificial materials, apart from production  wastes, must always be subsidized through the product or through  a disposal fee. "At Huels AG, PVC was ground nine times to  technical school standards and reformed into products without  its mechanical properties deteriorating. But practical  recyclability is limited by the structure of the finished  products, demands placed on the material during use, and the  type of collection.    In order to exploit the potential of nine cycles, more than  90 percent of every product generation would have to be  recovered and cleanly sorted. "That is unrealistic," Toetsch  points out. Even copper, he said, achieves a recycling quota of  only 40 percent, which represents 1.7 cycles. Material recycling  has its limits for PVC too. Depending on the application, a  realistic proportion of recycled material in new products lies  between 20 and 30 percent. This gives the upper limit for  material processing, as is stressed by AgPU expert Joachim  Eckstein.    If high reprocessing quotas were demanded, Eckstein  calculates that there would unavoidably be large surpluses of  recycled material. In his estimation the EU could accumulate a  mountain of 50 million tons of used plastics over a period of 10  years. He is firmly convinced that "a return quota of 60 percent  with nothing but material recycling cannot possibly be  realized." The Federal Environmental Agency (UBA) in Berlin has  not yet taken up anjunambiguous position on PVC recycling. It  describes its own attitude as "ambivalent"; it is true that  recycling reduces wastes, but it does not solve the problems  which lie in the material PVC itself. The UBA hopes for  clarification from a research project with the title "Ecological  Comparison of Products Which Contain Bromides and Chlorides With  Those Which Do Not in the Construction Industry." The results  should be available by the end of this year.</p>

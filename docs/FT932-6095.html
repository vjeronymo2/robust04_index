			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Arts: Welcome to Ayckbournsville - Alastair Macaulay reviews Ayckbourn's 'The Norman Conquests' in Scarborough, and decides that it is the perfect place for a weekend THE EAST Coast has its laureates: Aldeburgh's Britten; Hull's Larkin; and Scarborough's Ayckbourn. People now come to Scarborough just because it is Ayckbournsville; they come from the European continent and they come from America in whole parties. Ayckbourn joined Scarborough's Theatre-in-the-Round in 1957 and began to write plays there (aged 20) in 1959. He is sufficiently immodest now to observe that only Shaw is his rival for longevity among playwrights. 'I've now written 45, which is a lot more than Shakespeare did. But then he didn't have the chance of working in Scarborough.' To those who have not seen an Ayckbourn play in Scarborough, that last line may give the impression that the town feasts Ayckbourn with a luxurious big theatre - something along the lines of those in Stratford or Chichester. So it is a shock the first time you find the Stephen Joseph Theatre-in-the-Round - in the grounds of a school. (Its predecessor was used to be in part of the town library. After a few years, the library said it needed the space back 'for cultural reasons.') Foyer space is limited, the auditorium seats 300, stage space is hardly larger than that of most London pub theatres, the audience has to exit across the stage, and the air-conditioning is noisy. For these conditions Ayckbourn has conceived most of his most successful plays. Now the theatre is to move a few blocks, into the former Odeon cinema. The main theatre will still be in the round, and the stage area, though improved by hydraulic equipment, will remain intimate. But the auditorium now will seat 400, with improved exits and air-conditioning and larger foyers; and there will be a second auditorium seating 200. In press conference this week, Ayckbourn did not disclose any particular ambitions to write plays to fit the new space. He spoke instead of being able to finish his staging of the Chekhov cycle there, and of being able to foster several new playwrights by giving them a place to create new work. The new theatre will cost Pounds 4,350,000; 40 per cent of that has already been raised. Ayckbourn himself has contributed L400,000; he plans that the new theatre should open in 1995, in time to mark the 40th anniversary of Stephen Joseph's foundation of the Theatre-in-the-Round there, and he says he has ensured that the larger auditorium will bear Joseph's name. Some theatre-goers may often have wished they had an excuse to stay in Scarborough for more than one night, but scheduling seldom makes that easy (with each play performed in blocks of performances). This season, however, Ayckbourn's main project for this year has been to revive his famous trilogy The Norman Conquests, directing this 20th-anniversary staging himself; and so one may spend three days in Scarborough watching the three plays in succession. Though the playwright has made a few surreptitious updatings - Norman now says 'trainers' instead of 'gym shoes' - this seems designed only to stop the plays becoming period pieces just yet. The gist of The Norman Conquests, you may remember, is that each of the three plays occurs during the same weekend, but in a different part of (or outside) the same house. Watching them in a quick series - each one stands very well on its own - is, of course, to find the laughter multiplying steadily with every new bit of knowledge gained about the six characters. But it is also to be amazed by the plasticity with which Ayckbourn presents his characters and the events of the weekend. The Norman Conquests is the farce equivalent of Lawrence Durrell's Alexandria Quartet: relativity is all, and all versions of the truth are true. Four of Ayckbourn's new cast are just about perfect: Adrian McLoughlin (Reg), Andrew Charleson (Tom), Dariel Pertwee (Annie) and Buffy Davis (Ruth). Their playing is in-the-round in every sense; they let you see the different shades of their characters, with wonderfully objective playing. In the exceptionally hard role of Norman - Norman the feckless Don Juan of the provinces, the pathetically manipulative disaster area - Peter Lindford is almost as fine; just a trifle too practised and fluent in some speeches. Jane Maud attends too much to the surface of Sarah, deploying a hundred little facial, vocal and gestural actressy effects which actually bar us from seeing Sarah. The Norman Conquests are all about a dirty weekend that never occurs. Now, as it happens, Scarborough is just the place I would pick for a dirty weekend. Any town with sea-bathing, and, a mediaeval castle, cliffs, and a good theatre comes pretty high up my list. Even on a grey day you can walk along the cliffs for miles, with the North Sea churning below; and even if, like Norman or myself, you fail to get a dirty weekend to work out successfully, it is a pleasant town in which to pass the days that precede the evenings on which you watch The Norman Conquests unfold. The Norman Conquests is performed at Scarborough on various dates through to September 4</p>

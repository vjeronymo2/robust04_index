			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / LDP's reform bluff is called: Robert Thomson interprets the drama in Japan's parliament THE WORDS seiji kaikaku (political reform) have echoed through the Japanese parliament for so long that they have lost resonance and relevance. But, with the ruling Liberal Democratic party on the brink of a split and the country facing a possible snap election, the words have suddenly acquired new meaning. 'Did you see the politicians fighting on television last night?' asked an excited Japanese bank official yesterday. Having been encouraged to be apathetic by the frequent broken promises for change, the Japanese have been exhilarated by the action-packed political theatre of the past few days and can look forward to a few more days of an intriguing plot. One reason for the excitement is that two years ago Mr Toshiki Kaifu, the then prime minister, declared that he would push ahead with political reform regardless of opposition from the LDP's elders. Not long after his unexpected assertiveness, the well-meaning Mr Kaifu was humiliatingly dumped by those same elders. Things are different this time around. His successor, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, has allowed the LDP elders to stall reform once again, but the party faces a revolt from younger members who are threatening to support a planned no-confidence motion today against the cabinet and may force Mr Miyazawa to call a general election. The prime minister and most other LDP faction leaders had presumed that the political reform debate would take its usual course. Statements were made supporting reform, breasts were beaten and fists shaken, though these faction leaders had no intention of threatening their positions at the top of the political hierarchy by permitting radical change. Until this week, the debate went as planned. The anti-reformers in the LDP proposed a system of single-seat constituencies to replace the present multi-seat system, which has been prone to corruption. LDP factions compete for seats in the same constituency, putting pressure on each other to raise ever larger amounts of money and to promise local voters ever more bridges and railway lines. The system also makes young politicians dependent on faction funding for their campaigns, and ensures their loyalty to that faction in the parliament. In return, after five or so terms in office, the faction will provide the MP with a ministerial post, often regardless of suitability for the job. It may appear that the supporters of a single-seat system are in favour of reform, and the proposal has been accompanied by the statement that 'we must not compromise on our duty to reform the political system'. But the LDP members proposing the single-seat system know that it will be rejected by the opposition, and the reform debate will be stalled. The strategy of these LDP members, who are in the majority, was to suggest that they personally had pushed for reform, but to lament that the path was blocked by the four belligerent opposition parties. Opposition leaders generally favour a mix of proportional representation and single seats, fearing they would be slaughtered by the powerful LDP in a single seat shoot-out. But the anti-reformers, led by Mr Seiroku Kajiyama, the LDP secretary general, now find that their bluff has been called. They were nervously attempting to negotiate a peace settlement last night with the reformers, including Mr Tsutomu Hata, the former finance minister who recently turned down a cherished appointment as foreign minister to concentrate on changing the political system. In normal circumstances, the LDP would have the numbers to defeat a no-confidence motion, as the party has 278 members out of the present total of 496 representatives in the lower house, where the vote would be put. The problem is Mr Hata has 35 members in his faction, and all are apparently prepared at least to abstain - or perhaps even vote against the government. 'We have said that we are in favour of reform and we must take appropriate action to secure reform,' Mr Hata said last night. If he can convince enough young LDP members outside his faction to abstain, then Mr Miyazawa will be defeated without Mr Hata having to vote in support of the opposition and risk acquiring the tag of traitor. A shaken Mr Miyazawa has suggested that he is not afraid to call an election. However, recent opinion polls put his cabinet's popularity rating at a meagre 25 per cent, and he is likely to have lost some of that support in recent days because of his indecisiveness during the last week. Even if there is an election and the LDP is pounded at the polls, and even if a new electoral system is introduced, the old relationships and factions will not necessarily lose their influence. As Mr Hata has suggested, 'it's not just a matter of changing the system, you have to change the way of thinking'.</p>

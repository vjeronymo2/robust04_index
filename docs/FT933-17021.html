			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Bosnian Croat army issues general call-up: Moslem gains prompt mobilisation BOSNIAN Croat commanders yesterday ordered a general mobilisation as Moslem forces tightened their grip in the battle for Mostar in south-western Bosnia-Hercegovina. Moslem troops overran a Coat military base in Mostar after fierce fighting and secured the northern approaches to the city, according to Sarajevo radio. The Moslem gains yesterday prompted Mr Jadranko Prlic, prime minister of the self-styled Croat state of Herceg-Bosnia, to order Bosnian Croat men between the ages of 18 and 60 to report for military duty within 24 hours. Moslems outnumber Croats, who comprised 17 per cent of Bosnia's pre-war population of 4.3m. But Croat forces are better armed and have been bolstered by reinforcements from Croatia. The fighting at Mostar has reduced to rubble the regional capital of south-western Bosnia-Hercegovina, which was heavily damaged last year by Yugoslav army shelling. Sarajevo radio reported that some 30,000 Moslems were trapped in the city, with no food, medicine or electricity. It said Serbs and Croats yesterday pressed on with their joint attack against the Moslem-led Bosnian army around Maglaj and Zavidovici, Moslem-held towns in north-central Bosnia. Reports said refugees streamed out of Novi Seher, a suburb of Maglaj, which was set ablaze. Corpses floated down the River Bosna which flows through both towns, according to one report which could not be independently confirmed. UN officials yesterday said Serb commanders had despatched tanks to fight beside Croat forces around Maglaj. Recent reports say Serb fighters have rented tanks to their one-time enemies for DM500 (Pounds 200) a day. Tanjug, the Serbian news agency, denied that Serbs and Croats had engaged in a joint assault against the Moslems. The tenuous alliance between Croats and Moslems collapsed in April when Croat forces moved to take control of key towns in central and southern Bosnia. In Sarajevo the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said the surge in fighting and a shortfall in contributions from donor nations meant food aid for more than 1m people in central Bosnia would be halved over the next two months. Reuter adds: Serbian authorities yesterday charged opposition leader Mr Vuk Draskovic and his wife with assaulting a policeman and inciting a riot and demanded they be held in custody pending trial, according to Tanjug. The couple were arrested - and severely beaten - on June 2 after anti-government riots in Belgrade in which a policeman was killed and many protesters injured.</p>

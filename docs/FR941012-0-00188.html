			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Dispute Resolution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Disputes involving highway routing agreements between political jurisdictions within a State are to be resolved by the State's routing agency. Unresolved disputes involving through highway routing or routing designation agreements between States or Indian tribes may be submitted to the Administrator for resolution. Details of the dispute shall be furnished to the Administrator by the petitioner, together with a description of what was done to try to settle it, plus a recommendation of the actions that should be taken by the Administrator to resolve the dispute. The FHWA has revised &sect;397.75 of this regulation to clearly set forth the importance of public safety in any routing designation. The State or Indian tribe filing the petition for dispute resolution shall be responsible for providing a comparative risk analysis for the proposed routing designation and the current routing condition. Once a dispute is submitted to the Administrator, no court action may be taken for one year or until after a decision by the Administrator, whichever occurs first.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Judicial Review of Dispute Decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A party to a dispute who is adversely affected by a dispute resolution decision of the Administrator can obtain judicial review of the decision if such court action is filed within 90 days after the Administrator's decision becomes final.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Preemption Determinations and Waivers of Preemption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On September 24, 1992, the FHWA published an interim final rule (57 FR 44132) amending 49 CFR 397 by adding a subpart E which established procedures applicable to preemption determinations and waivers of preemption. This final rule amends subpart E to make these procedures applicable to NRHM routing designations which are now included in subpart C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any highway routing designation established, maintained or enforced by a State, a political subdivision thereof, or an Indian tribe is preempted if:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Compliance with both the highway routing designation and any requirement of chapter 51 of title 49, United States Code, or of a regulation prescribed thereunder is not possible;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The highway routing designation, as applied or enforced is an obstacle to accomplishing and carrying out chapter 51 of title 49, United States Code, or the regulations prescribed thereunder; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A State or Indian tribe establishes, maintains or enforces any routing designation that does not comply with the procedural and substantive requirements of the Federal standards set forth in this regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person, including a State, political subdivision thereof, or Indian tribe, affected by a NRHM routing designation can apply to the Administrator for a determination of whether such routing designation is preempted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A State, political subdivision, or Indian tribe may apply to the Administrator for a waiver of preemption. The Administrator is authorized to waive preemption of a NRHM routing designation, based on a determination that it provides equal or better protection to the public than these regulations would provide, and it does not unreasonably burden commerce.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Technical Amendments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Public Law 103&hyph;272 (108 Stat. 745), enacted on July 5, 1994, codified certain U.S. transportation laws as title 49, United States Code. Like other transportation statutes, the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act was repealed and its contents restated in title 49. This final rule changes the citations contained in the NPRM to conform to the provisions of the new law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

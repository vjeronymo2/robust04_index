			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "The National Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Venezuelan Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom has  charged there is a subversive plan aimed at destabilizing the  country. Escovar also said that the national government will  adopt severe measures against persons speculating in the value  of the dollar.    [Begin Escovar recording] I want to tell you the following:  This morning there were riots in some areas of the capital and  in some places in the interior. Most of the demonstrations are  under control. None are out of the government's control. Both  the National Guard and the metropolitan police are on the  streets closely cooperating to safeguard public order.    The citizens can be sure that the government is prepared to  take every measure necessary to safeguard the country's peace. I  want to report that there is a plan that calls for agitation.  Political interests that sometimes are contradictory are  involved in this plan. The people involved hope that public  order alterations may help their particular objectives.    To this we can add that before I was interior minister, when  I was the prosecutor general, I spoke of a hairy arm. I want to  tell you that the hairy arm is roaming around, that it is acting  up. The government is investigating to determine the degree of  participation in these events of the mourners of corruption and  people who do not want the penalization of some crimes against  the state or of crimes of corruption, people who want to create  confusion to use it as a smokescreen at a moment when the  country is closely following the struggle against corruption.  [end recording]    Meanwhile, Education Minister Antonio Luis Cardenas appealed  to students not to be fooled. He also urged parents and others  not to let secondary schools be used for subversive purposes.    [Begin Cardenas recording] Right. We, and I in particular,  as  education minister, deeply regret that people who want to  subvert public order, as well as destabilize the country, are  using public secondary schools and the boys, girls, and young  people studying in those schools to create riots and confusion.    Those people must realize that those schools care for the  lower income population and that the country is being seriously  harmed when boys and girls and young people are used to achieve  ugly goals. We have already had the unfortunate death of one  student. We regret that. Today I was informed that a young man  and a boy have been wounded. We must stop this situation. We  must clearly identify who the enemies of public education are,  who is leading these young people to a dangerous situation. We  appeal to parents and custodians and the community not to let  their schools, the ones attended by the needy people, the public  schools, to be used for subversive purposes.    We have decided not to suspend classes because we do not  think that is a solution, that it would harm the young people.  [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> 1ST CONTRACT SINCE FIRINGS;  </P> <P> AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS IN ACCORD WITH FAA  </P> <P> Air traffic controllers have reached tentative agreement with the Federal  Aviation Administration on their first union contract since President Reagan  fired 11,400 controllers in 1981.  </P> <P> "It's a clear victory for both the FAA and the union," said union President R.  Steve Bell, who predicted easy approval of the agreement by the National Air  Traffic Controllers Assn.'s 7,000 members. They make up just over half of the  nationwide controller work force.  </P> <P> "It represents a new spirit of cooperation between labor and management at FAA,  in sharp contrast to past problems," said FAA spokesman John G. Leyden.  </P> <P> The tentative contract was signed late Thursday after a third round of talks in  Baltimore, Md. The negotiations began in Washington in November.  </P> <P> The union won the right to represent the 13,000 controllers in June, 1987. The  former union, the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, was forced  into bankruptcy and decertified after Reagan's mass firings of most of its  members during the strike.  </P> <P> The contract does not cover salaries, which are set by Congress, or any matter  that would significantly increase cost of the operation.  </P> <P> It covers some working conditions, guaranteeing breaks for employees and  changes in working positions after every two hours. The controllers monitor and  control air traffic at about 400 installations around the country.  </P> <P> The contract also sets up several committees on safety, technology and other  matters, a development that union negotiator Elizabeth Thomas of Tamiami, Fla.,  said would give the union more involvement in FAA decision making.  </P> <P> Among provisions are participation of the union in accident investigations that  involve a controller's actions, immunity for controllers who report  deficiencies in the system, local and national committees on keeping a safe  workplace, and evaluation of possibly setting up a program to deal with job  stress.  </P> <P> Controllers earn between $19,000 and $55,000 a year, depending on experience  and the number of operations conducted at their assigned facilities.  </P></p>

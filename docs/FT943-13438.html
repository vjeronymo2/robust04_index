			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Europarliament elects president German Socialist Mr Klaus Haensch was elected president of the European parliament yesterday. Mr Haensch, who won 365 votes in the 567-member assembly, succeeds fellow German Mr Egon Klepsch. He will hold the post for half the five-year legislature. Mr Haensch's only opponent was French Liberal MEP Mr Yves Galland who gained 87 votes. Mr Haensch, 55, has been an MEP since the first direct elections to the assembly in 1979 and has concentrated on foreign and security policy matters. He has said his priorities are to secure increased powers for the parliament in the planned 1996 review of the EU's workings and to make full use of new powers it secured under the Maastricht treaty.</p>

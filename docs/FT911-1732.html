			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Securities clearing plan on course MOST of the clearing and settlement systems supporting the world's biggest securities markets are still on course to meet internationally agreed standards of performance by the end of next year, according to a report* from the Group of Thirty. However, a number of countries - including the UK, Spain, Italy, Australia and Hong Kong - face substantial developments if they are not to fall farther behind. Within Europe particularly, the efficiency and security of settlement arrangements have become an important aspect of the competition between national exchanges. G30, an international group of financial and economic experts chaired by Lord Richardson, a former governor of the Bank of England, laid down a series of recommended standards in 1989. These include the creation of central securities depositories, delivery versus payment mechanisms (to ensure cash and securities change hands simultaneously) and rolling settlement, with all transactions being settled three days after the trade date. The deadline set for most targets is the end of next year. A series of progress reports from 21 countries, published by G30 this week, show that most expect to be able to reach the targets on time. In an introduction to the report, Lord Richardson paid tribute to what he called 'impressive' efforts, given the 'substantial investment' called for at a difficult time for the industry, and the fact that many changes would result in upheavals in working practice. Some of the most developed settlement systems still lack key elements, Lord Richardson said. These include those in Japan, which is about to start loading information onto its central depository, France, which has yet to move to rolling settlement, and the US, which faces considerable opposition from the retail market in moving to three-day rolling settlement. Greater difficulties face countries like the UK, he added. 'With a paper-based system, no comprehensive central depository, no rolling settlement and no satisfactory delivery versus payment, the UK has a long and difficult hill to climb.' * Clearance and Settlement Systems Status Reports: Year-end 1990, Group of Thirty.

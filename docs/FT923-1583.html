			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Survey of Belize (7): Haven for refugees - The open door policy is under strain CENTRAL AMERICA's dirty wars have left Belize with one of the world's least known refugee problems: Belize has absorbed in 10 years an influx of foreigners equivalent to one-fifth of its population. In most countries, this would have brought about a surge of resentment and possibly riots. In Belize, in part because of its sparse population, it has been viewed with equanimity. There are signs, however, that the early tolerance to the newcomers is wearing thin, which has forced the government to shift its laisser faire stance on the issue. According to Mr Ismael Garcia, the country's ambassador to central America and Panama, most of the migrants to Belize are from El Salvador, accounting for perhaps 75 per cent of the estimated 30,000 to 40,000 foreigners who have entered Belize to settle. Some 20 per cent are from Guatemala, and the remainder from Honduras and Nicaragua. Honduras used to provide the seasonal workers for agriculture in Belize but the place of these transient workers has now largely been taken by more permanent residents. Mr Garcia said refugee cards are held by about 7,500 heads of households, suggesting perhaps 20,000 people would be officially defined as refugees. The children of other migrants born in Belize would also be entitled to citizenship. Belize has never established refugee camps, and refugees are free to move across the country. Many take over land and set up small farms, a practice generally tolerated by the government. However, relations between the previous government and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees did at times become tense. They have since relaxed, with the government signing in 1990 the UN convention of 1951 and the 1967 protocol that governs refugees' rights. The pace of immigration has slowed since the peak years in the mid-1980s. With the prospect of peace settling over central America, some migrants have started to trickle home. However, there is little doubt that the settlers are overstretching the country's education and health services. At least 60-70 per cent of the people using Belmopan's hospital, for example, are migrants. An estimated 90 per cent of the immigrants to Belize are illiterate and unskilled. Even though the migrants are recognised as making an important contribution to the growth of the agricultural sector in the last decade - taking jobs for pay most Belizeans would not consider working for - there is a growing sentiment that the newcomers are depriving Belizeans of jobs. The government's recent statements have reflected this disquiet. The foreign minister, Mr Said Musa, said in June: 'The time has now come for us to make a clear distinction between those who are genuine refugees and those who are economic migrants.' This policy aims at restricting entry of economic migrants and enforcing the law concerning illegal aliens. Voluntary repatriation will be encouraged. The policy is, however, more easily stated than enacted. The border between Belize and Guatemala is highly porous and difficult to police, and the prospect of round-ups of 'illegal aliens' is not one the government relishes. However, economics will continue to make Belize attractive for most central American peasants: farm workers can more than double the Dollars 4 a day they earn in Guatemala. Neither do the population pressures in the other countries exist in Belize.</p>

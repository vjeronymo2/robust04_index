			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Managers 'intimidated' by computers MANAGERS are intimidated by computers although most of them use PCs in their work, and 40 per cent say they could not do their jobs without them, according to a survey by the British Institute of Management and Microsoft, the computer software group. More than 90 per cent of managers questioned admitted being uncomfortable with computer technology. The survey results, released today, underline the continuing rift between managers' perceptions of the benefits of information technology and ways in which computers are used. The survey also suggests that the progress of technology is outstripping managers' ability to keep up. The main reasons cited for managers' unease are the use of jargon and lack of training. Three quarters of the respondents say computers are fundamental to their jobs and most think they bring considerable benefits in speeding up the performance of basic tasks and in enabling managers to do things they could not do before. In spite of the potential rewards, however, most personal computers are still being relegated to the role of glorified typewriters or calculators. Only 20 per cent of managers uses computers to help focus on priorities. Managers are not using computers to reduce their isolation, the survey says. Almost half the regular users work with stand-alone PCs. Only 10 per cent of managers uses a local PC network to share information with colleagues. Only 6 per cent of the respondents consider that the computers employed in their organisations are being used to their full potential and 97 per cent feel information technology will have a significant impact on their work in future. The survey suggests that nearly 60 per cent of managers have to rely on some self-tuition or to fall back on advice from colleagues. A total of 58 per cent feel that lack of time to be able to learn is the biggest deterrent to their use of information technology. However, when asked if computers were becoming easier to use, 87 per cent felt they were and 91 per cent cited more user-friendly software as the main reason. Commenting on the survey, Mr Roger Young, institute director-general, said: 'Managers know that computers can improve their productivity. Jargon and lack of training prevent them from exploiting these assets. An hour with a software manual is not enough. If managers are ever going to make full use of computers as a powerful working tool . . . they need training. 'The message is clear. Organisations must invest in software training. If they don't, they are squandering their investment in hardware.'</p>

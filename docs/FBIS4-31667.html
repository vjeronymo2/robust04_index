			<p>BFN     [Text] Brcko, 13 Jun (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Croat forces and  the Croatian Army shelled Krepsic 10 km west of Brcko at around  1300 today, firing twelve 82 mm mortar shells from the direction  of Vucilovac, the press center in Brcko said today. Croatian  forces opened strong infantry fire on Covic Polje 8 km southwest  of Orasje from the direction of Matici at around 0900 this  morning.    The republic of Srpska army units did not respond because  the  attacks had no serious consequences. Muslim forces also  launched attacks on the southwestern part of the Brcko front,  targeting Serbian positions but also without consequences for  the Serbian side which did not respond.    According to Serbian military sources, the attacks indicate  that the Croatian and Muslim forces have no intention of halting  their operations against the Serbian defense lines in Posavina,  and that in this way they will try to create conditions to  realize the goal for which they have been massing troops in the  area over the last few months -- to capture Posavina and link  Croatian and Muslim territories through this area.</p>

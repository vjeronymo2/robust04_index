In counties for which the Special Provisions designates a spring final planting date, the prevented planting guarantee will be based on your approved yield for spring-planted acreage of the insured crop. For example, if your production guarantee for timely planted acreage is 30 bushels per acre, your prevented planting production guarantee would be equivalent to 15 bushels per acre (30 bushels multiplied by 0.50). This subparagraph does not prohibit the preparation and care of the acreage for conservation practices, such as planting a cover crop, as long as such crop is not intended for harvest); or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) To plant the insured crop after the late planting period (The production guarantee for such acreage will be 50 percent (50%) of the production guarantee for timely planted acres.

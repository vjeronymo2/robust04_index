What  is your position on the Council of State decision regarding the  conduct of President Gaviria and the presence of U.S. troops in  our country? Good morning, Dr. Humberto de la Calle.    [De la Calle] Good morning, Dario. I am pleased to greet  you.    [Arizmendi] The same here, sir.    [De la Calle] I can tell you the following: I criticized the  little school episode because it was poorly handled. I believe  that what the country deserved was to be told the whole truth  right away, however I also want to tell you that I do not agree  with the decision Council of State decision because I do not  believe the Constitution has been violated. I share the belief  that an international treaty is being applied here. We are not  talking about a wartime situation or the presence of foreign  troops here but of joint maneuvers aimed at improving Colombia's  response capabilities in the area of security and the fight  against crime. I believe there is a precedent. All Latin  American countries conduct these type of joint exercises.  Colombia has been holding them for the past 30 or 40 years. I  believe the Council of State decision endangers all possible  military cooperation in matters of security and the fight  against drug trafficking.    Among other things, we not only receive military support,  but  also judicial support. This excess of nationalism only benefits  criminals, drug traffickers, and the guerrillas. I do not share  the positions of the Council of State.    [Arizmendi] Dr. Humberto de la Calle Lombana, do you believe  this decision made by the Council of State can seriously  endanger the candidacy of President Cesar Gaviria for the post  of OAS secretary general.    [De la Calle] I frankly hope the congress, which will review  his conduct, will bear in mind what we have pointed out with the  interpretation, which I believe is the correct one. I hope it  will clear up this incident, which is naturally disturbing for  the president and for Colombia.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [EC press release No. PRES/94/001: "Press Statement by the </F> Presidency on Behalf of The European Union"]    [Text] The European Union is following with concern  developments in the situation in the Congo, particularly in the  increasing frequency of confrontations in the capital and the  weakening of the process established by the Libreville Agreement  of 4 August 1993.    The European Union would remind the Congolese parties  concerned that it was asked to participate in implementation of  the agreement, inter alia by making magistrates available to the  Congo for the arbitration board. The board's careful and  independent work cannot be called into question and the European  Union would find it impossible to understand any contesting of  its decisions.    The European Union urges all Congolese political forces to  respect the provisions of the Libreville Agreement and seek a  political solution to the crisis through dialogue.</p>

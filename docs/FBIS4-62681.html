			<p>BFN     [Text] A joint Russian-Armenian commission set up to  coordinate works on bringing on line the Armenian nuclear power  station considered financing the project and the progress in the  station's state analysis in Moscow this week.    The Russian Atomic Energy Ministry told INTERFAX that the  date of the station's new launch was unclear as financing the  works remained unsettled.    However, Yerevan is to entirely finance all works on the  station carried out jointly with Russia in accordance with the  17 March treaty.    According to the treaty, Russia committed itself to take  part  in examining, reactivating and bringing on-line the station's  main installations as well as additional activities to ensure  its safety. Moscow also said it would supply the station with  nuclear fuel.    In late April, Armenian Vice Prime Minister Vigen Chitechyan  said his republic had completed preparatory works on the station  closed down in March 1989 under heavy public pressure which  followed the December 1988 earthquake. Yerevan plans to launch  the station by the end of this year. Taking into account  Armenia's highly unstable seismic conditions, the station must  withstand an earthquake of force nine on the Richter scale. To  reactivate the station, a minimum of $70 million is needed.    The republican government decided to bring the station  on-line again as it used to cover more than 40 percent of the  republic's energy consumption as far back as a year ago. At  present, power is mainly produced by hydroelectrical stations  which are capable of covering only 25-30 percent of the demand.</p>

			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH: DIGITAL TAPE COMPROMISE SEEN AS A SIGN OF CHANGING AUDIO TIMES  </P> <P> In 20 years, there will be no threat of digital audio tape (DAT) moving in on  the compact-disc business because there will be no digital audio tape and there  will be no compact discs.  </P> <P> That is the assessment of music retailers, audio engineers and others involved  in the recording industry upon hearing this week about a truce between record  companies and Japanese audio equipment manufacturers in the two-year-old war  over the future of DAT.  </P> <P> "The no-moving-part product will be the next major breakthrough," predicted Bob  Barrett, owner of the Compact Disc Center in Los Alamitos. "You'll just go out  and buy a chip, snap it in place and all the information will be downloaded  into your stereo system -- which will essentially be a computer system."  </P> <P> In the short run, however, Barrett sees no threat to his business. Compact  discs will be preferred over DAT or anything else, at least through the  mid-1990s, he believes.  </P> <P> Word leaked out earlier this week from Athens, Greece, that threatened to rein  in the burgeoning compact-disc business in the United States. At a summit  between U.S. record companies and Japanese audio-equipment manufacturers,  negotiators reportedly reached a compromise agreement over introduction of DAT  technology into the United States.  </P> <P> Officially, the announcement has been embargoed until today, but sources have  already revealed that the compromise calls for inclusion of a special audio  chip in all DAT machines imported from Japan. The audio chip would permit  compact disc owners to record their discs on the high-quality, state-of-the-art  digital audio tape, but would prevent DAT-to-DAT dubbing -- a possibility that  has driven fear into the hearts of major record-company executives who believe  that the fine reproduction quality of DAT could lead to widespread pirating and  erosion of record sales.  </P> <P> "But they have to know that it's the nature of technology to strive to improve  fidelity," said Don Palmquist, president of La Mirada-based Yamaha Electronics.  "It won't end with DAT.  </P> <P> "The next generation we'll probably see by the mid-1990s will be a recordable  compact disc," he continued. "The technology is still in its infancy in the lab  now, but by then we will see a disc you can erase and record again and it'll be  for both audio and video."  </P> <P> Since Japanese stereo manufacturers such as Casio, Marantz and Pioneer first  attempted to import DAT players in 1987, the Recording Industry Assn. of  America has attempted to block DAT marketing. The RIAA, which acts as the  federal lobbying arm of the six major U.S. record labels (Warners, Capitol,  MCA, RCA, CBS and Polygram), argued on Capitol Hill for a device that would  prevent DAT recorders from dubbing one cassette to another.  </P> <P> RIAA representatives claimed then, and now, that the sound-reproduction quality  with digital tape is so good that consumers who bought DAT recorders could  illegally reproduce recorded music, thereby cutting into the profits of  artists, distributors and manufacturers in the $5-billion-a-year recording  industry.  </P> <P> But the audio-equipment manufacturers' lobbying arm, the Electronic Industry  Assn., countered by forming the Home Recording Rights Coalition. The ad hoc  organization clashed with the RIAA before several congressional committees,  arguing that any device that prevented dubbing would infringe on consumers'  rights.  </P> <P> The resulting battle split the recording industry, with artists ranging from  Roberta Flack to Don Henley siding with the RIAA and the major labels it  represents, and Stevie Wonder and several of the smaller independent labels  siding with the EIA.  </P> <P> "What happened was this idea that Mr. and Mrs. America would say, 'Holy smoke!  I could do digital recording at home! I'm a recording engineer!,' " said  Barrett.  </P> <P> "That scared the music industry into pushing legislation. But what that  produced was that people got overexposed to DAT without having it readily  available to them and they got bored with the whole thing."  </P> <P> Consumers who grumble about the latest upgrade in audio software each time they  visit their local Wherehouse or Tower Records store will be grumbling into the  21st Century, according to Palmquist, Barrett and others. Five years ago,  prerecorded tape cassettes replaced the old vinyl LP albums as the top-selling  item in record stores. Today, many stores have stopped stocking LPs altogether  with the advent of compact discs, which are fast overtaking cassettes as the  top-seller in record retail chains.  </P> <P> "Four or five years from now, DAT players may replace cassette players the way  that compact discs are now replacing LPs, but the recording industry will have  to build up a library of pre-recorded tapes first," said Palmquist. "There's  also the question of pricing. DAT machines now cost $2,500 to $10,000. If  (Japanese manufacturers) go into quantity production, they could drop to the  $1,000-$1,500 price range in a year or two."  </P> <P> Still, it will be several years before DAT catches on to the same degree as  compact discs.  </P> <P> "Over the very long term, DAT will replace analog (conventional tape)  cassettes," said Barrett. "But it won't happen any time soon.  </P> <P> "The thing that we hear all the time is people saying they're not going to buy  a compact disc because DAT is coming out next year and the CD is a transitional  product. Well, what isn't a transitional product? There's always going to be  something in the works that will replace what you got. I mean, look at the  eight-track tape. It was here and gone in ten years. I'd guess the CD will last  another 20 years."  </P> <P> And after that?  </P> <P> "You'll be able to buy an album over the phone," said Barrett confidently.  "You'll use your (computer) modem to call Warner Bros. records and punch in  your credit-card code. They'll download the new Don Henley album into your  computer and either bill you on your phone bill or over the computer on a  monthly or quarterly basis."  </P></p>

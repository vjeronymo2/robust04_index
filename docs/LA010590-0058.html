			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AT THE GALLERIES / LEAH OLLMAN: IN THE ART WORLD, JANUARY BECOMES THE MIDDLE OF  THE YEAR  </P> <P> January may signal the beginning of a fresh, untried year -- and in the present  case, a new decade -- but in the art world, it is a month like any other. More  auspicious on the art world's calendar is September, when the new "season" of  shows begins and galleries settle down to business again after the summer lull.  Allegiance to an academic calendar that begins in the fall and ends with spring  is steadfast among New York galleries, whose clients retreat from the sweating  city during July and August.  </P> <P> The same pattern holds in San Diego, though the population here swells in the  summer. Galleries hang the traditional summer group shows, university and  college spaces shut down, and museums often schedule their most broadly  appealing shows.  </P> <P> However nondescript a month for those in the art biz, January is here, now, and  it has brought with it the rooted ritual of surveying the year ahead. The view,  of one exhibition season half-completed and the next barely planned, is  splintered, but telling.  </P> <P> San Diego galleries and museums have on their books for 1990 a globe-trotting  schedule that glimpses at the art of Indonesia, Poland, the Soviet Union,  Mexico and England. Good neighbors to our area artists, they also keep one foot  on local soil, anchoring the visionary with the responsible.  </P> <P> Several voids will begin to be filled in the coming year. Two shows featuring  contemporary African-American artists ought to restore at least a temporary  sense of egalitarianism to the local scene. One, focusing on printmakers  nationwide, opens Saturday at the Lyceum theatre, and was organized by the  embryonic African-American Museum of Fine Arts. The other, at Grossmont College  (Feb. 1-23), includes local and Los Angeles artists working in a variety of  media.  </P> <P> The void left by last year's closing of Installation, the downtown alternative  space, is also expected to be filled this year. The gallery's board of  directors is currently running the organization out of one board member's home,  but they have begun the search for a new director and anticipate getting back  on track by the year's end.  </P> <P> ARTWALK, the downtown art community's annual open house, coordinated by  Installation, will take place April 21-22. Other holes in the fabric of the  local art community may be left gaping this year. The large gallery space at  9th and G, recently vacated by Dietrich Jenny and, before him, Mark Quint,  awaits another brave soul willing to risk a fragile future as a contemporary  art dealer for the sake of helping to keep downtown's art scene alive.  </P> <P> New voids will also be created in 1990, as the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary  Art closes its downtown space (this weekend) and maybe part of its La Jolla  facility in the fall while it undergoes a major expansion. The museum is  scouting about town for a temporary exhibition space -- or several -- in which  to continue its programs until the expansion is completed in 1992.  </P> <P> What else to expect in 1990?  </P> <P> This year marks the 20th anniversary of the Centro Cultural de la Raza, which  will be publishing a book assessing its present and future endeavors. The  gallery also plans a rich schedule of shows, from the annual eye-opening  "Border Realities" installation by the Border Art Workshop, to a string of  one-person and group shows featuring Native American artists, Chicano artists  living in the Southwest and muralists from Baja California.  </P> <P> Ambitious global grazing on the part of local gallery directors will yield a  promising array of shows this year. Mark Quint Contemporary Art will feature  work by the Polish painter and photographer Mikolaj Smoczynski as well as the  wry assemblages of British sculptor Richard Wentworth.  </P> <P> Soviet artists return to the local limelight at the David Zapf Gallery, which  featured (along with the Mesa College Art Gallery) an engaging selection of  paintings by Leningrad artists during last year's festival. More paintings by  members of the Fellowship for Experimental Art will be seen at the gallery this  fall.  </P> <P> German sculptor Franz Erhard Walther will present his brand of Minimalism in a  series of abstract, dyed fabric works at the San Diego State University Art  Gallery beginning February 9. Sculptures, murals, drawings and exuberant  reliefs by the Basque artist Andres Nagel will be on view at the Tasende  Gallery the following month.  </P> <P> The Iturralde Gallery narrows its Latin American focus to concentrate on a  handful of Mexican artists this year, while the Mingei International Museum of  World Folk Art extends its gaze southward to present "Mayan Threads," a show of  textile treasures from Guatemala.  </P> <P> Local artists Manny Farber, Faiya Fredman, Graciela Ovejero, Reesey Shaw, David  Baze, Nancy Kittredge, Roy David Rogers and others will add solo shows to their  resumes this year, and ten as-yet-undisclosed locals will also be included in  "Satellite Intelligence: Boston/San Diego New Art Exchange," this summer at the  La Jolla Museum.  </P> <P> Double-takes and murmurs will, as always, greet Sushi's StreetSites projects  this year. In March, the performance and visual art gallery will plant three  temporary public art works downtown to engage the community in dialogue on such  issues as local growth and development, homelessness and censorship of the  arts.  </P> <P> Also bound to raise a few eyebrows is photographer Robert Mapplethorpe's "X"  portfolio, to be shown at PhotoWest Gallery this spring. Homoerotic and  sadomasochistic images from the series were at the heart of the recent  congressional debate over government funding of the arts.  </P> <P> Two dwellings will be temporarily constructed in town this year -- one a  shelter for the body, the other a refuge for the spirit. The San Diego Museum  of Art presents "In the Realm of Ideas" this summer, featuring the work of  architect Frank Lloyd Wright. As part of the exhibition, a full-scale "Usonian  Automatic House," Wright's proposed solution to the need for moderate,  custom-built housing, will be erected in the parking lot in front of the  museum.  </P> <P> On a more intimate scale, Los Angeles artist Mineko Grimmer will create a  site-specific installation for the Mesa College Art Gallery in May. Grimmer's  organic sculptures pay homage to the musical theories of John Cage as well as  to the Japanese reverence for the integrity, meditative potential and  metaphoric possibilities of stone. Perhaps the most subtle of the year's  offerings, Grimmer's work will seal the current season of shows and usher in  the calm interlude before the next begins.  </P></p>

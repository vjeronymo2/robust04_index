A recent  report from the Human Rights Watch and the American Civil  Liberties Union says the government fails to comply with  international human rights norms in important ways, ranging from  the way it treats Haitians to instances of interference with the  freedom of religion -- passing through racial and sexual  discrimination, police brutality, and other such things along  the way.    The two organizations carried out this study in the hopes of  breaking down the cynical official posture that international  law protects human rights only outside the borders of the United  States.    Other areas of concern are the systematic, deep-rooted  discrimination against women in matters of education,  employment, and salaries; overcrowded prisons; and abuse of the  death penalty.</p>

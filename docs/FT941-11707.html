			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Major pledges more cash for science Science enjoyed an unaccus-tomed day in the political limelight yesterday. Mr John Major made his first big speech on science as prime minister - promising to give research more money next year and a 'high priority' in future spending plans. Speaking to the parliamentary and scientific committee, Mr Major said that science and engineering had 'too often been undervalued' in Britain. 'In the past 18 months we've done more to redefine science policy than in the last 20 years,' he said. 'We have set a long-term course and now we must hold to it.' In a Commons debate on research, Mr William Waldegrave, minister responsible for science, announced that Pounds 15.4m would be allocated in 1994-95 to several initiatives, including a competitive scheme to encourage researchers to collaborate with industry. He said the government would know by the end of April which of its research establishments are suitable for privatisation. Mr Waldegrave said a specialist team had already begun a review and would be recommending candidates for privatisation. Where privatisation was not considered appropriate, the team would suggest more efficient working arrangements. 'It is essential that Britain does not waste resources on out-of-date structures,' he said. Mr Michael Meacher, Labour spokesman on science, warned that the 'uprooting of institutions' through privatisation and contracting out would undermine staff morale. The most innovative new scheme is for competitive research grants - called Rewarding Our Potential Awards after the title of last year's white paper on science.</p>

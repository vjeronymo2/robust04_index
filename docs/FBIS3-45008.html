In his speech, Liu Fangren pointed out that the general  demand for this year's work is: Guided by Deng Xiaoping's theoy  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the  party's basic line, we should further emancipate our minds, seek  truth from facts, deepen reform, widen the scope of opening up,  boost our morale, do our work in a down-to-earth manner, and  comprehensively promote the establishment of Gansu's socialist  market economic structure, its party building, its spiritual  civilization, and its democratic and legal systems.    Liu Fangren continued: The year 1994 is a crucial one for  reform and opening up in which it is necessary to seize the  opportunity, boost our morale, and move forward by overcoming  difficulties. There are thousands of jobs to fulfill in 1994 but  all jobs should focus on economic construction. [passage  omitted]    Liu Fangren said: The pace of reform will be very big this  year and we will see the most reform measures with the strongest  momentum for more than 10 years. [passage omitted]    In his speech, Liu Fangren stressed: The crux of speeding up  economic development, deepening structural reform, preserving  social stability, and doing a good job in all aspects of work  this year is to improve all party organizations in the province,  to strengthen the party's ideological style and organizational  build up, and to enhance the leadership level of party  organizations in all localities and their ability to control the  overall situation.

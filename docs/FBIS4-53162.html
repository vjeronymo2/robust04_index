			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Peter Gill] </F>   [Text] The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] group  should remain focused on economic issues and avoid the  "complications" associated with political issues, Taiwan's  Minister of State, Mr Vincent Siew, warned yesterday. And in an  interview with THE AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL REVIEW [AFR] Mr Siew  also cautioned against forcing the pace of any APEC move towards  an institutional framework.    Mr Siew, in Sydney last night to address the Asia Pacific  Insight Briefing, appeared to indicate that APEC should steer  clear of political disputes such as the U.S. pressure on China  over human rights. "I think it will be better for APEC to focus  on economic issues only, not to talk about any political issues.  (If) it gets involved in political issues, it will become very  complicated," Mr Siew told the AFR. While APEC had made "a lot  of progress" in the past five years, Mr Siew said he would like  to see the organization take on an "institutional framework".    But such a move should only occur when a consensus had  emerged among the APEC membership for such a "community".  Achieving such a community, however, required patience "because  the members of APEC come from different cultural, political, and  social backgrounds".    Mr Siew said APEC's goal should be "open regionalism instead  of the closed regionalism exercised by the Europeans and  others". A judgment on how consistent the North American Free  Trade Agreement and the ASEAN Free Trade Area [AFTA] were with  open regionalism could only be made in the future. "If they  follow the GATT rules, they will become open regionalism. If  they just emphasize their own interests then they will just veto  the GATT rules and the spirit (of the GATT)," he said.    Asked whether an Australian-New Zealand link with AFTA -- as  mooted by the prime minister, Mr Keating, last week -- could be  detrimental to the interests of APEC, Mr Siew said the AFTA and  NAFTA membership had given assurances that their regional  groupings "will not be against the general objectives of APEC".    "So we hope that kind of assurance can be honored," he said.</p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Letter: Carriers less restricted at US airports than at Heathrow Sir, Your article, 'After the US, the world' (September 17), discussing British Airways' global ambitions, presents a very misleading picture of BA's access to US airports. The impression given in the article is that US carriers dominate slot access at key US airports to the detriment of foreign competitors while enjoying unlimited slot access to Heathrow. Nothing could be further from the truth. What you have failed to advise your readers is that none of the US airports mentioned  - with the exception of Chicago  - is slot restricted at all. All carriers, including BA, enjoy as much international access to these airports as is justified by traffic demand. Chicago O'Hare is one of only two slot restricted international airports in the US. There, US carriers are forced by law to give up slots to enable their foreign competitors, including BA, to fly any services they wish. At Heathrow, by comparison, all carriers  - included United  - suffer from slot restrictions, and often can not fly the services permitted by international agreement. The BA-USAir transaction provides a unique opportunity for the US and UK governments to negotiate a liberalised agreement presenting real opportunities to carriers from both countries. It is important that the arguments on both sides are presented fairly, if the governments are to achieve their goal.

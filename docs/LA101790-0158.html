			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AUSSIE DRIVERS SAY 'G'BY, MATE,' TO GAS GUZZLERS AS PRICES SOAR  </P> <P> High fuel prices are driving Australians off the road.  </P> <P> The government reported today that September gasoline sales dropped 10%  compared to the same period in 1989.  </P> <P> Retail prices have jumped more than 30% since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug 2., to  $2.45 a gallon from $1.95.  </P> <P> Although Australia is largely self-sufficient in motor fuels, the government's  policy is that even locally produced petroleum should be sold at world prices.  This has led to widespread suspicions among Australian motorists that oil  companies and the government have been profiteering at their expense. Both deny  the allegations.  </P> <P> In fact, Resources Minister Alan Griffiths said, the government stands to lose  about $468 million a year from its budgeted gasoline excise revenue if the drop  in sales continues.  </P> <P> Even so, the sudden price rises have come as a shock for a country of 17  million where people have been driving 21 billion miles a year just commuting  to work.  </P> <P> Car dealers say people are starting to bring in their bigger gas guzzlers and  ask questions about the "economy" of smaller, more fuel-efficient models.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Australian branch of General Motors, Holdens, has put production  on hold for its V-8 models, which had been in demand until recently. Ford  Australia, which has the biggest Ford, the Fairlane, on its product list, also  is reviewing its production schedules.  </P></p>

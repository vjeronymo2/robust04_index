			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Improved controls boost Creighton's Creighton's Naturally, the USM-quoted maker of toiletries and beauty products, lifted pre-tax profit by 30 per cent in the year to March 31, although sales were lower. Mr Richard Collard, chairman, said improvements in production efficiency and operational cost control contributed greatly to the expanded profit. From sales down nearly Pounds 1m at Pounds 10.2m, profit worked through at Pounds 934,000 (Pounds 720,000). Earnings per share were 13.1p (10.4p) and the final dividend is 5p for a total of 7p (6.2p). Mr Collard said stocks were reduced by Pounds 500,000 and debtors by Pounds 600,000, allowing the company to benefit from cash surpluses and the elimination of a net interest charge.</p>

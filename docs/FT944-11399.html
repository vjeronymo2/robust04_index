			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Cautious Swiss think big when it comes to choice of gas guzzlers The Swiss love American cars. The Alps are crowded with Cadillacs, Cherokees, Mustangs and other strange beasts rarely seen in other European countries. In the first nine months of this year, Chrysler - the most successful of the big three US importers - sold 5,517 vehicles in Switzerland, claiming a 2.5 per cent share of the whole market. General Motors sold 1,774 US imports, and Ford 860. In each case, these results are vastly better than in other European countries. GM, for example, sells more US cars in tiny Switzerland than it does in Germany or France. The companies sell scarcely any US models in the UK because they do not make right hand drive models. It all seems at odds with the charming Swiss preference for things small. They like nothing better than to put the diminutive suffix 'li' on cherished things. A child's hand is a Handli; Liechtenstein is a 'Landli'. But a Chevroletli? Ask the Swiss or the car companies themselves the reasons for their quirky taste for American cars, and a variety of answers emerge. All agree that it is a long tradition, dating back to before the second world war. 'The Swiss have always liked the US as a country to visit,' offers Mr Roland Husser, sales manager of Chrysler-Jeep Import Switzerland. 'The ties between Switzerland and North America - both for families and for businesses - are much stronger than in other European countries,' claims a General Motors representative. There are also practical reasons. Switzerland is mountainous. Immediately after the war, under-powered Renaults, Fiats and Volkswagen 'beetles' had to struggle over the Alpine passes. Big Oldsmobiles and Buicks with six litre V8 engines cruised over. Moreover, petrol prices in Switzerland have always been relatively low, so the gas guzzling didn't matter. Perhaps most important, Switzerland has never had a car industry to protect, so import barriers against American cars are insignificant. Like many US buyers, the Swiss went off US cars in the 1980s as their quality standards sagged. Chrysler pulled out of the Swiss market completely, returning only in 1988. Today, even though American cars have become much smaller and more difficult to distinguish from European models, the Swiss have come back to them. Ironically, this is in part because of the good value they offer, thanks to the rise in the Swiss franc against the dollar in the past two years. Also, the US companies had a lead in a couple of the most trendy vehicle types, such as jeeps and the so-called multi-purpose vehicles (MPV). Chrysler's Voyager, GM's Pontiac TranSport and Ford's Explorer all do well among fashion conscious Swiss. Mr Husser says businessmen and men with large families buy the MPVs, and they like them loaded with options. Cherokee Jeeps are preferred by 'well educated males between 40 and 50'. Like nearly everything in Switzerland, US-made vehicles are more expensive than at home, usually by about 10 to 15 per cent, according to Mr Husser. The differential is rather higher these days because of the weakness of the dollar against the Swiss franc. As a rule, the companies set prices on the basis of market considerations and do not adjust frequently for exchange rate changes. There are good reasons for some price differential - mainly having to do with transport costs and maintaining a dealer network for a relatively small market. But it is a fair bet that the companies do very well on their Swiss business.</p>

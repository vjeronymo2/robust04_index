			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (1): Behind the masks of Murdoch - Raymond Snoddy welcomes a balanced biography of the driven media mogul RUPERT MURDOCH: RINGMASTER OF THE INFORMATION CIRCUS by William ShawcrossChatto &amp; Windus Pounds 18.99, 616 pages TREACHEROUS ESTATE: THE PRESS AFTER FLEET STREET by Michael Leapman Hodder &amp; Stoughton, Pounds 18.99, 304 pages THERE ARE many Rupert Murdochs, some real, some mythical. There is Murdoch the dark soul behind an Evil Empire, Murdoch the inspired businessman whose destiny it is to be one of the most important princes in the global village, and Murdoch the gambler who almost forfeited his empire through high-priced acquisitions. Then there is the Murdoch who can charm the birds out of the trees (before trapping them), not to mention the man who can be both generous and mean, who can show great loyalty and yet who dumped many of those who helped him. A man with a romantic side but with little imagination and, for good measure, a complex mixture of modesty, shyness and enormous ego. There are already a number of books about this complex and driven character. Some condemn him, some predict his imminent demise, some are simply cuttings jobs. With Rupert Murdoch: Ringmaster of the Information Circus, William Shawcross has written the best, fairest and most comprehensive account which comes to terms, as far as anyone can, with the perennial question: What Makes Rupert Run? It will not please those who have come to throw stones. Shawcross does not judge, although he provides ample evidence on which judgment can be made. Murdoch may be 'an entrepreneur of genius' but broken promises, plunges down market and cruel personal decisions have been carefully catalogued. It can also only be described as the best Murdoch book so far. At 61, 'the Dirty Digger' is only getting into his stride. After mastering newspapers and television stations, Murdoch, controller of one of the world's largest media empires, is now learning the nuts and bolts of running Twentieth Century Fox film studios. He is also looking forward to the day - perhaps 20 years off - when every home has a single integrated box giving access to an entire world of pictures and information. Murdoch wants to be part of that process, even if it is as an 80-year-old non-executive chairman of The News Corporation. But as Shawcross graphically tells, Murdoch scarcely made it beyond December 6 1990, when News Corp's Dollars 7.6bn (Pounds 4.3bn) debt crisis came to a head through a small loan owed to a small bank in Pittsburgh, US. Murdoch owed money to 146 banks and all had to be kept in the refinancing or the package would fall apart. The Pittsburgh loan officer was not prepared to roll over the loan, even if it meant the liquidation of News Corp. After failing to get the bank's president even to accept his call, Rupert Murdoch made the most important 'phone call of his life ('I had to beg', he said). The bank official agreed to roll over the loan and Murdoch had survived. As always, he was prepared to do what it took to do that. Apart from being balanced and comprehensive, two things stand out about the Shawcross book. One is the way he has firmly tied Murdoch the man to his origins and family history. The other is the way in which Murdoch the businessman is placed firmly in the context of the information revolution - even if sometimes this degenerates into a list of inventions. Murdoch knew how to exploit lax tax and offshore rules in Australia, and could often find his way around media regulations. But he also knew what computers and communications could make possible at Wapping and Sky, and he was bold enough to carry it out. Shawcross describes the two quite different grandfathers: Patrick Murdoch, a stern piller of the Free Church of Scotland, and Rupert Greene, a 'roistering, charming, half-Irish gambler.' You do not have to be too fanciful an amateur psychologist to see the influences. 'He is a complicated, often ruthless, often charming, usually effective but sometimes uncomfortable mix of Patrick Murdoch and Rupert Greene. He has more than one personality. He can be prim and yet he is 'larriken', an Australian troublemaker. He sees himself as a radical, he likes to provoke. But he has not always been careful of the consequences,' argues Shawcross. Throughout the book there is the leitmotif of pain suffered by people sacked or discarded. People such as John D'Arcy, managing director of the Melbourne Herald, summoned to London - he thought to be promoted - and then sacked in 20 minutes over a glass of whisky. Or, after 50 years of friendship, the curt note to News Corp. chairman Richard Searby, asking him to resign. How should the achievement of Rupert Murdoch be judged? Shawcross offers a pertinent question, and an appeal, rather than a condemnation. Why should US culture be imposed on the older cultures of Asia, the Middle East and elsewhere in an era when a handful of people can touch the lives of billions? Not only is this power awesome, the responsibility also is immense. 'It is,' says Shawcross 'a responsibility which Rupert Murdoch, grandson of the Reverend Patrick, great-grandson of the Reverend James, scion of the men and women from the dour beaches and strict kirks of Aberdeenshire, can understand. He only has to grasp it.' Michael Leapman, an earlier biographer (Rupert Murdoch - Barefaced Cheek) has just published a more general book on the transformation of the British press since its exodus from the boozy camaraderie of Fleet Street to more sober high-technology premises. Murdoch of course makes many guest appearances throughout, not just in the context of Wapping but also in chapters entitled 'Hounding The Royals'? and 'Shame and Scandal'. Leapman conveys well the changing feel of newspapers in the years since the publication in 1957 of Dangerous Estate by Francis Williams. And in spite of the ever-present controversies over invasion of privacy and reporting of sexual scandals he is surely right to take an optimistic view of the changes since the 1960s for both readers and journalists. 'We have more and better writers producing more and better newspapers - and doing their livers a favour into the bargain,' he says.</p>

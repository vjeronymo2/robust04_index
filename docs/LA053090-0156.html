BRIEFING;  </P> <P> NEW HOME SALES CONTINUE FALL  </P> <P> Sales of new single-family homes dropped 1.6% in April for the fifth straight  monthly decline while prices shattered all previous records, a government  report said today.  </P> <P> Private economists had expected a somewhat better sales showing.  </P> <P> But in the hard-hit Northeast, sales jumped by 18% in April, while dropping by  2.1% in the Midwest, 6% in the South and 6.4% in the West, the Commerce  Department report said.  </P> <P> The median price for a new home rocketed to $135,900 in April, after dipping to  $119,400 in March, and April's average price rose to $160,200, after falling to  $144,100 in March, the report said.  </P> <P> A Commerce Department spokesman said the April prices were the highest on  record, but the report did not indicate why there was such a huge increase in  new home costs during the month.  </P> <P> But the level of new home sales -- 546,000 at an annual rate -- was the lowest  since 521,000 in December, 1982, the spokesman said.  </P></p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Executive pay It seems an accepted fact of life these days that top managers need more special incentives to perform than lesser mortals among a workforce. That being so, shareholders have an interest in the incentives really being a reward for added value. Reuters' new executive remuneration scheme, which uses as a criterion the relative performance of its shares over a protracted period of time, is a welcome contribution to the debate. It avoids the pitfall of option schemes, which, as M&amp;G has embarrassingly discovered, are now a trap for the unwary. Such schemes may reward managers on the general strength of the market rather than individual company performance. Equally Reuters eschews such accounting yardsticks as stated earnings per share or return on assets, which might be open to manipulation. Yet relative share price performance is also a natural indicator for a company with a habitual tendency to beat the index. Reuters has out-performed the FT-SE 100 by nearly 300 per cent since its flotation in 1984. Indeed the scheme would have paid out maximum bonuses in five of the last six years. There may be no harm in that, since few investors will quibble with Reuters' impressive profit growth over that period. Less clear is whether its executives will be quite so happy when the company eventually stops growing, as it surely must. Its share price will hardly out-perform then and the bonuses will diminish. But, as the supermarkets are now finding, that is also a time when management is really required to perform.</p>

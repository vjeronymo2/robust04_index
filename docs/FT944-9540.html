			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Schering chief forecasts annual profits ahead 10% at DM310m Profits at Schering, the German pharmaceuticals group, will rise this year by 10 per cent to DM310m (Dollars 202m) and turnover by between 12 per cent and 14 per cent, Mr Giuseppe Vita, board chairman, said yesterday. He said the dividend would 'at least' match last year's DM14.22. Mr Klaus Pohle, chief financial officer, said he expected group sales to increase by about 8 per cent a year until the end of the century, more than 4 percentage points higher than the industry's expected average growth. This would boost Schering's turnover to DM7bn-DM8bn. Growth is attributed to the wider marketing of the Betaseron drug, a treatment for multiple sclerosis; the introduction of Levovist, an ultrasound drug; and the recent decision to refocus on pharmaceuticals. In the first nine months of this year, net profits rose 8 per cent to DM210m, compared with the same period in 1993, while turnover increased by 14 per cent to DM3.52bn. Net profits for the whole of 1993 totalled DM254m, with turnover at DM5.3bn. The optimistic forecasts for the next five years stem from Schering's decision two years ago to divest its industrial chemicals and natural substances divisions, and hive off its agro-chemical divisions into a joint venture with Hoechst, which took effect last January. Mr Vita said he expected the Betaseron drug, currently only on sale in the US, to obtain approval for distribution in Canada in the middle of next year, as well as in some European countries. 'We expect turnover of Betaseron to increase to DM350m by the end of this year,' he said. Turnover for the first nine months totalled DM230m. The Levovist drug would boost sales by between DM300m and DM500m. Turnover for Cyproteronacetat, or CPA, a drug containing hormonal treatments and which is used for contraceptives, fell 3 per cent between September and October following unconfirmed reports that the drug contained a carcinogen, a substance that encourages the growth of cancer.</p>

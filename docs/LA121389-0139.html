			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COLD PROMPTS OPENING OF SYLMAR SHELTER  </P> <P> Temperatures that dipped near freezing this week prompted the opening of the  San Fernando Valley's first city-operated temporary shelter for homeless  families with children, but few families have used it so far, shelter  organizers said.  </P> <P> The shelter, set up Sunday night at the Army National Guard Armory in Sylmar,  is able to house 100 people.  </P> <P> But none showed up Sunday, and only two spent Monday night there, said Nancy  Bianconi, director of housing operations for L.A. Family Housing, which is  under contract with the city to run the shelter and other homeless facilities  during the winter.  </P> <P> Shelter operators said that as of 8 p.m. Tuesday, three families had decided to  spend the night in the armory.  </P> <P> Temperatures in the Valley were expected to dip to the 30s and low 40s Tuesday  night and tonight, the National Weather Service reported.  </P> <P> The shelter was opened to comply with a new city policy under which most  homeless families in the Valley and Westside are accommodated in shelters on  cold nights instead of receiving vouchers to stay in motels.  </P> <P> The voucher system was too costly and denied homeless families many of the free  services that are available in shelters, Bianconi said. Homeless single adults  and couples are not affected by the new policy and may continue to seek shelter  in armories and other facilities as they have in the past, officials said.  </P> <P> At a Van Nuys armory that accommodated an average of 115 homeless single adults  and couples on cold nights last winter, only 10 people showed up Sunday night  and there were about 25 boarders Tuesday night, Bianconi said.  </P> <P> An organizer at the Van Nuys armory said word that the shelter was open  appeared to be spreading, as more than 40 people showed up by about 7:30 p.m.  Tuesday. They were sleeping on cots in the gymnasium and would receive a hot  dinner and breakfast, he said.  </P> <P> Bianconi said one reason for the lower numbers was the National Guard's policy  of requiring advance approval for television news to visit the shelters. The  policy, which she said was enacted this year, has stifled media coverage of the  shelter program and resulted in reduced awareness of the shelters among  homeless, she said.  </P> <P> Spokesmen for the National Guard could not be reached for comment Tuesday  evening.  </P></p>

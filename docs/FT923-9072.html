			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Blacks Leisure acts to reassure investors The directors of Blacks Leisure acted yesterday to reassure investors following the substantial fall in its share price earlier this week. The shares have slid slowly from a peak of 130p last November. On Wednesday they lost 12p to close at 41p. Yesterday, however, they recovered by 2p to 43p. The directors said they believed Wednesday's decline had been caused by a sale of 100,000 shares at a price substantially below the market rate. They added that although trading remained difficult, as indicated in the chairman's statement in May, strong core businesses, together with a strong balance sheet, positioned the company to take advantage of an eventual upturn. It was too early to make a dividend forecast, but the directors were mindful of shareholders' income requirements.</p>

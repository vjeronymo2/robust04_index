			<p>BFN     [Text] Jerusalem, May 17 (XINHUA) -- [Israeli] Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres said today that Israel will do utmost to  push forward the talks with Syria even though there was still no  sense to have areas of an Israeli-Syrian common announcement on  the Golan Heights [as received].    Peres was speaking to reporters this afternoon jointly with  visiting U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher at the  Foreign Ministry after their half-an-hour talk.    "We never denied the difficulties, but on the other side  there are still hopes of opportunities," Peres said.    He thanked Christopher for his continuous effort for peace  in  the region.    He said Christopher's visits had brought new promises from  both sides for the negotiations.    Christopher, who arrived in Israel Monday [16 May] from  Damascus, said that "we certainly are making some progress" on  bringing the Israeli-Syrian negotiations back on track.    "But it's a very long road, and we are at the beginning of  the long road," he said. He did not specify on the progress.    "There are detailed discussions on both sides on each of the  consistent points," he said. "Every meeting I have with them is  certainly a progress that makes a sense."    This morning, Christopher toured the new Palestinian  autonomous region of Jericho to get first-hand information of  the developments there.    "It is really a thrilling event to see the translation of  realities on the ground and to see the Palestinians taking  control of the civil administration," said the U.S. secretary.    Christopher is scheduled to hold talks with Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin later today.    It is still not clear whether he will return to Damascus or  just return home Wednesday.</p>

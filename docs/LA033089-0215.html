			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> EX-REP. CHAPPELL DIES AT 67  </P> <P> Former Rep. Bill Chappell (D-Fla.), who served in Congress for 20 years before  he lost a reelection bid in the wake of allegations involving the Pentagon  procurement scandal, died today in a Bethesda clinic where he had been  undergoing treatment for bone cancer. He was 67.  </P> <P> Chappell was defeated last November by political novice Craig James. Chappell  lost by 732 votes but did not concede defeat for more than five weeks.  </P> <P> A 20-year member of the House, Chappell was named in several documents related  to the Pentagon kickback and bribery scandal but was not charged with any  crime. He was criticized for allowing several major defense contractors to help  him out of financial difficulties when they purchased or arranged for the sale  of several failing business interests during the last five years.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By David Mason, PA News] </F>   [Text] A British armoured column was held up at a Serb  checkpoint near Gorazde today as the United Nations reported  rising tension in the Muslim enclave. The 168-strong British  force, including 32 Saxon armoured vehicles, was due to  reinforce about 500 UN peacekeepers patrolling an increasingly  unstable ceasefire around the town. But a spokesman at UN HQ in  Sarajevo said it had been held up since the early hours at a  Serb checkpoint at Rogatica, just north of the town. The  contingent is mainly drawn from the Duke of Wellington's  regiment, and its commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel David  Santa-Olalla will take command of UN forces in the enclave when  it arrives.    UN Protection Force spokesman Eric Chaperon said the  situation in Gorazde was worsening and Muslim forces on Saturday  fired two mortar rounds at the Bosnian Serbs. "The situation in  Gorazde is getting unstable due to the increasing tension around  the water plant, along the confrontation line north west of the  town," he said. "Several small arms exchanges were reported in  the area."    Both sides agreed a ceasefire after the Serbs lifted a  month-long siege of the town in compliance with a Nato ultimatum  to pull back. But UN officials said the Serbs had failed to  withdraw all their infantry from a two-mile exclusion zone and  Muslim-led forces were ignoring requests from peacekeeping  troops in the area.</p>

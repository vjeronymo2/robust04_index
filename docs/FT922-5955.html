			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Government warned on outlook for employment ECONOMIC growth in Britain is expected to fall short of government expectations in the medium term, making a significant fall in unemployment from the current 2.7m unlikely during this decade, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research warned yesterday. The independent economic research body said in its quarterly report on the economy that it believes economic growth is getting under way and will gather pace in the second half of this year. The speed of recovery will, however, be 'barely sufficient' to stop unemployment from rising. The institute sees unemployment rising to 3m in 1993 and 1994 before a slow decline sets in. The institute expects the jobless total in the UK to average 2.7m between 1996 and 1999. The institute's latest short-term forecast of 1 per cent growth this year and 2.7 per cent next year differs little from the Treasury's forecast in the Budget in March, and is only slightly more pessimistic about growth, employment and inflation prospects for this year than in its previous forecast in February. However, the institute takes issue with the Treasury's belief that gross domestic product will grow by 3.5 per cent a year over the fiscal years 1994-95 to 1996-97, with inflation subsiding to 2 per cent. It says the scope for fiscal and monetary stimulus will be limited by the state of the UK's public finances and constraints imposed by the European exchange rate mechanism. The UK will not be able, for example, to benefit from exchange rate depreciation as in earlier economic cycles. Its projections show the economy growing at about 2.5 per cent, or close to its long-term trend over the past 40 years, with inflation ranging between 3 per cent and 3.5 per cent a year. The institute expects Britain to have a current-account deficit of about Pounds 10bn, or close to 1.5 per cent of GDP, over the medium term. While that should be easily financed, it implies gradual depletion of Britain's strong net asset position abroad. The institute argues that real short-term interest rates of about 6 per cent are excessive for the UK and other EC member states such as France. The best solution would be a substantial tightening of German fiscal policy - which is outside the UK government's control. National Institute Economic Review, Number 140, May 1992.

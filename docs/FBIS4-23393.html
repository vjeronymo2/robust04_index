			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, June 5 (AFP) -- Some members of the dissolved  National Assembly pledged here Sunday [5 June] to give  "solidarity support" to detained former senate leader Ameh Ebute  whenever he is brought to court for trial.    "He is our leader and he deserves our moral support in his  moment of travail," four of the ex-legislators told AFP in a  telephone interview. They did not disclose what form the  support would take but said it would be demonstrated around the  court premises.    At least three senators, including Ebute, who attended a  meeting last Wednesday and issued a communique in which they  declared "illegal" the government of General Sani Abacha, have  been arrested.    Ex-senators Polycarp Nwite and Okoroafor were arrested and  detained Saturday, respectively in Lagos and Abeokuta.    Nwite, who spoke to AFP Sunday from his detention room on  his  cellular phone, alleged that the conditions under which he was  being held were harsh. He complained of non-provision of food,  water and a bed to sleep on.    His colleagues in the dissolved senate, Bola Tinubu and O.J.  Adewunmi, told AFP Sunday that they were also being sought by  security agents who had paid several fruitless visits to their  Lagos residences in the past 24 hours.    The arrest of the former legislators marked the beginning of  a government clampdown on the opposition, including members of  the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), a recently-formed  pro- democracy group, made up of prominent politicians,  ex-ministers and state governors and retired military officers.    Like the legislators, the NADECO has called on General  Abacha  to quit office to pave the way for the installation of Moshood  Abiola, the self-proclaimed winner of last June's annulled  presidential election.    Members of the House of Representatives who met last Friday  asked General Abacha to quit "not later than" June 11, the eve  of the first anniversary of the presidential election.    The government has described their action as "illegal,  criminal and very dangerous."    The National Assembly, made up of the senate and the house  of  representatives, was dissolved last November, along with other  democratic institutions, when General Abacha came to power.</p>

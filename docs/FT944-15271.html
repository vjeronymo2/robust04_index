			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Blair tackles Tories over split on Europe Mr Tony Blair used his first Commons appearance as Labour leader yesterday to resurrect the option of a referendum on the next stage of EU integration. Mr Blair, launching a fresh assault on Conservative divisions on Europe, sought to extract some of the traditional heat from question time by offering an unqualified endorsement of Mr John Major's Ulster policy. In what aides described as a deliberate attempt to raise the tone of the twice-weekly question time confrontation, he addressed the prime minister in cautiously modulated tones, and restricted himself to two questions rather than three. Mr Major, who also dislikes the gladiatorial aspects of question time, congratulated Mr Blair on his new job, prompting most observers to score the first confrontation between the two leaders as a draw. Mr Blair appeared to surprise Mr Major by challenging him to disown comments by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, ruling out a referendum on monetary integration as 'a very strange way to run a modern industrial state'. Mr Major said that the issue of a referendum 'does not arise and very probably will not arise' because the agenda for the 1996 intergovernmental conference of EU states had not been set. Ridiculing Labour's pro-EU approach, he accused Mr Blair of seeking to form a 'weak' government that would 'slavishly follow whatever Europe says'. But Mr Blair told him: 'The chancellor takes one view on Europe, the employment secretary (Mr Michael Portillo) takes another view, and you hover between the two. A divided government is a weak government.' Mr Blair gave no hint of a change in Labour policy on a referendum, which mirrors the government's official view that no decision is necessary until firm decisions have been made on whether to join a single European currency. However, friends said he was considering promising a referendum in an attempt to force Mr Major to endorse or reject demands for a vote by the Tories' powerful Euro-sceptic wing. Labour leaders are keenly aware that demands for a referendum caused Mr Major anxiety when they were pressed by Conservative Euro-sceptics before the European elections in May. A referendum is strongly opposed by Tory pro-Europeans, who believe it would exacerbate party splits and lead to a divisive campaign that could bring down the government. Tory strategists believe a referendum is equally dangerous for Labour because it could inflame the party's own Euro-sceptics.</p>

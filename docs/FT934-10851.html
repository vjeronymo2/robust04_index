			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: Sultan adds New York hotel to his collection SULTAN Hassanal Bolkiah of Brunei collects luxury hotels like the rest of us collect postage stamps. But when you have a personal fortune of Dollars 37bn you can afford to be a bit choosy about where you put your head down for the night. The Sultan of Brunei (left) this week agreed to pay Dollars 202m for the luxurious New York Palace Hotel on Madison Avenue. The Sultan and his family also own the top of the range Beverly Hills Hotel in California and the Dorchester in London. Closer to home, the Sultan controls two Hyatt hotels in Singapore. When the Sultan held a sit-down dinner party last year at his palace in Brunei for nearly 6,000 people as part of celebrations of his 25 years on the throne, Hyatt chefs and waiters were flown in from Sydney and Tokyo. If the Sultan tires of hotel living on his frequent trips abroad there are alternatives available. The Sultan's family are believed to have at least two houses in Beverly Hills. There are various houses and flats dotted round London. Then there is the main British residence - a country house conveniently situated close to Heathrow airport. The Sultan also has a mansion in central Kuala Lumpur. The Sultan's latest acquisition has an interesting history. The New York Palace Hotel was once called the Helmsley Palace, after Mrs Leona Helmsley, once the most famous hotelier in the US and a leading New York socialite. But the Helmsley hotel empire came crashing down in 1989 when Mrs Helmsley, known as the 'Queen of Mean' for her treatment of hotel employees, was sentenced to imprisonment for tax evasion and mail fraud. As the Sultan of Brunei's investment advisers were putting the final touches to documents buying the old Helmsley Palace, Mrs Helmsley herself was moving into less salubrious hotel accommodation - a halfway-house low-cost hotel just down the road from her old stamping ground.</p>

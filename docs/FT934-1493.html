			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Exceptional leaves Compco in red Difficulties at one of its joint venture properties, resulting in an exceptional debit of Pounds 550,003, left Compco Holdings, the property investment and development concern, with pre-tax losses of Pounds 198,149 for the six months to September 25, against Pounds 318,860 profits. Mr David Pickford, chairman, said that as a result of the difficulties, the value of the group's interest in the joint venture was uncertain and therefore full provision was made. He added that in the past three months there had been a noticeable increase in activity in the property sector and this improvement in market conditions had been reflected in the recent letting of the majority of vacancies in the group's properties. Losses were struck after interest payable of Pounds 283,756 (Pounds 372,364). Per share the deficit was 9.58p, compared with 8.21p earnings.</p>

			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Survey of Latin American Finance and Investment (5): Big rise in turnover - Debt / Secondary Markets THE secondary market in Latin American debt is less that 10 years old, having arisen from the ashes of the debt crisis of the early 1980s. Its origins as a makeshift market in illiquid debt developed by creditor banks have been left some way behind. Structural, economic and political changes in recent years have boosted interest in the market. Dealers estimate that turnover in LDC (less developed country) debt has grown from around Dollars 10bn a year in the mid-1980s to Dollars 200bn last year. The most actively traded LDC debt instruments, Mexico's and Venezuela's 'Brady bonds' - debt repackaged as bonds and backed by zero-coupon US Treasury bonds - are as liquid as some European government bond markets. The market has offered opportunities for high returns in recent years. In particular, traders who have timed their positioning successfully have drawn substantial benefits from the repackaging of old debt under the Brady plan. The old debt 'provides cheap admission to Brady bonds', explained Mr Victor Segal, international director of Singer &amp; Friedlander. However, interest among institutional investors has been directed mainly towards equity and bond offerings. The secondary debt market remains largely the domain of banks and speculative traders. Although the market has now recovered the ground it lost in a sharp sell-off last October, institutional investors were scared off by that experience. The collapse of the market last autumn halved the value of Brazil's external debt from 40 cents at its peak to around 20 cents on the dollar, and other Latin American debt prices also fell sharply. Brazilian debt had been rallying on expectations that an agreement with creditors on a debt rescheduling, under the Brady plan, was about to be reached. The price peaked at the end of August, when Brazil put forward proposals to its foreign bank creditors. Most traders were holding long positions, expecting the market to climb further when agreement was reached, a strategy which had been spectacularly successful in the case of Mexico. When it emerged that an agreement on Brazil's rescheduling was not imminent, the result was concerted selling by traders to reduce their long positions. Other LDC debt was also hit, with only Mexico and Venezuela which had already signed Brady-style agreements exempt from the fall. Venezuelan debt was hit in February, when news of an attempted military coup prompted a sharp sell-off, and further undermined institutional investors' confidence in the market. Even though the coup attempt failed, concern about political instability in the region was re-awakened. Venezuela par bonds, which were trading at about 66 cents on the dollar before the coup in February, are now quoted at around 59 cents. A sizeable portion of Venezuela par bonds had been sold to institutional investors, mainly in the US, who had been inspired by the performance of the Mexico par bonds. 'As time has worn on, it has become clear that there is a political crisis (in Venezuela),' said Mr Paul Luke, chief economist at Chartered WestLB. 'The honeymoon period for Brady bonds has come to an end.' Nevertheless, the anticipation of debt rescheduling agreements continues to provide impetus to trading in Latin American debt. Traders now expect that agreements on the rescheduling of Brazil's and Argentina's debt will be completed soon. 'Investors as well as traders have been actively buying' Brazilian and Argentinian debt, according to Mr Willem Naves, head of emerging markets at NMB. Brazilian debt had rallied from 33 cents on the dollar at the beginning of March to 38 cents, before easing a little to end the month at around 36 1/2 cents. Optimism over an Argentinian debt agreement boosted the price from 38 1/4 cents at the beginning of March to 41 1/2 cents at the end of the month. 'People started to rebuild their inventory in Argentina and Brazil debt at the end of last year,' according to Mr Luke of Chartered WestLB. 'It is clear that, whatever setbacks there have been, they are edging towards a Brady plan agreement.' Once Brazil and Argentina are out of the way, smaller reschedulings are on the cards: Peru, Panama and Ecuador are further down the line. The Latin American debt market continues to offer a rollercoaster ride. Dealers say that the market has become both more volatile and less liquid in the last six months. Some firms which entered the market, or expanded their presence, last year have pulled back a little. In the run-up to October's collapse, many market participants had taken on very large positions, and, in the wake of the losses they incurred, have become less willing to commit capital. 'The market is maturing, but it takes at least one step backwards for every step forward,' according to one trader. OM, the Swedish options exchange, plans to introduce options on an LDC debt index developed by FP Consult, a Paris-based consultancy, in a couple of months. The LDCx index was launched last August, and the options were originally scheduled for launch last Autumn. Although the options may prove useful for dealers or investors wishing to take a view on the broad market, its use as a hedging instrument will be rather limited according to traders. 'If you look at the last few months, Venezuela has been falling while Brazil has been rising,' one trader said. In general, the market still demands the skills of a stock-picker rather than an index-beater. Some banks already trade options on liquid Latin American debt issues, on an over-the-counter basis.</p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Leading Article: The choices for Germany The outcome of Sunday's German general election will have an impact well beyond Germany's borders. Europe's pivotal nation has the chance of using the next four years both to put its economic house in order and to prepare the European Union for a decisive phase of enlargement at the beginning of the next century. The next German government should set itself three prime objectives: to improve the country's economic structure; to narrow the gap between east and west Germans; and to make Germany a more effective proponent of European integration. Pressing attention needs to be given to public finances. In spite of this year's faster than expected recovery, public spending and revenue as a proportion of gross domestic product will be 5 per cent higher next year than before unification. By the end of this year public debt will have doubled since 1990. The next government will have to make further cuts in spending, including on welfare benefits. It will also have to maintain efforts to encourage labour flexibility and to reduce state interference in the economy. Net public sector transfers to east Germany should fall gradually from now on. But east Germany will hardly come close to matching overall economic performance in the west for another 15 years. The next government needs somehow to infuse east and west Germans with a sense of their joint responsibility in over-coming the legacy of 40 years' division. Kohl's belief Though often vague and indecisive about details, the incumbent chancellor, Helmut Kohl, deserves credit for sticking to one fundamental belief: that the unification of Germany must be carried out within the wider context of Europe. The difficulties involved in the process have caused some ebbing of German support for his vision, but Mr Kohl himself is unlikely to abandon it. If still in power after October 16 he may have to be more cautious about urging an extension of supranational European decision-making, in deference both to German public opinion and to his European partners. But neither he nor any successor is likely to abandon the priority of opening the Union to central and eastern Europe, so that the inevitable expansion of German influence there can occur as part of a wider integration process. So Germany will have to be more strenuous than ever in advocating reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, the structural funds, and the Union's decision-making machinery. It will also have to be prepared to play a full part in common European defence arrangements, which means overcoming the remaining inhibitions about deploying German soldiers as part of multinational forces outside the Nato area. Gargantuan tasks All these policies are likely to be espoused most readily if Mr Kohl remains in power, and continues his alliance with the liberal Free Democrats. That is the outcome which most of Germany's foreign partners will be hoping for. The only doubt is whether Mr Kohl and his colleagues, after so many years in office, still have the stamina required for such gargantuan tasks. A coalition of Social Democrats and Greens is less likely - and would be less well-equipped to tackle Germany's pressing economic problems. A more likely outcome is that the FDP will fall short of the 5 per cent threshold required for representation in the Bundestag, with the result that Mr Kohl has to form a 'grand coalition' with the SPD. Such a coalition might have greater difficulty in agreeing on policies than the present one, but it could be better placed to implement them once it had done so, especially as it would not have to fear a veto on its tax legislation from the SPD majority in the Bundesrat (federal council). It would also have great pedagogic value for the SPD, which, like other social democratic parties, finds it easier to adjust to unwelcome realities in office than in opposition. In the 1960s such a grand coalition provided a three-year transitional phase before the SPD took over the leadership of the country in 1969. The return of the present coalition led by a re-energised Mr Kohl would be the best outcome: but a grand coalition would not signal a fundamental change of course.</p>

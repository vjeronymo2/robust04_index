			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Kuchina] </F>   [Text] Riga April 7 TASS -- "There was a misunderstanding  due to a technical error" and "this instruction has nothing to  do with Latvia," said Russian Ambassador in Riga Aleksandr  Rannikh, bringing his apologies to the Latvian side for  technical errors, as a result of which wrong interpretation was  made of the Russian president's instruction.    The ambassador stressed that "Moscow is guided by the fact  that all issues connected with the withdrawal of troops from  Latvia and with conditions of temporary operation and the status  of the radar station in Skrunde, were settled in the documents  initialled by the two countries' delegations on March 15".    The documents lay down that the radar station is a Russian  military establishment, under civil control, and cannot be  regarded as a military base.    At the same time, the ambassador expressed surprise that a  xerox copy of the instruction saying about an alleged  establishment of Russian military bases in Latvia, reached the  Latvian Foreign Office quicker that the Russian Foreign Ministry.    "Such efficiency prompts some considerations," Rannikh said.  Moscow will examine the incident, since it "is detrimental to  our relations, which we regret," the ambassador stressed.    According to Rannikh, the incident which provoked a sharp  reaction in Latvia, prompts a conclusion on the need for the  earliest signing of the documents agreed in mid-March.    The Russian president's press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov  also made explanations at a news conference on Thursday.  According to the press secretary, "the Russian side does not  raise the question of deploying any bases in Latvia. The radar  station in Skrunde cannot be regarded as a base.    "All issues connected with the withdrawal of Russian troops  from Latvia were already settled in the Russian-Latvian  agreement which was recently initialled."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] An IMF mission has arrived in Minsk to continue  talks with the government on granting the second part of a  credit to Belarus in the amount of $98 million. As is known,  the first credit in the same amount was allotted by the IMF last  summer due to the government's simultaneous signing of a  memorandum on economic policy. The fulfillment of the  memorandum's conditions by the government, which provide for  radical market transformations with concrete terms of their  implementation, is being taken by the IMF as a basis during  talks on granting the second credit.    According to experts, the main difficulty in the talks will  be an uncertain fate facing further Belarusian monetary and  credit policies in connection with the declared monetary merger  with the Russian Federation. IMF credits are intended to  equalize the balance of payments in the country which gave [as  heard] a loan.</p>

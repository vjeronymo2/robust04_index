			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Officials break with tradition to reassure financial system The launch of a lifeboat for two ailing Japanese banks was greeted by analysts yesterday as a rare sign that the authorities are acting decisively to ensure the financial system's stability, writes William Dawkins. The Bank of Japan's decision to set up a rescue bank, partly funded by public money, to take over two small, virtually bankrupt credit unions early next year is its first post-war use of such funds for a bail-out. Tokyo Kyowa and Anzen will be closed and the rescue group will try to recover some of their Y100bn (Pounds 637m) bad debts, before selling the remnants back to the private sector. Mr Yasushi Mieno, outgoing central bank governor, had recently hinted at a switch away from the traditional preference for smoothing over financial problems. He told a meeting of BoJ economists: 'Failure of an institution that has reason to fail is necessary from the viewpoint of nuturing a sound financial system built on competitive mechanisms.' This will be the first publicly backed bank rescue since 1927, when the government and private sector launched the jointly owned Showa Bank to take over the assets of failed financial institutions during the slump of that time. Showa, unlike the new vehicle, was privately funded, with the central bank simply co-ordinating the rescue. This new lifeboat reduces the likelihood that commercial banks will be cajoled by the finance ministry, as in the past, into taking over their weaker counterparts, although they will be asked to contribute to the rescue. It was, on balance, a 'positive sign,' a senior commercial banker said. Ms Alicia Ogawa, equity analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia, said the lifeboat might speed up a reduction in the number of small loss-making banks, thereby freeing market share for the financially secure commercial banks. This would be welcomed by the bigger institutions, as the domestic market is shrinking; total loan volumes have declined by 1 per cent so far this year, according to the BoJ. However, it was unclear yesterday whether the lifeboat would be enlarged to take on bigger potential threats to financial stability, such as the seven housing loan corporations whose bad debts stand at an estimated Y6,000bn. Mr Masayoshi Takemura, finance minister, said he believed the rescue was on offer only to the two credit unions. The credit unions suffered from a combined Y100bn of bad loans to EIE International, an aggressive property developer hit by the slide in property prices which led to its five main banks halting lending last year. Mr Harunori Takahashi, EIE's president, is also the head of Tokyo Kyowa. He and the management of both unions are resigning. The amounts at stake are small in comparison with the property related bankruptcies to have hit builders and developers, such as Muramoto Construction which last year collapsed with Y590bn of debts. And yet Mr Mieno had good reason to act swiftly before he hands over next Friday to his successor, Mr Yasuo Matsushita, who would be constrained by a newcomer's reluctance to rock the boat. The recent embarrassing failure of a finance ministry plan to merge three regional banks in northern Japan, blocked by customers and unions, may also have contributed to the decision to tackle the problem openly. Moreover, the finance ministry and central bank are secure in the knowledge that the credit unions' problems are limited to their increasingly small sector; the lifeboat will boost confidence rather than trigger panic. The credit associations and credit unions are a specialised relic of the fragmented traditional banking sector, now facing tougher competition from the big city banks. They were intended to lend to consumers and small businesses, to leave larger players free to channel capital to industry. But in today's less regulated banking market, Ms Ogawa believes, they are no longer economically viable. They have missed out on the economies of scale and technology achieved by larger competitors, while lending is limited by law to individuals and small businesses. As a result, the 812 credit associations and unions had a mere 11.2 per cent of private sector loans by the end of last March. This may explain why Tokyo Kyowa and Anzen were tempted, in apparent disregard of official guidelines, to stray beyond their usual markets into property lending. The cost of local credit banks' funds remains high, while their big competitors are exploring ever cheaper sources of capital. The deregulation of interest rates on deposits, completed two months ago, has also increased competition for customers' cash. Some have responded with costly marketing gimmicks, to the finance ministry's anxiety. Johnan Shinkin Bank, the largest credit association, last month started a new trend by offering savers cash prizes. Others have started to raise deposit rates, confident the government will not allow them to collapse. Yesterday's announcement shows the authorities are ready to take a tough line with those who go astray.</p>

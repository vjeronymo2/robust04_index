			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> The fiberglass-and-metal pods Jacqueline Dreager molds from abandoned Air Force  radar covers are a curious balance of threat and amusement. It's hard not to  enjoy the funky, let's-pretend artifice of the pill-shaped planets with  Saturn-style wooden rings and time capsules of translucent plastic with  uncertain contents.  </P> <P> Like props from old science-fiction movies they are entertaining even if they  do suggest the campy terror of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers." But plastic  egg shapes, with their industrial sameness, get redundant. After a rush of '60s  nostalgia we need more than sci-fi simulated planets. Pieces like the brass  "Double Portrait," a ball pierced by ice tongs marked with two pressure screws  inscribed "L.A." and "Beijing," add a welcome layer of political reflection.  </P> <P> Also on view are Mari Andrews' large white, blue on blue paint-stick drawings  of organic vessels. These painterly blueprints read like enlarged viscera. Each  form is a wide, linear white silhouette delightfully alive with expressive  marks and rippling with a ghostly electricity. Pared down to the essentials  they suggest both calligraphy and science; natural instinct and rational  intelligence. Interesting dualities never seem at odds.

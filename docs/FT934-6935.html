			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Curacao votes to stay put Curacao has voted overwhelmingly to remain within the Netherlands Antilles federation, rejecting the options of being an overseas possession of the Netherlands or of political independence, reports Canute James from Kingston. The vote at the weekend was to determine whether the 170,000 people of the Caribbean island wanted to follow neighbouring Aruba which left the federation four years ago. The islands are a growing offshore banking and financial services centre, and also depend on tourism. The Dutch Caribbean islands are responsible for all aspects of their administration, except foreign and military affairs which are controlled by the Dutch government. Persistent reports of official corruption and laundering of drug money have caused the Hague to consider increasing its influence in local affairs.</p>

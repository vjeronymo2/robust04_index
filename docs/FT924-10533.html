			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Utd Newspapers to redeem Pounds 105m preference shares UNITED Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Express, Sunday Express and Daily Star, yesterday announced its intention to redeem its Pounds 105m guaranteed exchangeable preference shares by the end of the year. The decision is expected to enhance earnings in the current year and could result in a potential gain to shareholders' funds of up to Pounds 20m. The preference shares were issued in 1989 at Pounds 1,000 each, as a method of converting United's 2.7 per cent stake in the Reuters news agency into cash. They carried annual interest of 8 per cent. They can be redeemed on December 23 or exchanged for 114.1 Reuters shares before December 14. At last night's price of 1,178p for Reuters stock, a preference share would be worth Pounds 1,344. United said last night that it expected most of the 105,000 preference shares to be exchanged into Reuters stock. That would cut United's stake in Reuters to less than 0.5 per cent. If all preference holders swapped for Reuters, then earnings attributable to shareholders would be increased by about Pounds 3m on an annual basis, the company said. That represented the difference between making the interest payments on the preference shares and the cost of holding the Reuters shares. The company said the value of the Reuters shares carried on the balance sheet was substantially lower than the exchange price represented in the preference deal of 876.5p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] We begin our reports with developments  in the Yugoslav crisis at home and abroad. [Hungarian Foreign  Minister] Geza Jeszenszky, who visited Serbia a few days ago,  talked about the Yugoslav situation this afternoon at a news  conference. Miklos Lengyel reports:    [Lengyel] Hungary supports the lifting of sanctions against  the rump Yugoslavia only if Belgrade meets international  expectations, Geza Jeszenszky emphasized at his press briefing  today. The Hungarian foreign minister said that pressure on the  Hungarian minority in Serbia had eased. Hungary was striving  for balanced relations with all successor states to Yugoslavia.    The Hungarian foreign minister also plans to visit Zagreb  and  Sarajevo soon. Geza Jeszenszky thinks there is still a chance  of finding some sort of peace solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    However, Geza Jeszenszky considered it regrettable that  Istvan Szentivanyi, an Alliance of Free Democrats deputy, had  criticized the foreign minister's Belgrade talks. He was  surprised that THE WASHINGTON POST had only belatedly commented  on his visit to Belgrade. He denied that the Hungarian  Government had only now mentioned the detrimental effects of the  sanctions on Hungary. If the sanctions did not work properly,  it was not Hungary's fault, Geza Jeszenszky said.</p>

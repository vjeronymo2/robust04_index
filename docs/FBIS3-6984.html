In the correspondence, the prime minister requests the  people's committee chairmen of these provinces to solemnly  review the low tax rates and the imposition of light fines for  the large quantity of cars illegally imported through their  local land borders. At the same time, they must clearly define  the causes and responsibility of involved organs and individuals  before taking disciplinary actions against the offenders. The  chairmen must directly report their findings to the prime  minister.    The prime minister also reminds the people's committee  chairmen of provinces and cities directly subordinate to the  central government -- except the three aforementioned provinces  -- to conduct checks in their localities for similar cases and  to report them to him with suggestions on how to deal with the  cases. He also clearly requests that all provinces must  complete their report in March 1994.    The same newspaper reports that in 1992-93, the provinces of  Tay Ninh, Song Be, and Dong Nai legalized 789 illegally imported  cars, which caused an influx of cars from Cambodia through the  southwest border. This created confusion for border control and  car registration authorities, causing a loss of 50.627 billion  dong for the national budget.    It is noteworthy that before the issuance of the Directive  No. 01 TTG, these three provinces registered to legalize 328  illegally imported cars. After the introduction of the  directive, they did not seize those cars as directed by the  government instruction but continued to legalize an even larger  quantity, 631, of illegally imported cars.</p>

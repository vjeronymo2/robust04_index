			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: Waterford Wedgwood incurs IPounds 17m deficit LOSSES BEFORE tax at Waterford Wedgwood, the luxury crystal and ceramics manufacturer, increased from IPounds 2.7m to IPounds 17m for the 1992 year. The figure was scored after taking account of higher-than-expected exceptional provisions amounting to IPounds 18.4m (IPounds 5.3m). Of the exceptionals IPounds 16.5m was for closure costs at four Wedgwood plants in the UK and redundancy costs at three Waterford Crystal plants in Ireland. IPounds 1.9m was attributable to property disposals. Sales for the year fell from IPounds 292m to IPounds 274m but operating profits held steady at IPounds 9.1m. Losses per share rose from 0.73p to 2.69p. Mr Richard Barnes, finance director, said the exceptional item included a provision for planned ongoing redundancies in both divisions during 1993, of which 'the cash impact is 80 per cent complete at Waterford and 50 per cent complete at Wedgwood'. He said no further capacity cuts were planned once the present rationalisation process was concluded and added: 'The capacity in place is appropriate for the demand today.' The total workforce has been cut by 25 per cent to 7,500 since 1991. Earlier this year, unions representing the 1,600-strong workforce at the Waterford Crystal division agreed to a rescue plan involving a further 200 voluntary redundancies, pay cuts of up to 25 per cent, a three-year no-strike agreement and a one-year moratorium on the outsourcing of new lines of crystalware from mainland European manufacturers. Mr Paddy Galvin, chief executive of the Waterford division, said that as a result 'we are getting improved margins on all Waterford products'. He said new products within the classic crystalware range were planned to comprise 30 per cent of the sector's sales within a few years and would be sourced outside of Ireland if they cannot be produced competitively enough at home. The successful Marquis range of stemware, introduced in 1991, is manufactured in Germany and Slovenia.</p>

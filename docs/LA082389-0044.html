Cornelio Sommaruga, president of the International  Committee of the Red Cross, appeared to direct his remarks mainly at Iran and  Iraq, who are still holding POWs despite a cease-fire in the Persian Gulf War a  year ago. "Tens of thousands of prisoners of war wait in camps. Thousands, some  after years of internment, are wounded or sick. They have become hostages of  international negotiations," he said at a ceremony in Bern, Switzerland, to  mark the signing of the first Geneva Convention in 1864.  </P></p>

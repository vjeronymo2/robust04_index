			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Growth rate at 2.6% in S Africa South Africa said yesterday its gross domestic product grew by a worse-than-expected 2.6 per cent in the third quarter of the year. Following a decline in GDP of 3.6 per cent in the first quarter and a rise of only 1.6 per cent in the second quarter, the latest figures mean that the final growth rate for 1994 is likely to be about 2 per cent, only slightly up on last year's 1.1 per cent. The announcement is a blow for the government, which earlier in the year had been forecasting growth of 3-4 per cent for 1994. However labour unrest and political uncertainty surrounding the country's April elections appear to have dented growth in the first half of the year. The news, which came as the administration presented the latest version of its centrepiece economic plan, the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP), to parliament, may also make it difficult for the administration to meet its revenue targets for the year. The White Paper on the RDP is predicated on a 3 per cent annual growth rate for South Africa.</p>

			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / The big squeeze in Japan: Companies face a series of challenges in a changing economy The recent turmoil in the Tokyo stock market heralds profound changes in the Japanese economy. Companies fear that the decline in the Nikkei average indicates something far more serious than a cyclical slowdown. They are bracing themselves for changes as far-reaching as those caused by the two oil shocks of the 1970s and the rapid rise of the yen in the mid-1980s. As Mr Takeshi Nagano, chairman of Keizaidoyukai, the employers' organisation, said in an interview recently: 'The stock market is weak because everything is so unclear. The Japanese economy is not weak but its future is very fuzzy. It's difficult to form a consensus about what to do.' The main challenge facing business is the increase in capital costs, which followed the collapse of the financial boom of the 1980s. Other difficulties include growing labour shortages, spreading deregulation and the rise of protectionism in the US, the largest buyer of Japanese exports. Moreover, urgent economic reforms that might stimulate growth are being delayed by government inaction, including the further liberalisation of agriculture, transport and land-use laws. After nearly 40 years in power, the ageing ruling Liberal Democratic Party is losing its vigour. Faced with the prospect of retrenchment, many Japanese executives are considering a switch from high-volume/low-margin production, which has served Japan well since the Second World War, to a low-volume/high-margin strategy. Japan has the capacity to implement reform, not least because of the skill of its workers, the capital reserves of its manufacturing companies and the healthy state of government finances. Moreover, companies may have the time to make changes because many of their foreign rivals are facing difficulties caused by the global recession. The most sudden challenge to arise has been the increase in the cost of capital. In 1989, equity-linked funds cost less than 1 per cent. Even bank borrowings cost blue-chip borrowers less than 4 per cent. Today, equity fund-raising is hard, and commercial loans cost about 6 per cent. Also, weighed down by bad property loans, banks' capacity to lend is shrinking. Industry has not yet felt the pinch, because the economy is slowing, but a recovery could end prematurely in credit shortages. Mr Akio Morita, chairman of Sony, the electronics group, said: 'The basic problem for Japanese industry is the difficulty of financing.' While investor sentiment will ebb and flow, the shift in capital costs seems permanent, since it results partly from the financial deregulation of the past decade. The post-war financial system was designed to channel low-cost funds to big industry, at the expense of individuals and small companies. Liberalisation of interest rates has given investors the power to demand market rates for their money. Companies also face labour shortages. There are 125 jobs on offer for every 100 job seekers. As the population ages, the number of people of working age will start falling from 1996. Working hours are also being reduced from an average of 2,050 in 1990 to a target of 1,800. Labour-saving equipment will lessen the impact, but the upward pressure on wage costs will not ease. Business is also being hit by a shortage of land. The cost of land has forced Tokyo-based Nissan Motor, for example, to build its latest factory in distant Kyushu, in southern Japan. In spite of the recent sharp price falls, many businesses cannot afford to buy land in Tokyo or Osaka. Japanese companies used to respond to domestic pressures by boosting exports, sometimes dumping goods on world markets at below-cost price. Today, this practice is much more difficult. With protectionist sentiment growing in the US and Europe, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry has been pressing companies to limit export growth. Last month, for example, carmakers were forced to accept a sharp cut in the ceiling for exports to the US. Expanding Asian markets will absorb some products - but not high-value, high-price consumer goods destined for industrialised countries. The strength of the yen, supported by continuing current account surpluses, will further squeeze export growth. Companies would like to rely more on domestic growth. But the prospects have been dimmed by government inaction on the removal of regulatory constraints. Land reform is long overdue: in Tokyo, there are still acres of urban farms, thanks to tax laws which favour using land for crops instead of buildings. Farm trade liberalisation, including the opening of the rice market to imports, is even more urgent. By reducing retail food prices, reform could create new demand for manufactured goods. The Japanese spend 32 per cent of income on food, compared with 19.5 per cent for Americans. The LDP-led government lacks the will to act, however. Two years ago it watered down a land reform bill and is now hesitating over rice imports. Pressure from this combination of constraints on capital labour and demand is forcing companies to adopt varying strategies. The pressures on profits are severe in the principal international industries, particularly carmaking. Auto companies believe the Japanese market may have reached saturation - like the US and parts of Europe. Developing countries will require more cars, but not the high-cost, high-margin models sold in the industrialised world. Some of Japan's 11 vehicle makers may not survive the decade. 'We are at a structural turning point for the next one or two years,' said Mr Yoshifumi Tsuji, president of Nissan Motor. Electronics makers are still counting on future expansion, notably in office and factory automation. But in consumer products, the industry has yet to find a hit to follow the video recorder. The mass commercialisation of high-definition television seems remote, with the cheapest individual sets priced at Y1m (Pounds 4,200). Smaller consumer electronics specialists face grave difficulties, notably the loss-making Sansui. Even Sony suffered an operating loss for the year to March 1991, its first as a listed company. It is wrong, however, to generalise. Even within the more hard-pressed industries some companies, such as the cash-rich Toyota Motor, feel little pressure from rising capital costs. Whole industries remain buoyant, such as shipbuilding, owing to orders for big tankers. Consumer services, including travel, theatres and restaurants, are still expanding. Nevertheless, overall retail sales are slowing and earnings declining. Profits have fallen by an estimated average of 15 per cent in the year to March 1991 for companies included in the Nikkei index, and could drop a further 10 per cent this year. The first step for companies is to respond to the cyclical part of the slowdown. Production is being cut; price-discounting is rampant; entertainment, advertising and travel are being slashed. Directors are submitting to pay cuts of up to 35 per cent. Capital spending is falling. Sony, for instance, is cutting investment in the year starting this month by Y160bn to Y280bn. Even research and development spending, precious seedcorn for Japanese groups, is being trimmed. Hitachi says R&amp;D spending will be held at last year's level, which means a decline in real terms. Smaller companies are making big cuts: at Ascii, a software publisher, long-term R&amp;D has been shelved. However, many businessmen believe these short-term measures will not be enough to cope with an expected long-term slowdown. 'I'm planning for a seven-year recession,' said Mr Kazuhiko Nishi, Ascii's president. Some companies are taking increasingly far-reaching action. Steelmakers, for example, are reconsidering diversifications: Kawasaki Steel is contemplating reducing investment in ceramic products. Similarly, companies are questioning the merits of direct investment overseas: the total fell by 35 per cent last year to Dollars 31.2bn. It will decline further as companies complete projects started in the late 1980s - such as Toyota's UK assembly plant  - and postpone new ones. Equally important are efforts to raise profitability in mainstream businesses by curbing waste and upgrading products. Matsushita Electric Industrial, the electronics company, said: 'We are shifting from volume to quality. This is not a temporary move but a permanent one.' Matsushita, among others, is also cutting model ranges. An official said: 'The Japanese television industry produces 300 models. Only 100 can be displayed in the shops. Only 10 sell well. We can cut this waste without affecting customers.' There are also the first signs of corporate consolidation. The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the business daily, recently published a list of 31 mergers, mostly of companies already in the same industrial grouping, or keiretsu. The deals cover everything from oil distribution to stainless steel. Do all these changes presage a permanent revolution in Japanese corporate behaviour, or are they temporary responses to changing circumstances? The answer is that individual industries and companies will move at different speeds, but none can fully escape the emerging constraints on growth. The chase after sales seems certain to give way to a pursuit of profits. A taste of the future could lie in the industry most exposed to changing capital costs - banking. Japanese banks have been forced by the erosion of their capital base to abandon their former hunt for market share in favour of boosting margins. In international markets, the Japanese share of new credits to non-bank companies has fallen from 46 per cent in 1985-89 to 5 per cent in 1989 to mid-1991, according to the Bank for International Settlements. In manufacturing, too, senior businessmen have begun to contemplate the need for radical reform. Sony's Mr Akio Morita earlier this year called on companies to accept that growth had limits and urged giving back more to employees, shareholders and society - which means earning higher profits and distributing bigger dividends. The appeal caused widespread controversy. Mr Yotaro Iida, the chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, commented that traditional Japanese capitalism had strengths as well as weaknesses. Fundamental change will take time - '10 or 20 years', said Mr Takashi Ishihara, Nissan's former chairman. Even Mr Morita has said that his arguments should not be taken as an indication of Sony's policies, only as a discussion agenda. However, if the current pressures imposed by the capital markets persist - as seems likely  - the priority on profit could become permanent. As Mr Richard Koo, an economist at Nomura Research Institute, an affiliate of Nomura Securities, said: 'Being a famous name will no longer be enough if a corporation cannot come up with the goods and offer shareholders a decent return.'</p>

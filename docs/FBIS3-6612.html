			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Kazuhiko Sasaki] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 20 Mar -- The main purpose of Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's recent talks with Chinese leaders  was to confirm that Japan and China will take unified actions in  dealing with the suspected nuclear weapons development (by the  DPRK). During his talks with Premier Li Peng, the two agreed  that the DPRK should open all its nuclear sites to inspections  by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). However,  there was apparent discord between them -- Hosokawa, with a  sense of crisis, urged China to persuade the DPRK to accept the  nuclear inspections while Li called for exercising prudence in  dealing with the issue. The DPRK issue is expected to be a main  topic in Japanese-South Korean and Sino-South Korean summits  scheduled for this weekend. Because it has become apparent that  China is taking a cautious approach, Tokyo will have to review  its plan for "Japan, the United States, China, and the ROK to  work in closer cooperation" in dealing with the DPRK issue.    Hosokawa repeatedly touched on the suspected nuclear weapons  development by the DPRK during his talks with President Jiang  Zemin and Premier Li on 20 March. He said: "It (what the DPRK  is doing) is delaying tactics," and "the international  community's patience has been running out and it is possible  that attempts to resolve this nuclear issue through dialogue  might end in failure." Compared with Tokyo's traditional stand,  his remarks were a little harsher to Pyongyang in response to  the DPRK's recent attitude. Behind his remarks lie growing  arguments in Japan, the United States, and the ROK that "if  these nations try to resolve the issue only through dialogue,  they will fall into the DPRK's tactics" (according to a  government source).    The DPRK nuclear issue has direct influence on security in  Japan and other northeast Asian nations. In recent summits,  Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton shared the same view on  this grave problem and agreed to work in closer cooperation in  dealing with it. In view of current relations between Washington  and Beijing, Japan is the only nation that can make requests to  China. It is certain that being aware of this, Hosokawa visited  Beijing.    However, Beijing did not fully accept Japan's requests.  Because there are about 2 million Koreans living along the  China-DPRK border, any actions that provoke the DPRK might also  create commotion in China. Moreover, it is rumored that DPRK  President Kim Il-song will visit Beijing in the near future. In  such a situation, it is a matter of course for China to think it  is best to exercise prudence. Another reason for China  rejecting Japan's requests might be that it tried to indirectly  check the United States from carrying out a hard-line policy  against the DPRK.    Because China's cautious attitude has become apparent  through  the recent Japanese-Sino summit, some people have begun to think  that even if the DPRK nuclear issue is sent from the IAEA to the  UN Security Council [UNSC], it is uncertain whether the UNSC  will be able to adopt a resolution calling for sanctions against  the DPRK because if China, a permanent UNSC member, should  exercise its veto power, the resolution will be killed.    A government source said: "Tokyo will consider strengthening  its persuasion on China." Nevertheless, China's cautious  approach might affect future cooperation between "Japan, the  United States, China, and the ROK." During his talks with South  Korean President Kim Yong-sam scheduled for 24 March, Hosokawa  is to discuss with the president cooperation between Japan and  South Korea in dealing with the DPRK. After visiting Japan,  President Kim is to visit China to meet with Chinese leaders.  The DPRK issue occupies a major position in a series of summits  between Japan and China, Japan and the ROK, and China and the  ROK. It can be said that in the recent Japanese-Sino talks, the  first in a series of summits, Tokyo was forced to review its  plan for "Japan, the United States, China, and South Korea to  work in closer cooperation" in dealing with the DPRK.</p>

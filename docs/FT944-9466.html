			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of European Airports (11): Schiphol has grand plans under way - Amsterdam Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport is in the middle of an ambitious, multi-billion guilder expansion drive that will allow it to handle 40m passengers a year by the year 2015. This is a near doubling compared with the 21.3m passengers who used the airport in 1993. The airport also hopes to build a new, fifth runway around the turn of the century. Opponents of Schiphol's goal of becoming one of the Europe's 'mainport' for air traffic are focusing their attention on trying to delay the runway's construction. A milestone in the expansion programme was reached in May 1993 when Schiphol's terminal extension was opened in May 1993, boosting potential capacity to 27m passengers a year from 19m previously. The extension, used primarily as a base for intercontinental flights, was designed so that Schiphol could retain its 'one-terminal' structure, making transfers easier for passengers. Schiphol is aiming to keep its future expansion within this one central terminal, although satellite terminals may be necessary in the 21st century. Transfer passengers, particularly those from regional airports in the UK, are crucial to Schiphol. In 1993, 43.4 per cent of all passengers arriving on scheduled flights were stopping over to catch a connecting service. In August, Schiphol opened a new pier dedicated to regional airlines, as part of its strategy of strengthening its position as a European aviation hub. Like other airports, Schiphol has a wide range of facilities for business travellers, including office space, lounges and meeting rooms.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Khrustov report under the "Projects" rubric: </F> "Money for Space Will Yield Space Technologies"]    [Text] The "Molniya" Science and Production Association,  where "Buran" -- our own version of the space shuttle -- was  designed, is embarking on the first financial-industrial  aerospace consortium in Russia. This information was relayed to  journalists who had been invited to the famous firm by Aleksandr  Bashilov, general director of the science and production  association, and his deputy Konstantin Borovoy, director of the  new commercial project.    Since it is simply impossible at present to support the  aerospace industry at the proper level within the framework of  the state budget, it has been decided to pool the efforts of our  best aerospace firms with the financial potential of Russia's  commercial structures. "Molniya's" specialists regard the  following as the principal long-term projects with a good chance  of success: A multipurpose aerospace system and an orbiting  spaceplane launched from a delivery vehicle rather than a space  center, a function that could be performed by the An-225 (the  "Mriya"). Incidentally, the science and production association  plans to develop its own heavy aircraft with a much bigger cargo  carrying capacity than "Mriya." This system, which would not  require a space center, would enable us to place payloads in  orbit from virtually any point on the globe, thus making orbital  payload delivery five to seven times cheaper. "Molniya" is  already preparing to offer customers a series of light business  aircraft, one of which -- the six-seater "Molniya-1" air taxi --  is successfully undergoing flight tests. A total of 20 series  aircraft have already been manufactured by the Samara plant.    It is expected that the incorporation documents for the  establishment of the Russian Aerospace Company could be signed  this June. The first profit, Konstantin Borovoy believes, could  show up literally within the next few months: The "Molniya"  Science and Production Association already has a competitive  product both on the domestic and the world market. In addition  to the aerospace technology already mentioned, it includes  advanced technologies and new materials, for example adhesives  which were developed during work on "Buran." Moreover, most of  this "know-how" is extremely adaptable and can be applied in a  number of sectors of the national economy.</p>

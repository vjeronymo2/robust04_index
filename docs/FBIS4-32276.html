			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 21 Jun (MTI) -- Hungarian President Arpad  Goncz and Slovak President Michal Kovac believe an unexpected  opportunity has arisen for their countries to reach a historic  reconciliation, and they wish to closely cooperate in order to  attain this aim. The two presidents, who are currently visiting  the United States, had breakfast together on Tuesday at their  common residence, the Ritz Carlton Hotel, prior to leaving for  their meeting with President Bill Clinton.    After the working breakfast, Goncz and Kovac said in a  statment that reconciliation was made more difficult by mutually  established misunderstandings about relations between the two  countries. In their view, the first misunderstanding is that  the wounds which Hungarians and Slovaks have caused to each  other are too deep to heal quickly.    However, the reality is that the two nations have lived side  by side for many centuries, in spite of the conflicts, and have  enriched each other both materially and culturally. The  presidents stressed their firm resolve to overcome psychological  obstacles in the way of cooperation.    According to their joint statement, the second  misunderstanding, often used for advantage by extremist  elements, is that the minorities could endanger the unity and  integrity of the individual countries. The statement declares  that the presidents are convinced that ethnic linguistic and  cultural diversity is beneficial not only for their countries,  but for international relations as well.    Presidents Goncz and Kovac added that the sole authentic and  effective minority policy must be based on international law and  the measures set down in the approved international documents  relating to minorities. They also stressed that a proper  approach could disperse all misunderstandings.    Presidents Goncz and Kovac voiced their readiness to support  the enforcement of minority rights and to mutually work toward  elevating cooperation between their states to a new standard.       They are of the opinion that a readiness for closer ties is  beginning to emerge in both countries. "We support the efforts  of the political leaders in our countries to intensify bilateral  cooperation and to reach agreement in the matter of a contract  which -- based on respect for territorial integrity and the  existing borders -- will guarantee good neighbourly relations  and minority rights in both countries," they stated.    The presidents also called attention to the fact that  intensifying bilateral relations could promote the integration  of Hungary and Slovakia into the western economic, political and  security structure.    President Goncz and President Kovac believe that the  distinction which is to be conferred on them by the Institute  for East-West Studies indicates that the United States  understands and appreciates these efforts, while the meeting  scheduled with President Bill Clinton demonstrates that the U.S.  Administration supports the goals of the two countries.</p>

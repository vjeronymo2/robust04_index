			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCILMAN DENIES PLAN FOR ANNEXATION  </P> <P> Inglewood Councilman Jose Fernandez said at a Lennox community meeting that  Inglewood has no plans to annex the unincorporated area, although he said such  a move would help relieve Lennox's drug, crime and blight problems.  </P> <P> Although Inglewood is studying the costs and benefits of annexing the portion  of Lennox north of Lennox Boulevard, Fernandez said such a move is not in the  works and would not be made unless Lennox residents were behind it.  </P> <P> After the meeting, several residents said they are still apprehensive that  Inglewood, Hawthorne or the county have secret plans to redevelop their  community.  </P> <P> Lennox is inside Inglewood's and Hawthorne's "sphere of influence," a planning  term that gives those municipalities the right to consider annexation. The  county is preparing a revised community plan for the area, which officials say  they will present to residents in September.  </P> <P> "We're poor people that are not against progress, but we want to preserve our  rights," said Hector Carrio, vice president of the Lennox Coordinating Council.  </P></p>

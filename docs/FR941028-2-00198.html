			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a. Fixed room-air recirculation systems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The preferred method of recirculating HEPA-filtered air within a room is a built-in system, in which air is exhausted from the room into a duct, filtered through a HEPA filter, and returned to the room (Figure S3&hyph;5). This technique may be used to add air changes in areas where there is a recommended minimum ACH that is difficult to meet with general ventilation alone. The air does not have to be conditioned, other than by the filtration, and this permits higher airflow rates than the general ventilation system can usually achieve. An alternative is the use of HEPA filtration units that are mounted on the wall or ceiling of the room (Figure S3&hyph;7). Fixed recirculation systems are preferred over portable (free-standing) units because they can be installed and maintained with a greater degree of reliability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Portable room-air recirculation units. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Portable HEPA filtration units may be considered for recirculating air within rooms in which there is no general ventilation system, where the system is incapable of providing adequate airflow, or where increased effectiveness in room airflow is desired. Effectiveness depends on circulating as much of the air in the room as possible through the HEPA filter, which may be difficult to achieve and evaluate. The effectiveness of a particular unit can vary depending on the room's configuration, the furniture and persons in the room, and placement of the HEPA filtration unit and the supply and exhaust grilles. Therefore, the effectiveness of the portable unit may vary considerably in rooms with different configurations or in the same room if moved from one location to another in the room. If portable units are used, caution should be exercised to ensure they can recirculate all or nearly all of the room air through the HEPA filter. Some commercially available units may not be able to meet this requirement because of design limitations or insufficient airflow capacity. In addition, units should be designed and operated to ensure that persons in the room cannot interfere with or otherwise compromise the functioning of the unit. Portable HEPA filtration units have not been evaluated adequately to determine their role in TB infection-control programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Portable HEPA filtration units should be designed to achieve the equivalent of "12 ACH. They should also be designed to ensure adequate air mixing in all areas of the hospital rooms in which they are used, and they should not interfere with the current ventilation system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some HEPA filtration units employ UVGI for disinfecting air after HEPA filtration. However, whether exposing the HEPA-filtered air to UV irradiation further decreases the concentration of contaminants is not known. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Evaluation of room-air recirculation systems and units. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Detailed and accurate evaluations of room-air recirculation systems and units require the use of sophisticated test equipment and lengthy test procedures that are not practical. However, an estimate of the unit's ability to circulate the air in the room can be made by visualizing airflow patterns as was described previously for estimating room air mixing (Suppl. 3, Section II.B.1). If the air movement is good in all areas of the room, the unit should be effective. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Installing, Maintaining, and Monitoring HEPA Filters <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proper installation and testing and meticulous maintenance are critical if a HEPA filtration system is used ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 104 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), especially if the system used recirculates air to other parts of the facility. Improper design, installation, or maintenance could allow infectious particles to circumvent filtration and escape into the general ventilation system ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 47 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). HEPA filters should be installed to prevent leakage between filter segments and between the filter bed and its frame. A regularly scheduled maintenance program is required to monitor the HEPA filter for possible leakage and for filter loading. A quantitative leakage and filter performance test (e.g., the dioctal phthalate [DOP] penetration test [ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 105 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ]) should be performed at the initial installation and every time the filter is changed or moved. The test should be repeated every 6 months for filters in general-use areas and in areas with systems that exhaust air that is likely to be contaminated with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (e.g, TB isolation rooms). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A manometer or other pressure-sensing device should be installed in the filter system to provide an accurate and objective means of determining the need for filter replacement. Pressure drop characteristics of the filter are supplied by the manufacturer of the filter. Installation of the filter should allow for maintenance that will not contaminate the delivery system or the area served. For general infection-control purposes, special care should be taken to not jar or drop the filter element during or after removal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The scheduled maintenance program should include procedures for installation, removal, and disposal of filter elements. HEPA filter maintenance should be performed only by adequately trained personnel. Appropriate respiratory protection should be worn while performing maintenance and testing procedures. In addition, filter housing and ducts leading to the housing should be labelled clearly with the words ``Contaminated Air'' (or a similar warning). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When a HEPA filter is used, one or more lower efficiency disposable prefilters installed upstream will extend the useful life of the HEPA filter. A disposable filter can increase the life of a HEPA filter by 25%. If the disposable filter is followed by a 90% extended surface filter, the life of the HEPA filter can be extended almost 900% ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 98 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). These prefilters should be handled and disposed of in the same manner as the HEPA filter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> D. TB Isolation Rooms and Treatment Rooms <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Purpose:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To separate patients who are likely to have infectious TB from other persons, to provide an environment that will allow reduction of the concentration of droplet nuclei through various engineering methods, and to prevent the escape of droplet nuclei from such rooms into the corridor and other areas of the facility using directional airflow. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A hierarchy of ventilation methods used to achieve a reduction in the concentration of droplet nuclei and to achieve directional airflow using negative pressure has been developed (Table S3&hyph;2). The methods are listed in order from the most desirable to the least desirable. The method selected will depend on the configuration of the isolation room and the ventilation system in the facility; the determination should be made in consultation with a ventilation engineer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,i1,s20,r20 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Table S <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> 3&hyph;2._ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Hierarchy of Ventilation Methods for Tuberculosis (TB) Isolation Rooms and Treatment Rooms <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Reducing concentration of airborne tubercle bacilli* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Achieving directional airflow using negative pressure <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=5 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0036 unknown -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / International Company News: Nova Scotia reports increased earnings BANK of Nova Scotia, Canada's fourth largest bank, reports that earnings in the first nine months of fiscal 1992 were up 8.9 per cent, reflecting increased domestic and foreign margins and gains in fee and other income. For the three months to July 31, net profit was CDollars 165m (USDollars 138.6m), or 71 cents a share, against Dollars 165m, or 73 cents, a year earlier. The latest quarter showed a small decline from the second quarter. Return on equity was 14.53 per cent, against 16.35 per cent, and on assets 0.69 per cent, against 0.75 per cent. Net interest income rose 5.1 per cent and other income 6.1 per cent. Non-performing loans were CDollars 2bn at July 31, or 2.9 per cent of total loans, against 2.7 per cent at April 30. Loan losses for fiscal 1992 are estimated at CDollars 640m, unchanged from April 30. Sovereign loans, after provision, were reduced to CDollars 1.05bn from CDollars 1.6bn at April 30, due mainly to the Mexico's removal from the official 'basket' of developing country loans. Last May Bank of Nova Scotia said its exposure to the Olympia and York Developments group was about CDollars 600m. Analysts said the results and provisions indicate that the bank has provided fully for this exposure.</p>

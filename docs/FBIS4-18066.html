			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former President Kurt Waldheim by Claus </F> Lutterbeck in Vienna; date not given: "At Daggers Drawn With  the Nazis"]    [Text] The U.S. Justice Department kept it secret for  seven years. Now, the documentation that accuses former UN  Secretary General Kurt Waldheim, 75, of evil war crimes has been  published -- among other things, he is accused of having  participated in the execution of British prisoners of war and  the deportation of Greek Jews.    STERN correspondent Claus Lutterbeck interviewed the former  Austrian president in Vienna.    [Lutterbeck] Mr. Waldheim, did you "aid and participate" in  war crimes?    [Waldheim] This is an abomination that is intended to  destroy the reputation of a man who has never in his life been a  Nazi or committed war crimes.    [Lutterbeck] The report describes your role in Army Unit  E....    [Waldheim] ...just with assumptions and claims. There is  not a single piece of evidence on 204 pages that I was  personally involved in these events. Not a single historian in  the world has proven something like that. A British Government  committee in 1986 noted that I was not guilty of any crimes.  Only the Office of Special Investigations in the U.S. Justice  Department claims that.    [Lutterbeck] The report describes your responsibility quite  precisely. According to the report, you, as an assistant  adjutant, were a key figure in this army unit.    [Waldheim] Nonsense, I was a lieutenant -- later a first  lieutenant -- without any authority to give orders and I dealt  with situation reports in the army staff.    [Lutterbeck] Curiosity about your case was aroused because  in your official biography, you did not mention your wartime  past in the Balkans....    [Waldheim] ...in the official curriculum vitae, which I  presented to the Foreign Ministry in 1945, I mentioned the  Balkans. Later on, I did not see any reason to constantly repeat  that.    [Lutterbeck] Your way of dealing with the past in Hitler's  army is strange. Why does one not hear a word of repentance and  shame from you?    [Waldheim] I openly expressed my grief and sympathy here in  parliament in 1986.    [Lutterbeck] Was it not perhaps this Austrian method of  always considering oneself only as one of Hitler's victims and  not as a perpetrator?    [Waldheim] Of course, there were Austrians who were among  the biggest Nazi criminals, but there were also many victims.  My family and I were at daggers drawn with the Nazis.    [Lutterbeck] You are always the victim.    [Waldheim] My family was persecuted by the Nazis, my father  was imprisoned, and my mother spit at in the street. I am  deeply aggrieved that it is intended to turn precisely a man  with this fate into a super Nazi and war criminal.    [Lutterbeck] However, this did not turn you into a man that  opposes Nazis.    [Waldheim] It is easy to say that for the generation who did  not live through it. "Why did you not let yourself be beheaded  for your convictions?" We were young people and wanted to  survive.    [Lutterbeck] President Von Weizsaecker was also an officer.  Why did it hit you and not him?    [Waldheim] These are two completely different cases that you  cannot compare. I once had the problem of holding the highest  office in the world. It was intended to hit the UN secretary  general, who, during his term of office, also made decisions  that some governments did not like.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Leonid Sharov: "They Are Threatening, But We Are </F> Not Afraid," preceded by a "warning" from the Committee on the  Press and followed by remarks from a legal expert]    [Text] Warning    OBSHCHAYA GAZETA No. 11 of March 1994 published  material entitled "Kidneys Are Swelling. Is a Putsch Coming?  Version No. 1," which contains information on a coup d'etat,  aimed at discrediting leaders of the Federal Duma and the  Russian Federation Government, which is allegedly being  prepared.    The Russian Federation Committee on the Press believes  that by disseminating deliberately false and slanderous  fabrications by an anonymous author aimed at undermining the  constitutional order and destabilizing the situation in the  society, the editorial staff of OBSHCHAYA GAZETA has violated  Articles 4 and 51 of the Russian Federation Law "On the Mass  Media."    In accordance with its powers, the Russian Fedration  Committee on the Press issues an official warning to the  OBSHCHAYA GAZETA editorial staff.    [Signed] First Deputy Chairman of the Committee on the Press  V.V. VOLODIN  <H8>  * * * </H8>   So OBSHCHAYA GAZETA has gotten its deserts. Next came a  statement by the Russian Federation Committee on the Press  devoted to glasnost. The questions asked in it were no laughing  matter:    --Who wants to turn the peoples of Russia into a biomass  without a tongue?    --In whose interest is it to sow the poisonous seed of  hostility between the branches of government?    --In whose interest is it to sow the same seed between the  leadership and society?    --Who is eager to undermine the constitutional order?    --To whose advantage is it to keep Russia in an atmosphere  of  rumors, gossip, and slander--ultimately fear?    And there is an answer. On the eve of "Laughter Day" (or as  they still call it, "Fools' Day"), the deliberate criminal has  been identified at last. It is OBSHCHAYA GAZETA! And something  is not very laughable, even on 1 April. Although it is not very  frightening, either. Rather, it is a little nasty. For example,  what is the value of the first paragraph in the committee's  statement to watch over the democratic achievements of our mass  media: "Only unprincipled politicians who put their own  ambitions above the fundamental interests of the state, the  society, and the nation, can..." Such deep drilling should be  envied by Iosif Stalin, Andrey Zhdanov, and Mikhail Suslov.    Let us explain for those who have not been readers. A spark  was lit because in two preceding issues, the editorial staff had  published the so-called "Version No. 1," explaining in a  commentary here that this was obviously a hoax aimed at  discrediting a number of major political figures. Why is the  newspaper publishing a document which it states itself is from a  questionable source? Because the provocative writing, regardless  of the view of any newspaper, is being disseminated and  unfortunately has become a fact of sociopolitical life.  Following our publication, numerous commentaries demonstrated  once again how many had "Version No. 1" in hand, were reading  it, and were pondering what would actually take place.    Both before and after the warning, the editorial staff  continues to be confident that an informed public is within its  direct responsibility. Moreover, this is precisely the reason it  exists.    But the anger which has been directed at us is like an echo  of those distant times when the first one to bring bad news had  his head chopped off. Three weeks have passed since our  publication. Neither the public prosecutor's office nor  counterintelligence has been able to answer: who has been so  assiduously disseminating slander on a coup, who has been  circulating it, and who has been passing the anonymous document  from hand to hand? the head of the FSK [expansion not given]  states that they have managed to find the authors of the  document. Though special efforts were not required for this: the  first one--Gleb Pavlovskiy, came to our editorial office himself  and told us about work on the document. As far as those who were  interested in disseminating the false document and spared  neither time nor effort for this are concerned, nothing is known  about them. It is not hard to assume that they will not want to  reveal their names. The simplest thing is to accuse OBSHCHAYA  GAZETA of all the sins.    Official reaction to the newspaper's statement is striking  for its inadequacy. Every day in the newspapers and on  television we read and see every possible kind of statement by  all kinds of extremist political figures. All of them are simply  taken into consideration, and it does not occur to anyone to  make television or newspapers take responsibility for these  statements: evceryone recognizes the right of the SMI [mass  media] to reveal information.    So what aroused the guardians of public tranquillity in our  case? Let us examine the details. If the committee decides to  repudiate "Version No. 1" after OG [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA], why all  the fuss? There are simply no reasons to be worried about public  stability and the constitutional system. But if a state  department believes there are reasons for this anyway, then it  consequently assumes that "Version No. 1" is not all a pack of  lies; in this case, reproaching the newspaper for spreading  slanderous misinformation is even more unfair. This is like  accusing the doctor who gives an inoculation against rabies of  deliberately spreading infection.    What is the point of the warning given to us? This is what  it  is: "Next time do not take it into your head to inform the  public about a provocation being prepared, but the main thing is  not to interfere first and without permission--otherwise you  will be burned for sure!" Alas, OBSHCHAYA GAZETA cannot accept  these instructions for implementation. In the event that  something like "Version No. 1" is undertaken, we will respond to  it in accordance with our convictions and professional  responsibility by warning the public (but not the bureaucracy)  of impending dangers. Because only a putsch itself can confirm  rumors about a putsch. This is enough, we have already "gone  through it." In August 1991, three were buried by a million. In  October 1993, at least 150 died... No one but the relatives  knows where they are buried. The consequence has ended--forget  it.    But why are there so many extreme epithets threatening coups  and exclamation points in those documents which made their  appearance in the Committee on the Press 10 days after our  publication? Because nothing else is left for them. They have to  threaten when there is no legal basis to deal with those who do  not want to be near you.    You have been threatened badly, as I see.  <H8>  The Scheme for Accusation: Falsity-Previous </H8> Knowledge-Premeditation    The excitement at the General Prosecutor's Office about  the slander gave rise to conflicting opinions among the public  and in the press.    We asked Aleksandr Yakovlev, professor and doctor of  juridical sciences, for a particularly professional assessment  of the scheme, which is how this matter can be classified.    As soon as a criminal case has been raised, it certainly  involves the application of Article 130 of the UK [Criminal  Code], or more precisely, its third part, which defines the  punishment for slander, combined with the charge of a state or  other heinous crime. It has to be kept in mind that slander is  the dissemination of DELIBERATELY false fabrications which  defame another person. This wording must be "combined" with the  principle of the presumption of innocence which applies in  criminal law. This means that the burden of proof lies with the  prosecuting side. Three things must be proved in a slander case:  the falsity of the information disseminated; the fact that the  falsity was known beforehand to the accused; and the fact that  they acted with premeditation. This is the chain that appears:  falsity-previous knowledge-premeditation.    But it also happens that a person who disseminates false,  defamatory information has been honestly deluded. In this case,  we can and should speak about libel, which is a subject for  consideration in civil law. Here the burden of proof lies with  the defendant. The defendant's intention has no significance.    Slander and libel lead to different legal consequences.  Slander (Article 130 of the Criminal Code, Part 3) leads to  imprisonment for a period of up to 5 years. Libel leads to  refutation, and in a number of cases to compensation for  material damages, if the court comes to the conclusion that this  took place.    Most cases of slander and libel are linked with publication  in the press. It is very difficlt to assess the role of the mass  media in disseminating information that is incorrect. On one  hand, real protection must be given to a citizen's honor and  dignity. On the other hand, to encroach upon the prerogative of  the press, which ensures the right of that same citizen to  information--that is not to silence the newspapers and other  mass media.</p>

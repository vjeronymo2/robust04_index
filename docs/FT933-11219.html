			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Observer: Quornered ICI is patently glad to be shot of its bio-science operations; it passed off Zeneca, its Pounds 4bn offshoot, merely as a 'discontinued business'. Industry journalists can only agree. As the two companies' results briefings will no longer coincide, there will also be no occasion for Zeneca to ply unsuspecting hacks with the company's meat-substitute, Quorn, in between sessions.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said today that he  does not share the assessment that Egyptian President Mubarak's  regime is threatened. Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports  that in a meeting with the Labor Knesset caucus, Peres said that  Mubarak's regime handles fundamentalist violence with political  wisdom and appropriate force. Peres stressed that signs of  economic development are clearly visible in Egypt.    The foreign minister sharply attacked the Syrian attitude  toward the peace process. He said that we have a right to  demand that it raise the level of negotiators to that of heads  of state or senior ministers. The Syrians must adjust to  international standards. We will not get far if we continue the  Syrian way of negotiating. The talks with them are still bogged  down, Peres said.</p>

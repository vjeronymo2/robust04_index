			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Gadi Sukenik] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Cabinet ministers are bound  to rejoice when they are informed of President Clinton's  message, which was delivered to Prime Minister Rabin on Sunday  [16 January]. The message says that as of now, Israel may  participate in U.S. tenders and projects involving the launching  of space satellites. The license includes access to American  equipment and expertise. Until now, any such access was denied  to our hi tech companies. This is a tangible expression of the  United States' strong commitment to preserving Israel's  qualitative edge, Clinton wrote in his letter, which was  delivered by his team of advisers headed by Dennis Ross.    It is estimated in Israel that the implementation of this  decision will create many new jobs, most notably in the Israel  Aircraft Industries, REFA'EL [Armament Development Authority],  and the Israel Military Industries.</p>

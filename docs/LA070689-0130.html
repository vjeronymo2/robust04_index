			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ETHICS PANEL'S RENT DEAL CALLED IMPROPER  </P> <P> The commission appointed by Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley to rewrite the city's  ethics law is renting an office from the owner of the Westside Pavilion  shopping mall for $1,000 per month, well below the prevailing rate in the  Westwood neighborhood.  </P> <P> The arrangement has irritated some homeowners, who say it is improper for the  panel to receive below-market accommodations from a developer with a project  pending before the city. In January, Westfield Inc. received preliminary  approval from the City Council to expand the mall, but needs final approval to  build a controversial bridge over Westwood Boulevard to connect the mall and  annex.  </P> <P> "Of all the buildings to rent, you don't rent that one," Sandy Brown, who heads  a coalition of five homeowners' groups near the mall that oppose the expansion,  said Wednesday. "They should at least charge them market value."  </P> <P> Spokesmen for the commission and Westfield denied that the commission has  received special treatment. "It is a tempest in a teapot," said Xandra Kayden,  director of the ethics commission. "Ideally, we would have found free space,  but we felt an obligation to pay rent."  </P></p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Cleared to go Two private jets formerly owned by Robert Maxwell (pictured above in one of them) were advertised for sale yesterday at a combined price of almost Dollars 27m (Pounds 14.8m), Daniel Green writes. The Gulfstream IV and Gulfstream II that ferried Maxwell around the world are owned by VIP Aviation (Bermuda), part of Headington Investments, Maxwell's main pri-vate holding company. They are being kept at a secret location to avoid the attentions of aggrieved Maxwell creditors. The Gulfstream IV, with an asking price of Dollars 21.9m, is lavishly fitted out and is powered by the latest Rolls-Royce engines. The Gulfstream II, with a price tag of Dollars 4.9m, is a 15-year-old aircraft and Maxwell was its fourth owner.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On the directives of His Majesty King Husayn, the  Council of Ministers held an extraordinary session yesterday  evening to examine the dimensions of the terrible crime  perpetrated by the Israeli settlers at dawn yesterday against  worshipers in the Ibrahimi Mosque in the occupied city of Hebron.    The prime minister reviewed all dimensions of the criminal  act and the Arab, Islamic, and international reactions as well  as the impact of this incident on the peace process. He also  reviewed the measures adopted by the Jordanian Government on the  local, Arab, and international levels in view of the magnitude  of the tragedy in the Ibrahimi Mosque, indicating that this  incident conflicts with all human, religious, spiritual, and  ethical values. Dr. al-Majali explained the urgent contacts the  Jordanian Government held with all concerned parties.    The minister of state for foreign affairs briefed the  Council  of Ministers on his summoning of the ambassadors of the Security  Council permanent member states and the Greek and Indonesian  ambassadors in their capacity as chairmen of the EEC and the  Nonaligned Movement respectively. He communicated to the envoys  the Jordanian Government's denunciation of this ugly inhuman  crime and demanded their countries shoulder their responsibility  toward protecting the Palestinian people in the occupied Arab  territories, providing security to them, and forcing Israel to  abide by the UN resolutions, withdraw from the occupied Arab  territories, and dismantle the Israeli settlements as guarantees  for the continuation of the peace process and the establishment  of a just, permanent, and comprehensive peace as aspired by the  peoples of the region.    The Council of Ministers announced a three-day mourning in  the kingdom in condemnation of the ugly crime. Flags will fly  at half mast over the ministries and both the official and  popular departments. The government decided to suspend work  today for two hours from 1200 to 1400 in solidarity with the  Palestinian people in the occupied Arab territories. The  Council of Ministers also decided to offer donations to the  martyrs' families to alleviate their suffering as a show of  solidarity with them at this sorrowful time. The ministers also  decided to make personal donations.    The Council of Ministers decided to form a higher national  committee to supervise the collection of donations to the  martyrs' families and the wounded. It will be chaired by the  Chief Justice and consist of the secretary general of the Awqaf  and Islamic Affairs Ministry, the secretary general of the  Social Development Ministry, the director general of the  Palestinian Affairs Department at the Foreign Ministry, the  chairman of the Welfare Societies Union, a representative from  the Chamber of Commerce, and another from the Chamber of  Industry. It was also decided to form committees to collect  donations in all Jordanian governorates. These will be chaired  by the administrative officers. Medical aid and urgent  assistance will be extended to the wounded. Medicine and  medical supplies will be sent to all West Bank hospitals. The  Council also decided to pursue contacts with sisterly and  friendly states in order to adopt the necessary measures to  prevent the recurrence of such ugly crimes and intensify  diplomatic efforts to guarantee the Israeli withdrawal so that  the Palestinian people can exercise their legitimate rights on  their soil and achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the  Middle East.    At the conclusion of its session, the Council of Ministers  issued the following statement:    The Council of Ministers became acquainted with the news of  the Jewish settlers' sinful criminal attack on defenseless  worshipers in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron during the dawn  prayers--an attack which resulted in the martyrdom and injury of  a large number of worshipers. The Council of Ministers  expresses its profound denunciation and vehement condemnation of  this terrible massacre. This massacre, unprecedented in  savageness, targeted the innocent worshipers in this blessed  month and in one of the holiest shrines. It was a continuation  of a chain of inhuman attacks and violations targeting the  Palestinian people. Jordan has long warned against the grave  consequences of such attacks and violations on security,  stability, and the peace process.    Israel must bear full responsibility for this action, put an  end to all kinds and forms of terrorist acts, particularly those  perpetrated by the Jewish settlers, disarm the settlers, remove  settlements, and secure the protection of Palestinians in the  occupied territories. The Council of Ministers also appeals to  the international community and both world and humanitarian  bodies to shoulder their responsibilities and prevent such  incidents by guaranteeing the protection of the Palestinian  people, securing their legitimate rights, and seeking a just and  comprehensive settlement that ends the conflict and guarantees  Israel's withdrawal from all the Palestinian and Arab  territories, headed by holy Jerusalem.    The Council of Ministers, while extending deepest sympathy  and condolences to the patient and steadfast kinsfolk and  brothers in Hebron and the occupied territories and to the  martyrs' families, stresses the solidarity of Jordan--king,  government, and people-- with them in confronting such measures  and violations. It stresses that it stands by their side in  their just and legitimate struggle. The occurrence of such  incidents requires us to unify efforts, close ranks, overcome  Arab differences, and realize a unified Arab position based on  pan-Arab constants and capable of advancing the peace process in  order to achieve a just and lasting peace that will return  rights to their owners and that is acceptable to future  generations.    The Council of Ministers, while addressing the sons of the  one Jordanian family, who were distressed by this serious  incident, hopes that this will be an occasion for further  cohesion and national unity in order to confront challenges and  deal with them with wisdom, reflection, and reason.</p>

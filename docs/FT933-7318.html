			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Government promises tough action on jails and deficit THE GOVERNMENT yesterday sought to lay the groundwork for a political recovery in the autumn by promising tough action on law and order and the budget deficit. As Mr John Major, the prime minister, began a holiday in Portugal, ministers moved to recapt-ure the political agenda from the government's rightwing critics. The most dramatic initiative came from Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, who plans to make life harder for prisoners in British jails. The proposals, which outraged prison reformers, are intended to underline the government's determination to regain the initiative on law and order issues. Ministers are keenly aware that fear of rising crime was a strong factor in the two recent Conservative by-election defeats. Mr Howard is also vulnerable to rightwing claims that he has been out-manoeuvred by Mr Tony Blair, Labour's home affairs spokesman, who has spoken strongly of the impact of crime on voters. The proposals were well received by many rightwing Conservatives. Sir Ivan Lawrence, chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, said the prison system had to be 'frightening' enough to deter potential offenders. 'The public are fed up with hearing stories of prisoners not being tasked sufficiently, being released earlier than the public would think proper, and enjoying sports and home life,' he said. Other rightwingers dissented, suggesting that Mr Howard may need to do more to ensure a trouble-free conference. Sir Teddy Taylor said prisons were already sufficiently tough. On government economic policy, Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, sought to undermine rightwing critics, by repeating pledges to reduce the Pounds 50bn budget deficit. Interviewed on Breakfast with Frost on BBC television, Mr Portillo played down rightwing calls for big public spending cuts, and refused to rule out tax increases in the Budget. 'Some of the people who are making these criticisms fear that we are going to let up on our efforts in controlling public spending. We are not going to do that,' he said.

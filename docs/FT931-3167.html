			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Widespread anger as VAT is levied on home fuel bills THE much-feared increase in value added tax on Britain's wide range of zero-rated items was limited to a delayed increase in household power bills. VAT will be introduced on domestic fuel and power at an 8 per cent rate from April 1994 and at the full 17.5 per cent from April 1995. Mr Norman Lamont used environmental arguments to justify the new levy but was bitterly attacked for doing so by the opposition, consumer and poverty action groups. The change takes the UK into line with other European countries, all of which, except Ireland, levy VAT on fuel bills. Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, accused Mr Lamont of 'endangering the lives of many elderly people'. British Gas, which has cut domestic gas prices by 20 per cent since it was privatised in 1986, said its customers would be 'disappointed' at the VAT burden. But it had schemes which could help people with difficulty paying their bills, it said. Mr Lamont said levying VAT on domestic fuel bills would encourage greater energy efficiency in every household, helping the UK to achieve targets set in the world environmental conference in Rio de Janeiro last year. Electricity and gas industry analysts, however, said that the changes would have only a limited impact on company profits because demand for household fuel and power, seen as a basic necessity, is relatively inelastic. Energy shares might fall, nevertheless, on sentiment, they said. The measure would raise Pounds 950m in 1994-95, Pounds 2.3bn in 1995-96 and Pounds 3bn a year thereafter. Social security benefits would rise automatically to reflect the price effect of this change, the chancellor said. The government recognised that the change would cause difficulties for those on low incomes and would take this into account when income-related benefits rose next year. The average household spends about Pounds 300 on electricity and Pounds 300 on gas. Help the Aged said the average single-household elderly person spent Pounds 8.50 a week on fuel and this would rise by Pounds 1.50. State pension and income support should rise in line, it said. The Gas Consumers' Council said the imposition of VAT on fuel bills was a 'punitive tax'. It said it wanted the government to make grants available for energy efficiency improvements to help offset the burden of higher fuel costs.</p>

			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Israel and the PLO: Jordan close to deal on talks agenda JORDAN is expected today to conclude an 'agenda' or framework for discussion with Israel. Jordanian officials have stressed that the document is not a peace agreement but a list of agreed subjects to be tackled in negotiations. Jordan's government acknowledges that the agenda has been ready for endorsement for nearly a year. But its announcement was delayed until the Palestinians achieved a breakthrough. The framework is based on Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 and includes water rights, Palestinian refugees and displaced persons, disputed land borders, and security issues. Water has become a pressing issue in Jordan which faces difficulties with its rapidly expanding population. Accusations that Israel is 'stealing' water have become customary and the kingdom will be pressing to regain its share from the Jordan river basin. Jordanian officials said they sought a settlement based on one mediated by Mr Eric Johnston, a special envoy of President Eisenhower, between 1953 and 1955. This allocated a 3 per cent share of the Jordan river basin to Lebanon, 10 per cent to Syria (which never signed the agreement), 31 per cent to Israel and 56 per cent to Jordan. Although the Johnston plan may be a basis for discussion, officials in Amman concede that demographic changes since the 1950s will probably lead to a re-assessment of water needs. The question of refugees and displaced persons has taken on new impetus now that Israel has agreed to limited Palestinian autonomy. Mr Adbul Salam al-Majali, Jordan's prime minister, recently said that the PLO-Israeli accord, and Jordan's agenda, would entail the repatriation of 246,000 Palestinian displaced persons who entered Jordan in 1967. He said another 3,000 Palestinians who had left the occupied territories since 1968 should also be reunited. Publicly, government officials say that Jordan will push for the full rights of return of all the 1.1m registered displaced persons in the kingdom. But Israel is unlikely to accept the return of nearly 300,000 refugees who fled their homes during the 1948 Palestine war. Jordan may thus seek some kind of compensation. The agenda also provides for the first Israeli recognition of Jordanian claims to land held by Israel. This includes a strategic strip of land in the north which contains the source of the Yarmouk river, and territories in Wadi Araba which lie between the southern tip of the Dead Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba. Jordan supports the idea of free trade with the West Bank and Gaza Strip, but Israel is calling for restrictions on Jordanian exports which might enter the Israeli market. Jordanian officials say they do not expect negotiations to lead rapidly to a full peace treaty</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Belgian Banking and Finance (3): Belfox thrives in the gentleman's club - Backed by the old bourse, the new futures and options market has proved itself The majestic Brussels stock exchange building, which dates from 1873, is home to two very different institutions. Most of the 20,000 sq m in the centre of Belgium's capital is used by the venerable stock exchange. Mr Henri Servais, its dapper, bow tie-wearing new president, is under no illusions about the task which faces him. 'The stock exchange is still an old gentleman's club,' he says. 'It's very difficult to get them to accept changes and challenges.' Sharing the premises - with a meagre 200 sq m or so - is Belfox, the country's fledgling futures and options market. Since its launch two years ago it has had to face a series of changes and challenges, ranging from computer breakdown to debilitating lack of volume and liquidity. Now, Mr Jos Schmitt, Belfox general manager, says the exchange has emerged as one of Europe's strongest, most efficient and least costly futures and options markets. As proof, Belfox has just announced that it reached its profit target for 1993 by the end of September. That does not mean that the exchange is growing complacent. As part of a new marketing drive, Mr Schmitt and his colleagues expect to have delivered nearly 200 presentations all round Belgium by the end of the year, explaining, in particular, how stock options work. Belfox has added a series of options on other stocks to its original limited choice and continues to expand. The interest of Belgium's sophisticated private investors is heartening for the Belfox management, but much more encouraging has been this year's spectacular recovery of professional trade in futures. The future on the benchmark Belgian government bond (BGB) was supposed to be one of the central planks of Belfox's success, but by August last year trade was so thin that a 'gentleman's agreement' had to be arranged between 15 financial institutions to underpin the contract. Happily for Belfox, when the agreement expired in January, the BGB future continued to flourish, benefiting, together with the future offered on the three-month Belgian interbank offered rate (Bibor), from an unusually turbulent year for the Belgian government and currency. 'Turmoil is very good for us,' points out Mr Schmitt, 'not so much for the volume itself, but because these periods make people try to use our contracts.' Belfox has also experienced particular success with its option on the Bel-20 index of most heavily traded stocks. The exchange had anticipated that some 500 contracts would be traded daily, and hoped for 1,000 a day. In fact, volume has started to average 2,000 contracts a day, and is regularly breaking its own daily records. A Bel-20 future has just been added to Belfox's list of products. The stock exchange has also caught the trend for new investment products, listing warrants on the Bel-20, and offering professional investors an easy way of hedging their risks, by promoting 'Belix', a basket of Bel-20 stocks, weighted in the same way as the index itself. As yet there is no open rivalry between landlord and tenant. After all, Belfox would never have existed without the backing of the bourse itself. But Mr Servais says the bourse is watching carefully to ensure that its products do not overlap with those of Belfox - and vice versa. It would be understandable if the stock exchange were a little envious of Belfox's apparent success. The bourse has always been plagued by lack of volume and liquidity, and although this year's 25 per cent increase in share values to record levels looks impressive, Brussels is still underperforming its main European rivals. Mr Servais knows that the bourse has a lot more to lose than Belfox, and he is acutely conscious of the challenges ahead. He is warning his colleagues on the stock exchange council, and on other European stock exchanges, of the dangers of complacency in the face of European legislation which could crack open the gentleman's club. The investment services directive - which comes into force in 1996 - will end the cosy situation in which most investment in Belgian stocks is funnelled through the 80 members of the bourse. A large proportion of business in the most heavily traded shares is already handled by London-based Seaq International, but Mr Servais says that from 1996 such new 'regulated markets' based on telephone trading will be even better placed to win big investment business away from Belgian firms. Mr Servais is convinced that there will always be a need for 'traditional' continental-style stock exchanges, particularly as a safety net during difficult trading periods. His problem is persuading his fellow brokers that the threat is real, and that action must be taken. 'We need to be able to offer an excellent service, at a low price, or we will disappear in favour of other regulated markets,' he warns. With the 1996 deadline in mind, the stock exchange is trying to reform itself. For example, Mr Servais is fighting internal opposition to linking up the exchange's trading and clearing computer systems. At the same time, the stock exchange is pursuing limited deregulation of commissions, which it believes will make large trades cheaper, while avoiding an increase in the cost of small transactions. The finance ministry is under pressure to remove the tax on transactions by foreign investors, and Mr Servais is examining ways in which to diffuse stock exchange prices more efficiently to the public: one possibility is a formal link with one of Belgium's financial newspapers. Belfox, meanwhile, is also introducing changes to widen its appeal: foreign banks and brokers will be allowed to participate directly in the futures and options market; the fee structure will be relaxed between members of Belfox; and the definition of Belfox products will be formally widened to allow new instruments to be traded. In spite of the growing pressure from rival markets, both Mr Schmitt and Mr Servais are confident that they can attract new investors, if preparations for a new era of liberalised investment are made now. To illustrate the point, Mr Servais brandishes a recent report showing that US fund managers increased their investments overseas by Dollars 46bn in the first half of 1993 to nearly Dollars 200bn. Brussels' market capitalisation may represent only 0.7 per cent of world stock market capitalisation, but, as Mr Servais points out, eyes gleaming, a 0.7 per cent share of that US overseas investment would account for about a third of the bourse's turnover.</p>

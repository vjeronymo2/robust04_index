			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Kleinwort sees financing openings in China POWER generation projects for energy-starved China present almost boundless opportunities for creative financing according to Mr Robin Fox, vice-chairman of Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank. Mr Fox, who was a guest speaker in Beijing at a Sino-British commercialisation and capital project financing seminar, said 'build-operate-transfer' (BOT) deals would help China overcome an acute shortfall of financing available from traditional sources such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. BOT schemes - under which infrastructure projects are built, operated and paid for by a promoter for an agreed period before being transferred to government ownership - have already been pioneered in China by Mr Gordon Wu, the Hong Kong businessman who heads property development group Hopewell Holdings. He has built a power station in southern Guangdong province and is in the process of building a second. China recently announced it would allow 100 per cent foreign ownership of power utilities. This is a sure sign that it is desperate to engage foreign capital in efforts to overcome chronic energy shortages that are proving a drag on economic growth that neared 13 per cent last year. China is circulating a list of 28 power projects totalling 45,000 megawatts that it hopes to begin work on in the next three years, finance permitting. This, Mr Fox believes, is where opportunities lie for financial intermediaries. 'World Bank, Asian Development Bank and other international agencies will be fully involved, but it is likely they can only meet a limited proportion of the finance requirements,' he said. 'China has already moved quickly to accept an increased reliance on market forces and significantly increased private sector participation.' Mr Fox said BOT schemes could also be used for other infrastructure development such as toll-roads, ports, bridges and airports, but these were trickier in terms of securing a guaranteed return on investment to satisfy financial backers. Power stations, on the other hand, were more easily geared to recouping outlays from tariffs paid by consumers, Mr Fox said. 'A power purchase contract can guarantee the revenue stream for a power station project,' he observed. 'But it is clearly less practical to conclude contracts with users of a toll road or passenger rail system.'</p>

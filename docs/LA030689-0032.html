			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGEL NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> BLYLEVEN LOSES A REAL LAUGHER, 5-1  </P> <P> As the team buses weaved their way out of downtown Yuma Sunday afternoon,  embarking on the 200-mile trek back to Mesa, the Angel question of the hour was  . . .  </P> <P>  Where's the beef?  </P> <P> More than a few Angel players had to wonder when they unwrapped their postgame  sandwiches, expecting the succulent steak they signed up for earlier, only to  find meager ham and cheese staring back at them.  </P> <P> Oh, that Bert Blyleven.  </P> <P> Throwing out the first major prank of the spring, Blyleven posted a clubhouse  sign-up sheet Sunday morning bearing the heading: Steak Sandwiches for Bus Ride  To Mesa. Underneath was a column for players' names and a column for number of  sandwiches.  </P> <P> The first name of the sheet belonged to Blyleven, along with an order: "medium,  one, w/mayo."  </P> <P> Minutes later, 18 other names and orders accompanied it.  </P> <P> Eighteen Angels were suckered -- hook, line and sinker.  </P> <P> It's an old gag, Blyleven confided to reporters after pitching three innings in  the Angels' 5-1 loss to the San Diego Padres, but it always seems to work on a  new team.  </P> <P> "Every club I've been on has done that during spring training, on the first  long bus trip," Blyleven said. "You always get the young kids.  </P> <P> "They say, 'Steak sandwiches? Really?' And you tell them, 'Oh, yes, son, you're  in the big leagues, now. Steaks. First class.' "  </P> <P> But even a few Angel veterans bit -- Jack Howell, Greg Minton, Dick Schofield,  Devon White -- which pleased Blyleven no end.  </P> <P> "They tell me Minton was sitting there for five minutes, trying to figure out  what he wanted on it," Blyleven gleefully reported.  </P> <P> The conversation eventually turned to meatier matters, such as Blyleven's  spring debut, in which he allowed three runs on six hits and wound up the  losing pitcher.  </P> <P> The smile evaporated from Blyleven's face.  </P> <P> "Nobody likes to go out there and get hit," Blyleven said. "I don't like to  give up any . . . runs. It ticks me off.  </P> <P> "I wish I could computerize myself. The program would say: No runs. But I'm not  a computer. If I was, I'd be a lot happier."  </P> <P> Blyleven kept away from his calling card -- the home-run pitch -- but was  squibbed and dribbled to defeat.  </P> <P> In the first inning, Tony Gwynn reached base on an error by Howell and scored  on an infield single by John Kruk. In the third inning, another infield single  moved Tim Flannery into scoring position for Carmelo Martinez, who drove him in  with a double to left.  </P> <P> "I thought Blyleven threw real well," Angel Manager Doug Rader said. "Schoey  (shortstop Dick Schofield) let one ball go through and there were some other  squibble balls that went through.  </P> <P> "But his velocity was OK. I thought he threw well."  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Sunday's loss completed a three-game Yuma sweep for the Angels, which, counting  exhibition games, extends the club's losing streak there to 15 straight. Since  last Sept. 18, Angel managers have posted these records: Cookie Rojas, 0-4;  Moose Stubing, 0-8; Doug Rader, 0-3. It's been an arid stretch, but Rader isn't  worried -- yet. "I doubt too many people will remember this game two weeks from  now," he said. "I just don't want it to become a trend. I don't want losing to  be the expected, rather than the unusual."  </P> <P> This Wasn't The Idea: The list of injured Angels left behind in Mesa this  weekend grew larger by the time returned to camp Sunday night. Held back  because he wasn't scheduled to pitch in Yuma, Dan Petry developed a stiff right  shoulder during Saturday workouts and was scratched from today's game against  the Chicago Cubs. Dave Concepcion, kept behind in order to work out at  shortstop, also hurt himself, coming up with a sore hamstring and a tight lower  back. The Angels don't regard either injury as serious but Petry's spring debut  has been pushed back to Friday. Non-roster pitcher Gary Buckels will replace  Petry today.  </P></p>

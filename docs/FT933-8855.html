			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Jobless total rises in north and falls further in south THE SMALL seasonally adjusted rise in unemployment last month was concentrated in Scotland and the north of England, while the south saw another fall. The tiny 200 increase in the number of people out of work and claiming benefit was the first for six months and led some economists to suggest that recent drops in unemployment reflected a temporary reversal from the large job losses at the end of last year. The unemployment rate remains highest in Northern Ireland, where it is 14 per cent of the workforce, and in the north and the south-east including Greater London, where it is 12.2 per cent and 11.6 per cent respectively. Unemployment tends to rise in July as school leavers enter the job market, and the Department of Employment said it could not totally adjust for the big flows. It believes that the basic trend in the jobless total is downwards, in spite of the latest small increase. The figures contained some encouraging indicators, including a strong rise in vacancies - generally a precursor to falls in unemployment - and a rise in manufacturing employment. The stock of vacancies at Jobcentres - about one third of all vacancies in the economy - rose by 7,900 in July to reach their highest level for more than two years. Over the three months to July, seasonally adjusted vacancies rose on average by 1,400 per month. Latest figures show that while unemployment was falling earlier this year, the size of the workforce also declined. The workforce in employment was 24,882,000 in March, 61,000 fewer than in the previous quarter. Employment over the year to March fell by 744,000. However, manufacturing employment increased by 16,000 in June after falling 6,000 in May, the sharpest rise for six years. Manufacturing employment has risen for two consecutive quarters, but fell 207,000 over the year to June. The numbers of those unemployed for more than six months fell in the quarter ending July by 18,000, the first drop in the long-term unemployed for 2 1/2 years. Those jobless for more than a year rose by 6,000 in the latest quarter, the smallest quarterly rise for almost three years. The number of people joining the count last month was 438,000, some 10,000 fewer than in July last year.</p>

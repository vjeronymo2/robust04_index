			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Virgin and BA renew efforts to end dispute BRITISH AIRWAYS and Virgin Atlantic Airways have restarted talks aimed at settling the 'dirty tricks' dispute. Lawyers from the two companies met last week at BA's instigation, Virgin said yesterday. They revised the draft agreement over which the two companies had failed to agree in March. The amended version of the agreement is understood to have been sent to BA, which last night would not comment. Virgin does not plan to postpone the start of court proceedings against BA over compensation for damage done to its business by the 'dirty tricks' campaign. The first of the writs could be issued as soon as the start of May, although the fresh initiative raises the possibility that the two sides might conclude their long-running row without the need for further legal action. The 'dirty tricks' campaign was designed to undermine Virgin's business. It led to BA apologising in the High Court in January for its behaviour and paying Pounds 610,000 in libel damages. The two companies then began discussing compensation for the commercial damage done to Virgin. The draft agreement would have seen BA pay Pounds 9m compensation to Virgin. The talks foundered on a clause limiting discussion of the case. BA said it had asked for events not to be 'raked over' but Virgin said it would have been 'gagged' by the clause. Virgin abandoned the talks on March 19 threatening to produce new evidence against BA in the courts.</p>

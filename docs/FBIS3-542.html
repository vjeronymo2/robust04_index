			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lieutenant General Mateus Ngonhamo of the Mozambique  National Resistance [Renamo] has reiterated that if a number of  difficulties -- particularly shortages of funds -- persist, the  program for the formation of the new single Mozambican army will  be seriously delayed, jeopardizing the multiparty elections  scheduled for October. Ngonhamo has accused the government of  not making available necessary funds for the formation of the  various components of the new army, which will consist of  government and Renamo soldiers.    [Begin Ngonhamo recording] We should not forget this program  is facing serious financial problems. I am concerned by the  government's slowness in dealing with our financial  difficulties. We are tired of this slowness. It leads us to  believe that there are people who do not want the new army to  operate before elections are held in the country. If this  situation persists, it will seriously affect the formation  process, hindering the deployment of the army units in strategic  areas. If the difficulties persist, it will not be possible to  form the new army before the elections. It seems that the  government has been alleging shortages of funds to deal with  these issues, but the truth is that in this way it will not be  possible to form the new army before the elections, as  stipulated in the accord. We have two armies in Mozambique, and  all their expenses would be included in the budget to be  allocated to the Mozambique Armed Forces. We are facing serious  financial problems, which include the instructors in Dondo  District. How will it be when we have 2,500 infantry troops and  other groups, such as the ones training in Nacala and Catembe in  Maputo? What will happen? This situation will create a problem  that only the government will be blamed for later on.    We held a three-hour meeting in Dondo recently to find the  solution to these issues, but the government seems to be  allergic when it concerns money. No one wants to assume the  responsibility. Everyone is pointing fingers at the others, and  important and urgent decisions are not being made. Since the  country is structured and has a government, we appeal to his  excellency, President Joaquim Alberto Chissano, Mozambican head  of state, to intervene so that the funds for the training  program are released. We also appeal to all leaders of  political parties to assist us, not financially, but in  discussions with the government. If the agreement is not  fulfilled, elections in the country will be seriously affected.  [end recording]</p>

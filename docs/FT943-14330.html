			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Britain in push for better relations with Beijing Mr Alastair Goodlad, a UK Foreign Office minister, arrived in Beijing yesterday for the start of a six-day visit marking the start of a concerted effort by Britain to improve its relations with China. During his stay, to take in Shanghai and Guangzhou, Mr Goodlad will meet Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, and senior government officials responsible for China's relations with western Europe and Hong Kong. He said on arrival in Beijing that Sino-British relations were good and 'will be getting better'. He is the most senior British politician to visit Peking since Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, went there a year ago. Mr Goodlad is expected to tell his Chinese hosts the UK wants links put on a more normal footing. The two countries are permanent members of the UN Security Council and share common interests in free trade. UK officials say the visit is not a negotiating session; they describe it as a chance to exchange views on a range of topics, which may include the safety of the Korean Peninsula after North Korean President Kim Il-sung's death. Pressure is growing on Foreign Office ministers to recognise that, while the UK has a responsibility for Hong Kong, its bilateral relations with China will command centre-stage after the 1997 handover of the colony. The UK government is under pressure from a restive business community which believes British business is losing out in China because of the government's stance on democracy in Hong Kong. A high-level business mission plans to visit China this autumn to improve commercial ties. There has been evidence that China's hostility to Hong Kong's political development has cooled to the extent where Beijing will let large-scale infrastructure projects progress. But Britain's decision to press on with Governor Chris Patten's plans for greater democracy continues to anger Chinese leaders. Last week Mr Jiang Zemin, state president, said that while China would work for a smooth transfer of power in Hong Kong, Britain could not be trusted. Advisers to China in Hong Kong have warned that while Beijing may be prepared to work with Britain on Hong Kong's transfer, relations would remain cool for many years to come. A Foreign Office official said Mr Goodlad's trip would be a start to 'getting the relationship back on track'. The minister will spend next Wednesday in Hong Kong.</p>

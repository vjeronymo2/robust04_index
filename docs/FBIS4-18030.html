			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Mironov report: "Lubyanka Opens New Doors"] </F>   [Text] The Public Relations Center of the Federal  Counterintelligence Service [FCS] is going to move to a new  office, although within the same well-known building the service  inherited from the NKVD-KGB-Security Ministry. The move has  been prompted by an increase in the press group personnel and,  therefore, the need to improve their working conditions. The  specific location of the center's new office has not been  disclosed yet, but it is known that its staffers will have  spacious rooms and a separate entrance, something that will ease  access to the bulwark of counterintelligence for journalists and  other interested citizens. To whom it may concern: the center's  telephone numbers will not change.</p>

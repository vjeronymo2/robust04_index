			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marina Loboda, VLADIVOSTOK: "One Hundred Fifty </F> Candidates Nominated to Kray Duma"]    [Text] Lists of contenders for seats in the  representative organ of authority in the kray have been compiled  in the kray's electoral commission.    According to preliminary data, 150 Maritime Kray residents  are contending for 39 seats (on the average, 3.85 persons per  seat). Of these, 129 are men and 21 are women.    The greatest political activity was noted in the 14th  Electoral District (Frunzenskiy Rayon of the city of  Vladivostok). Eight contenders were nominated here, which is  explained by the considerable size of the district--more than  57,000 persons.    The minimal possible number of contenders was nominated in  nine districts--two persons each, which could be an indication  of the low interest in politics among the population, as well as  an indicator of the serious approach of the citizens to the  evaluation of their political data.    An overwhelming majority of the contenders are managerial  workers, and an increased interest in politics has been noted  among doctors. Given a closer examination of the list, one could  find in it: metal workers--one, lathe workers--one, and  sailors--one.    On the other hand, 37 former people's deputies decided to  take this path once again. Among them--six former chairmen of  soviets at all levels.    No less active were the presently functioning authoritative  structures: 15 heads of administration of rayons and cities of  the kray are tying their future fate to the kray duma. The  greatest activity here was displayed by officials of the kray  center: Six representatives of the city administration and six  from the kray administration intend to expand their  authoritative powers at the expense of duma seats. It is  impossible not to note the fact of the inclusion in the  political campaign of A. Pavlov, deputy governor of the kray,  who was on the point of receding into the shadows.    The Zvezda plant took first place among the enterprises of  the kray. Right off there were four contenders for a seat in the  duma--is this not conversion?</p>

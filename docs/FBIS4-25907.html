			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Carter: Time Has Come for Overall U.S.-DPRK Relations"] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 16 (XINHUA) -- It's time for the  United States and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  (DPRK) to establish a comprehensive relationship, said former  U.S. President Jimmy Carter here on Wednesday [16 June].    Speaking at a dinner in his honor, he said both nations  should prepare for overall bilateral relations, which should  include friendship, mutual understanding, trade and personnel  exchange.    On the vital nuclear issue on the peninsula, he noted that  unfortunately this problem has caused great misunderstanding  between the two nations, and expressed the hope that the dispute  can be solved through joint efforts.    As soon as a solution to this issue is found, other problems  can also be solved, he said.    Carter added that he and the U.S. leaders are confident that  a peaceful unification of the Korean peninsula can be achieved.    Kim Yong-nam, vice premier and foreign minister of the DPRK,  said that it is the common desire of both nations and their  people that bilateral relations will be normalized one day.    Kim pointed out that if the U.S. respects the DPRK's  sovereignty and treats it justly, a perfect solution to the  nuclear issue will certainly be found.    This solution will be conducive to peace in Asia and  throughout the world as well, he added.    Carter passed through the truce village of Panmunjon and  arrived here Wednesday morning on a four-day private visit to  the DPRK for possible mediation of the dispute over Pyongyang's  suspected nuclear weapons program. He is expected to meet with  the DPRK's leader Kim Il-song.    Carter met with South Korean President Kim Yong-sam and  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu before arriving here.</p>

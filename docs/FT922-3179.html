			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Britain urges EC to pull back over frontier row MR Kenneth Clarke, the British home secretary, yesterday urged his EC counterparts not to make a crisis out of the UK's refusal to remove frontier checks on EC citizens. The European Commission last month levelled the threat of legal action at Britain and any other EC member which did not abolish all controls by January 1. But Mr Clarke told fellow-interior ministers at a two-day meeting in Lisbon they should not elevate the border controls issue into a 'legal battle' - especially at a time when the Danish vote against Maastricht had raised much larger problems for the Community. 'I don't believe you can create the European Community on the basis of legalisms,' he said after yesterday's session on immigration. Britain is alone in actively wanting to retain controls, arguing that they are essential if non-EC travellers are to be properly monitored. Other countries such as Denmark and Ireland also have difficulties because of existing passport unions with the Nordic states and the UK. After talking yesterday to Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC's internal market commissioner, Mr Clarke said he thought the issue would be resolved through political discussions during the British presidency which begins next month. However, he did not say how a compromise might be reached, and reiterated that Britain did not see January 1 as a firm deadline for lifting controls. 'We don't think we are under any obligation about lifting border controls, but we are quite happy to minimise inconvenience for EC travellers,' he said. 'We are not going to compromise our system of immigration controls.' Only Greece, Portugal and Luxembourg seem to back the Commission's legal approach wholeheartedly. Most other countries recognise there are practical difficulties in applying the Brussels' hard-line interpretation of the 1986 Single European Act, which defines the internal market as 'an area without internal frontiers'. Portugal - which holds the EC presidency - was yesterday trying to persuade Spain to sign a convention strengthening the Community's external frontier. The Spanish have been blocking the convention for more than a year because of the continuing dispute with the UK over how Gibraltar should be treated.</p>

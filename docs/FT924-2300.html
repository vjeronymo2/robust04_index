			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Bonfire of Brussels laws fails to catch light - Subsidiarity JUST before the Edinburgh summit, a European Commission official said he expected the EC would be able to agree 'a text sufficiently meaningless to everyone' on subsidiarity, to get through the artificially pumped-up debate on how to divide power between the Community and the member states. He was broadly right. The conclusions on 'subsidiarity' are modest. There will be no rolling back of Community activity and the Commission retains its sole right to propose legislation. Instead, there will be a greater onus on the Commission, on national ministers, and on Euro-MPs to demonstrate that action at EC level is in response to real needs in the member states. The European institutions will have to show that their supranational plans have added value for EC members, and that the means required to implement them are proportional to the desired end. They will also have to ensure the widest possible scope for national decision-making and to consult more broadly before proceeding, through means such as green papers. To open up decision-making to greater public scrutiny, important policy debates and 'major new legislative proposals' will be televised for the press. But, as now, the real negotiating process will still be shielded from view. The record of all formal votes in the Council of Ministers will be published, with member states explaining their decisions if they so wish. But already ministers go to great lengths to avoid embarrassing any of their number through formal votes, so this measure is unlikely to make the defence of national and vested interest more visible. For the moment, the balance of power within the 'ever-closer union' postulated by Maastricht has not changed. The bonfire of 71 items of EC law and Commission proposals sought by the UK became a damp squib. Laws will be updated, to make them less intrusive and easier to implement nationally or locally. But the Commission is withdrawing a mere score of planned measures, some so arcane that officials could not be found to explain what they were. At a later date, an 'inter-institutional accord' between the Commission, the European parliament and the Council of Ministers will make clear that all power is vested in the member states except where otherwise specified. This essentially federalist principle is implicit in both the Treaty of Rome and the Maastricht treaty. What was reaffirmed at Edinburgh was the EC's political preference for decision-making at national, and in most cases, regional, level, combined with its need for some decisions to be taken at supranational, Community level. In a word, federalism - at least as most Community members understand it.</p>

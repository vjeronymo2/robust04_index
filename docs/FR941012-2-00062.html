			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Kasse Andrews-Weller, Program Manager, Office of University and Science Education Programs, ET&hyph;32, U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585. Telephone: (202) 586&hyph;8949.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The DOE is strongly committed to increasing the public's science literacy as well as increasing the number of students interested in science and technology careers. Projects which are designed to enhance public awareness of, and to encourage all young people to consider careers in, science and technology are strongly desired. While the application must be submitted by a museum, collaborative efforts are encouraged. Such efforts by potential applicants may include: Partnerships of several small museums, of a small and large museum, or of a history museum and youth museum in collaboration with museum organizations; and cooperative enterprises which utilize the scientific and technical expertise of the DOE laboratories, industry, and the broader educational community in conjunction with a museum.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a part of DOE's effort to promote public science literacy; enhance the Nation's mathematics, science, and engineering education; and fulfill the National Education Goal of ``by the year 2000, U.S. students will be first in the world in science and mathematics achievements,'' eligibility for awards under this notice is restricted to U.S. museums which will offer informal energy-related science education. In accordance with 10 CFR 600.7(b)(1), this restriction is necessary to support established U.S. institutions which provide a valuable supplement to formal education and will enhance meeting the national education goals. While this program anticipates awarding grants only from Fiscal Year 1996 appropriations, the period of support of a grant may extend up to two years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before preparing a formal application, potential applicants are asked to submit a brief preapplication in accordance with 10 CFR 600.10(d)(2) and (3), which consists of no more than two pages of narrative describing the major project objectives and method of accomplishment to be utilized by the applicant to determine the effectiveness of the intended exhibit or media forum, collaborators, advisors, dissemination plan, work schedule, and approximate cost of the project to DOE.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the preapplication is to give the program staff the opportunity to determine the level and appropriateness of interest in the project or activity. The program staff will also look at the approach the museum is considering. Each museum will receive a written response to its preapplication. Once you have submitted a preapplication, however, you may submit a formal application, regardless of the written response to the preapplication. Telephone and telefax numbers are required to be part of the preapplication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A formal application consists of an original and seven copies, a copy of the museum's Internal Revenue Service nonprofit determination letter, and other documents as stated in the Application Guide for the Office of Energy Research Financial Assistance Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Mexican rebels break army line Armed rebels in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas announced that thousands of their troops had slipped by positions held by government soldiers and that they now occupied 38 of the state's 110 municipalities. There were no immediate reports of fighting but eyewitnesses said Indian peasants armed with rifles were blockading highways around the state and had taken over at least one town hall. Subcommandante Marcos, leader of the rebel Zapatista Army, said the move was his troops' first 'major military action' since a ceasefire declared on January 12. Government troops have controlled the standoff by encircling Zapatista territory, but the new action may complicate the situation, putting government forces in the middle of territory claimed by the Zapatistas.</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Setback for CME chief as members reject merger plan A plan to merge the two most powerful divisions of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the CME and the International Monetary Market, failed to obtain the required two-thirds majority in a membership referendum this week. The defeat was a setback for Mr Jack Sandner, the CME chairman, and the exchange's board of governors, who had recommended the merger as a way to give the IMM's bank members a broader voice in exchange governance, and to bring new blood into the CME's low-volume agricultural pits. With 90 per cent of the exchange's membership voting, 3,307 voted in favour and 2,439 against. The measure failed to win the required majority in part because of aggressive campaigning against the merger by Mr Leo Melamed, who founded the IMM more than 20 years ago, but for the past three years has not been active in CME affairs. Mr Melamed contended that a merger of the IMM and CME could bring unexpected consequences, and that there were other, less intrusive ways to give IMM membership greater representation at the exchange.</p>

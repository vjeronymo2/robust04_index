			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Engineering a path through a sea of debt: The challenge facing Eurotunnel's banks A monumental task of civil engineering was brought to a successful conclusion yesterday when the Channel tunnel was opened for freight services. However, the equally daunting financial engineering challenge faced by Eurotunnel, the Anglo-French operator of the tunnel, is yet to be achieved - and there is a growing concern among its bankers and shareholders that the company may be engulfed by its Pounds 7.7bn sea of debt. To avoid receivership or administration under UK insolvency law, the company needs to raise Pounds 1.6bn in bank debt and equity to cover interest payments and operating costs until the forecast break-even date of 1998. Of this, it would like Pounds 850m to come from a rights issue, which it needs to launch in the next 10 days before the French markets begin their usual long summer slumber. However, the issue cannot take place until Eurotunnel's 200 bank creditors have agreed to provide around Pounds 700m of new senior debt - and by yesterday they had given commitments to provide slightly more than Pounds 500m. The formal deadline for raising the bank finance was last Monday. But missing deadlines is something of a tradition among Eurotunnel's banks - in the 1990 refinancing, when Pounds 1.8bn of additional banking facilities were provided, the company avoided receivership by a whisker. As one of its main bank lenders said: 'Midnight is once again only a few seconds away.' The company's critical condition is set out in its latest set of accounts: 'Eurotunnel's existing equity and bank facilities will have been fully spent by June of this year.' So within a very few weeks, the company will have exhausted the Pounds 9.3bn in debt and equity it has raised in five principal financing exercises. Last night, Eurotunnel managed to secure the required 90 per cent majority vote of its banks in favour of the refinancing and a change in loan agreements to avoid breaches of covenants. Bankers were hopeful that commitments would by tonight have reached around Pounds 600m. 'I think we will get to something over Pounds 600m early next week,' said one of the principal bank creditors. Japanese banks, whose capital has been eroded by recession, have been the slowest to commit new money. Collectively they have provided 23 per cent of the company's existing commercial bank debt so their participation in the latest financing is vital. The four with the biggest exposure of this group - Bank of Tokyo, Industrial Bank of Japan, Long Term Credit Bank and Sanwa Bank - have at last indicated that they are likely to participate or indeed have already made a binding commitment. But even with these contributions, bankers are convinced that the Pounds 700m target cannot be met. 'The syndicate (of 200 banks) has done what it can,' said a banker. 'After all, Pounds 600m is a lot of money.' Eurotunnel's board is therefore going to face in the next few days the difficult decision of launching the rights issue in these adverse banking circumstances. With only Pounds 600m of senior debt, it would need to raise around Pounds 900m of equity. But even its preferred target of Pounds 850m in equity would be difficult to achieve - after all that is 20 per cent more than the stock market had been expecting until a week ago. 'I simply do not know whether Pounds 600m of senior debt is enough,' said a Eurotunnel director. The debt and equity elements of the refinancing are inter-dependent. The commitments to provide senior debt would be withdrawn in the event that the equity is not raised. But underwriting this substantial share issue will be extremely challenging, according to leading corporate stockbrokers. The marketing of the issue has already begun, with Sir Alastair Morton, the company's joint chairman, yesterday giving presentations to institutional investors. A fund manager expressed a widely held concern: 'Given the company has itself said that cash generated from operations will not cover interest payments until 1998 and there will not be a dividend until 2003, I don't feel at all comfortable about how to value these shares.' Mr Terry Smith, an investment analyst at Collins Stewart, has calculated that for yesterday's Eurotunnel unit price of 405p to represent an appropriate valuation of the company's financial prospects, it would need to pay dividends of almost Pounds 300m after tax in 2003 and then increase them at a compound annual rate of 9 per cent for the lifetime of the operating concession, which expires in 2052. The question for shareholders is therefore whether the company's revenues over the coming years are going to be lower than it expects. On its forecasts, revenues will have climbed to Pounds 1.3bn by 2003, from which Pounds 376m of operating costs have to be deducted and more than Pounds 600m of estimated interest costs - leaving a margin of just Pounds 300m from which to repay principal on the debt, provide for depreciation and pay the promised dividend. 'There is a tiny margin for error,' said Mr Smith. 'If revenues are lower than forecast or costs higher, the company will be facing yet another refinancing before long.' However, there is one reason for having some confidence in Eurotunnel's forecast. Its main competitors, the ferry operators, would probably be ill-advised to launch a bitter price war which puts Eurotunnel into the hands of a receiver or administrator. If forced to restructure in those conditions, Eurotunnel would obtain relief from its debt burden, making it a far more potent and aggressive competitor.  --------------------------------------------------------------------         EUROTUNNEL: ANATOMY OF AN POUNDS 11BN FUNDING EFFORT  -------------------------------------------------------------------- 1986: Pounds 46m seedcorn equity from five banks and contractors  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Pounds 206m through a share placing with institutions  -------------------------------------------------------------------- 1987: Pounds 5bn loan facility agreed with 200-bank syndicate  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Pounds 770m equity funding through public offer in UK and France  -------------------------------------------------------------------- 1990: Pounds 1.8bn additional debt from syndicate  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Pounds 300m loan from the European Investment Bank  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Pounds 650m rights issue  -------------------------------------------------------------------- 1994: Trying to raise: Pounds 700m in senior bank debt  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Pounds 850m rights issue  -------------------------------------------------------------------- The above add up to Pounds 10.32bn.

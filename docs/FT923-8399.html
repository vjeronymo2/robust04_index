			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Threat of a French summer of discontent THE threat of a summer of discontent looms in France with the dockers stepping up their industrial action by calling a national strike today and disgruntled farmers renewing their protests against the European Community's agricultural reforms, Alice Rawsthorn reports from Paris. The dock strike will be the second national stoppage at France's ports this week. The dockers have staged intermittent protests throughout the summer against new legislation which involves job losses and radical changes in their employment status. Today's stoppage has been called to protest against an incident in Dunkerque on Monday when 12 dock workers were held by police for questioning about alleged vandalism to the port over the weekend. Meanwhile French farmers yesterday stepped up their protests. More than 100 farmers occupied the agriculture ministry's regional office at Auch in the Gers region demanding the right to put their case to Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister. The demonstration broke up after Mr Beregovoy agreed to see them next Wednesday.</p>

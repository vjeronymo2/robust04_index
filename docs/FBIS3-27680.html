Sparks flew at a joint press conference given here by EU  Commissioner Leon Brittan and Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Wu  Yi, which was cut short after a heated exchange over the issue  of Hong Kong and Sino-British trade ties.    The press briefing followed the 13th meeting here of the  EU-China Joint Committee, which was co-chaired by Brittan and Wu  and focussed on the EU's support for China's re-entry to the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    Responding to comments by Wu that Britain's "unfriendly and  uncooperative" stance on Hong Kong would inevitably damage  Sino-British trade ties and economic cooperation, Brittan  stressed that the basis of EU-China relations was  non-dicrimination against separate EU member states. "Any  action that discriminated against one member state on polticial  grounds would be a very serious matter, not just for that member  state but for the European Union as a whole," Brittan said. He  declined to specify what action the EU might take should China  disrupt trade ties with Britain, but the union's main leverage  on Beijing would appear to be continued support for China's GATT  re-entry.</p>

			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RELIGIOUS BROADCASTERS ETHICS PANEL PROBING CROUCH'S TRINITY NETWORK  </P> <P> Paul F. Crouch, founder and president of Orange County-based Trinity  Broadcasting Network, is the subject of an investigation by the ethics  committee of the National Religious Broadcasters, according to Richard Bott  Sr., chairman of the committee.  </P> <P> The investigation, examining some of Crouch's business practices, could lead to  his expulsion from the voluntary organization.  </P> <P> "There have been allegations, which we are looking into," Bott said before this  week's National Religious Broadcasters convention in Washington. Other sources  in the organization confirmed this week that an inquiry is under way.  </P> <P> Bott, president of Bott Broadcasting in Independence, Mo., declined to provide  details, but according to a 17-page complaint submitted to the ethics committee  -- copies of which have been provided to The Times -- the allegations focus on  Crouch's acquisition and building of new television stations over the past 16  years.  </P> <P> The Tustin-based Trinity network has undergone spectacular growth in the past  16 years. The network and subsidiary organizations own or control more  television stations than any other single owner in the country. The network  includes 17 full-power UHF stations and more than 75 low-power stations around  the country, as well as at least 20 stations abroad.  </P> <P> The committee investigating Crouch held a secret, 14-hour committee meeting in  Los Angeles in late September, during the western regional convention of the  National Religious Broadcasters, according to one of those who attended the  session but asked not to be identified.  </P> <P> The complaint was filed by the Rev. Keith A. Houser of Dallas. Houser has been  battling Crouch for the past six years in the courts and before the Federal  Communications Commission for control of WTBY-TV, in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.  </P> <P> In his complaint to the National Religious Broadcasters, Houser repeated  charges made in a lawsuit and before the FCC alleging that Crouch unethically  took over the station, which Houser said he founded. Houser alleged that Crouch  joined with other station board members, creditors and a banker and "cut deals  with these parties without my prior knowledge and virtually started a hostile  takeover of the television station."  </P> <P> Houser also charged that the takeover was part of "the modus operandi of Paul  Crouch in the taking of several other television stations" or building or  buying new stations that undermined the audience of existing Christian  stations.  </P> <P> Houser's lawsuit over control of the Poughkeepsie station is scheduled to go to  trial soon, he said. There is no action pending before the FCC, which granted  Trinity a license to the station without reservation.  </P> <P> The Rev. Phillip A. Crouch, vice president of Trinity Broadcasting Network and  brother of Paul Crouch, denied that the organization operated in any unethical  fashion.  </P> <P> "We have certainly never wanted to hurt another organization," he said in a  telephone interview. "If we are hurting one (Christian station), we are hurting  ourselves. But we don't feel we are doing this."  </P> <P> Crouch said his brother, who was in Phoenix on Wednesday, is "a little upset at  the NRB for not coming to him first."  </P> <P> "This is something that upsets him. We're kind of worrying about their ethics,"  he said.  </P> <P> Among other charges made by Houser to the National Religious Broadcasters is  that Phillip Little, a private detective employed by Trinity Broadcasting  Network, was used to "intimidate" Trinity critics and former employees. In a  telephone interview earlier this week, Little, who is chairman of West Coast  Detectives Inc. of North Hollywood, acknowledged that he visited various people  around the country on Trinity Broadcasting Network's s behalf but said that he  never intimidated anyone.  </P> <P> Any decision the National Religious Broadcasters' ethics committee reaches may  be moot, said Paul Crouch's longtime Washington attorney, Colby M. May, who  handles the network's dealings with the FCC. He said in a telephone interview  that Crouch may quit the National Religious Broadcasters within the next two  weeks.  </P> <P> May said he has advised Crouch to quit the National Religious Broadcasters  rather than comply with new requirements that by January, 1990, boards of  directors must be controlled by individuals "other than those joined by a  family relationship, staff or employees."  </P> <P> Phillip Crouch said his brother has not yet decided about remaining in the  National Religious Broadcasters .  </P> <P> National Religious Broadcasters members must submit applications by Feb. 15 to  join the organization's new Ethics and Financial Integrity Commission. The  watchdog group, which is not the same committee that is investigating Crouch,  was established in the wake of the televangelism scandals of the past two  years, and membership in the body is mandatory to remain in the National  Religious Broadcasters organization.  </P> <P> All of Trinity Broadcasting Network's 10 boards are headed by Paul Crouch and  dominated by family members and employees.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Michael D. Shear in Washington contributed to this article.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, member of the </F> Yemeni Presidential Council, by Ahmad Birru; place and date not  given; from the "Today's Guest" program -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Birru] Your Excellency 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd  al-Ghani, member of the Yemeni Presidential Council: The Yemeni  war is in its third week. As a result of this war, northern and  southern Yemen have sustained grave losses. There are many  domestic, Arab, and international calls for dialogue. Isn't it  high time for dialogue, and is Sanaa ready for it?    ['Abd-al-Ghani] We did not want this war. This war was  imposed on Yemen by the secessionist elements in the Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP] leadership. We always supported dialogue.  We held a dialogue with the secessionist YSP leadership for nine  months. We were ready to resume dialogue, but they discontinued  this dialogue and started the fighting inside the Armed Forces.  [passage omitted]    [Birru] Both 'Ali Salim al-Bid and the YSP leadership  declared the secession of southern Yemen. As was understood  from remarks by Shaykh Zayid, president of the United Arab  Emirates [UAE], the UAE implicitly recognizes the new Yemeni  state. Shaykh Zayid said he received a telephone call from His  Excellency 'Ali Salim al-Bid. Moreover, Shaykh Zayid warned  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih that Yemeni unity cannot be  imposed by force. Do you expect recognition of the south Yemeni  state by Gulf, Arab, or foreign states?    ['Abd-al-Ghani] In fact, we do not believe the UAE has  recognized the secessionist state or the secession declaration  announced by 'Ali Salim al-Bid. The UAE has always been with  unity, particularly Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan, who supported  Yemeni unity. We do not believe any Arab or foreign state will  recognize this secession declaration announced by 'Ali Salim  al-Bid, because it is unconstitutional.    We do not want to impose unity by force, because unity was  achieved through peaceful means. The whole Yemeni people in the  southern, eastern, northern, and western governorates support  unity. Those who are imposing state authority in the southern  governorates are government forces. These forces are not from  the northern governorates, but from northern and southern  governorates. The northern governorates are not imposing unity  on the southern governorates. There is readiness for unity. As  it was achieved peacefully, it will continue so. All the Yemeni  people support unity.    [Birru] Do you hold the YSP, in its entirety, responsible  for the war, or are you ready to hold a dialogue with elements  in the YSP leadership in order to find a way out of this war?    ['Abd-al-Ghani] We do not hold the YSP responsible. This is  proven by the fact that parliamentary leaders from the YSP and  leaders of the YSP branches in various parts of the Republic  have issued statements against the secession declaration. We  are ready for a dialogue with these leaders on the best ways to  save Yemen from the war imposed on it. We are only against the  secessionist elements that started the fighting and declared the  secession.    [Birru] The YSP leaders who called for dialogue are from  northern Yemen. Have YSP leaders from southern Yemen announced  their readiness for dialogue, or are you ready for dialogue with  them?    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Yes. We do not view the YSP as a southern  or northern party. The YSP is represented throughout the  Republic, and its members in the northern governorates outnumber  those in the southern governorates. Those who issued a  statement against the secession declaration were led by brother  'Ali Salih (?'Ubad), deputy speaker of the House of  Representatives, who represents a constituency in the southern  governorates. Doing the same were approximately 15 YSP leaders  representing constituencies in the southern governorates. They  issued a statement, along with their brother members of the YSP  in the House of Representatives from some northern governorates.    The truth is that the war is not one between the north and  south, as people described it. In fact, elements in the YSP  leadership rebelled against the state. These elements are being  confronted by all citizens in the north and south. I believe  that if you sent people to the southern governorates and asked  the opinion of both the man on the street and the leaders, you  would find that all people support unity and are against both  the secession declaration and fighting, exactly like other  citizens in the Republic.

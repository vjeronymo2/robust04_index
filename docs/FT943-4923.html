			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / International Company News: Borealis cuts losses to DKr250m Borealis, the plastics joint venture set up this year by the Finnish and Norwegian state-owned oil refiners, Neste and Statoil, cut its first-half loss to DKr250m (Dollars 41m). Turnover was about DKr6.53bn. No comparable figure for 1993 was available, but Mr Svein Rennemo, Borealis' chief financial officer, said the loss last year was estimated at DKr1bn-DKr1.2bn. Mr Rennemo said cost reductions resulting from the merger, which created Europe's largest producer of polyethylene and polypropylene, played a significant part in the improved performance. Mr Rennemo cited several gains from the merger. He pointed to lower costs for head office staff, a streamlined sales force, lower research and development costs, and lower costs arising from operating the Neste and Statoil petrochemical operations at Stenungssund in Sweden as a single operation. Borealis forecast a better second half, when growing demand for plastic raw materials is expected to liftprices.</p>

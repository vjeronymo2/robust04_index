			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Agreement to end sand extraction Sand extraction at Druridge Bay on the Northumberland coast should cease within three years under an agreement announced yesterday between the county council and Northern Aggregates, a subsidiary of RMC, the concrete and cement producer. Environmentalists have fought a campaign to stop the extraction of 40,000 tonnes of sand a year which they say is causing severe erosion on the beach and dunes.</p>

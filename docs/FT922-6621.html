			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Paying price of peace dividend: David White on the battle for survival at two naval dockyards BRITAIN'S two main naval dockyards are fighting a highly politicised battle for survival. The private-sector companies which have been running the yards since 1987 believe their fate will be sealed within the next year. When the two refit yards - Devonport Royal Dockyard at Plymouth and Rosyth Royal Dockyard in Fife - were placed under private-sector management in 1987, the change was hotly contested by unions. Both yards have been through heavy redundancy programmes paid for by the government. At Devonport, with an annual turnover of about Pounds 270m, jobs have fallen from more than 11,000 to just over 5,000. Rosyth, with a Pounds 180m turnover, has cut the number of jobs from about 6,000 to 4,200. The Ministry of Defence, which still owns the facilities, guaranteed the managers a 'core programme' for refitting surface ships and submarines - about two thirds of naval work with the rest being put out to competition or carried out by the Royal Navy's maintenance yard at Portsmouth. The programme has now been substantially reduced. Fleet numbers are being cut, some vessels have been paid off early, and the latest ships need less frequent work. Devonport Management (DML), a consortium in which the main partners are Brown and Root of the US, Balfour Beatty (part of BICC) and Weir Group, says its warship refit work has been cut by 45 per cent compared with the original programme. Mr Mike Leece, managing director, thinks the whole naval industry - shipbuilding and refit - will provide no more than 11,000 to 12,000 jobs in the late 1990s compared with 30,000 in the mid 1980s. The crucial decision under consideration at the MoD is on new refuelling and refitting facilities for nuclear-powered submarines. Refitting of the UK's Polaris ballistic-missile submarines is done at Rosyth and work on nuclear-propelled 'hunter-killer' submarines is split between Rosyth and Devonport. Both DML and Babcock Thorn, the management consortium at Rosyth, believe the logical option is to concentrate this work in a single site. Cranes and lorries are already busy at the Rosyth yard on a facility known as RD57 to accommodate Trident submarines, the successors to Polaris. Plans include two dry docks and an integrated refuelling site. About Pounds 50m has already been spent, and the overall cost was originally put at Pounds 450m. DML says it could provide similar facilities for less than Pounds 200m and that the extra work would greatly increase its efficiency. Babcock Thorn is discussing a low-cost alternative to its original plan at Rosyth which it says would reduce the further spending needed there to Pounds 150m. Both yards have diversified into areas such as refurbishing rail stock and boat building, but both see their future pinned to submarine business. The MoD is due to tell them by October 5 whether it proposes to renew their contracts, which expire in April 1994. Both dockyards are next to naval bases - another area under review at the MoD. DML argues that the Navy, needing to find substantial savings in support costs, cannot sustain three bases in the south - Plymouth, Portsmouth and the smaller establishment at Portland - and that the whole complex could be at risk, affecting 10,000 jobs. Mr Leece says: 'At the end of the day one of us is going to pay the bloody peace dividend.' SIGNIFICANT delays and cost overruns in the refitting of naval vessels at the Devonport and Rosyth dockyards have been highlighted by the National Audit Office, the public spending watchdog. In a report published yesterday the audit office underlined the problems of high overhead costs and excess capacity at the yards and said the defence ministry must determine how much of the facilities it would need in the long term. The report recognises that commercial managers had improved efficiency but said there was no way of assessing the net savings achieved since the MoD handed over the running of the yards. The audit office calculates that under-utilised staff and facilities at the yards cost Pounds 53m in 1990-91. Ministry of Defence: Operation of the Royal Dockyards under Commercial Management. HMSO.

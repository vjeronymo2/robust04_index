			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor (1): Pseudo 'intellectualism' has disturbing hold over common-sense morality Sir, Many people would no doubt agree with Christopher Dunkley's comment that 'political correctness seems to have a frightening hold over more and more BBC journalism' ('Danger of overkill', June 8). What is disturbing, however, is the hold that pseudo enlightened 'intellectual' journalism has over common sense morality. Political correctness has much to answer for, not least allowing journalists such as Mr Dunkley to state that it is only 'fashion (that) dictates making love with children really is the most damaging crime of all'. Paedophiles do not 'make love' with children, they violate them physically and emotionally to satisfy their own perverted requirements. Better some 'sanctimonious' comment from Dunkley's tabloid colleagues than the arguments of a moral wolf dressed in intellectual sheep's clothing. P Hambrook, Chiltern Street, London W1</p>

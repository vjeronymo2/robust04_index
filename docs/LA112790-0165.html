			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> WIMBLEDON POSTS RECORD PROFIT  </P> <P> The Wimbledon tennis tournament made a record profit of nearly $19 million this  year despite a significant drop in attendance and expensive construction work.  </P> <P> The Lawn Tennis Assn. said today the profit was a 4.5% increase from the  previous record, set last year.  </P> <P> Wimbledon officials had said earlier this year that they were expecting a drop  in profits because safety regulations led to nearly 56,000 fewer spectators  this summer than in 1989.  </P> <P> Attendance also was down this year because of competition from televised games  of soccer's World Cup, in which the English team reached the semifinals.  </P> <P> But Wimbledon chief executive Chris Gorringe said an increase in ticket prices  and a lucrative satellite television contract helped account for the record  profit in 1990.  </P></p>

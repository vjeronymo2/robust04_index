			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The ringleaders of the Vietnamese communist puppets  mobilized 200 Vietnamese puppet soldiers on 21 January and sent  them to attack a liberated village belonging to the people and  the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] at K'daoh, on  the Kulen battlefield in Preah Vihear Province.    Aware of the plan in advance, however, the NADK and the  people were waiting for them. The NADK and the people jointly  attacked and routed them with assorted primitive and modern  weapons of every caliber. They killed a captain and seven  Vietnamese communist puppet soldiers; wounded others; and seized  two pistols, nine AK rifles, and a quantity of war materiel.  The survivors retreated in disarray. Many puppet soldiers fled  to their homes. Having been forcibly recruited, they were  afraid of being killed and did not want to fight and die for a  handful of warmongering Vietnamese communist puppets.</p>

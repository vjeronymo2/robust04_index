			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 8 (AFP) -- An American woman whipped in  Iran two weeks ago on charges of promoting prostitution is  "probably a spy", a radical newspaper charged here Sunday.    Mary Jones, 35, was picked up two weeks ago in the Shemiran  neighborhood in northern Tehran allegedly in a drunken state.  She was immediately given 80 lashes of the whip after being  found guilty in a court of "promoting corruption."    JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI daily charged however that new information  on Jones had led the authorities to believe that she was also  engaged in espionage.    She paid visits to the war front during the 1980-1988  conflict with Iraq and made "suspicious remarks" during  interrogation after her arrest," it said.    However, a revolutionary court contacted by AFP denied there  was any evidence of espionage activities against Jones, and that  she had been arrested on corruption charges only.    The U.S. interests section at the Swiss embassy in Tehran  declined to comment on the case.    The daily KEYHAN charged on Thursday that Jones, who has  been  here since 1983, came here "without identity papers and with the  aim of corrupting the young in Iran."    KEYHAN said that Jones had been ordered to leave the  country,  but a judiciary official at the court refused to disclose if she  had already been deported.    Iran banned the sale and consumption of alcoholic drinks  after the 1979 Islamic revolution which toppled the late shah.</p>

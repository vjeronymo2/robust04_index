			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Riva tumbles into Pounds 2.2m deficit Following the warning in January of a substantial loss for 1993, Riva Group, the USM-traded Lancashire-based supplier of electronic point of sale systems, yesterday announced a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 2.2m, writes Reg Vaughan. Mr Peter Giles, chairman, said the loss - which compares with a profit of Pounds 134,000 - reflected significant trading losses in Spain, Denmark and France. In view of these the balance sheet was significantly depleted. The chairman said that trading in continental Europe had been hit by the continuing recession. However, the UK operations remained profitable. Group turnover declined from Pounds 59.4m to Pounds 54m. The chairman said that liquidity remained healthy and although gearing was high, with the continued support of the banks, the depleted balance sheet was not expected to affect operations this year. As losses continued in continental Europe in the first half of the current year, Mr Giles said he expected 1994 'to be a year of rationalisation and consolidation.' In the UK the year had started in line with expectations, with turnover stable and costs generally under control, but with margin pressure on hardware sales, Mr Giles said. Borrowing costs fell to Pounds 695,000 (Pounds 879,000). Losses per share were 8.6p (0.2p earnings) and there is again no dividend.</p>

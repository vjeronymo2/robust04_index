			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: France seeks lower rate of land set-aside France believes that, if the European Union does not substantially reduce the share of arable land set aside from production next year, the EU may have to decrease exports or increase imports, officials in Paris said yesterday. Last week the French government sent the European Commission a long-promised memorandum containing the reforms on which Paris would like to see progress during the French presidency of the EU in the first half of 1995. In particular, France said it wanted to see the current 15 per cent average rate of 'set-aside' in the EU reduced 'substantially'. Otherwise, the French calculate, EU cereal stocks could fall to close to zero next year after the fall from 20m to 10m tonnes this year. 'Such a level would not be manageable,' said an agriculture ministry official. By French calculations, this year's harvest of 158m-162m tonnes, plus 5m tonnes of imports, would amount to some 10m tonnes less than the total of anticipated consumption of 140m-145m tonnes plus around 32m tonnes of exports. If stocks dropped to near zero 'either we would not be able to export as much as permitted by the Gatt or we would have to increase imports', said the official. Another French aim is to improve the competitiveness of EU agriculture to avoid Gatt-required cuts in subsidised exports. The limits to subsidising exports were illustrated in the past few days when France failed to firm up a preliminary contract to sell China up to 1m tonnes of wheat because a Brussels offer of a subsidy of Ecus 5 a tonne proved insufficient to bring the price low enough.</p>

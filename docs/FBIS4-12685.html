			<p>BFN     [Text] The mission of the international observers in Hebron  is now under way. This is the first operation of its type in  the territories occupied by Israel. Giovanni Bocco reports:    [Bocco] It was a lightning visit by the delegation of  international observers in Hebron. Two officers from the  Italian carabinieri force were also present. They spoke with  the Palestinian mayor of the city and with the Israelis about  the organizational aspects of the mandate.    There will be 35 Italian observers, but only 15 will be  permanently stationed in Hebron. After leaving the private  room, the negotiators entered the council chamber, which was  full of people. There was a handshake between the mayor, a UN  delegate, and Yitzhaq Rabin's representative. However, the  smiles did not hide the fact that there were still many things  to be decided. The two Italian delegates are Colonel Pietro  Pistolese and Major Giovanni Trullio. They come from the  Tuscagna carabinieri parachute regiment, which has already seen  action in Somalia as part of the Ibis mission. Here is the head  of the Italian delegation, Colonel Pistolese:    [Pistolese] This is the first contact...    [Bocco, interrupting] Have you overcome the obstacle of  security?    [Pistolese] No. For the moment there are no security  problems. We are welcomed and we hope to be good guests.    [Bocco] Will you be completely disarmed. I have heard that  this will be so?    [Pistolese] We are working on this. We are just at the  beginning of our mandate. It is premature...    [Bocco, interrupting] How do you think that this meeting has  gone?    [Pistolese] Well.    [Bocco] The 160 UN observers: 90 Norwegians, 35 Danes, and  35  Italians will have to operate in a difficult situation. Hebron  is a fortress of the Islamic fundamentalists, but four  kilometers away there is a colony of some 5,000 Jewish settlers.  Friction is the order of the day.</p>

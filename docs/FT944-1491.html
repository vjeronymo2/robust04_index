			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / People: Mining (Scotland) David Brewer, finance director of British Coal, is to become boss of Mining (Scotland), the consortium of private sector investors and unions which is the government's preferred bidder for the Scottish coalfield. Brewer's title will be operations and financial director. The present chief executive officer is Brian MacDonald, a Scottish businessman and company doctor, but it was always made clear that MacDonald would step aside and recruit a ceo from the coal industry once he had steered the consortium's bid to a successful conclusion. Brewer, 48, has been with British Coal since 1968 and has held a number of senior financial posts, as well as being involved in the privatisation process.</p>

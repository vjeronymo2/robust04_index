			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Meyer cuts jobs as profits halve MEYER International, which owns the Jewson builders' merchants chain, saw pre-tax profits tumble from Pounds 16.5m to Pounds 8.5m in the half year to September 30. This followed Pounds 2.6m of rationalisation costs as a further 400 jobs were cut. Operating profit slipped from Pounds 18.5m to Pounds 17.9m on turnover of Pounds 540.5m (Pounds 566.7m). Interest payments of Pounds 6.8m (Pounds 7m) and a lack of property profits did the rest of the damage to the pre-tax figure. One off-setting factor was the disposal of a loss-making plumbing distributor. Mr Richard Jewson, chairman, said that the devaluation had added Pounds 13m to debt translated into pounds. A deferred payment for a German company had also extended borrowings and year-end gearing was expected to rise from 40 to 50 per cent. In the UK, the group had been simplified into two divisions, Jewson and Forest Products. This continuing process might double the exceptional charge for the full year. Jewson's operating profit fell to Pounds 7.1m (Pounds 11.4m). PontMeyer in the Netherlands declined to Pounds 4.4m (Pounds 5.5m). Earnings per share fell to 6.2p (12.9p). The interim dividend is maintained at 4.2p. COMMENT As a leading light among the builders' merchants, Meyer was given the benefit of the doubt for a long time before the recovery story turned sour. Its share price has halved since August last year. Mr Jewson, who came from the heart of the business, has had to act like a new broom - clearing out past mistakes and rationalising from the branches upwards. If it were not for balance sheet worries and dividend doubt, this ought to be the low point for sentiment. Paying an uncovered final dividend may depend on whether the market looks healthy enough to restore cover in 1993-94, which is a moot point. A forecast full-year profit of Pounds 15m gives a prospective p/e of 22. Even if the final dividend is halved the prospective yield is nearly 6 per cent, which gives some support.</p>

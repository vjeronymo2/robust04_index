			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY SPOTS: ARBORETUM OFFERS A LIVELY INTRODUCTION TO THE ENVIRONMENT  </P> <P> The Environmental Education Fair, today at the Los Angeles State and County  Arboretum, may have a dry name but it is a lively convention. The point of this  ambitious annual event is to get youngsters thinking about their environment  and to teach them at an early age how to care for it.  </P> <P> Children can make solar water heaters with plastic bags and black paper. They  can touch live sea creatures in "tide pools" brought by the staff of the  Cabrillo Marine Museum. And they can visit with raccoons, owls and reptiles  from the Wildlife Waystation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Addresses Various Issues  </P> <P> More than 60 exhibits -- inside and outside Ayres Hall and in a circus tent --  will address issues of transportation, air quality and conservation in terms  that children can understand. Youngsters can participate in water experiments,  weaving and gardening. Nature games, at 9:15 a.m. and 2 p.m., will use  activities to illustrate concepts such as food webs (a complex version of the  food chain) and animal perception (blindfolding children to help them  understand how animals use other senses). There also will be walking tours of  the arboretum at 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.  </P> <P> Admission to the arboretum and fair is $3 for adults, $1.50 for ages 13 to 17  and students, and 75 cents for children ages 5 to 12. There is parking at  nearby Santa Anita Fashion Park with shuttle service to the gate. Clowns will  entertain shuttle riders with environmentally oriented games. The arboretum is  at 301 N. Baldwin Ave., Arcadia. Information: (818) 446-8251.  </P></p>

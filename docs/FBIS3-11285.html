			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The official agenda of the meeting President Menem  and U.S. Vice President Al Gore are scheduled to hold the  morning of 21 March encompasses a wide range of bilateral  issues, but it does not include the most controversial one:  U.S. pressure for the approval of a new patents law in  Argentina. Nevertheless, a high-ranking Argentine Foreign  Ministry source, who is well-versed on diplomatic rules,  explained: "The fact that the issue is not included on the  agenda does not mean it will not be discussed."    Preparations for Gore's visit included a 30-minute meeting  in  Buenos Aires between Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella and U.S.  Ambassador Cheek and a meeting in Washington between Argentine  Ambassador Raul Granillo Ocampo with the U.S. vice president's  advisory team. "Controversial issues have been exempted from  the agenda (...). The patents law issue has been rejected  because it is believed this is an excessively technical issue  and all the points have been made."    When he presented his credentials, Ambassador Cheek took the  trouble to explain that the main priority on his agenda was to  pressure for the prompt approval of a new patents law that would  specifically recognize the intellectual property of U.S.  laboratories. Moreover, representatives from Bill Clinton's  administration have threatened to include Argentina on the list  of countries that deserve to have economic sanctions imposed for  violating intellectual property.    The list of these countries will be disclosed on 30 April,  that is, one month and 10 days after Gore's arrival in Buenos  Aires. The U.S. vice president will travel to Buenos Aires to  attend a UN-sponsored world telecommunications conference. He  is scheduled to dine with Menem on Sunday [20 March] evening.  They will see each other again on 21 March, and during this  meeting the official agenda will not necessarily be respected.</p>

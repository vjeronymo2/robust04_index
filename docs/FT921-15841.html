			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Letter: No Teutonic plot on interest rates or on social charter Sir, As an Englishman living in Germany I feel obliged to take issue with John Willman's ('With Friends like Germans', January 4) intemperate comments. Certainly the Bundesbank increased interest rates recently. It did so solely to correct an overheated domestic economy and, in fact, followed the Bank of England's example of 12 to 18 months ago. Moreover, the German Bundesbank is wholly independent of German government control and it is therefore incorrect to imply that it was part of a Teutonic plot to dominate Europe. Second, what is wrong with Germany recognising the independence of Croatia and Slovenia? Almost every British newspaper and periodical that I have read has been sympathetic to these new states and certainly the Foreign Office's apparent indifference to the situation has not improved matters one iota. Finally, Social Charter. The Germans did not impose this on Europe. All EC members supported it with the exception of the UK government, which will conceivably lose the next general election as a result. S Feacey, Lohweg 24, 6050 Offenbach-Waldheim, Germany</p>

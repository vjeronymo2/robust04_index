			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: Sharp reduction in first-quarter losses at Swedbank Swedbank, the newly-merged savings bank group, reports a sharp reduction in first-quarter losses, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. Operating deficit fell to SKr864m (Dollars 118m) from SKr2.94bn after loan losses of SKr2.78bn against SKr4.63bn. The comparative figures represent one quarter of 1992 totals. A rising share of problem loans meant net interest income for the period fell 8.1 per cent to SKr2.92bn and total income dropped to SKr3.90bn from SKr4.01bn. However, a cost-cutting drive reduced operating expenses by 14 per cent to SKr1.99bn and helped the operating result before credit losses to improve to SKr1.91bn from SKr1.69bn.</p>

			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Monday Interview: Europe's timely champion - Nicolas Hayek, chairman of SMH watch company, talks to Ian Rodger It is not easy these days to champion the cause of European manufacturing of consumer products. Philips' warning last month of serious problems in its consumer electronics division comes after years of bad news from European makers of motorcycles, cameras and cars, all adding to the view that Europeans can no longer compete in these product areas with low-cost competitors from the Far East. Nicolas Hayek is in the rare position of being able to refute the Cassandras. Hayek, a Swiss consultant to European and US manufacturers such as Siemens, AEG Telefunken, Olivetti, Deere, and US Steel, since the early 1960s, masterminded the rescue of the Swiss watch industry in the 1980s. And he did it by taking on and beating the dominant Japanese competitors at their own game - attacking the low-margin, cost-sensitive mass market. For Hayek, reviving the Swiss watch industry was simply a matter of proving what he had long believed. 'No other area in the world is as rich in highly gifted people as western Europe. If we use our people well, we can always make high-quality, low-cost consumer products and make them better than people in Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea or Japan.' On the other hand, he warns: 'If we lose our know-how to make products, then we will lose our financial independence. And if you lose your financial independence, you lose every other kind of independence.' Although he grew up in Switzerland and has worked all his life there, Hayek, whose mother was Lebanese, father American, bears little resemblance to the reserved, correct businessmen normally associated with the country. He wears wrinkled, shapeless suits over ill-fitting shirts and flamboyant neckties, sports at least one watch on each wrist and puffs away at huge cigars or a pipe. Whereas many Swiss businessmen shrink from publicity, he delights in transmitting his often obscure ideas and startling opinions at the drop of a microphone. In 1981, he was called in by the Swiss banks to rescue the two most important companies in the country's cherished but fast-declining watch industry, Asuag and SSIH. These two were important not only because of their size and because they made finished watches that carried famous brand names such as Omega, Longines and Tissot, but also because they supplied large numbers of components and fully assembled watch mechanisms, or movements, for sale to other watchmakers in Switzerland and around the world. Thus, their dilatory introduction of quartz and electronic technologies in the 1970s, which enabled the more nimble Japanese makers to make huge gains in world markets, especially of high-volume, low-priced models, undermined a large part of the Swiss industry. Swiss exports of watches and watch movements crashed from a peak of 91m units in 1974 to only 43m in 1983. This pattern had been seen in other European consumer product industries, and the solution most frequently chosen was to retreat to up-market or specialised niches. Hayek, who had counselled many companies against that strategy, had his chance to prove they were wrong. At SSIH and Asuag, which he later merged into a group called SMH, the main challenge was to overcome the disadvantage of Switzerland's high wages. Hayek did it by designing watches with a drastically reduced number of components. Also, he ordered that different models should, wherever possible, use common parts. And, with the banks' support, he invested heavily in assembly automation. At first, most of this effort was concentrated on the Swatch, a line of cheap and cheerful watches introduced in the autumn of 1982 that would become one of the great marketing success stories of the 1980s. Swatches feature plastic straps and mountings in various colours. Models with new face designs, from the elegant to the outrageous, emerge every few months. At roughly Pounds 20 apiece, Swatches are accessible to all and seem to be acceptable to many. SMH has sold more than 100m Swatches since their introduction, making it the best-selling watch line in history. Perhaps as important, many of the disciplines and innovations that went into its success could be transmitted to factories making the group's up-market brands, thereby improving margins on them and freeing up funds to bolster their marketing. Also, the high production volume of movements required for Swatches yielded economies of scale that have enabled SMH in the past two years to compete profitably in world markets for movements. The result: Swiss watch and movement exports last year surpassed their 1974 peak level and SMH became one of Switzerland's most successful industrial companies with net profits of SFr252m. This year, it is set to overtake Citizen of Japan to become the world's largest producer of watches and watch movements. Hayek believes that the SMH experience is transferable to other consumer products. He says most Japanese managers do not understand how to put what he calls 'messages of emotion' in their products, which may have an image but nothing more, he claims. 'If you take Playboy magazine and see a pretty girl in it, that is an image. You may like it, but if you show it to your wife or to a man who likes men, they might react differently. 'But if that girl were here giving one message, if the message was clear, differentiated, intelligent and not too long, she could give all of us the same message. This is what I call the message of the brand.' Hayek refuses to explain this beguiling analogy further because, he says, he does not want to make things easier for his Japanese competitors. Armed with confidence in his marketing skill, Hayek has perhaps inevitably begun to think of producing other consumer products himself. SMH has diversified into personal telecoms products, making a Swatchphone and a Swatch wristwatch pager. But his most audacious project to date is a joint venture with Volkswagen, the German car maker, to make an environmentally friendly car. The project was announced two years ago with considerable fanfare and an appeal for inventors to contribute ideas, but details of the car's design have been kept secret. Hayek originally said he would unveil a prototype this year, but he has changed his mind, claiming that such a move would give away some of the ideas to competitors. He says he will reveal the real thing in 1996. Is this hubris? Would he, wearing his consultant's hat, endorse a plan by a watch company to make a car? 'If they had the people, yes. Making a car is not a difficult thing because the basic technology has not changed in 50 years.' His appeal in the media two years ago raised Hayek's profile in Switzerland and abroad. He makes no apology for devoting much of his time to interviews. The biggest challenge for management today, he says, is communicating. 'Europe has had a fantastic boom in the past 50 years, but we have created very rigid structures in our societies. Bankers and businessmen no longer like to take risks. So we have to be very strong communicators and convince the people around us of the value of our ideas.' He has also embraced the environmental cause and last March addressed the United Nations general assembly preparatory session for the Rio summit on the global environment. 'Each one of us has a responsibility. Because I am an entrepreneur, I have more resources and capability to change things than politicians who talk very much and do very little. That is why we started with the car two years ago. That is why we are going to sell watches without packaging.' Like most Swiss industrialists, he is eager to see Switzerland join the European Community. But whereas most say joining would be good for Switzerland, Hayek emphasises what Switzerland can do for the EC. 'I think Europe has to be constructed according to a Swiss model. That is the only way it can work and survive. With all these different cultures and languages, it would be a catastrophe to go the centralised way.'

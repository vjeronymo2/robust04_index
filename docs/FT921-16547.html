			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Stasi files on 2m Germans are opened to public HUNDREDS of thousands of files kept by the former East Germany's Stasi security police will be opened today, threatening to split families and ruin friendships as unpleasant secrets about the past are uncovered. The files on nearly 2m citizens - both informers and those who were informed on - occupy some 200km of shelves in several government buildings in central east Berlin. Mr Joachim Gauck, head of the Berlin-based federal agency which administers the Stasi documents, said citizens would have to apply in writing to see their files. He expected about 70,000 east and west Germans to do so each month. His newly created agency, with branch offices in main cities, has more than 800 employees. It aims to increase that number by about 200 a month - to 3,400 - to cope with the demand for files. That will be more than the Treuhand agency, charged with privatising nearly 10,000 former east German state companies, which employs just under 3,000. Mr Gauck warned people to reflect on the possible consequences before applying to read their files. 'A human catastrophe could come about if someone discovered that a member of his own family informed on him,' the 51-year-old east German pastor suggested. Parents were known to have foiled plans by their own children to escape to the west by informing the Stasi. In some cases they were afraid that the children would be shot at, and possibly killed, by border guards. Communist functionaries feared loss of their privileges if their children escaped. Ms Barbel Bohley, a founder of the New Forum movement which helped topple the Communist regime, will be among the first to gain access to her own voluminous file. She recently learned that a close friend and fellow opponent of the Communists served as a longtime informer for the Stasi, or Ministry of State Security. A senior east German official said last year that he opposed opening the Stasi files as it would lead to 'murder and homicide.' However, Mr Gauck said that opening the files was an essential part of 'coming to terms' with east Germany's recent past. Some Germans argue that Bonn wants east Germans to atone for the Communist past in a way that perhaps west Germans have failed to do over their Nazi past. Among those working for Mr Gauck are more than 12 former Stasi officials with an intimate knowledge of the complex filing system containing more than 6m entries. Many of these consist of code names as well as actual names of the 300,000 informers and their more than 1.5m victims. Among the Stasi files is one on this correspondent who has reported from East Germany since 1961 and was kept under surveillance on many occasions.</p>

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Amstrad's finance director resigns AMSTRAD, the consumer electronics group founded by Mr Alan Sugar, yesterday announced the sudden departure of the group's finance director - the second senior finance executive to leave the company within 48 hours. News of Mr Peter Thoms' resignation was announced 10 minutes before the market closed yesterday afternoon, giving traders little time to react. Amstrad's shares closed  1/2 p lower on the day at 28 1/2 p. Amstrad declined to comment on the reasons for Mr Thoms' resignation. He said: 'I feel hamstrung, but I've been asked to say nothing.' On Wednesday Mr Ken Ashcroft, Amstrad's corporate finance director, left the board as part of the company's restructuring. Mr Ashcroft has become non-executive chairman of Betacom, the telephone equipment distributor which is 71.3 per cent owned by Amstrad. On Thursday, Amstrad warned that a sharp deterioration in the personal computer market meant it was likely to lose Pounds 65m in the year to June 30, on turnover of about Pounds 350m. These losses were about Pounds 25m higher than market expectations. Amstrad said Mr Thoms would be succeeded as group finance director by Mr Tony Dean, who joined the group in 1985 and had been designate director, group financial controller since October 1991 and, prior to that, held the position of UK finance director. No-one was available to comment at Amstrad's brokers, James Capel, financial adviser Kleinwort Benson, or auditors Touche Ross. Herbert Smith, Amstrad's solicitors, declined to comment.</p>

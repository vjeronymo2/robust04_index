			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: Malaysian bank turns in 90% improvement BANK Bumiputra, Malaysia's second biggest bank, reports pre-tax profits of MDollars 80.6m (Dollars 32m) for the year ended March, writes Kieran Cooke. The result represents a rise of nearly 90 per cent on last year.  Bank Bumiputra has assets of MDollars 35bn. The bank, set up in the mid-1960s to help the bumiputras, or Malays, who make up about 50 per cent of Malaysia's population, has been plagued by scandal. Twice in the past 10 years the state has had to step in to rescue it. The bank increased its provision for bad loans to MDollars 156m from MDollars 147m in the previous financial year.</p>

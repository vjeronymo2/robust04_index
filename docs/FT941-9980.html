			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / BP defies price fall to return to profit British Petroleum fought off the effects of falling oil prices to announce a return to the black as it reaped the rewards of a wide-ranging restructuring and disposal programme. Pre-tax profits last year on a replacement cost basis - which excludes the effects of changes in inventory values - were Pounds 896m after exceptional items, against losses of Pounds 352m for 1992. Exceptional items for the year totalled Pounds 240m. BP saw a 56 per cent improvement in comparable fourth quarter profits to Pounds 315m. The group also substantially improved its cash flow, recording a positive contribution of Pounds 1.95bn before financing, against a Pounds 607m outflow in 1992. This was partly due to the success of BP's disposal programme which has raised more than Pounds 3bn since 1992. Mr David Simon, chief executive, said the group had 'really been tested. We have shown a steady improvement in our financial performance in spite of the oil price.' Average oil prices declined during the year by more than Dollars 2 to about Dollars 16 a barrel. Since early December they have fallen to about Dollars 13.50, but Mr Simon said BP's larger oil fields had remained profitable. He did not hold great hope for a revival of oil prices in the near future and said BP would have to 'find a way to live in a Dollars 13 to Dollars 14 world'. This would mean greater efforts to maintain margins, rather than relying on the oil price for profits. The group announced it intends to find a further Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) savings in the next three years, but there were no firm plans for further redundancies. There was room for cutting variable costs, Mr Simon said. The main exploration and production business returned operating profits of Pounds 1.9bn, against Pounds 1.7bn last year. Mr Simon said this had been achieved through margin management and increased gas production, as well as cost-cutting. Refining and marketing jumped from Pounds 304m to Pounds 810m. The improvement largely resulted from Pounds 265m of cost reductions. The chemicals division was hit by low petrochemical prices and incurred losses of Pounds 68m, against a Pounds 24m deficit last year. The fourth quarter dividend was 2.1p (against 2.1p), for a total of 8.4p (against 10.5p). Earnings per share on a replacement cost basis, before exceptionals rose from 9.9p to 10.7p.

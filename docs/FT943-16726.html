			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: A simple Pounds 60bn success story - Seeing how other people look after money helps you to control your own more efficiently. That is the theory behind Joanna Slaughter's series on private client investment managers.  Today: Mercury Asset Management / The Professionals Mercury Asset Management, the investment management arm of the SG Warburg group, made its reputation in the 1970s and 1980s by being overweight in equities. Today, it sees no reason to reverse this investment philosophy. British shares continue to form rather more than the backbone of most UK private client portfolios and David Rosier, the chairman of MAM Private Investors - the private client subsidiary which alone has Pounds 2.9bn under management - says: 'We still believe that long-term investors will do a lot better by investing in the equity markets. That is where the long-term value is.' MAM was incorporated as a Warburg subsidiary in 1969 and now has a total of Pounds 60bn under management, including a large amount of pension fund money. Rosier cites this financial muscle as an added source of reassurance and benefit for the private clients in his corner of the empire. 'We are dedicated to giving a personal service to private clients,' he stresses. 'They will have their own portfolio manager looking after them whose job it is to cater to their requirements. But, by being part of Mercury Asset Management, we also have the ability to deliver services that may not be available at other investment houses. 'For example, we have specialists in MAM who are looking after Dollars 20bn of international bonds, and our clients have been able to take advantage of the large rise in international bond markets that began in 1991. In Julian Baring, we are also acknowledged to have the expert in mining and gold shares in the UK, and there are times when private clients would like, and should have, some gold. 'MAM has offices in every financial centre in the world and a smaller organisation simply couldn't afford that. A further benefit of size is that it has allowed us to invest heavily in systems. 'Administration is so important on the private investor side. People can understand that you don't always get that extra bit of performance, but they can't understand if you don't spell their name right or if they don't receive their dividend cheques.' MAM believes a correct asset allocation strategy is central to the management of clients' investments. Last year, some private clients with growth portfolios had approaching 20 per cent of their assets in international bonds and cash. Today, the favoured asset distribution is UK equities (63 per cent); North America (6 per cent); Europe (7 per cent); Japan (6 per cent); Pacific basin (3 per cent); emerging markets and commodities (3 per cent); gilts (11 per cent) and cash (1 per cent). Private client portfolios do not replicate these allocations slavishly, however. Rosier explains: 'It is up to the private client manager to work within this asset allocation because he knows the client and structures the portfolio accordingly.' MAM has 2,400 UK private and 500 international clients and each has a portfolio manager with whom regular contact is maintained although there is the safety-net of a team back-up to ensure continuity 'if someone falls under a bus'. The managers have considerable autonomy and there is no list of approved equities to clip their wings. Sometimes, however, there will be a strong house view on certain companies, and managers will be told not to hold these shares. It is a matter of some pride to Rosier that MAM was not holding one Polly Peck or British &amp; Commonwealth share when these companies hit trouble. Individual portfolios are constructed for all private clients with more than Pounds 300,000 to invest, and the UK exposure in these is concentrated tightly on 20 to 30 shares. 'In order to take away 90 per cent of the risk in a portfolio, you need to have about 20 shares,' Rosier argues. 'With 50 to 60 shares, you are moving only towards the average, and there is no point in having something in your portfolio that isn't going to have any effect on your performance.' Exposure to smaller companies is provided through Mercury unit trusts. Indeed, unit trusts and a range of investment trusts also provide the overseas weighting in smaller portfolios. Only clients who have more than Pounds 1m are invested directly in overseas equities, and even these large accounts often have a core holding in a fund. Unless they are very large, equity portfolios are seldom hedged because of the cost. Hedging usually is confined to the pure bond portfolios where managers may like a bond market but not the currency. The performance achieved for each private client portfolio is monitored regularly. So is turnover; Rosier reckons this averages around 25 per cent a year. Each of the 24 private client managers has responsibility for a specialist sector of the market, but they are not expected to devote themselves only to research. Rosier notes: 'They don't have time and, anyway, we have this huge research back-up within MAM.' The numbers certainly are impressive. There are more than 170 fund managers in the group, each specialising in a market or sector. MAM believes this to be one of the largest investment teams in the world. Last year, MAM's private investor arm won 420 new clients and lost between 20 and 30. Each new client is asked to contact Rosier if they are unhappy with the service the receive. Last year, a client with Pounds 5m did so. 'He didn't believe we had understood his brief and we changed the manager,' says Rosier, adding: 'You always lose a few clients but it is quite hard to find out why. Essentially, it means that the relationship has broken down.' Rosier sees a 'huge' potential for expanding overseas client numbers. 'The international private client market is very fragmented,' he points out. 'There are areas of the world where there has been an enormous growth in personal wealth - yet, by and large, the international private client has not been well catered for.' Increasingly, clients with very large portfolios are opting to spread their assets among several different investment managers. Rosier says: 'There is very much a trend towards multi-advisers. It is not so much that clients want diversification, but they don't want all their eggs in one basket.' This seems to demonstrate an inherent caution which Rosier believes to be common to almost every client. Indeed, a number of MAM's international clients insist that 50 per cent of their money is in bonds and 50 per cent in UK equities. Rosier says: 'Experience has taught me that most clients are pretty risk-averse. Often, you find that the more money people have, the less risk they want to take. After all, if you have made Pounds 100m, you don't need to take risks.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                   INVESTMENT MANAGERS: FACTFILE 2  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- MERCURY (Mercury Asset Management Private Investors)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Established: 1946  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Regulator: IMRO  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Number of offices in UK: One  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Number of Offices worldwide: 13  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Funds under management: Pounds 2.9bn  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Number of UK private clients: 2400  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Number of expatriate/foreign national private clients: 500  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Minimum investment for private clients: Pounds 100,000 (Mercury Portfolio Service based on collective investments); Pounds 300,000 segregated portfolios)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Current asset allocation for private clients: 63% UK equities, 25% overseas equities 12% gilts and cash  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Average annual portfolio turnover: 25%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Fees: Balanced portfolios, 1% on first pounds 500,000, 0.75 thereafter (minimum pounds 2,000 pa plus transaction commissions);fixed interest portfolios, 1% on first pounds 1 milllion (minimum pounds 7,500 pa); Mercury Portfolio Service, minimum pounds 250 pa to pounds 750 pa  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNDESERVED PUBLICITY FOR 'SHADOWS'  </P> <P> Your article, "Shadows on a Legend" (by Garry Abrams, March 24), gives  undeserved publicity and recognition to two authors whose journalistic  credibility has been questioned on several previous occasions. Their book is  composed of false allegations, rumors and contorted interviews. Simple facts  such as how my grandfather died are incorrect as are the insulting charges  about my father, Randolph Scott. At least twice, the authors used anonymous  sources casting doubt over the specific allegations as well as the integrity of  the total book.  </P> <P> It was hard to believe that The Times would give such prominent attention to a  book that maliciously strives to tarnish the reputation of distinguished  individuals. The book reads like a hard bound copy of the National Enquirer.  Its main goal is not enlightenment of the reader but enrichment of the authors.  Why would you consider helping them?  </P> <P> SANDRA SCOTT TYLER,  </P> <P> THE FAMILY OF  </P> <P> RANDOLPH SCOTT  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

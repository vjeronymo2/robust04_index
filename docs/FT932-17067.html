			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Arts: Eliot Gardiner and the Philharmonia - Concert It was difficult to tell why there were empty seats at this concert at the Royal Festival Hall. Perhaps some people had been put off by the advertised programme and others turned away in disappointment when it was changed, for this Philharmonia concert had undergone more wholesale transpositions than an ageing prima donna's songbook. Suffice to say that the original and rather adventurous plan to give us Mozart and Britten (Act 2 of Gloriana and the Spring Symphony) evaporated some weeks ago into an Elgar symphony and a Beethoven concerto, but by the time the audience had settled into their seats the concerto had gone as well. The evening's soloist had been taken ill. In her place John Eliot Gardiner had been persuaded to take the orchestra through Beethoven's Seventh Symphony - on no rehearsal. No doubt the Philharmonia Orchestra could play this symphony on autopilot anyway. But Gardiner is not the sort of conductor to let an orchestra get away with that. If they really had not had any rehearsals for this performance, the players were in for a surprise. He set a galloping fast tempo for the main Allegro of the first movement (no easy matter to keep dotted rhythms clear at that speed) and after that the symphony never stopped for breath. The importance of Gardiner - and the reason why a traditional orchestra like the Philharmonia is well advised to get him on board its roster of conductors - is that he has the will and the intelligence not just to go along with accepted notions of how well-known pieces of music should be played. The Beethoven may only have been an outline of a performance, but it was stamped with his own personality. His Elgar after the interval was wholly original, unidiomatic perhaps, but unforgettable. Coming from working with early music, Gardiner approaches late 19th-century orchestral works with different expectations. He wants clarity of sound and precision, not grandiloquence (the Philharmonia pinned down inner parts astonishingly for him). In shaping the music, he is not content to take the long view; every single phrase has to be given its own meaning. The result was a performance of Elgar's Second Symphony that had more to say about the music than any other I have encountered. Instead of vague romantic gestures, it seemed to speak urgently of personal passion and the gathering storm-clouds of the First World War, the latter in a fearsomely articulated scherzo. Forget Tate's rather bloated Elgar and Sinopoli's debilitating efforts with the same orchestra. Gardiner is the new, thinking Elgarian for the 1990s.</p>

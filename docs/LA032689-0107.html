			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: AND THE DOCTOR IS . . .  </P> <P> Also attending the Oscars will be Nancy Hale -- fresh from the kitchen.  Producer Hale's "Portrait of Imogen" was nominated in the Best Documentary  category, but it hasn't made her rich or famous. She spent recent weeks in her  sister's Chicago gourmet shop and cafe, supervising a cooking crew and selling  food delicacies to retail outlets.  </P> <P> Hale, who has a baby daughter and a husband who is in grad school, moved from  San Francisco to Chicago just before "Imogen's" release, convinced that "there  was not enough money in making films to support a family. The films I did cost  money rather than paying money."  </P> <P> Now that her husband has finished his course work at Northwestern, the Hales  plan to move back to California this fall. "Maybe I can make a living in film  after all," she said, hopefully. From Stacy Jenel Smith  </P></p>

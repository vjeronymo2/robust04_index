			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / International Company News: Sumitomo Chemical to resume production of epoxy resin SUMITOMO Chemical, supplier of most of the epoxy resin used in making semiconductors, expects to resume production around the end of the year after an explosion last month halted output at its plant in south-western Japan. Spot prices for memory chips soared as a result of the accident, and the share price of Nippon Kayaku, the other main Japanese supplier of the material, reached new highs last week after it announced that it was increasing capacity. Sumitomo initially expects to bring back on stream one of the two production lines at its factory in Niihama, which accounted for about 60 per cent of the world market for epoxy resin. Sumitomo Chemical says the episode will have no material impact on its earnings, although it has declined to make a forecast for this year. The company slipped into loss for the first half to June.</p>

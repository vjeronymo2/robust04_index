Rozhko, Kiev State University]    [Abstract] The photoluminescence spectra and n-1 exiton  reflection of i-n[.sup]-[/]-, i-n[.sup]-[/]-n- and i-  n[.sup]-[/]-n-n[.sup]+[/]-GaAs epitaxial structures, grown  by the MOS-hydride method were examined at helium temperatures.  Their electron mode of conductivity was achieved by Si doping.  On some epitaxial layers with many structural surface defects,  such as micro-pockets, micro-cracks, oval defects, etc., the  intrinsic photoluminescence was manifested in a form of  intensive single band at 1.51514 eV. It was demonstrated that  with attenuation G&lt; G[.sup]cr[/] this band is caused by the  polariton luminescence near the surface, and with  G&gt; G[.sup]cr[/] by the resonant luminescence of the n-1  exiton.

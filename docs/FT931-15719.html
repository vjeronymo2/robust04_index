			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / People: . . and Wheatley joins Babcock's Engineering group Babcock International, which last summer said it wanted to achieve a better balance of expertise on its board, has invited Alan Wheatley to join as a non-executive director, in the first of two or more such appointments it intends to make in coming months. Wheatley, 54, the new chairman of 3i and a former senior partner of Price Waterhouse, has known the chairman of Babcock, Lord King, for some while. 'But these things are done in a much more formalised way these days and the chairman and deputy chairman spent some considerable time considering the sort of person we wanted,' says chief executive Oliver Whitehead. Whitehead points out that Wheatley, with his City contacts, 'fills an obvious gap' following the death of Rocky Stone, a former Smith New Court director and a leading light in the Industrial &amp; Commercial Finance Corporation, who had been on the board of Babcock since 1966 and who died last April. The chief executive says his own 'personal preference' would be for an industrialist as the next non-executive director, but that that search is not very far advanced.</p>

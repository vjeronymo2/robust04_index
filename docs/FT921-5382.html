			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / IMF funds increase hits Congress hitch THE International Monetary Fund's prospects of winning its Dollars 60bn (Pounds 34.2bn) funding increase this year appear to be dwindling as a result of mounting hostility in the US to foreign aid. The Bush administration has asked Congress to approve the funding for the Dollars 12bn US share of the increase but has not yet pressed hard in the face of opposition from Republicans and Democrats in Congress. Congressmen said attempts to pass legislation authorising the increase, which would boost the IMF's capital base by 50 per cent, appear virtually dead for this year. Administration officials, however, said negotiations on the issue were not yet over. The administration's reluctance to push hard has been reinforced by Mr Patrick Buchanan, President George Bush's isolationist challenger for the Republican party's presidential nomination. He has denounced foreign aid in general and the IMF funding in particular. Democratic congressmen have been wary of repeating their experience with the last IMF quota increase: they voted it at the Republican administration's request, only to find themselves under attack from Republican opponents in the subsequent elections for pouring money abroad. The IMF funding has also been complicated by a dispute between the Bush administration and the Israeli government over Israel's request for Dollars 10bn of loan guarantees to help it absorb up to 1m immigrants from the former Soviet Union. This dispute has tied up this year's foreign aid bill - the natural home for the IMF quota legislation. Most other IMF member countries have already approved their contributions to the quota increase but under IMF rules the overall increase cannot go ahead unless approved by countries representing 85 per cent of voting power. The US has 19 per cent of the votes. Letters, Page 17</p>

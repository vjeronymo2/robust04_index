			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Uruguay Round talks 'still far from complete' The achievement of the Uruguay Round of global trade talks 'is still far from complete' and European Union leaders must treat its ratification with urgency, Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, said in Dublin yesterday. Addressing a meeting of the EU economic and social committee, he said Europe had 'a responsibility to give leadership on ratification' by the 125 states that signed the Gatt agreements in Marrakesh in April. This had to be given as much priority 'and political energy and commitment' as the conclusion of the negotiations themselves. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) which will replace Gatt, is due to be established by January 1, 1995 under the auspices of the Uruguay Round agreement, and will have stronger powers and procedures than Gatt to enforce the liberalised trade arrangements which now extend to agriculture, services, textiles and intellectual property rights. Implementation of the Uruguay Round agreements 'will reward those who have embraced competition as an ally with improved opportunities to compete in the fastest-growing markets in the world - the upper-income developing countries'. He said a larger share of EU exports to third countries went to developing countries 'than to North America and Japan put together', and that these had the fastest-growing economies 'and the greatest reserves of unfulfilled demand'. The Uruguay Round would not only make these markets more accessible, but greater access to EU markets for developing countries' products would in turn further drive a growth in demand for EU goods and services. He stressed that exporters would be better able to protect their brand name and image under the new rules on intellectual property rights. Better protection would enable them to develop new markets 'with more confidence that they are not just offering counterfeiters and pirates a free ride'.</p>

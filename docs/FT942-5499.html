			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / UK draws back over rights: The Tiananmen Square killings, five years on The British government has drawn back from inflaming its delicate relations with China, rejecting calls for the establishment of a human rights commission in Hong Kong and denying visas to two leading Chinese dissidents ahead of today's fifth anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre. Governor Chris Patten declined visa requests by Mr Liu Binyan, a distinguished Chinese journalist, and Mr Ruan Ming, the former private secretary of Mr Hu Yaobang, China's former communist party chief. A senior official said Hong Kong could not become a base for 'subverting' the Chinese government. The UK government is expected to formally reject the creation of a human rights commission when it replies later this month to a Commons committee report which endorsed the idea. China has made it plain that such a commission would be abolished after its 1997 takeover. Hong Kong and British government officials indicated that Beijing's 'neuralgia' about Tiananmen and human rights had prompted the government to seek different ways of achieving civil rights gains in Hong Kong other than high profile commissions. This has been rejected by liberal groups in the colony who believe their interests are being sacrificed in favour of better Anglo-Chinese ties. Meanwhile, in the past two weeks there has been a change in attitude by Beijing on social and economic issues in Hong Kong. Mr Lu Ping, China's top official on Hong Kong affairs, has suggested solutions to financing the colony's multi-billion dollar airport project, the composition of Hong Kong's top court post-1997, and the development of a container port. Pro-Beijing legislators yesterday raised no objection to the government's request for funds to build a tunnel under Hong Kong harbour for the new airport's planned railway. The vote providing HKDollars 715m (Pounds 61.6m) without dissent was seen as evidence that a solution to financing the airport was within sight.</p>

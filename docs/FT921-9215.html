			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: Fisher-Price rises to Dollars 4m in second quarter FISHER-PRICE, one of the world's biggest marketers of pre-school toys, yesterday posted second quarter earnings of Dollars 4m, or 26 cents a share. The company, spun-off from Quaker Oats last June, recorded a net deficit of Dollars 29.2m in the 1990 second quarter. Revenues were virtually unchanged at Dollars 185m, compared with Dollars 184.6m. Part of the improvement came from lower advertising and merchandising expenses, which dropped to Dollars 27.7m in the 1991 second quarter from Dollars 43.4m last time. Selling, general and administrative expenses were cut to Dollars 42.9m from Dollars 54.7m. The New York-based company said last year's figures do not necessarily reflect the results had Fisher-Price been operating as a stand-alone entity. For the six months, net income was Dollars 12.2m, or 80 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 373m, against a net loss of Dollars 38.7m on revenues of Dollars 339.4m. On Wall Street, the shares eased Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 37 1/8 at mid-session yesterday. During the first half, domestic revenues climbed 26 per cent to Dollars 266.1m, but international revenues tumbled 17 per cent to Dollars 106.9m. Foreign currency translations accounted for Dollars 7.4m of the Dollars 22.1m decline. Mr Ronald Jackson, chairman and chief executive, said: 'We view the international business as a growth opportunity, even though we didn't make as much progress as we had hoped in 1991.'</p>

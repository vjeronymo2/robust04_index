			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> CHRIST COLLEGE COMES DOWN FROM HILL, RISES TO NEW HEIGHTS  </P> <P> Each time it wins a game this season, the Christ College Irvine women's  basketball team takes another step away from its dismal past. The Eagles, who  won only four of 27 games last year, are 6-1 this season, and Tuesday they  shocked Biola, 78-59.  </P> <P> Christ College had never defeated Biola in women's basketball. Last season,  Biola beat Christ College by 52 points and advanced to the NAIA District 3  championship game. Tuesday, four starters from that team played for Biola, the  only California team to receive mention in the latest national NAIA poll, but  Christ College still won handily.  </P> <P> "It felt good to come away with a win," said Genevieve Graff, a sophomore guard  who was a starter last year. "Each game we play builds up our confidence more."  </P> <P> Said Coach Kent Schlichtemeier: "I don't think we are going to surprise anyone  anymore. The NAIA (District 3) stats came out yesterday and we're around the  top. That's definitely a total reversal from where we were last year."  </P> <P> At the end of last season, the players who would be returning this year met  with the coaching staff on top of a hill behind the college's campus. They  talked about self-motivation and commitment and working hard in the summer.  </P> <P> "It was a long year last year and we just didn't want that to happen again,"  Schlichtemeier said. "I've never seen a team work harder than this team.  </P> <P> "Our team goal is to make the playoffs this year. It's never been done in the  school's history."  </P> <P> History at Christ College, founded in 1976, doesn't go back too far. In its  seventh season of women's basketball, the school has never had a winning  record.  </P> <P> The Eagles, who have lost only to Division II Cal State Dominguez Hills, are  within one victory of the school record of seven, accomplished in 1987-88 and  1988-89.  </P> <P> This year Christ College, which plays Whittier College Friday night, is getting  balanced scoring from Gitte Mejer, a freshman from Denmark, who is the  district's fourth-leading scorer (14.7); Stacy Kirch, a sophomore transfer from  Wyoming who is leading the district in three-point shooting percentage (56%),  and Graff, a sophomore who is averaging 13 points.  </P> <P> "That's the nice thing. We have a lot of good scorers from every position so  they're difficult to defend," Schlichtemeier said.  </P> <P> Cross-county traffic: Because a number of Whittier College players have final  exams that end at 5:30 p.m. Friday, the Poets' game at Christ College has been  delayed an hour until 8:30. And even with the delay in game time, the team may  find it difficult to make the freeway trek from Los Angeles County in time for  the scheduled start.  </P> <P> Going into a trip to Northern California this weekend, the Chapman women's  basketball team is doing well statistically. The team's top three players --  Marvette Williams (17 points a game), Linda Kirby (17) and Jackie Saunders (15)  -- are the top three scorers in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. Only  UC Riverside, which is averaging more than 85 points, is scoring more than the  Panthers (76.4 a game).  </P> <P> However, only one team, Cal State Los Angeles, is allowing more points than the  Panthers (67.6).  </P> <P> "We'd like to hold people to less points," Coach Lindsay Strothers said, "but I  guess if we can hold teams to less points than we have we're all right."  </P> <P> But Chapman (6-3) has been inconsistent and Strothers said the Panthers aren't  playing as a team.  </P> <P> "Player-for-player I don't know if a lot of teams can match up with us," he  said. "But putting it all together on the floor is a different story, and  that's my job."  </P> <P> The Southern California College men's basketball team, which has won five  consecutive games, including a 67-64 overtime victory over Cal State Dominguez  Hills Saturday, will likely have its first tough test in District 3 on Saturday  at home against Biola. The game is at 7:30 in SCC's gym, called "The Pit."  Biola (8-1) was ranked 24th in the latest NAIA poll.  </P> <P> </P> <P> College Division Notes  </P> <P> John McKay, former USC and Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach, will be the featured  speaker at the 12th Chapman Hall of Fame dinner Jan. 30. The dinner -- where  Kathy Copelin, an All-American softball player, Don Hurzeler, an All-American  track athlete, and John Young, a Chapman baseball player, will be inducted --  will be held at the Doubletree Hotel starting at 6 p.m. Tickets are $75 and  proceeds will go the the Chapman Athletic Scholarship Fund.

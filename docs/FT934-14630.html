			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Sema to acquire part of Swedish software group SEMA group, the Anglo-French computing services company listed in London, is spending SKr250m (Pounds 20.5m) to buy the main part of a Swedish state-owned information technology company. Sema yesterday reached agreement with the Swedish government to buy the facilities management, information services, consulting and systems integration businesses of SKDforetagen. The deal gives Sema its first presence in Scandinavia and strengthens the company's position in Europe in facilities management. FM, a fast growing trend in information technology, means a company takes responsibility for a customer's data processing requirements. Sema said yesterday that it believed the acquisition would strengthen its hand in bidding for UK government market-testing contracts. SKD had turnover of Pounds 92.3m in 1992. It is one of Sweden's largest IT companies and was formed as a result of the merger of the state companies DAFA, which processes data for the government, and Statskonsult, which develops administrative systems. Customers include Volvo. In the first six months of the current year, Sema's pre-tax profits rose 38 per cent to Pounds 10.6m on revenues up 19 per cent at Pounds 232m. The SKD sale is the latest in a steady programme of privatisation, covering 35 wholly or partly state-owned companies embarked upon by the centre-right government of Mr Carl Bildt since it came to power two years ago. Yesterday's deal was small, compared with the large privatisation issues already carried out, such as this year's SKr2.2bn flotation of Celsius, the defence group, and those still to come, such as Procordia's pharmaceutical business and the government's share of the OK Petroleum group. However, it confirmed the government's willingness to include foreign buyers at a time when the issue of growing foreign influence in Swedish industry is the subject of keen debate, mainly precipitated by the proposed merger of Volvo's car and truck operations with France's Renault and a spate of foreign buying recently on the Stockholm stock exchange.</p>

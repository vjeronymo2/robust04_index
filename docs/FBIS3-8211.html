			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Army General Rasim Delic, chief of the general staff  of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, and Gen. Michael Rose, UNPROFOR  [UN Protection Forces] Commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina, had  talks in Sarajevo today. The two commanders discussed the  dynamism of the implementation of the cease-fire agreement,  signed between the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the HVO [Croatian  Defense Council] transition from a war to a peace situation in  the city of Sarajevo, as well as possibilities of UN  representatives entering Maglaj.    Gen. Rose was optimistic in assessing the activity so far in  the realization of the HVO-Bosnia-Herzegovina Army agreement,  which he could see for himself during his visits to Old Vitez,  Gornji Vakuf, and other parts of central Bosnia in the past few  days. He pointed out the problems of implementing the agreement  in the city of Sarajevo, where he expects a great deal of work  in the near future. The Army and civil authorities are expected  to make their contribution to this in cooperation with the  UNPROFOR.    Army Gen. Delic said that Bosnia-Herzegovina Army units and  commands were ready to carry out all the tasks laid down by the  peace agreement with the HVO. The agreement is being  implemented with success on the ground and there is room for  optimism, said Army Gen. Delic.    As for the opening of Dubrave airport near Tuzla, the stands  of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the state leadership are  quite clear. We insist that the airport be opened, but I do not  accept any Serb conditions regarding its opening. This is our  free territory and there can be no discussion about the  territory, which our army has liberated, stressed Army Gen.  Delic at the end of the talks today.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vasiliy Golovnin] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, 8 Apr -- Kazakhstan President Nursultan  Nazarbayev today said he was most concerned that there was a  danger that the Russian population might leave the country.    Replying to questions at a news conference in Tokyo, he said  Kazakhstan does not have a refugees' problem yet. However,  Nazarbayev said, "collapse of empires never goes quietly," and  people are concerned since they can see bloodshed in Tajikistan  and the Caucasus. Politicians, he said, should have foreseen  this when they were signing the Belovezhskaya Pushcha agreement  and when "against our will, the ruble zone was being destroyed."    An economic crisis can be observed throughout the former  USSR  at present, the quality of life worsens, and on the eve of the  elections on 12 December many politicians had nothing better to  do than "to use the Russian theme since there was nothing else  they could talk about." However, concern for common people and  politicizing are different matters, the president stressed.    The Russian-speaking population in Kazakhstan enjoys all the  rights and even have opportunities not available in other  countries on the territory of the former USSR. "Russians,  Germans, and Ukrainians are our citizens, citizens of  Kazakhstan, and I know it will be worse for them if they leave,"  Nazarbayev said.</p>

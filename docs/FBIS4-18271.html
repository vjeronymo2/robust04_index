			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["msl/DW"-signed report: "Bomb Threat Against Israeli </F> Embassy"]    [Text] Bonn -- A large area near the Israeli Embassy in  Bonn has been sealed off for several days following bomb threats  against Israeli institutions. German security authorities have  been informed of Palestinian groups planning terror attacks on  the embassy.    There is "very serious evidence" of possible bomb attacks  "by  the Hezbollah" on Israeli targets in Germany, a police spokesman  said in Bonn yesterday. He did, however, not indicate whether  the threats came from the pro-Iranian Hezbollah operating from  South Lebanon or from another group. A terror commando is said  to have already entered Germany.    The Israeli Embassy itself has not received any threats.  Yet, the security authorities are speaking of "a danger that  has to be taken very seriously."    The Interior Ministry did not want to release any details on  the security measures taken. "The security authorities are  taking appropriate measures," a spokesman said.    In Frankfurt/Main, where there are many Israeli  institutions,  a police spokesman only said that these buildings are  permanently being observed. He did not say whether security has  been stepped up following the bomb threats.</p>

			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Threat of strike at BT recedes The executive of the National Communications Union is today expected to retreat from industrial conflict with British Telecommunications over new working patterns. BT and the union have been in negotiation for several months about new working patterns designed to ensure that more staff are available to customers at weekends and in the evenings. It appeared that negotiations had broken down after nearly three-quarters of the 27,000 affected workers rejected the changes in a ballot. However it now appears that sufficient common ground has been found for a deal. A joint statement issued yesterday said: 'Both BT and the NCU believe that they have identified the basis for a joint agreement on CSIP (Customer Service Improvement Programme) attendance patterns. 'BT is prepared to defer commencement of phase 2 until 26 September in order to establish whether we are jointly able to confirm that there are no differences between the company and the NCU executive.' The reason for the change of heart on both sides may be found in the number of employees who had signed up voluntarily for one of the four new attendance patterns in spite of a recommendation from the union not to do so. It is thought that about 40 per cent of the 27,000 workers have signed up. That is more than the union would have liked and would have made industrial action difficult to sustain. But equally, a clear majority of staff have followed the union instruction - in spite of strong pressure from managers to accept the deal - which might have made life difficult for BT. Under the most radical work pattern options, staff can work regular weekends in return for a four or even three-day week and a Pounds 1,000 one-off payment. BT also says that the options are voluntary and staff can opt to remain on their existing hours. The voluntary status of the agreement has, however, been questioned by some staff and union officials.</p>

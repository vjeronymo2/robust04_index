			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read statement by the Ukrainian Defense Ministry; </F> passages within quotation marks spoken in Russian]    [Text] We will begin with a statement by the Ukrainian  Defense Ministry Press Service.    The world public has again been misled, reads the statement.  Again referring to a "source close to the Black Sea Fleet  headquarters," I read the original, ITAR-TASS circulated  misinformation on 19 May as if 1,000 special purpose troops from  the Ukrainian armed forces have arrived on the territory of  Crimea over the last 24 hours. The same "source" reported the  concentration of 300 Ukrainian servicemen in the vicinity of  Sevastopol.    The Ukrainian Defense Ministry Press Service declares that  this statement is a provocative lie, evidently aimed at  aggravating the political situation on the peninsula, which is  tense even without this, to the limit and provoking yet another  splash of anti-Ukrainian hysteria.    As earlier, the familiar special propaganda methods of the  Black Sea Fleet Press Center, which is carrying out open  subversive activities on the territory of the sovereign state --  Ukraine, can be seen through these malicious falsehoods.  Obviously, there are forces standing behind these vain  attempts, who are used to cheap populist tricks of the  totalitarianism times, and who use them to slander our state in  the eyes of the world public and sow mistrust among the peoples  of Ukraine.    I would like to remind you that this was a statement by the  Ukrainian Defense Ministry Press Service.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari has called upon  the government and the opposition to negotiate their political  differences and sort out the important critical issues facing  the nation. In an interview last night, he said what is needed  now is for both sides to sit together and evolve a joint  strategy to reach a consensus on such major issues as Kashmir,  the nuclear program, and economic stability.    Refuting the opposition's allegation that he is biased, the  president said he resigned from the Pakistan People's Party  following his election as president because of an evident  polarization in the country's political environment. Sardar  Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari said the country's political structure  is such that nobody can bargain on important issues of national  interest. Matters relating to the country's security and  economic affairs are fully under the government's control.    On the nuclear program, the president said that Pakistan's  nuclear program is peaceful. He added that Pakistan has made  several proposals to India, including the creation of a  nuclear-weapons-free zone in South Asia. The president asked  the United States and the United Nations to take note of India's  expanding missile program, which could start a regional missile  race.    Answering a question, the president said the armed forces  played their role in conducting free and fair elections and they  are in favor of democracy in the country.    On the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution [giving  discretionary powers to the president to dismiss the government  and dissolve the National Assembly], the president said he has  expressed his desire to abrogate it many times.</p>

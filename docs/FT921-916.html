			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Turkey's civil war SINCE 1984, Turkey has been struggling with a guerrilla war in its south-eastern provinces, launched by the separatist Workers' Party of Kurdistan (PKK). Last year, there seemed real hope of a political solution. President Turgut Ozal won popularity among Turkey's Kurds by backing their kinsmen in Iraq, and by legalising the Kurdish language. His opponent, Mr Suleyman Demirel, who became prime minister in November, went further, releasing many political prisoners and acknowledging the existence of a Kurdish 'identity'. The PKK responded with a ceasefire. Alas, by late December the ceasefire had broken down. The Turkish armed forces, apparently paying little attention to Mr Demirel's statements, continued to fight the PKK with their familiar methods, terrorising the civilian population and carrying out raids across the border into Iraq. In recent weeks, things have got worse, with terrorism spreading to the cities of western Turkey, all of which have large Kurdish communities. Last week, the Kurdish new year was marked by mass violence, with more than 60 deaths. Mr Demirel has now promised to seal the Iraqi border with a wall. He must know that this is both impossible and largely irrelevant. The heart of the problem is not the PKK bases in Iraq or Lebanon, but the support it enjoys inside Turkey. If the authorities continue trying to suppress it by force they are condemning the country to a long civil war, in which ethnic clashes in the western cities - hitherto virtually unknown - will soon play a part. The effect will be to abort Mr Demirel's liberal policies and paralyse the country's foreign policy, by alienating European and American public opinion at the very time when Turkey's strategic importance, both in the Middle East and in relation to the Turkic-speaking ex-Soviet republics, is opening new diplomatic opportunities. None of that is what Mr Demirel wants. Nor should it be what Mr Ozal wants, since it would undo all the work he did as prime minister and president to turn Turkey into a modern and outward-looking economic power. He should resist the temptation to turn the tables on Mr Demirel by an appeal to Turkish nationalism, or to the military. Nor, indeed, should it be the aim of the military themselves, who are the guardians of Turkey's secularist and western-oriented tradition. They should recognise that the policy pursued up to now has not suppressed Kurdish opposition but has inflamed it and provoked a brutal guerrilla war, and that the only hope of preserving Turkish unity now lies in recognising the Kurds' identity and granting them real autonomy. The Kurds on their side must realise how long, bloody and uncertain would be the road to independence via civil war, given that not only Turkey but Iran and Iraq also oppose it. They should still be ready to compromise, if compromise is offered.</p>

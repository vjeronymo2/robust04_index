			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / ANC focuses ire on S African president: Deterioration in relations stems directly from stalemate at Codesa THE African National Congress's commitment to mass action on an unprecedented scale in South Africa, made at its policy conference which ended yesterday, has come at a time when relations between the government and the organisation have plunged to a low point. The deterioration in relations flows directly from the failure two weeks ago to make substantial progress at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), where a second round of constitutional talks took place. Since the stalemate the ANC has stepped up its attacks on the government. Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC leader, launched yesterday a stinging attack on President FW de Klerk. Mr Mandela again likened South Africa to Nazi Germany, saying that in South Africa people were killed merely because they were black, and talked about crimes that had been committed by the president. Government ministers have given notice that they will respond in kind. A return to mass action and confrontation with the state would reflect an attempt by the ANC to supplement its influence at the negotiation table with popular support on the street. An ANC statement said: 'We have come to the realisation that unless the majority of South Africans participate actively in shaping the process, negotiations must fail.' Although the organisation stresses that it remains committed to negotiations, the return to 'struggle' politics is clearly a victory for militants in the movement. This is typified by the return to prominence of Mr Ronnie Kasrils, a marginal figure in the negotiation process, to head the ANC's campaigns committee. The chill in the political climate shifted attention from the ANC's four-day policy conference, where there was a mood of realism. This was most prominent in the economic field, with the ANC moving some distance from its initial socialist-style pronouncements. Although the stress is on policies which will help uplift the country's poorest people, there is no dogmatism about the best way to achieve this. Policy adopted by the ANC notes that the priority is 'not the legal form that state involvement in economic activity might take at any point, but whether such action will strengthen the ability of the economy to respond to the massive inequalities in the country'. The ANC says it will encourage foreign investors, adding: 'The most important way to promote foreign investment is to establish a climate of political stability, economic growth and transparent, consistent economic policies.' Mr de Klerk left yesterday on a week-long visit to Russia, Japan and Singapore, where he will attempt to improve trade and investment links.</p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / UK Company News: Frost turns in Pounds 2.5m after relisting FROST Group, which through its Save and Look service stations is one of Britain's largest independent petrol retailers, yesterday released its first results since relisting on the stock exchange last October. The company announced pre-tax profits down from Pounds 4.75m to Pounds 2.5m on turnover of Pounds 82.8m (Pounds 101.5m) for the year to December 31. However, Frost said the two periods were not comparable because of the company's previous status as a subsidiary of Norfolk House, the property group which went into receivership in March last year after buying Frost in 1990. Under Norfolk House's management, service station sites had been sold, and these changes were now being reversed. Earnings fell to 13.4p (24.2p) but the company is recommending a dividend of 2p (nil). Mr James Frost, chairman, said the company had increased the number of service station sites to more than 100 with 23 acquisitions, and more purchases were expected.</p>

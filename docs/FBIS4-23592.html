			<p>BFN     [Text] Nigeria's Foreign Affairs Minister Ambassador Baba  Gana Kingibe has described as ill-advised the threat to form a  government by Chief M.K.O. Abiola. Ambassador Kingibe, who was  speaking with the PAN-AFRICAN NEWS AGENCY in Tunis, said he  believed there was a better way of tackling the problem created  by the annulment of the 12 June election. According to him, 12  June was a democratic event endorsed by the people of Nigeria  and, therefore, it would be wrong of anybody who is talking of  democracy to seek to impose his vision without consulting the  people on the political future of Nigeria.    He said the only way to reach all Nigerians on the issue was  through their elected representatives in the national  constitutional conference scheduled to begin later this month.  Ambassador Kingibe, who was Abiola's running mate in the  annulled election, said he did not run with Chief Abiola to be  vice president of Nigeria by force. He advised Abiola to  consider the implications of his actions on the nation and  accept the realities of the moment. Ambassador Kingibe gave an  assurance that the present military administration will  disengage from politics and hand over power to an elected  democratic government through the national constitutional  conference.</p>

This behavior was represented by their attack on the  36th Infantry Battalion of the Unity [al-Wahdah] Brigade  stationed in Mudiyah Province in Abyan Governorate. The  al-'Amaliqah forces used in their barbarous attack Katyusha  missile launchers, tanks and artillery, as well as other medium  and light weapons. This attack targeting the 36th Battalion was  accompanied by another military attack, targeting towns,  villages and small villages in Mudiyah Province, when military  units of the al-'Amaliqah forces carried out intensive shelling  of peaceful inhabitants.</p>

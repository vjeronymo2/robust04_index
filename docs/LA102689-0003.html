			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH-SPEED TRAIN TO LAS VEGAS  </P> <P> I see that the local politicians are debating whether the proposed Las Vegas  high-speed train should terminate in Anaheim or Palmdale.  </P> <P> With Southern California suffocating in smog and traffic congestion, billions  of dollars are proposed to be spent on transporting people on a "gamblers'  special" train out of the state. I wish I had thought of that!  </P> <P> An even better idea would be to run the train in one direction only -- towards  Las Vegas. That way we'd solve our congestion problems and I further suggest  that those politicians debating this non-issue be given free passes on the  first train.  </P> <P> DON RICHARDSON  </P> <P> Alta Loma  </P></p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Government Bonds: French auction leads Europe to firmer ground European government bonds ended a choppy session on a firmer tone, supported by a successful auction of long-dated French government bonds and short-covering in the futures markets. However, investors continued to keep a low profile, put off by this week's high concentration of potentially market-moving events: Tuesday and Wednesday's meeting of the Federal Reserve's open market committee, yesterday's Bundesbank council meeting, today's US jobs data for June and the weekend summit of the Group of Seven industrial nations in Naples. After outperforming the rest of Europe on Wednesday, the German bond market was overtaken by most of its neighbours yesterday and ended little changed. The September bund future on Liffe rose 0.05 point to 92.00. The bund market's allure as a safe haven in times of turmoil had prompted heavy switching into bunds out of other markets earlier this week, causing yield spreads over Germany to widen dramatically. However, that was partially reversed yesterday, with some spreads narrowing back sharply. The main beneficiary of the this trend was France, where a well-received auction of 10-year and 30-year bonds gave the market a lift. The French 10-year yield spread over bunds narrowed to 52 basis points, from 63 on Wednesday. The Treasury sold a total of FFr19.337bn in bonds, at the lower end of the government's FFr19bn to FFr21bn pre-announced range. The bulk of paper was allocated in the 6.75 per cent bonds due 2004, which saw a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.4 times. The cover on the 6 per cent bond due 2025 was even higher at 3.3 times. Most of the paper was said to have been taken by primary dealers, with investors largely abstaining. UK gilts ended another trendless day firmer, supported by the French market's strength and early institutional buying. However, traders said cash volume remained thin as many investors remained sidelined, awaiting today's US data and the G7 summit. The September long gilt future on Liffe rose  25/32 to 100 19/32 . Danish bonds rallied sharply after the central bank cut its two-week repurchase rate by 10 basis points. The 10-year benchmark bond rose nearly a point, causing the yield spread over Germany to narrow to around 130 basis points, from 142 at Wednesday's close. US Treasury prices across the maturity range barely moved yesterday amid trading subdued by the unwillingness of participants to commit funds to the market ahead of today's important jobs figures. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond, which had inched higher during the morning, was down  1/16 at 84 1/4 , yielding 7.594 per cent. There was a similar lack of movement at the short end, where the two-year note was down  1/32 at 99 13/16 , to carry a yield of 6.084 per cent. After this week's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making open market committee ended without any sign of a move in interest rates, the attention of investors and traders switched to the June employment report, which is due this morning. Most analysts believed the FOMC chose not to change monetary policy because it wanted to see what the June jobs numbers would say about economic conditions. Analysts said yesterday that if the data revealed a further strengthening in the economy, then the Fed might choose to raise rates again to slow the pace of economic activity. If the figures come in at or below the consensus forecast of a 284,000 rise in non-farm payrolls, then the Fed would be more likely to leave monetary policy unchanged. Either way, uncertainty about the outlook for interest rates persuaded many participants yesterday that they were better off staying out of the market until after the June employment report. The only action during the morning was some modest demand from international accounts and the occasional short-covering which, along with rumours of outright buying of Treasuries by the Fed, lifted longer-dated prices slightly by mid-day. Later, bonds retreated as what few buyers there were in the market dried up, and participants squared their positions ahead of the employment release. A small drop in the dollar contributed to the afternoon decline in prices. The French economics minister, Mr Edmond Alphandery, told a conference that a plan to make it easier for private investors to buy French government bonds would not affect the government's borrowing requirement, AP-DJ reports.</p>

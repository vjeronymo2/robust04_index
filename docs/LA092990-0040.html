			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> EMBARRASSING PADRES OWE DODGERS FOR DISMAL SHOWING AGAINST REDS  </P> <P> As a Dodger fan, I felt like such an idiot rooting for the lowly Padres last  weekend. You don't realize what a lifeless, gutless, truly atrocious team the  Padres are until you're put in a position in which you must pull for them.  </P> <P> Watching the Padres fumble and bumble their way to a four-game sweep by the  Reds raised the very real suspicion that San Diego was tanking it against  Cincinnati to make things more difficult for the hated Dodgers. The evidence:  Mark Parent, who couldn't throw out Roseanne Barr trying to steal, started two  games in the series with the Reds; Atlee Hammaker, who couldn't last six  innings if you put a gun to his head, made a start against Cincinnati. Neither  of these alleged players saw action in the recent series against the Dodgers,  which the Padres played as if it were the World Series.  </P> <P> If I were the Dodgers' starting pitcher in Game 1 of next week's series against  San Diego, I'd drill the Padres' first four batters of the game -- one for each  game San Diego gave to Cincinnati last weekend. The Dodgers need not worry  about retaliation from San Diego -- the Padres have proven they are spineless  wimps.  </P> <P> HAROLD P. WEBER, Oceanside  </P></p>

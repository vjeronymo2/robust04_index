The Commission is publishing this notice and order to solicit comments from interested persons and to grant accelerated approval of the proposed rule change on a temporary basis through January 31, 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I.

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, MSTC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. MSTC has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has approved the Program on a temporary basis through January 31, 1994. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  The rationale for initially approving the rule change on a temporary basis was to provide MSTC with the opportunity to formulate more definitive financial and operational standards for Institutions that desire to participate in the Program. On December 26, 1990, MSTC filed a proposed rule change <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  which proposed more definitive standards and which requested permanent approval of the Program. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  In order to provide the Commission and MSTC with the opportunity to continue their studies of these standards while providing continuity of service to Institutions participating in the Program, MSTC requests that the Commission grant temporary approval of this proposed rule change on an accelerated basis under the terms of the previous temporary approval orders through January 31, 1995. MSTC believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 17A of the Act <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  because it will promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and help perfect the national system for the clearance and settlement of securities transactions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 27752 (March 1, 1990), 55 FR 8271 [File No. SR&hyph;MSTC&hyph;89&hyph;05]; 28844 (February 1, 1991), 56 FR 5035 [File No. SR&hyph;MSTC&hyph;91&hyph;01]; 29493 (July 26, 1991), 56 FR 36854 [File No. SR&hyph;MSTC&hyph;91&hyph;03]; 30326 (January 31, 1992), 57 FR 4783 [File No. SR&hyph;MSTC&hyph;92&hyph;01]; 30981 (August 10, 1992), 57 FR 35616 [File No. Sr&hyph;MSTC&hyph;92&hyph;06]; and 31798 (January 29, 1993), 58 FR 7276 [File No. SR&hyph;MSTC&hyph;92&hyph;11] (collectively referred to as ``temporary approval orders''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> File No. SR&hyph;MSTC&hyph;90&hyph;10. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For a complete description of the services offered and the current standards of financial and operational capabilities for Institutions, refer to the temporary approval orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1 (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and, in particular, with the requirements of section 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F) of the Act. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  Those sections require that the rules and organizational structure of a clearing agency be designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism for the national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions. The Commission believes that MSTC's proposal will help achieve these requirements by providing Institutions with the opportunity to participate directly in the national market system through MSTC's Program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b)(3) (A) and (F) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MSTC has requested that the Commission approve the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of the filing. The Commission finds good cause for so approving the proposed rule change because such accelerated approval will permit MSTC to offer continuity of service to Institutions that currently participate in the Program while providing the Commission and MSTC with additional time to analyze MSTC's proposed standards of participation and of financial and operational capabilities for Institutions. The Commission does not anticipate that it will receive any negative comments on the proposed rule change in light of the fact that no comments have been received on the proposals approved in the temporary approval orders, which were identical in substance to this proposed rule change. Furthermore, the Commission notes that the Program has operated without incident during the previous temporary approval periods. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

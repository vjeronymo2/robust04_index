			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Waste Management The coincidence of the election aside, it seems the market is nervous about the Pounds 465m flotation of Waste Management International. With offerings such as GPA, Wellcome, 3i, and the Daily Telegraph yet to come, a flop could have expensive consequences for the City. That is why Severn Trent Water's admission this week that its Biffa waste subsidiary is performing below expectations was unfortunate. Granted, the immature UK waste industry is scarcely comparable with its US equivalent and in any case has lost its premium rating. Nor does any UK company have anything near the market presence of WMI's US parent. But some UK investors are sceptical of the US-style multiple demanded for WMI shares. There are deeper questions being asked of the issue, not least why the parent should sell its fast-growing overseas operations merely to pay off cheap debt. Promises of fast earnings growth for WMI sit uneasily with the lack of a profits forecast and a stated intention not to pay dividends at this stage. The prospectus also revealed over half the group's 1991 turnover was generated in Italy and Argentina. But perhaps this is academic. The flotation will probably succeed because the shares are attractive to US funds. UK investors who doubt WMI's merits can wait to be convinced - the multiple is unlikely to be much higher a year from now. Just the same, London's corporate financiers will be glad to put this sale behind them.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Cairo, April 27 (AFP) -- The Moslem militant  group al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah on Wednesday vowed to kill  President Husni Mubarak to avenge the death of its military  leader.    Police said they gunned down 32-year-old Tal'at Yasin  Hammam,  head of the group's armed wing, and six other militants in a  dawn raid Monday on his apartment in northeast Cairo.    In a statement sent to AFP, al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah (the  Islamic Group) warned Mubarak, saying: "your head, as well as  those of hundreds of torturers in the Interior (Ministry), will  not be enough for our revenge."    It mocked the government's effectiveness in fighting  militants, saying Hammam used to plan his operations from a  building located "a few meters (yards) from the general  intelligence offices" in central Cairo.    Hammam "dealt one blow after the other" to the regime, the  statement said.    The Egyptian authorities said Hammam was, among other  things,  in charge of sending statements to foreign press agencies.  [passage omitted]</p>

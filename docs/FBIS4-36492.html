			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman (J.T.)--The government's decision to raise by  10 percent the basic salaries of civil servants aims at  improving the living conditions of government employees and  giving them incentive towards better and more productive work,  Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali said Sunday.    Speaking at a meeting held at the Central Bank of Jordan  (CBJ), Dr. al-Majali said the government was also seeking reform  in its public administration system and improve the performance  of employees.    Dr. al-Majali's statement came less than 24 hours after the  government's announcement that the 437,000 serving government  workers, military personnel and pensioners will get a raise of  10 percent that would not be less than JD [Jordanian dinars] 10  per month. The increase takes effect on July 1, 1994.    Finance Minister Sami Qammuh said the decision was taken to  give the civil servants a raise "within the government's  financial means." But, he added, a special committee of experts  is continuing to study other measures intended to improve  government employees' conditions and raise their efficiency and  performance.    Mr. Qammuh told a press conference on Sunday that the  government hoped the committee would end its study and submit  recommendations to the govenrment in the next few months.    Another committee had been entrusted with studying matters  related to state-owned lands on which govenrment housing units  could be set up to benefit government employees, he said. This  committee would be given long-term soft loans provided by the  state, the minister said.    Mr. Qammuh said that while the 10 percent increase benefits  government civil and military personnel and the pensioners,  employees excelling in their performance would be granted other  allowances depending on the degree of their progress and their  production.    Mr. Qammuh said the economy was moving ahead "with firm  strides towards further growth and stability."    Economic indicators in the first few months of this year  point to continuing economic growth in various sectors of  production and service despite the "wait-and-see situation in  view of the prevailing circumstances in the region," Mr. Qammuh  said.    "We hope to see all Jordan's economic objectives achieved  with the completion of the economic restructuring programme  agreed on with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)," the  minister said, adding that the accomplishments of the past two  years had exceeded expectations.    Mr. Qammuh said that exports rose from JD 213 million in the  first four months of 1993 to JD 292 million in the first quarter  of this year and imports declined from JD 697 million in the  first four months of 1993 to JD 644 million in the same period  of 1994.    The deficit in the fiscal budget has narrowed from JD 69  million to JD 21.7 million in the first four months of this  year, largely due to a decline in expenditure and a rise in  revenues, the minister said.    Mr. Qammuh said that an upsurge in the construction business  provides another indicator of the improvement of the general  economic situation.    In the first four months of last year 2,889 building  licences  were issued against 4,232 in the same period of this year while  the area built during this period this year amounted to nearly a  million square metres, up from 635,000 square metres in the same  period of last year, the minister said.    Mr. Qammuh noted that intial issues in Amman Financial  Market  (AFM) in the first four months of 1994 amounted to JD 79.2  million compared to JD 48.1 million in the same period of 1993.    Mr. Qammuh said the government expects Jordan to achieve a  5.5 percent growth at current fixed prices in the gross domestic  product (GDP). Inflation, he said, is expected at five percent.  A reduction in the fiscal budget by 6.4 percent over the 1993  figures is also expected.    A reduction in the budget deficit from 6.4 percent of the  gross domestic product in 1993 to 5.4 percent this year is also  expected, Mr. Qammuh said.    The government expects a reduction of the deficit in the  current balance of payments from JD 648 million in 1993 to JD  546 million this year, he said.</p>

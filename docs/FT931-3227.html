			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling firms on UK Budget THE POUND gained 2 pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday as dealers absorbed the message from the UK chancellor that the current level of UK base rates was 'consistent with the achievements of the government's inflation objectives', writes James Blitz. In the run-up to yesterday's Budget statement, sterling rose against the German currency from around DM2.3900 at 8.30am to DM2.4050 shortly before the chancellor spoke in the House of Commons. The stronger sentiment towards the pound was based on the correct impression that the chancellor would not ease monetary policy further in his annual budget statement. His announcement that the projected Public Sector Borrowing Requirement for 1994/95 had been raised to Pounds 50bn triggered a  1/2 pfennig loss for the pound at one stage of the speech. However, news of the chancellor's measures to tighten fiscal policy over the next few years helped to boost confidence in sterling on both currency and fixed income markets. The pound closed in London at DM2.4025, up 2 pfennigs on the day. At lunchtime in the US, the UK currency was trading higher at DM2.4045. Mr David Cocker, chief economist at Chemical Bank in London, said yesterday's budget statement would consolidate the favourable sentiment towards sterling seen in recent weeks. He said there were already signs that the UK economy was recovering, and the chancellor's promise to tighten fiscal policy over the next few years would be a further attraction for investors. But he also felt that the budget proposals themselves were unlikely to push the currency up very far. In Europe, the immediate outlook for the European exchange rate mechanism remained uncertain. The Bundesbank's decision not to change the interest rate at which it lends short term funds to German commercial banks added to ERM tensions. Market participants appeared to believe that the Bundesbank would cut its official Lombard and discount rates by 50 basis points at tomorrow's council meeting. However, yesterday's decision to offer a fixed rate repo at the unchanged rate of 8.25 per cent disappointed some dealers. Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London, expressed surprise that the market was so optimistic about an official rate cut following the recent conclusion of the Solidarity Pact talks between the German government and opposition. 'The pact actually revises up the budget deficit forecast for 1995 and there is little reason for the Bundesbank to be optimistic,' he said. At least one trader said the Bank of France was subtly buying its currency to staunch selling. The franc finished at FFr3.4000 to the D-Mark, having been as low as FFr3.4043 on Monday.</p>

			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Defence may be the best attack: Paul Betts and Tony Jackson ask whether BAe's strategy of returning to its roots will reap long-term rewards On the face of it, this has been a brilliant week for British Aerospace. On Monday morning, it announced the Pounds 800m sale of Rover to BMW. Since then, its shares have risen 30 per cent, adding more than Pounds 500m to its market value. With one bold stroke, BAe has returned to its roots: not merely as an aircraft manufacturer, but - more important - as one of the UK's main defence contractors. There are two snags. First, the defence industry - in Europe especially - is becoming ever more viciously competitive. Second, success in defence requires financial clout: that is, a strong balance sheet. As part of the Rover deal, BAe wrote off Pounds 450m. Yesterday it wrote off another Pounds 250m on its turboprop aircraft business. In the course of a single week, its balance sheet has shrunk by more than a third. Despite the cash BAe is getting on the Rover deal, it may not have the resources to develop its defence business alone. The obvious answer, as BAe chief executive Mr Dick Evans told the Financial Times this week, is for BAe ultimately to combine in some way with the UK's other big defence contractor, Lord Weinstock's cash-rich GEC. The scale of the challenge in defence is simply put. Since the end of the cold war, the US has adopted a more liberal attitude to military sales. As a result, its share of the world's defence exports has doubled. From anaverage of about Dollars 6bn a year before 1989, the figure is now Dollars 15bn. On the otherside of the coin, European defence exports have halved from Dollars 10bn-Dollars 12bn a year before the Berlin Wall came down to Dollars 4bn-Dollars 5bn today. In addition, one of BAe's most prized customers shows signs of losing interest. BAe has enjoyed a long and lucrative relationship with Saudi Arabia. Last year alone, it sold the kingdom Tornado aircraft worth Pounds 4bn. There are now signs that military exports tothe Middle East have peaked, at least for the next three or four years, thus forcing BAe and other competing contractors to seek new markets in the Far East. For the company's top management, led by Mr Evans, the picture looks rather different. On their version of events, it has been a long, hard slog from thebrink of the precipice. For the past two years, amid continuing internal tensions, Mr Evans and his team have fulfilled step by step the recovery strategy broadly set out by the company after the forced resignation two years ago of Professor Sir Roland Smith, BAe's controversial chairman. This has involved sweeping restructuring in both the defence and commercial sides of the company's aerospace activities, with more than 25,000 job losses and the closure of three historic plants: Kingston, Hatfield and Preston. So-called non-core businesses havebeen shed to raise cash and cancel debt. Now it has unshackled itself of its automobile operations. 'Some while ago it was already pretty clear to us that it would have been difficult to support both the aerospace and car side of our businesses in the second half of the decade,' explains Mr Evans. 'We decided to exit the car business towards the end of the decade but then we were made a remarkable, unconditional offer from BMW.' So far, so good. But where do the events of the past few days leave the company that once harboured the ambition of combining with Daimler-Benz of Germany to create, in Sir Roland's words, 'the General Motors of Europe'? At the time of BAe's Rover acquisition in 1988, it was fashionable for large car companies to diversify into aerospace. GM bought Hughes; Ford invested heavily in aerospace; Daimler-Benz took charge of the restructuring of the German aerospace industry by creating asubsidiary called Deutsche Aerospace. For BAe, the logic of buying Rover was not so much industrial as financial. The acquisition virtually doubled the company's asset base overnight. With shareholders' funds increasing from Pounds 1.1bn in 1987 to Pounds 2.2bn the following year and annual sales jumping from Pounds 4.1bn to about Pounds 9bn,BAe significantly reinforced its financial firepower to support its defence exports. The military side, where exports account for more than 70 per centof sales, has traditionally been the company's biggest source of profit. By contrast, commercial aerospace activities have been a steady drain. Between 1981 and 1992, the commercial aerospace business, including BAe's regional jets, turbopropeller commuter aircrafts and a 20 per cent stake in the European Airbus largeairliner programme, lost Pounds 1bn, according to Mr Keith Hodgkinson, aerospace analyst at US broker Shearson Lehman. With the sale of Rover, BAe is back to square one. Shareholders' funds are now expected to drop to about Pounds 1.2bn andsales this year to about Pounds 5.5bn, from Pounds 1.78bn and nearly Pounds 10bn respectively in 1992. Mr Evans argues that the sale has strengthened the company's financial base to support its core business. 'The Rover sale will free off a lot of banking capacity which had been devoted to Rover. It will release something in excess of Pounds 2bn, reduce our gearing and help us achieve our longer-term plans for aerospace.' At present, Mr Evans says BAe has no plans to seek fresh funds from shareholders to bolster the company's balance sheet. Instead, the company will shed inessential assets. The next target will be BAe's Arlington Securities property interests, bought during Sir Roland's acquisition spree in the late 1980s. The other immediate priority is to halt the financial haemorrhage from civil aerospace. Although Airbus faces a difficult few years as a result of the sharp fall in the airliner market and increased competition from Boeing, its bigger US rival, Mr Evans believes Airbus is 'without a shadow of doubt an excellent business' with good long-term growth prospects. However, he admits the jury is still out on the future of BAe's regional and commuter aircraft activities. A year ago, BAe tried to resolve the financial problems of its BAe 146 regional jet operations by negotiating a joint venture with Taiwan. But negotiations have been at a standstill for several months and the proposed deal now looksincreasingly likely to collapse. However, while negotiating with Taiwan,BAe cracked down on the cost base of its regional jet operations based at Woodford, near Manchester, and took a Pounds 1bn provision to cover the liabilities on aircraft leases as well as the eventual closure of the 146 line. Mr Evans says the restructuring has helped enhance the performance of the regional jetbusiness, enabling the company to maintain this activity as it seeks out other partners. 'The urgent job now is to find a way forward for our turboprops,' heexplains. The company yesterday took a first big step in addressing the problems of its turboprop Jetstream operations, now concentrated at Prestwick, Scotland, and expected to show an operating loss of about Pounds 120m in 1993. It announced it would make a Pounds 250m provision to cover turboprop leasing liabilities. 'What we are ultimately envisaging is the creation of a joint venture inthe regional and commuter aircraft sector in which we would own a 20-25 per cent stake of the business,' Mr Evans says. Although several City aerospace observers would prefer to see BAe withdraw from the turboprop and regional jet market,Mr Evans still believes there are opportunities. 'The question is whether we can be part of an organisation that dominates this market. You have to benumber one: it's no good being in the second division,' he insists. BAe is thus looking at possible alliances with Aerospatiale of France, Fokker, the Dutch group now controlled by Deutsche Aerospace, and McDonnell Douglas of the US, which is planning to develop a 100-seat version of its MD90 twin engine jet called the MD95. One thing is sure: commercial aircraft activities must stop sapping the profits of BAe's defence business, Mr Evans stresses. But even if BAe resolves the problems of its civil aerospace operations, it must still establish its defence business on a more competitive footing in the post-cold war world. BAe's military aircraft activities, whose spiritual heart is at Warton, Lancashire, are widely recognised as being world class. But industrial excellence and total design capability are no longer enough without scale and financial muscle. Mr Evans has long been convinced that there will be a shake-out in the European industry. 'The Americans are already much further down the road of consolidation and the Europeans will have to respond,' he says. BAe is already in advanced negotiations to merge its guided weapons activities with those of the French Matra-Hachette group - though even that combination will be dwarfed bythe two leading US missiles groups, Hughes and Raytheon. Uncertainties also abound for BAe on existing programmes, most notably on the Eurofighter 2000 due to make its maiden flight in April. BAe acknowledges that this first flight will be psychologically crucial for the aircraft's controversial Pounds 10bn development programme, on which much of the future prospects of BAe's military aircraft production hinge. 'Eurofighter is bloody important, but in defence, politics has always been the problem,' Mr Evans says, referring to Germany's continuing hesitations. The ultimate answer to all this could lie in one of the most dramatic mergers in UK corporate history. BAe and GEC, the two dominant UK defence companies, are in many ways natural partners. The idea of putting them together has been in the air since the early 1980s. Sir Raymond Lygo, former BAe chief executive, had actively sought a merger between the two companies before being turned down by his board. The companies are already working together on naval systems and joined forces two years ago in an unsuccessfulbid for the prime contract on the Royal Navy's EH101 anti-submarine helicopters. Last summer, BAe and Lord Weinstock, GEC's managing director, again held talks to see if the two companies could combine their defence activities into a single group. To Lord Weinstock's particular annoyance, the talks were blown off course when the news leaked out in the Sunday Times. Although BAe is at present not involved in any talks with GEC - 'we've got enough on our plate at the moment', says Mr Evans - the company sees a link-up as inevitable. 'It is not if, it is a question of when,' Mr Evans says. 'The fact of the matter is that the UK customer, HMG, cannot afford to sustain a competitive policy among UK companies.' If the UK wants to maintain its market position and remain the best defence contracting country in Europe, Mr Evans argues, it will have to form a bigger entity to face international competition. GEC, with its cash hoard, would provide a more logical alternative to Rover in BAe's quest for size. Between them, they would constitute the world's second-biggest defence group after Martin Marietta of the US. While the Rover sale thus marks the end of a short and troubled era in the company's history, a link-up with GEC could finally secure BAe's long-term future as a world-class defence contractor.</p>

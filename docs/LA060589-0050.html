			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> TECHNIQUE HELPS DNA BONDING IN ANIMALS  </P> <P> What has been called "a powerful new means for introducing foreign DNA into  animals" has been developed by Italian researchers at the Institute of  Biomedical Technology in Rome. The new technique should make it much simpler  and less expensive to produce transgenic animals (animals carrying a foreign  gene), which are useful in medical research and have great potential value for  agriculture.  </P> <P> Molecular biologist C. Spadafora and his colleagues reported last week in the  journal Cell that they simply incubated mouse sperm cells in a solution  containing the genes they desired to add to the animals. When mouse eggs were  fertilized with this sperm, 30% of the mice obtained had the new genetic trait.  The process had previously been carried out, with less success, by laboriously  inoculating fertilized eggs with the foreign DNA.  </P> <P> In an editorial commentary, geneticist Max Birnstiel of the Research Institute  of Molecular pathology in Vienna, wrote that, "if confirmed by others, this  publication will be a cornerstone in biology, not only because the technique  promises to do away with the laborious and technically demanding needle work .  . . but also because of its potential usefulness for introducing commercially  important features into animal species that have so far proved difficult to  deal with."  </P></p>

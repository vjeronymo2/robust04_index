			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Row over Balladur success The growing tension that Mr Edouard Balladur's rising popularity is causing his rivals was highlighted yesterday after two ministers of the centre-right UDF party triggered a political row by endorsing the Gaullist RPR prime minister for president. Mr Jean-Louis Debre, deputy secretary general of the RPR and a die-hard backer of Mr Jacques Chirac for the Elysee, yesterday criticised Mr Francois Leotard, the defence minister, and Mrs Simone Veil, the social affairs minister, for 'missing a fine occasion to shut up' when in separate TV interviews on Sunday they praised Mr Balladur's presidential potential. Mr Debre said the ministerial pair 'would have done better to have followed Mr Balladur's instructions not to speak now of the presidential election', due in spring 1995. But Mr Balladur himself fuelled speculation about his hopes by saying in an interview, published yesterday in Le Figaro newspaper, that he could not envisage staying in the prime minister's Matignon residence for a full parliamentary term. 'Five years in the Matignon, never. Two years, yes. After that, we will see,' he told the newspaper. But yesterday's row - which was also caused by the UDF's growing preference for Mr Balladur over its nominal leader, Mr Giscard d'Estaing - raises the question of whether Mr Balladur has not shown his hand too early. The health of the 77-year-old President Mitterrand means a presidential poll before May 1995 cannot be ruled out.</p>

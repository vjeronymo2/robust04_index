			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Inflation in the works It is tempting to see the sharp drop in April producer price inflation as justification for last week's base rate cut. But that is altogether too neat. The fall in the headline rate - to 3.8 per cent from 4.5 in March - largely reflected slackening pressures on food, drink and tobacco prices, probably because manufacturers are reluctant to pass on Budget increases. The underlying rate of 2.8 per cent, although low, has barely moved over the past three months. Three factors should continue to restrain wholesale price inflation in the short run: weak raw material prices, a relatively strong currency and downward pressure on wages resulting from both fear of unemployment and tight corporate cash flow. Less clear is how far the recent record can be sustained in the upturn. Unless it can, the UK has little chance of undercutting German interest rates for any length of time. But manufacturers may well be anxious to use any recovery of demand to repair margins, especially in sectors such as metals and fibres, where prices have actually fallen over the past year. Nor is there a direct correlation between producer prices and retail inflation. Admittedly, the worst forecasts may prove exaggerated when April's RPI is announced on Friday. Food, drink and tobacco prices may also be sluggish at the retail level, but the rate will jump from March's 4 per cent as lower mortgage interest rates fall away. And while manufacturers' prices are soft, the service sector has been much slower to respond to treatment.</p>

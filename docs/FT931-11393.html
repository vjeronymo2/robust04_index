			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / US pit strike may hit other coal producers MORE THAN 7,000 miners working for Peabody Coal, the largest coal producer in the US and a subsidiary of UK-based conglomerate Hanson, went on strike yesterday in a dispute over job security and union representation that could soon spread to other big US coal producers. The United Mine Workers union said it was ordering its members at Peabody, who make up the bulk of the company's workforce, not to report for work after negotiations over a new national wage agreement broke down. The old agreement, negotiated in 1988, expired just before midnight on Monday. The dispute is over a refusal by the employers' body, the Bituminous Coal Operators Association, to issue a guarantee in the new wage agreement that its members will employ union workers at their new mines. Without such a guarantee, the union will not negotiate a new national contract, which covers 42,000 of the country's 103,000 mine workers. Mr Thomas Hoffman, a BCOA spokesman, said yesterday: 'Employees should have the right to decide themselves whether they want to be represented by a union or not.' The UMW is seeking a guarantee for its members because in recent years employers have been increasingly using non-union labour at their new mines, a practice which has steadily reduced the UMW's representation among mine workers. In the 1970s, the UMW represented more than 50 per cent of all mine workers. Today, the union represents only 35 per cent. There was no indication from the union yesterday whether it would extend the action to other producers. However, Mr Richard Trumka, president of the UMW, said on Monday: 'If, when and how this strike expands depends entirely on whether the BCOA companies are prepared to bargain.' If the UMW does extend the strike, it could seriously affect production at other big producers. Companies with operations in the Mid-West, where the UMW is heavily represented among miners, would be particularly vulnerable. An extended nationwide strike, however, would not immediately affect coal-users or consumers. Mr Ron McMahan of Resource Data International, a Colorado-based consultancy, estimates that the country's leading electric utilities have stockpiles of coal that would last about 60 days. Peabody, however, is likely to be hit immediately by the strike. The company employs UMW workers at all but one of its 71 mining operations, and the strike will affect about 58 per cent of the company's annual coal output of almost 90m tons. The rest of Peabody's production, all of it concentrated in the western US, would not be affected because these operations have a separate contract with unions. Peabody's parent, Hanson, would also suffer from a prolonged strike. In 1991 it made a profit of Dollars 263.5m on sales of about Dollars 1.7bn, making it the second largest contributor, after tobacco, to Hanson's total earnings. Industry analysts were not surprised that UMW chose Peabody, saying that the company was probably singled out because it is foreign-owned. The union is likely to have judged that industrial action would have had much greater impact if it struck first at a non-US-owned company. This latest miners' strike - the first since the violence-plagued stoppage against the Pittston Coal in 1989 - comes at a time when the coal industry is producing more coal each year with fewer miners. Just after the second world war, the US coal industry employed 320,000 miners who produced about 480m tons of coal a year. By 1979 employment had fallen to 220,000 but production had jumped 781m tons, and by last year, 103,000 miners were producing more than 1bn tons of coal.</p>

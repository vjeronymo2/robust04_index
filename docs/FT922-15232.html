			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / International Company News: Gota Group shareholder pledges support THE BIGGEST shareholder in Gota Group, Sweden's fourth largest bank, was forced to pledge its support yesterday for the loss-making bank following rumours that Gota was close to collapse. Trygg-Hansa SPP, the Swedish insurance group which owns 50 per cent of Gota Group, said it would underwrite the bulk of a SKr2.04bn (Dollars 340m) share issue which is planned this spring. The guarantee means that Gota Group will probably become a consolidated subsidiary of Trygg-Hansa SPP since other shareholders are unlikely to take up the share offer. Trygg-Hansa SPP will also propose installing Mr Bjorn Sprangare, Trygg-Hansa SPP's chief executive officer, as chairman of the Gota Group. Senior management of the bank and its main shareholder met for several hours yesterday to hammer out a way of rebuilding confidence in the loss-making Gota Group. International banks, worried by speculation that Gota was facing a liquidity crisis and was close to collapse, pressed Gota for information about its financial state yesterday. Gota Group plans to raise SKr2.04bn in preference shares - consisting of 151m shares priced at SKr13.5 each. Trygg-Hansa SPP will underwrite SKr1.5bn of the issue. The new capital will be used to pay off a SKr1.5bn perpetual subordinated loan which Trygg-Hansa SPP made to Gota earlier this year. Gota received its SKr1.5bn capital injection from Trygg-Hansa SPP after the bank warned that it faced heavy credit losses for 1991. Operating loss plunged to SKr2.13bn, partly due to the bank's exposure to the real estate sector and the collapse of finance firm Gamlestaden. Gota pointed out that the capital injection was intended as a confidence-building measure. Even before the capital injection, Gota said its capital adequacy ratio was well over the minimum 8 per cent requirement set by the Basle accord. The risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio rose from 9.22 per cent to 11.22 per cent after the capital injection.</p>

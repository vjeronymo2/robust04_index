			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Management: Degree of reluctance - George Bickerstaffe wonders why there are so few women taking MBA courses Women may be taking over top jobs - but the chances are that many do not have an MBA. Business schools, perhaps surprisingly, remain a bastion of maleness. The UK-based Association of MBAs (AMBA), drawing on its own surveys and other data, says that the number of women taking MBA programmes in the UK has struggled to stay around 20 per cent of the total since 1989. Before that it was lower. In the US, in 1991-92, the latest period for which official Department of Education statistics are available, around 35 per cent of masters degrees in management were conferred on women. Anecdotal evidence suggests, however, that female enrolment has since fallen significantly, with some schools said to have dropped from 40 per cent to around 20 per cent. In some top European schools the imbalance may be getting better, but women are still in a clear minority. At Insead outside Paris admissions of women have just risen to 24 per cent, against 17 per cent in the early 1990s. At London Business School 27 per cent of full-time and 25 per cent of part-time MBA students are women, figures which are up on recent years. Only 8 per cent of students taking LBS's new MSc in finance, however, are female. Even at the Open Business School, part of the Open University, less than a quarter of all MBA students are female, although the flexible nature of learning at home might seem better suited to some women. Business schools would love to have more women on their programmes - but they are baffled as to why women apparently show such little interest in the degree. 'You would have thought it would have been an ideal way to break the glass ceiling,' says Leo Murray, director of Cranfield School of Management in the UK (25 per cent women on its full-time and part-time MBAs). Jason Sedine, associate director of international programmes at ISA, the MBA arm of the prestigious grande e'cole HEC in Paris (again 25 per cent women), believes the corporate sector needs to give a lead. 'In certain fields, such as pharmaceutical marketing, for example, women are moving to really high levels, but not yet the very top,' he says. 'Business needs to provide more opportunities and role models for women.' The view that it is continuing discrimination in the workplace that prevents women studying an MBA is widespread. 'They can hit chauvinism in their jobs,' says Helen Henderson, admissions director at Insead. 'People ask them what are they are going to do with their husbands and children when they have to travel internationally.' Sheila Cameron, former MBA programme director at the Open Business School, is not sure that is the whole reason. 'Distance learning requires a heavy financial and time commitment,' she says. 'Women find it very hard to juggle a job, family and study.' She also comments that in general women tend to be more diffident about their abilities than men and seem less willing to invest in their own development. More pragmatically, she points out that the OBS MBA is targeted at experienced managers and there are fewer women than men in that group. Murray also raises the vexed question of age. 'The growing insistence on work experience by MBA programmes tends to work against women,' he says. 'It puts them in their mid to late 20s, which is a key time for marrying and having a family.' Although the numbers on programmes are relatively low, significantly more women who apply are accepted than men. The business schools are adamant that this does not represent positive discrimination. Women simply are better candidates, says Don Martin, director of admissions at the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business. 'There is no question that once on a programme, women perform exactly the same as men. They do every bit as well.' In order to encourage more female recruits Insead has offered sponsored scholarships to women through the pages of Cosmopolitan magazine. Cranfield has had its marketing literature picked over by women MBA students to remove anything that might turn off women. Chicago has revamped its merit-based scholarships to make sure women and minorities are given every opportunity. It has also carried out some nifty marketing. The university's large and leafy campus is on the south side of Chicago, not an area with the best reputation. The school has run a campaign to counteract worries about its location, including paying for women applicants to fly in and get to know the area. One approach that none of these has tried is simply to admit only women. But there is a unique business school in Boston that has been doing just that for the past 20 years. Simmons College Graduate School of Management is thought to be the only all-women MBA programme in the world. It was set up in 1974 by Anne Jardim and Margaret Henig, two women doctoral students at nearby Harvard Business School, outraged by the treatment of women students and by their career prospects. Simmons runs a traditional rigorous MBA programme with added behavioural courses geared to women's experience of the workplace. It works on the premise that men create hierarchical organisations that look to a leader, whereas women are generally more equality-based and participative. Jardim, who once commented memorably that 'the ceiling isn't glass; it's a very dense layer of men', explains why she thinks women do not take MBAs. 'Traditional programmes do not take cognisance of the barriers women have to face,' she says. 'Where that added-value is present, women will buy into it.' Not all business academics accept that this approach is really favourable to women. Many believe that an all-women learning environment is not the ideal preparation for the business world. But Jardim contends that Simmons students are not 'cosseted' and offers to back her graduates against women graduates from any top school.</p>

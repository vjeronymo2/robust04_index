In his interview with Interfax, he reported that shelling of  Karabakh positions is going on every day. Moreover, in his  words, "while waging active offensive operations, the  Azerbaijani party deliberately creates obstacles on the way to  any peacemaking efforts by referring to the existence of various  approaches to settling the conflict: CSCE's and Russia's one."    Petrosyan expressed conviction that "if to throw away the  screen of words and to judge just by deeds, then it becomes  clear that Baku's true goals remain the same, to force a  solution of the Karabakh problem by military means."    That is why, Petrosyan said, the Karabakh party is so  anxious  with respect to guarantees and provisions for Nagorno-Karabakh's  security and is circumspect about peaceful statements voiced by  Azerbaijani leaders.</p>

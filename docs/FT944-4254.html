			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Rule on pensions solvency diluted The government yesterday confirmed that the UK's biggest occupational pension schemes will have to meet a significantly weaker minimum solvency requirement than was initially proposed, when new pensions legislation is introduced next week. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, announced details of some of the thorniest issues raised by the legislation in response to a parliamentary question. The government has been under heavy pressure from employers' groups to ease a solvency requirement that many feared would force them to sell equities - which have historically offered higher returns - from their pension funds and buy gilts, which have lower, though more predictable, total returns. They said such a requirement could have forced employers to put more cash into their schemes. Details of the government's plans to significantly weaken some elements of proposals contained in a June white paper have been circulating in the pensions industry for several weeks. Mr Lilley said schemes with assets of Pounds 100m or more would be allowed to hold equities in respect of about 25 per cent of their current pension liabilities. At present, the actuarial profession considers it imprudent to hold assets other than gilts against pension liabilities. Also, employers with schemes falling short of the minimum solvency requirement will have more time than originally planned to make up the shortfall. Schemes with assets covering less than 90 per cent of liabilities will have a year to make up the shortfall, instead of three months as planned. Schemes with between 90 per cent and 100 per cent cover will have up to five years to regain full solvency. Mr Lilley also outlined how new age-related rebates on national insurance contributions will work. Currently there is a flat-rate rebate for all those contracting out of the state earnings related pension scheme through personal pensions and occupational money purchase schemes, giving much more generous tax breaks to young people but encouraging them to opt back into Serps as they age. Mr Lilley said that because the provision of age-related rebates for those currently nearing retirement age would be very expensive, the rebate would be limited to 9 per cent of relevant earnings.</p>

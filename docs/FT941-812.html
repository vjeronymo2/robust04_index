			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / S African leaders call emergency summit after 18 die in gun battle South Africa's political leaders last night called an emergency summit after gun battles in the heart of Johannesburg's business district left at least 18 people dead and provoked calls for a state of emergency to control violence ahead of next month's elections. Thousands of Inkatha Freedom party supporters, staging an anti-election march in South Africa's commercial capital, attempted to storm the headquarters of the African National Congress. ANC security guards shot at them, killing at least eight. Witnesses said the marchers were also shot at outside the city library, where several were killed by snipers firing from nearby buildings. Police said at least 50 people were injured, but independent sources, who put the death toll at 31, indicated that the casualty figure could be higher. In response to the mayhem, South Africa's four most important political leaders - President FW de Klerk, ANC leader Mr Nelson Mandela, Inkatha leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelethini - are to meet together for the first time at a two-day summit beginning tomorrow. They will discuss ANC demands that troops be sent to Natal province, where at least 55 people were killed last weekend. The Johannesburg killings aroused the country's worst fears of growing violence forcing the delay or abandonment of next month's first all-race elections unless brought under control. Mr Thabo Mbeki, ANC chairman, said a state of emergency would have to be considered to ensure the poll could take place from April 26 to 28. President de Klerk said the time had come for 'urgent consideration . . . of additional measures or steps which can prevent a repetition of what has happened today'. Tension had been building for several days, with Inkatha supporters angered by ANC threats to depose Chief Buthelezi and his KwaZulu administration. For the first time in a decade of violence in and around Johannesburg, large-scale unrest broke out in the city centre itself, within earshot of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange where share prices fell sharply. The city was last night declared an 'unrest area' by Mr Hernus Kriel, minister of law and order, giving police special powers. In past outbreaks of political violence, South African leaders have rapidly stabilised the position. But as the election draws closer, defusing crises has become more difficult.

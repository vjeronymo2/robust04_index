			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Travel: Ghana: do not rely on magic before 3am - Leslie Downer reaches Accra ahead of the trampling crowd IN 1972 the Meridien was one of the most splendid hotels in Africa. Straddling the Greenwich meridian, it was the tallest building in Ghana, so high that people said it made them dizzy. When you stepped into the lobby from the heat and dust outside, it was as icy as a fridge. There were liveried bellboys, chandeliers, a fountain with four etiolated stone figures in it and marble floors so polished you could slide across them. Outside was a huge pool with a diving board and terraces with lawns and trees, like an oasis from the tropical heat. Most decadent of all was the casino, the Zero Room (the meridian is zero degrees of longitude). The hotel is in Tema, at that time a spanking new port city, the Wanchai or the Marseilles of Ghana, and the Zero Room was always packed with reckless buccaneering types with money to spend - seamen, adventurers, international travellers. Tuxedoed croupiers with white gloves manned the roulette tables and fortunes were won and lost. For schoolboys up from the bush it was an awe-inspiring sight. One recalls how he timidly put a few pence into a fruit machine. Bells started ringing, people gathered round, and money began tumbling out. Finally the cashier came and counted all the coins and changed them into notes. It came to more than Pounds 100. Today you would never guess at the Meridien's splendid past. The air-conditioning was turned off years ago, and shipping offices now occupy the luxury suites. The floors are scratched and grimy, the lifts do not work, the chandeliers have been ripped out and replaced with dangling light bulbs and the pool is dry and crumbling. Plastic sheets cover the tables in the Zero Room. Ghana is a great place for intimations of mortality. It is full of crumbling stucco, grand buildings gone to seed, deserted hotels where elegant young men once propped up the bar, and fine straight roads pitted with potholes. You can see the history of the past 20 years etched into the fabric of the place. It is a sad tale of extravagance, incompetent government and spectacular corruption. Colonel Acheampong, the military ruler from 1972 to 1978, was accused of having salted away Dollars 100m in Swiss bank accounts before meeting his come-uppance, and things got so bad that when the rains didn't come everyone said it was Acheampong's fault. 'I am not God,' he replied. Since then there has been desperate hardship. As recently as 1988 there was starvation and airlifts of food, though now the economy is improving at last and there are goods in the shops again. We arrived in Ghana at the height of the dry season, when red dust swirls around and gets into your toes, eyes and hair. Accra, the capital, is a city which has not sealed itself off from nature as successfully as most. The red dust encroaches everywhere. Instead of pavements, you walk along the edge of the road, on dusty rutted verges. There are palm trees and scrubby grass between the squat buildings and rows of coconut palms edging the ocean. Accra spreads for miles along wonderful silver beaches. You can sit at the bar of the Riviera, another faded hotel with a dried-out pool, and watch the Atlantic breakers, yet still be in the heart of the city. At night, bullfrogs croak hoarsely from the stagnant drainage channels which line the streets, and cicadas trill; in the morning you might be woken by cocks crowing. Besides its romantic seediness, the seductive thing about Ghana is that almost no-one knows about it. In Accra the white faces belong to businessmen and engineers, often British; in the port cities they belong to seamen, who seem ill at ease at the sight of a white woman. Perhaps it is because, like all port cities, there is a sizeable red-light district, and a white woman reminds them too forcibly of their reproachful wives back home. The most romantic of the port cities is Takoradi, a four-hour drive down a mercifully unpitted road from Accra, through lush rainforest and groves of coconut palms. Like everywhere in Ghana, it has seen better days. But it is still a grand and leisurely town, with broad boulevards which lead past tumbledown stuccoed buildings with shutters and parapets, up to the Harbour View. We sat here and had beer and pepper kebabs, while the seamen at the neighbouring tables, each with his prostitute, avoided my eye. Boats tacked back and forth and there was even a railway line - though, like everything in Ghana, it is nothing but a memento of better times. People walk up and down the line with bundles on their heads, and in all the time I was there I never saw a train. In the evening, like everyone else, we took a stroll along the main street. Ghana is practically on the equator and the climate is like a perfect June day all year round, with hot days and balmy nights. Life really begins at dusk, when everyone emerges from the cool of their houses. People squat in doorways, laze on doorsteps or parade up and down, laughing and talking. The grand decaying buildings turn into a backdrop and tiny stalls spring up in their shadows, lit by flickering yellow kerosene flames, the only street-lighting there is. Between two decrepit stone lions a couple of women swathed in brightly-coloured cloths were selling whole smoked fish, balanced in intricate piles, and kenkei, steamed maize meal in bamboo leaves. Other stalls offered rice, 'bush meat,' goat stew, plantain, tea (with evaporated milk - there is no fresh milk in Ghana), ice-cream, cigarettes or biscuits. We had decided to take in a magic show at the Zenith Hotel. Outside, posters proclaimed that the world-famous Professor De-ago would kill his wife Nana Ama, cut open her stomach, pull out her intestines, eat them, and then bring her back to life. This had to be seen. We paid our 300 cedis (about 50p) and went in. The 'hotel' turned out to be a theatre, with a balcony and a huge stage. Once our eyes got used to the darkness we saw that there were only hard school benches to sit on, and the stage was lit by two lightbulbs swinging from a cord. By midnight, nothing had happened. Magic, apparently, never begins until at least 3am. We finally gave up and went to bed. For all its mood of grand decay, things are definitely looking up in Ghana. Foreign investors are returning and in the last couple of years several luxury hotels have opened, even more splendid than the Meridien used to be. Last August saw the opening of Ghana's first five-star hotel, the Labadi Beach, in Accra. Stepping in from the hot dusty road outside is a positively surreal experience. The vaulted lobby, of Ghanaian timber, is as icy as a fridge. Outside a fountain plays, surrounded by lawns and flower-beds, as green and lush as an oasis. The only thing missing is a casino. Ghana is gearing itself to welcome tourists, though for adventurous travellers now is the time to go. Four airlines fly to Ghana from the UK: BA, KLM, Swissair and Ghana Airways. The fare is about Pounds 1,112 for a one-month return (PEX up to 25 days: Pounds 919), or a little over Pounds 500 through a bucket shop. Accommodation: There are hotels to suit every taste and pocket in Accra. Kyn's Hotel in Osu has air-conditioned doubles for about Pounds 13 a night; the Sunrise has smarter rooms and a pool for about Pounds 30; the Labadi Beach offers luxury and the best beach in town for Dollars 180. In Takoradi the best hotel is the Ahenfe, with doubles about Pounds 11.50 a night. Maps and guidebooks: There is an excellent map put out by KLM and Shell (Pounds 7.95). Lonely Planet's West Africa: A Travel Survival Kit, (Pounds 7.95) has useful information. If you can get it, Ghana, A Travel Guide, published by the Ghana Tourist Board, is much more detailed and less opinionated.</p>

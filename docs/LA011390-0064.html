			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THIS TIME THEIR TEARS WERE FOR JOY  </P> <P> The two brothers embraced for more than a minute, both approaching tears, while  cameras clicked and television lights glared as a 15-year separation that began  with the fall of Saigon came to an end.  </P> <P> In the middle of Arrival Area B at Los Angeles International Airport on Friday  morning, Tuoi Nguyen of Oceanside was reunited with his brother, Cuong Huu  Nguyen, who had just been released from a Vietnamese "re-education camp" after  serving 6 1/2 years of an eight-year sentence.  </P> <P> About 100 friends and relatives were on hand to greet Cuong Nguyen and Ha Hieu  Ho, Christian ministers and cellmates in Vietnam, and their families.  </P> <P> Among the well-wishers were 30 Vietnamese ministers from the West Coast and  Canada, including representatives of four of the five Vietnamese churches in  San Diego.  </P> <P> "I really didn't expect this many people," Cuong Nguyen said through tears.  </P> <P> Nguyen, who will live with a nephew in Poway, and Ho were the first former  Vietnamese political prisoners allowed to emigrate to the United States under  an accord reached in July between Washington and Hanoi after seven years of  negotiations. About 700 former prisoners from Vietnam are expected to arrive in  the United States by the end of January, according to the State Department,  many of them in San Diego County.  </P> <P> Yet neither Nguyen nor Ho wanted to leave his country. Each would have  preferred to take his ministry to the Vietnamese people.  </P> <P> "Persecution as a Christian minister is a matter of fact in a communist  country. I was prepared for that," said Nguyen, 49, whose Saigon church was  shut down when he was arrested in 1983. "I feel happy about being persecuted  for my faith. It is a blessing.  </P> <P> "The arrest of ministers has strengthened the faith of the church members  because they come closer to God, and through their faith and their prayers, God  has been working."  </P> <P> Nguyen, who said he was not mistreated in prison, said he and Ho quietly  converted more than 200 people to Christianity while in the camps.  </P> <P> Since 1975, Christianity has been oppressed in Vietnam, and Christians meeting  in private homes rely on tourists to smuggle in Bibles. Nguyen does not see  that oppression ending.  </P> <P> He and Ho were the only two ministers in the first wave of 300 freed political  prisoners who will come to the United States in the next week. Mechanical  problems with the airplane that was to take the 300 to Tokyo prevented all but  Nguyen, Ho and their families from making the Friday flight. Another flight had  15 open seats, and Nguyen and Ho were among the lucky ones to get on.  </P> <P> One welcomer who served three years in the prison camps and then escaped the  country in 1980 recalled some of his experiences with Nguyen as a Christian in  Vietnam.  </P> <P> "We had a lot of hard times together after the fall of Saigon," said Luc  Nguyen, who, with Cuong Nguyen, had led a Christian youth group that flourished  during that country's civil war. Luc, no relation, now lives in Garden Grove  and operates a construction firm. "We got together after I got out of camp just  to fellowship together, and the communist government nearly put me back into  the camps."  </P> <P> To some, the release of Nguyen and Ho was a surprise, although those who had  been working closely with the State Department said it had been expected for  more than a year.  </P> <P> But Sinh Nguyen, Cuong Nguyen's nephew, said he had stopped listening to  promises of a release from the Vietnam government.  </P> <P> "They have been promising for so long now," Sinh Nguyen said. "I did not  believe it until he got to Bangkok."  </P> <P> For brother Tuoi Nguyen, the anticipation of Cuong's arrival was  nerve-wracking.  </P> <P> Friday started at 4 a.m. for Tuoi, 57. He couldn't sleep. He knew the flight  wasn't to arrive until 5 1/2 hours later and that immigration would take at  least another hour.  </P> <P> But, with the moon still high in the sky and the colors of sunrise making only  a faint impression, he and his wife left their Oceanside house to start the  two-hour trip.  </P> <P> After a stop in Westminster to pick up his daughter, Bich Loan, and her family,  they were back on Interstate 405. The heavy traffic made Tuoi Nguyen visibly  anxious as he wrung his hands and frequently checked his watch. "Will we be  late?" he asked, despite the early hour.  </P> <P> A picture published in The Times of his brother and Ho at the Tokyo airport  only whetted his appetite.  </P> <P> "He looks good. He looks very good," Tuoi Nguyen said, although he could not  tell for certain whether his brother had lost weight, noting only that his face  looked a little thinner.  </P> <P> "He's thin and skinny, but he's smiling," said Tuoi's sister Nga Nguyen Do, who  had flown from Seattle to greet her brother. Do also had not seen Nguyen since  1975, when she fled Vietnam.  </P> <P> Nephews, nieces and grandchildren too young to know Nguyen but old enough to  understand what he has accomplished nodded reverently at the picture.  </P> <P> When Do saw him in person, her eyes filled with tears as they hugged.  </P> <P> And Nguyen, despite his reservations about leaving Vietnam, said he is glad to  have found a new home.  </P> <P> "I just want to express my appreciation for the people who have been working  for my release and bringing me to the United States," he said, "and my  appreciation to the American people that they will receive me here."  </P></p>

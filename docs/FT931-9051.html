			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: PNG may compromise over mine stake THE GOVERNMENT of Papua New Guinea yesterday indicated that it was willing to compromise in a dispute with Australian mining groups over its shareholding in the giant Porgera gold mine. Mr Masket Iangalio, the mining and petroleum minister, told a conference in Sydney that the government's 10 per cent stake was insufficient and claimed that PNG citizens would become frustrated if it was not increased. However, he said there was 'room for negotiation' on the government's demand for a 30 per cent shareholding, which has been resisted by the joint venture partners. Talks are to resume later this week between the government and Placer Pacific, Renison Goldfields and Highlands Gold, a PNG-registered subsidiary of MIM Holdings, which each own 30 per cent of Porgera. The government claimed last year that it had been misled about the potential profitability of the mine, which began production in September 1990, and is expected to produce about 900,000 troy ounces of gold a year. Mr Iangalio said the government had reached understandings with the joint venturers on most of the outstanding issues. 'We would love to have 30 per cent, but if we feel comfortable about it then there is room for negotiation,' he said. The PNG government said it had captured the rebel stronghold of Arawa on Bougainville island, where secessionist fighters have forced the closure of the Panguna copper mine. Mr Paias Wingti, Prime Minister, urged the rebel Bougainville Revolutionary Army to abandon its four year fight for independence. However, rebel representatives in the Solomon Islands said the government had captured only part of the town. They said the BRA would fight on. Up to 200 people have died in the fighting, and hundreds are feared to have died from lack of medical supplies. The rebellion was triggered by protests over royalty agreements with CRA, the Australian resources group which operated the copper mine.</p>

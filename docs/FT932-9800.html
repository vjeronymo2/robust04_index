			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Fiat issues code of business ethics for workforce FIAT, Italy's biggest private company, yesterday sought to distance itself from the growing political corruption scandal by issuing a new 'code of business ethics'. The move is expected to be followed by other big Italian companies, including the state-owned Eni energy and chemicals group, which has also been implicated in allegations of corruption and kickbacks on public-sector contracts. The code, drawn up by a team of lawyers headed by Mr Franzo Grande Stevens, a close adviser of Fiat's controlling Agnelli family, sets out behaviour for employees towards government officials, political parties and civil servants. It supplements an existing 'internal' code regarding issues such as conflicts of interest and insider trading. The document, approved at a special board meeting yesterday, specifically forbids any form of bribery or kickbacks involving the public sector. The ban also applies to any financial inducements to public servants or politicians in covert form, such as sponsorship, advertising or cosmetic 'consultancy' agreements. 'No group employee must promise or pay money or benefits in kind of whatever nature or value to any public sector official to promote or favour the interests of one or more group companies, even as a result of illegal pressure,' it says. Though not made explicit, the penality for non-observance would be termination of a worker's contract. The same requirements will have to be met by sub-contractors or freelances working on behalf of Fiat or its subsidiaries, which will have to make a commitment to respect the strict conditions. All employees whose jobs are likely to expose them to the areas covered by code will have to sign a copy of the document. The company said implementation throughout the group would be slow, as the code would only come into operation in each of the roughly 1,000 separate companies after being approved by their respective boards. The code does not extend to dealings with other private sector companies or the behaviour of Fiat executives abroad, although the company said it was expected that the code would in time be extended outside Italy. Fiat employees most likely to be asked to sign are those dealing with sales and marketing, relations with the public sector and lobbying, and purchasing.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, March 30 (AFP) -- Major French insurance  group AGF reported Wednesday [30 March] that it made a  group-share consolidated net profit of 977 million francs (170  million dollars) last year, down 35 percent from 1.49 billion  francs in 1992.    New chairman Antoine Jeancourt-Galignani said that banking  activities (losses of Comptoir des Entrepreneurs and of Banque  du Phenix) had depressed the group result by 2.5 billion francs.    He said the goup's over-all result should improve this year.</p>

			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: What the experts think - Scheherazade Daneshkhu seeks guidance from three advisors WE ASKED three independent financial advisers for their choice of investments to produce income. All emphasised the need to spread risk through a well-balanced portfolio of equities, deposits and bonds. RICHARD BOYTON, of Boyton Financial Services: 'What investors must look for is total return - that is, both income and capital growth.' For a single, basic-rate taxpayer, he suggests buying National Savings income bonds and investing in an international bond fund: 'Both GT and Baring are based in Ireland, pay their dividends gross, and are well-managed.' Many people do not make use of their annual capital gains tax allowance, now Pounds 5,800. Recently, Ivory &amp; Sime launched its ISIS investment trust with the aim of providing income by exploiting the CGT But Boyton is unimpressed by this and similar high-income packaged products: 'I'm not so sure these products are without risk.' He prefers zero coupon preference shares in a split-capital investment trust to take advantage of the CGT allowance. As their name suggests, these do not pay income. All the return from a zero comes as capital growth, which is taxed as capital gain. His choice is Exeter Zero Dividend preference fund. Boyton says the investments so far should account for 49 per cent of the portfolio. Another 3 per cent should be held in cash and the remainder placed in equities, where he suggests the following investment trusts: Alliance, Electric &amp; General, Foreign &amp; Colonial, Murray International and TR Far East: 'All have an impeccable reputation and the expectation of an increasing income stream together with capital growth.' Finally, for exposure to capital growth over a five-year period, Boyton likes Murray Smaller Markets. TONY SHEPHERD, of Shepherd Associates, believes people must accept they cannot get the same level of income as before. He also believes packaged high-income or guaranteed products are unnecessary so long as the portfolio is structured well. Taking a retired married couple as a sample, he would place 41 per cent in cash and fixed interest with the balance in longer-term equities. Twelve per cent would be in a tax-exempt special savings account (which pays tax-free interest after five years on a staggered total investment of Pounds 9,000), cash on deposit in a bank, and in Fidelity's cash unit trust. The National Savings element is the index-linked sixth issue, which pays 3.25 per cent tax-free above the rate of inflation. Another 29 per cent is in bonds and gilts. Shepherd chooses Fidelity's Gilt and Fixed Interest UK bond fund and the international bond funds of Kleinwort Benson and Baring. The gilts are Conversion 9 per cent 2000 and Treasury index-linked 2 per cent 2006. 'These low risk investments are designed to provide a balance of liquidity, inflation protection and some prospects of capital return.' The equity side of the portfolio aims to provide long-term security through capital growth. For UK exposure, Shepherd likes the income funds of James Capel, M &amp; G and Schroder. The funds invested in Europe would be Lazard's European Growth, M &amp; G European Dividend and Morgan Grenfell European Growth, with Fidelity's Controlled Risk America fund for the US. Finally, the Far East funds would be Save &amp; Prosper's South East Asia, James Capel's Japan Growth, and Schroder's Tokyo. DAVID HARRIS, of Chantrey Vellacott, is no fan of high-income packaged products, but he does favour the income shares of Johnson Fry's Utilities trust with a yield of 9 per cent. Traditionally, utilities have paid high dividends and some fund managers are using this as the basis for a high-income fund. Harris regards Cazenove's Utility and Bond fund, which is packaged within a Pep, as good value. With interest rates low, he does not think this is the time to buy annuities or guaranteed income bonds. Instead, he prefers Whittingdale's Gilt Income fund and Fidelity's Gilt &amp; Fixed Interest, and thinks Pibs are a useful way to boost income although their prices have been rising. He likes Britannia and Bradford &amp; Bingley.</p>

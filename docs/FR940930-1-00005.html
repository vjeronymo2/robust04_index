This action is in response to a petition by Public Citizen and Aviation Consumer Action Project to increase the minimum liability limit from $1,250 to $1,850 per passenger. The Department is also requesting comment on two alternate proposals: (1) to raise the minimum limit to $1,850 with a mechanism that automatically provides for periodic future increases, or (2) to raise the minimum liability limit to $2,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments are requested by November 29, 1994.

Reports submitted to the Department by the major airlines indicate that over 2.2 million mishandled baggage reports were filed by passengers in 1993, although it is unknown how many of those reports resulted in claims for compensation. When baggage is lost, damaged, or delayed, the airlines are prohibited by federal regulation (14 CFR Part 254) from limiting their liability to less than $1,250 per passenger for provable damages. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The rule applies to flights on large aircraft (aircraft designed to carry more than 60 passengers), and to any flight segment included on the same ticket as a flight segment using large aircraft.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The amount of the minimum liability limit was last amended by a final rule effective April 10, 1984, issued by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) before its ``sunset'' (ER&hyph;1374, 49 FR 5065, February 10, 1984). The $1,250 figure was calculated based upon the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPIU) between the date of the previous amendment and September 1983. When setting the limit, the CAB attempted to balance the amount necessary to cover the value of most passengers' baggage while still allowing the airlines to protect themselves from extraordinary claims.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On December 22, 1993, the Department received a petition for rulemaking from Public Citizen and Aviation Consumer Action Project to increase the minimum liability limit in order to account for inflation since the 1984 amendment. The petitioners suggest that the limit should be raised to $1,850, calculated by increasing the current $1,250 limit proportionate with the increase in the CPIU from 1983 until the approximate time a new final rule would take effect (estimated to be one year from the date of the petition). A letter in support of the petition was filed by Mr. Michael Kees, a consumer who recently suffered a loss in excess of the liability limit, who asserts that a more realistic limit today would be $2,500.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that in September 1983, the CPIU was 100.7 (using a 1982&hyph;84 = 100 reference base). As of April 1994, the CPIU had increased by 46.4 percent to 147.4. Stated differently, the purchasing power of a $1,250 maximum baggage claim award in 1983 had eroded to $854 in April 1994 dollars. To keep up with the 46.4 percent increase in the CPIU as of April 1994, the minimum liability limit would have to increase to $1,830. The Department believes that in addition to the direct monetary effect on consumers, an unrealistically low minimum liability limit invites the airlines simply to pay the claims rather than to address the causes of lost, damaged, and delayed baggage. The Department therefore proposes to raise the minimum liability limit to $1,850 as suggested in the petition, and seeks comment on this proposal. Carriers are requested to submit the following data on domestic baggage claims for calender year 1993 as well: (1) the total number of domestic <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  baggage claims for reimbursement and the total amount claimed (i.e., the amount that the claimants requested); (2) the total amount paid by the carrier in settling those claims; and (3) the number and total dollar amount of such claims that exceeded $1,250, and the number and total dollar amount that exceeded $1,850. This information will help the Department to assess the economic burden of the proposal on the affected airlines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A ``domestic'' claim for this purpose is one that is subject to Part 254. For example, a claim concerning a problem that occurred on a domestic segment of an international trip would not be included since such transportation is governed by the Warsaw Convention rather than by Part 254.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

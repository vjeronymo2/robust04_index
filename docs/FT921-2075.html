			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Sharp increase reported in fraud losses LOSSES resulting from fraud more than doubled between 1987 and last year, KPMG Forensic Accounting, an offshoot of KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, reported yesterday. Analysis of cases in which fraud-related criminal charges were brought shows total losses through fraud of Pounds 163m in 1987 and Pounds 376m last year. The number of fraud cases per year increased from 45 in 1987 to 75 last year. The figures for last year do not take into account possible fraud emerging from the collapse of the Maxwell empire. KPMG has set up a 'fraud barometer' to measure the incidence of fraud and monitor trends. Results will be published three times a year. Its decision to examine only reported frauds involving losses of more than Pounds 100,000 means that it will present a limited picture of the extent of fraud in the UK, much of which remains unreported. KPMG says its analysis of the 279 reported frauds since 1987 - involving an estimated Pounds 1.2bn - provides useful information for companies about the pattern of fraud. Many companies concentrate on systems to give protection against employee fraud, which is believed to be a prime area of risk. The KPMG figures show, however, that employee fraud accounted for only a quarter of the cases and only 13 per cent of the money lost. The figures indicate that companies are far more at risk from management fraud, which accounted for 33 per cent of the cases surveyed by KPMG and 39 per cent of the money lost. But the greatest risk comes from external fraud, which accounted for 38 per cent of the cases and 46 per cent of the money lost. External fraudsters include gangs which target and defraud particular companies. Banks and other financial institutions are still the most common victims of fraud, accounting for 31 per cent of the cases and 37 per cent of the money at risk. The public is the next biggest group of victims. KPMG says the increase in fraud is linked partly with the 1980s growth in share ownership, which attracted unsophisticated investors into the markets. The firm says they became easy targets for unscrupulous investment advisers such as Barlow Clowes. There has also been a big increase in mortgage frauds in recent years - these were perpetrated in the housing boom of the 1980s and are coming to light as prices fall. KPMG says fraud increases during a recession because frauds committed during the boom are difficult to conceal in an economic downturn. A downturn can also trigger fraud as managements try to stave off creditors by painting a false financial picture of their businesses.</p>

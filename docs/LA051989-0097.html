			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> EDWARD MORGAN IN ARPINO'S 1977 'TOUCH ME'  </P> <P> To a fervent gospel recording by the Rev. James Cleveland and the Charles Fold  Singers, a black, bare-chested male in pleated white culottes kicks high,  reaches wide, rolls his hips, walks on his knees, flings his voluminous garment  up over one shoulder like a toga and reels back from passages of flailing  intensity into poses of soulful pride.  </P> <P> No, the Alvin Ailey company isn't back in town. This is "Touch Me," the 1977  solo that Gerald Arpino created for Christian Holder and revived this Joffrey  Ballet season for Edward Morgan.  </P> <P> It graced an otherwise familiar program Wednesday in the Dorothy Chandler  Pavilion and showed Morgan to be a dancer of great power and versatility. It  also displayed Arpino's fluency in a modern-dance vocabulary that had nothing  in common with his usual lyric/virtuosic classicism.  </P> <P> You could argue, of course, that Arpino was merely working in Ailey's shadow  here. However, the results had greater integrity and relevance to the  accompaniment than what Peter Martins and New York City Ballet inflicted on the  music of Ray Charles in "A Fool for You" (telecast a week ago on PBS). And  Morgan's performance gave the borrowed dance-rhetoric superb immediacy.  </P> <P> In George Balanchine's "Cotillon," Deborah Dawn danced stylishly as the  Mistress of Ceremonies. However, Julie Janus and Peter Narbutas looked none too  secure in the severely conventionalized mime and rapid, intricate cycles of  supported turns of the "Hand of Fate" pas de deux.  </P> <P> Completing the program: Arpino's "Round of Angels" and "Light Rain," which were  both substituted for other Arpino ballets that could not be performed due to  dancer injuries.LEWIS SEGAL  </P></p>

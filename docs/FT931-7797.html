			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / UN relief convoy due in Kabul THE United Nations sent a convoy of trucks carrying 16 tonnes of medicines and blankets for the thousands of wounded to the shell-shattered Afghan capital Kabul yesterday despite the lack of a permanent ceasefire, Reuter reports from Islamabad. Mr Sotirios Mousouris, UN special envoy, said he had decided not to wait for a formal ceasefire from the two main warring factions of President Burhanuddin Rabbani and arch rival Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, chief of the dissident hardline Hezb-i-Islami party. More than 1,000 people have been killed and 6,000 wounded in a month of rocket and artillery bombardments between the two sides. Both the main warring parties have agreed to a UN request for a 72-hour ceasefire in Kabul to allow evacuation of badly wounded civilians and a shipment of medical supplies but have still to set a date and time. The UN convoy left the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar on the 280 km journey to the Afghan capital early yesterday.</p>

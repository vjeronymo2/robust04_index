			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Dish installations decline: FT satellite monitor INSTALLATIONS of satellite dishes fell to 57,000 last month, according to the latest FT satellite monitor. The monthly figure compares with 71,000 in May, and a total of 94,000 in April. In June last year the figure was 64,000. The total number of homes with satellite receivers is now just over 2.5m. However, there has been a significant rise in those saying that they definitely intend to get a satellite dish, probably as a result of publicity surrounding the purchase of rights to live Premier League football games by British Sky Broadcasting. Those who say they will definitely get a dish increased in June from 67,000 homes to 403,000. This takes the total size of the satellite market in Britain - those who have a dish or say they will definitely or probably get one - to more than 5m for the first time. The FT monitor is produced by Continental Research, and is based on monthly telephone interviews with more than 4,000 adults. The share of satellite television viewing in homes equipped for it declined from 33.5 per cent in March to just over 30 per cent in May, the last month for which figures are available. For the first time, however, the audience share of Screensport - owned by a consortium including French and US companies - has equalled BSkyB's Sky Sports. Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake in BSkyB.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In a speech to a Democratic Socialist Party  convention on the morning of 7 June, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  said: "We have to form a political group capable of competing  against the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and taking the reins  of government in a dignified manner." In this way, he again  indicated that he would make the Hata administration a  full-fledged government and carry out political reorganization  while considering forming a new political party.    After attending the convention, Hata returned to the prime  minister's official residence. There, he was asked by reporters  about his speech at the convention. Hata said: "The hasty  formation of (new parliamentary group) `Kaishin' created  confusion. So, we have to proceed slowly next time. In the  initial stage, the political group I mentioned should function  as a parliamentary group. But in the future, I think it should  become a political party." His remark suggests that he will  first form a new parliamentary group that includes the Social  Democratic Party of Japan.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Copenhagen, May 15 (XINHUA) -- Danish Foreign  Minister Niels Petersen and Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National  Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference (CPPCC), today expressed the hope that exchanges and  friendly relations between their two countries will be further  increased and strengthened.    In his talks with Petersen, Li, who arrived here Friday for  a  four-day visit, said Denmark was among the first Western  countries to recognize the People's Republic of China and since  the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two  countries in 1950, bilateral cooperation has been developed  considerably in the political, economic, scientific and cultural  fields.    In recent years, the traditional Sino-Danish friendship has  been further strengthened thanks to the efforts of both sides,  he said.    There have been more exchanges of high-level visits between  the two sides while bilateral economic and trade relations have  been increasing, he added.    Li also noted that a number of large and medium-sized Danish  enterprises have invested in China and built factories there  while some others are ready to do more business in the country.    The Chinese leader told Petersen that in its development of  national economy, China needs to learn the advanced technology  and managerial expertise of developed countries including  Denmark.    There are great potentials of and broad prospects for  Sino-Danish cooperation, said Li.    "We are willing to further develop friendship and  cooperation  with Denmark on the basis of seeking common grounds and  reserving differences and of equality and mutual benefit," Li  declared.    Petersen said Denmark and China have traditional friendly  relationship and bilateral trade in recent years has increased  considerably.    The Danish foreign minister told Li that his country pays  great attention to the development of relations with China.    He also praised China's economic achievements and expressed  his confidence that Li's visit to Denmark will further promote  bilateral cooperation.

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: A saver for travellers - Annual insurance policies can offer good value If you throw away automatically all the glossy leaflets that fall out of the envelope with your bank and credit card statements each month, for once you could actually miss something useful. Your bank, building society or card issuer might have been touting an annual travel insurance policy which could save you time and money. With single-trip insurance, a couple spending a week skiing and a two-week summer holiday in Europe each year would be lucky to spend less than Pounds 100 to cover both. Once children, weekend breaks, business trips and holidays outside Europe enter the picture, the attractions of an all-inclusive family policy for as little as Pounds 109 become clear. Annual policies usually provide cover for an unlimited number of overseas trips and their convenience and cost-effectiveness have been strong factors in their growing appeal. But another reason could be the increasingly common habit of taking more frequent holidays abroad, particularly short breaks. Most of the clearing banks and large building societies now have own-brand policies, as do several specialist travel insurers, American Express, the travel club Wexas, and health insurer BUPA. Insurance broker Towry Law is the latest to join the crowd. A lucky few consumers may have annual travel insurance already. Some gold cards include it in their high annual fee while Clinicare has travel insurance as part of its private medical cover. Recent policy launches are showing a tendency towards greater sophistication, not to mention complication. You can now opt for budget, standard or deluxe cover; reduce premiums by going for a high excess or ruling out trips to North America; opt out of baggage cover; choose higher or lower cancellation limits, and so on. Some policies even offer overseas motor breakdown insurance as an optional extra. The numerous quirks and options available mean that it is well worth shopping around to find the most appropriate deal for your own circumstances. Unfortunately, some of the better-value schemes have limited availability. Midland's policy is available only to its credit card-holders and a more or less identical policy is available only to First Direct customers. With some of the cheaper policies, watch out for an overall limit on the amount of time you spend abroad each year. If there is one, it is usually 100 days or more. This should not create any difficulty for the average working person but could be a problem if, say, you have a house in France or Spain and spend a lot of time there. All the policies have time limits per trip (to stop them being used by expatriates returning to the UK once or twice a year); these range from one to three months. Should your home contents policy already cover your luggage and personal possessions, insurers such as Bradford &amp; Bingley, National &amp; Provincial, Lloyds Bank, Towry Law and Frizzell offer premiums 15 to 20 per cent lower if you opt out of baggage cover. Skiers should be aware that some policies exclude winter sports, although most cover up to 17 days' skiing a year automatically while the Midland and First Direct policies set no limit on skiing holidays. Devotees of other sports should ask specifically if they are covered. Likewise, business travellers should check that their chosen policy also is valid for business travel. The Halifax, for example, excludes business travel altogether while the Bradford &amp; Bingley charges an extra Pounds 24.50 to extend the policy for unlimited business trips. Older travellers may have difficulty finding an annual policy as many insurers impose an age limit for annual cover of 60 or 65. Indeed, some refuse customers older than this, and others charge substantially more. Towry Law has an age limit of 71 for its standard rates while Bradford &amp; Bingley charges Pounds 130 for over-65s. Some insurers let you choose if you want a partner and children to be able to travel separately from the main person insured. The Crispin Speers family premium quoted in the table covers a spouse and up to three children for travel with or without the first person insured, but Pounds 25 less buys cover if they only ever travel as a family group. It is always worth reading the small print, preferably before you sign up for the policy - although it can be surprisingly difficult to get hold of full policy details before you make up your mind. A keen-eyed reader could discover, for instance, that Columbus will not cover cancellation costs if you lose your job - but will cover delays due to acts of terrorism. In general, areas to check particularly carefully include excesses, limits on individual items and money, and overall limits for cancellation costs. Also, you should let the insurer know if you have any medical problems; otherwise, you could find it will refuse to pay up if you become ill on holiday.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Annual Travel Insurance  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                          Single       Family  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Amex                 Pounds 130   Pounds 179 Barclays              Pounds 98   Pounds 126 BUPA                 Pounds 130   Pounds 185 Brad. &amp; Bing.

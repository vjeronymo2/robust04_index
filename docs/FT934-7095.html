			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Western banks plunged into Russian politics: A pre-election financial curb With the issue of a single presidential decree, western bankers have become embroiled in the politics of the Russian elections. Three weeks before the elections to a new parliament, the Russian government has imposed restrictions which it condemned as reactionary when they were demanded by the old parliament. A presidential decree published at the end of last week prevents banks that are more than 50 per cent foreign-owned and have not begun serving residents from doing so until January 1996. Only two of the dozen western banks that have already received licences to take deposits from Russian customers are spared, because their Russian subsidiaries are already up and running. They are Credit Lyonnais Russie and BNP-Dresdner Bank's joint subsidiary, both of which are in St Petersburg, rather than Moscow, the country's banking capital. Banks affected by the decree are: Chase Manhattan and Citibank of the US; France's Societe Generale; the Netherlands' ING Bank and ABN-Amro Bank; Credit Suisse; Bank of China; and Turkey's Yapi ve Kredi Bankasi, which planned to take a 51 per cent stake in a joint venture bank with Russia's Tokobank. 'How can you give out a banking licence and then a few weeks later say 'Sorry, we've changed our minds',' said one western executive involved in the Yapi ve Kredi project, which only got its licence on November 1. 'It's ridiculous but we'll just have to figure out some new arrangement.' One solution might be for Yapi to reduce its shareholding to 50 per cent but take priority over Tokobank in decision-making. The western banks had no plans to take deposits from Russian individuals, but the decree deprives them of the opportunity to work with Russian enterprises including lucrative joint ventures with foreign shareholders. The decree was signed the day after a meeting between leading Russian bankers and Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, who heads the Russia's Choice electoral bloc. It fits in with the protectionist promises of other large parties competing in the December 12 elections. Apart from the desire to satisfy the powerful banks that are supplying much of the campaign finance, the decree is also part of efforts by radical government ministers to undermine Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, who granted the licences. Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, said on Friday the decree was in line with international practice and intended to protect Russian banks' from losing their best clients and staff at a critical stage in their development. Banks point to the more than Dollars 3bn accumulated by the International Moscow Bank, the first bank with foreign capital to open in Moscow, to illustrate their claims that prestigious western banks will steal their prized currency deposits without putting more money back into the economy. They also point to the fact that IMB has lent a much smaller proportion of funds to the Russian economy than top Russian commercial banks.</p>

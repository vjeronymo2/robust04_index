			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] You have undoubtedly heard of the deaths of five  people during the night of 15 March as they were driving to  Kigali from Kinihira subprefecture, deaths that some circles are  trying to describe from a certain perspective, notably the  National Revolutionary Movement for Development [MRND] party  through a communique broadcast yesterday on (RTLM) radio and  today on Kigali Radiodiffusion Nationale de la Republique  Rwandaise. These reports strong and inflammatory language.  [passage omitted]    Given this sudden reaction on the part of the MRND party and  its political bureau, a few questions easily emerge. Why this  swift condemnation of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] by the  MRND -- without providing a shred of evidence? Remember the  Kirambo Massacre of December 1993, which the MRND attributed to  the RPF even before investigators had been informed of the  incident. How else can one interpret a reaction which emerges  before information [words indistinct] more or less [words  indistinct] the truth? Is it not a [word indistinct] which  consists in trying to look for an alibi in order to carry out  long-term objectives and which would not miss the slightest  opportunity to reveal itself in broad daylight? Let us leave to  Rwandans the task of analyzing this, in the same way I did.  [passage omitted].</p>

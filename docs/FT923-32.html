			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Personal Computers and Software (4): PCs battle for shelf space - The US US PERSONAL computer industry executives talk less about technology these days. Instead of boasting about the 'speeds and feeds' of their latest products, they are more ready to discuss issues such as 'brand merchandising' and 'channel segmentation'. With the advent of the 'commodity' PC market, in which there is little to differentiate one machine from another, the US PC industry has begun to take on many of the characteristics of consumer marketing. Just as manufacturers of breakfast cereals tussle over supermarket shelf space, PC makers are now vying with one another for positions in expanding and increasingly diversified distribution channels. Similarly, 'packaging' or 'bundling' PCs into products designed to appeal to specific segments of the PC market has become an increasingly important competitive tool, with several of the top PC makers recently announcing revamped products. Sophisticated merchandising is widely seen as the path that the industry must take to escape the debilitating price wars of the past two years, which have seen prices plummet by as much as 70 per cent. Today, 386SX-based desktop PC systems, complete with a colour monitor, hard and floppy disk drives, are widely available in the US for around Dollars 1,000. Similar systems sold for about Dollars 1,500 six months ago and cost as much as Dollars 3,500 in early 1991. The price wars were led initially by 'clone' manufacturers, but over the past nine months industry stalwarts, including International Business Machines (IBM), Compaq Computer and Apple Computer, have struck back with drastic price cuts of their own, plunging the industry into a frantic battle over market share. With profit margins now razor thin, several smaller PC makers have given up the ghost. However, it is traditional computer dealers who have paid the highest price in the PC price wars. Their role in the industry is being usurped by new PC sellers. Computer 'superstores', offering discount prices and a wide selection of equipment, have sprung up throughout the US. By year end there will be about 200 of these stores, according to industry estimates. This year, computer superstores are expected to account for 12.3 per cent of the Dollars 47bn-worth of PCs sold in the US, almost doubling their share of the market in 1991, according to Merrin Information Services, a California-based computer market research firm. By 1995 the researchers predict that computer superstores will sell over 23 per cent of PCs, with total US sales expected to reach Dollars 78bn. Electronics retailers are also becoming a force in the PC market. Circuit City, one of the leading consumer electronics chains, touts PCs along with televisions, refrigerators and stereo equipment in its newspaper advertisements. Office equipment stores are also rejoining the ranks of PC resellers, aiming to pick up sales to their small business customers. To reach home computer buyers, leading PC manufacturers are also placing their products in department stores. 'Direct fulfilment', via telephone orders, also represents a growing portion of the PC market. Following the lead of Dell Computer, which established itself as a serious contender in the PC market with telephone sales, most of the large US PC manufacturers have, or are preparing to, side-step the middle man and sell direct to end users. IBM's struggle to set its PC business back on course demonstrate the radical changes that are under way in the US PC market. The computer giant has established the IBM Personal Computer company as an independent business unit with the freedom to react as swiftly as necessary to rapidly changing market demands. IBM PC is in the process of establishing four distinct 'brands' of PCs. In the US market these will be: the Premium brand, comprising existing and new PS/2 models aimed at IBM's traditional stronghold in the corporate computer sector. They will be sold by IBM value added dealers, as well as by the company's own salesforce. IBM's soon to be announced 'ValuePoint' brand, a set of PC products aimed at the highly price sensitive segment of the PC market and sold through computer superstores and office equipment shops. IBM's PS/1 product line is being expanded and aimed more directly at consumers and small businesses. These will be sold through mass merchant retailers including department stores. The fourth 'brand' group will be 'mobile computers', aimed at the fast growing market for notebook and portable computers. 'Only a few years ago, we sold our PC products to what was largely a single group of buyers. They bought mainly through one of two channels - dealers and value added resellers. 'Today, there are multiple buyer types, or segments, all with distinct and different wants and needs, in terms of both product and distribution channel,' explains Mr Sam Inman III, head of US PC marketing. 'The days of 'one size fits all' are long gone,' in the US PC market, Mr Inman says. 'To make it today, we must have products targeted to different types of buyers who buy through sales channels like superstores, for example, that didn't even exist a few years ago.' IBM is not alone in recognising the increasing segmentation of the US PC market. Compaq Computer recently launched a new product line called Prolinea, aimed at price sensitive buyers, and Dell has split its product range into three groups aimed at home buyers, small business buyers and corporate customers. Similarly, Apple Computer recently introduced three new models of its Macintosh PCs, called Performa models, aimed at home computer and small business users. The Performa products will be sold through department stores, office suppliers and consumer electronics outlets. 'We need to be where the customers are,' said Mr Robert Puette, president of Apple USA, the company's domestic sales and marketing division. 'Our goal with Performa is to reach new users and complement Apple's current product and distribution strategy in the business arena,' added Mr Keith Fox, Apple's vice-president of consumer markets. 'Experienced computer users, business users and those who require complex solutions will continue to rely on Apple's authorised reseller network for the largest selection of Macintosh solutions for a range of business needs,' said Mr Fox. Nonetheless, PC makers acknowledge that there is bound to be some overlap among distribution channels. A small business proprietor, for example, might choose to visit a computer superstore or browse through the shelves of a consumer-oriented electronics retailer. Corporate buyers are increasingly ordering PCs from superstores where prices are lower than those offered by value added resellers. One danger of the multi-brand, multi-channel approach is that customers will become confused. Finding the best value for money when shopping for a PC is an ever more complex challenge given the bewildering array of features and performance criteria and now the different names attached to similar models from the same manufacturers. There is no doubt, however, that by expanding their distribution channels and lowering prices US PC makers have created strong demand. In spite of rapidly declining prices, US PC sales revenues are expected to rise slightly this year, reflecting a substantial increase in unit shipments.</p>

			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Markets Report: Dollar shows fresh gains New indications about the strength of the US economy pushed the dollar higher while the French franc also enjoyed a good spell against the D-Mark, writes Peter Marsh. A bigger than expected fall in US unemployment and bullish figures on home sales were behind the rise in the US currency, which just failed to break through the Y112 'wall' against the yen. The franc rose to its strongest levels against a lacklustre German currency since the exchange rate crisis of July, amid hopes of an easing in European interest rates over the next few months to boost tentative recovery signs across the continent. A surprise cut in Dutch interest rates failed to excite dealers in most trading centres, where currency sales were extremely thin as markets wound down ahead of the new year holiday. The main talking point for investors was the continued rise in the dollar on the back of a decline in the number of Americans claiming unemployment benefits. The figure fell 39,000 last week to 291,000, the lowest for nearly five years. Indications that US growth next year will be fairly high were helped by news of a rise in house and apartment sales. The data triggered buy orders for the dollar, which rose nearly 2 pfennigs on the day to DM1.7337 by the close of European trading. That marked a 3 1/2 pfennig rise since Tuesday night and a gain of 7 per cent since the start of the year. Against the yen, the dollar extended its recent run of strength, closing at Y111.845, after Y111.8 the previous night. Even though the dollar has fallen 10.5 per cent against the Japanese currency since January 1, many expect these losses to be chipped away in the new year as a result of doubts about the strength of the Japanese economy. In European trading yesterday, the dollar rose at one stage to Y111.95 but got no further. Rumour had it that Japanese exporters placed dollar sell orders at Y112 to limit the dollar's advance. Against a D-Mark which lacked support, the yen made steady gains, with the German currency quoted last night at Y64.53, after Y65.08 on Wednesday evening. This followed on from the yen's strength against the German currency over the year, during which it has put on nearly 20 per cent. In early European trading, the French franc moved up to FFr3.395 per D-Mark from FFr3.40 on Wednesday. This was its highest level since July 8, and comfortably above the FFr3.404 at which it started the year. There was even some talk among the more wild-eyed franc enthusiasts in the market of the currency making its way to FFr3.35 over time as the outlook for the French economy improved. But news that seasonally adjusted unemployment in France rose in November to a record 3.285m did little to arouse bullish sentiments, and the franc closed at FFr3.397 to the D-Mark, barely changed. The Danish crown also firmed to around DKr3.9 per D-Mark from DKr3.906. In Amsterdam, the Dutch central bank created something of a stir in the sleepy market conditions by cutting its special advances money market rate to 5.6 per cent from 5.7 per cent. The reduction followed the guilder's recent strength against the D-Mark which has seen it move to 10-year highs. Nevertheless many traders had not expected any Dutch move on monetary policy until January 6, when the Bundesbank council is expected to discuss a lowering in its Lombard and discount interest rates. The guilder traded yesterday at HFl1.118 per D-Mark, against HFl. 119 the previous day, holding fairly steady after news of the cut. Sterling slipped against the dollar, closing at Dollars 1.4768, down 1 1/2 cents, while against the German currency it was quoted last night at DM2.5602, slightly lower than the DM2.5624 on Wednesday evening. Over the year the pound has fallen 2.5 per cent against the dollar though gained 4.3 per cent against the German currency. The overall rise in its trade weighted index has been nearly 3 per cent. Sterling was little affected by figures showing British bank notes in circulation rose a high 7.1 per cent in the week to December 29 over the equivalent week a year ago. Economists gave the numbers little attention on the grounds that they may have been have been distorted by the Christmas holiday. However, indications that the UK economy is continuing to recover were buoyed by news of a sharp fall in company failures in the fourth quarter. The data were hailed by the Treasury as showing the upturn was 'well under way'. In its money market operations the Bank of England channelled Pounds 1.659bn into the banking system after forecasting a liquidity shortage of Pounds 1.75bn. Norway's central bank said it had bought NKr1.4bn on foreign currency markets last week to support the currency which has recently looked unsteady against the D-Mark and other European currencies. It said it purchased NKr500m on Wednesday and NKr900m on Thursday. In Frankfurt, German call money tightened, with the bulk of money market business being transacted at interest rates of between 6.5 per cent and 6.8 per cent. Rates generally straddled the Bundesbank's Lombard rate of 6.75 per cent, as banks strove to ensure they had secured a required monthly average on minimum reserves of above DM60bn. The monthly average reached DM60.2bn by the close of business on Tuesday.</p>

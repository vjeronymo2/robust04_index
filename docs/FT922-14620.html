			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Eco-plan agreed but payment unresolved DEVELOPED and developing countries have agreed after two years of often acrimonious debate to join in a 'global partnership' to restore and preserve the earth's ecosystem. However, its impact is diminished by continued failure to resolve the problem of paying for such a massive environmental clean-up in the teeth of economic recession. The accord was reached at the UN on Saturday in an all-night meeting of the preparatory committee for the Earth Summit conference to be held in Rio de Janeiro in June. Mr Maurice Strong, the conference secretary general, estimated that Third World states would require Dollars 125bn (Pounds 72bn) a year in outside aid for new environmental programmes - Dollars 70bn more annually than they receive now in all financial assistance. He projects even larger sums for the long term. Questions still to be resolved include the transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries, institutional arrangements for overseeing policies, and protecting the rapidly depleting forests. Among the principles agreed is the obligation of polluters to pay for cleaning up, the need for environmental protection even without prior scientific evidence, and the responsibility of states not to damage the environment of other states.</p>

			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FDIC PROJECTED TO LOSE $6.1 BILLION OVER NEXT 3 YEARS  </P> <P> New projections by the Bush Administration show the fund insuring bank deposits  shrinking to less than half its current size within three years, a senior House  Banking Committee member said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s fund for commercial banks will lose $6.1  billion through fiscal 1993 even if the fees banks pay for deposit insurance  are increased, said Rep. Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.), citing projections by the  Office of Management and Budget.  </P> <P> The new estimates are sharply more pessimistic than the budget office's  previous projections. In June, the budget office had estimated that the FDIC  would show a profit of $600 million during the three-year period, Annunzio  said.  </P> <P> "The taxpayer is in serious jeopardy of being asked to bail out the banks," he  said in disclosing what he characterized as "little-noticed calculations" by  the budget office.  </P> <P> The new projections are in the budget agreement reached by White House  negotiators and congressional leaders on Sept. 30, he said.  </P> <P> Roger Watson, FDIC director of research, said the figures as described by  Annunzio "certainly are pessimistic."  </P> <P> "They are possible, but not likely," he said.  </P> <P> They show the fund shrinking to $5.3 billion by Sept. 30, 1993, or only 22  cents for every $100 in deposits. That is less than one-fifth the $1.25 minimum  considered safe and less than half the 60-cent level in the fund at the end of  June.  </P> <P> "These OMB projections are doubly alarming when you realize that they are based  on economic assumptions that do not include a recession," said Annunzio,  chairman of the House Banking Financial Institutions Subcommittee.  </P></p>

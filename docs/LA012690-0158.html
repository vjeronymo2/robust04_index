			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANN CONWAY: GETAWAYS FOR POWER TRIPPERS  </P> <P> Want to hit the fast track in the '90s? Start packing your bags.  </P> <P> Seems that anybody who is anybody is headed for faraway places, and not just  for the chance to snooze by themselves on a white-sand beach. No way. They're  leaving it all behind to be with people of their own kind to learn.  </P> <P> Take developer Peter B. Rothschild of Newport Beach. Last weekend, the CEO of  Rothschild Industries left town to pave the way for about 250 members of the  Young Presidents Organization to attend a "university" beginning near Montego  Bay, Jamaica, on Sunday.  </P> <P> Members, who must be no older than 40 when they become top gun of a company  (typically, a company with a minimum of $5 million in annual sales) will attend  classes during the day and spend evenings partying at the Half Moon Bay Club.  </P> <P> The learn-then-play concept is nothing new for the Young Presidents  Organization, founded in 1950. But it's a travel concept -- call it  power-tripping -- that is being used more and more by local leadership groups.  Doors open wider when movers and shakers arrive, en masse, so why not go for  it?  </P> <P> The reason doors open, says Craig McDaniel, director of marketing and  communications for the organization in Dallas, is that members have access to  the people who control those doors and access to the kind of experts the  organization likes to present at their "universities."  </P> <P> "We're known for drawing the creme de la creme of business and politics as  'faculty members,' " McDaniel says. (Former President Richard M. Nixon was  invited to speak at the Jamaica conference. Young Presidents Organization  member Al Baldwin of Emerald Bay offered to fly him there in his private jet.  But Nixon's phlebitis condition prevented him from making the trip.)  </P> <P> Influential women on the move include members of the Angels of the Arts, a  support group that has raised $2.5 million for the Orange County Performing  Arts Center since it was founded in 1983. "We're looking to do  cultural-educational trips because it gives our members an opportunity to see  theater and art from another perspective," says Angels President Judie Argyros,  wife of Forbes 400 developer George Argyros.  </P> <P> On the drawing board for the Angels: a trip to Manhattan that would include  visits to art museums, theaters, and behind-the-scenes peeks at such Big Apple  landmarks as Radio City Music Hall.  </P> <P> "We did a survey with our client base last fall," says Linda McIntosh,  president of International Travel Specialties in Irvine. "We asked them: 'If  you could go anywhere in the world, where would you go?'  </P> <P> "Sixty percent of them told us they weren't interested in just taking trips,  they wanted to travel with a purpose. If they were going to go to Nepal, for  example, they wanted to go with a special-interest group eager to explore  Nepal's culture."  </P> <P> McIntosh, who is helping the Angels plan their trip, thinks the reason local  power groups are beginning to travel together is because they are maturing.  "They've joined a group with goals they believe in. They've found they have  loads in common. It only follows they would want to travel with them," she  says.  </P> <P> Besides the chance to explore the arts, the Angels would enjoy the chance to  "get to know each other and their spouses better," Argyros says, "to talk Angel  shoptalk, to tell a good joke or two. It's the quality time together that  ultimately sells the idea of a cultural trip away from home."  </P> <P> "People love to travel with friends," says Ginny Ueberroth, co-chairwoman of  the Los Angeles Music Center's $25,000-per-person Silver Anniversary trip to  Lanai, Hawaii next month. "I think some people have a little trouble with  traveling. Being with friends and being taken care of on a tour makes it more  comfortable."  </P> <P> The trip, which will mark the grand opening of David Murdock's new 102-room  Lodge at Koele, will offer more fun than education (sunset receptions, garden  teas, barbecues, helicopter rides, formal dinners). But the happy campers, who  will include Sidney Sheldon, Henry Mancini, Dina Merrill and Michael York, will  relax knowing that their megabucks helped educate others about the theater  arts.  </P> <P> "One of my jobs was getting locals from Orange County to go on the trip," says  Ueberroth, who lives with her husband, Peter Ueberroth, in Emerald Bay. "But  most of the people I know were loyal to the Orange County Performing Arts  Center. I do think the interest between the two centers has increased. And I  think this is important. We're going to have to be working together to attract  certain groups and programs."  </P> <P> Ueberroth doffs her hat to Murdock. "It was a great idea, inviting donors to  his island. He's done so much for the Music Center. It's going to be  marvelous."  </P> <P> About 25 local movers and shakers are lining up to go to Germany and France on  March 10 with Don R. Roth, chairman of the Orange County Board of Supervisors.  Roth has invited influential friends and associates to join him when he  inspects high-speed train technology, which could be used on a rail line  between Anaheim and Las Vegas.  </P> <P> Developer Gus Owen, president of the Lincoln Club, is trying to find room in  his and wife Kathryn Thompson's hectic schedule to make the trip. "It would be  exciting to see the innovation other countries have come up with to solve their  transportation problems," he says. For Owen, the plus of power trips is the  chance to "meet with people you would not have the ability to meet with if you  were on a trip by yourself."  </P> <P> "Bringing transportation experts together for one person would be difficult.  But with a number of community leaders present, people have a greater reason to  sit down and chat, explain how they accomplished what they did.  </P> <P> "When you have powerful people arriving together at one time, it's rare that  you can't get other powerful people together at the same time."  </P></p>

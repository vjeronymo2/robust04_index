			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Thai group invests Dollars 1bn in China A THAI conglomerate announced yesterday that it had signed a deal to undertake a Dollars 1bn forestry and pulp and paper project in southern China's Guangdong province, in what it said was the largest Thai investment so far in China, writes Victor Mallet in Bangkok. Soon Hua Seng group (SHS), an unlisted company which boasts of being the biggest rice and tapioca exporter in the world, signed an agreement with the state-controlled Forestry and Paper Mill Co of Shanwei City to plant trees and build wood chip and pulp and paper plants which will eventually employ 4,000 people. It was the latest in a series of moves by Thai entrepreneurs of ethnic Chinese origin to invest in southern China; other Thai Chinese investments in China include feedmills, property projects and banks. Mr Kitti Dumnernchanwanit, president of SHS and a director of Bangkok Bank, praised China's economic liberalisation measures and said: 'I am a Chinese, but was born in Thailand. I always realise that for a human being it is a must to bring progress and prosperity to his country of origin.' SHS said it would start planting eucalyptus and acacia trees next year on 32,000 hectares of land to be rented from the Shanwei government. Construction of the wood chip plant would begin in 1997 or 1998, and the building of the pulp and paper factory would start in 1999. Production was expected to start in about 10 years, and paper output destined for China and for export markets would be about 120,000 tonnes a year. The company released no financial details, but said part of the total Dollars 1bn investment would come from international financial institutions. 'The relations between China and Thailand are evident and no development can sever or destroy them,' said Mr Prasit Kanchanawat, a former commerce minister who is chairman of both SHS and Bangkok Bank.</p>

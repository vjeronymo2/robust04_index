			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> RTD BOARD APPROVES EXPANSION OF SHUTTLE  </P> <P> Directors of the Southern California Rapid Transit District have approved  expansion of Glendale's free Beeline bus shuttle service into south Glendale  for at least six months. The service, expected to begin Oct. 1, will loop  through the southern part of the city along Brand Boulevard and Central Avenue,  with a stop at the city's Amtrak station.  </P> <P> RTD officials had protested expansion of the city's shuttle, saying that it  would divert riders from RTD buses that travel the same route. As a condition  of its approval Aug. 9, the RTD board ordered ridership surveys to measure the  shuttle's impact on bus revenues.  </P> <P> If the shuttle diverts a significant number of riders, the RTD and city will  consider route changes, financial compensation or other mitigation measures. If  there is no major change in bus ridership, the shuttle will be allowed to  continue operating beyond the six-month limit.  </P></p>

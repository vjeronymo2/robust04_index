			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Meggitt bids Pounds 17.3m for Micrelec MEGGITT, the specialist engineering group, yesterday announced an agreed bid for Micrelec Group, valuing the USM-traded petrol pump controls company at Pounds 17.3m. The offer of 141 new Meggitt shares for every 100 Micrelec values the target's shares at 130p, against last night's close of 122p, up 10p. There is a cash alternative of 62 new shares and Pounds 65 for every 100 Micrelec shares. Meggitt has received irrevocable acceptances from directors holding 35.6 per cent of Micrelec's shares and undertakings from institutional shareholders to accept, subject to no higher offer, representing a further 12.2 per cent. Mr Nigel McCorkell, Meggitt's managing director, said Micrelec's electronics systems for retail petrol distribution would fit with systems developed by Triscan, his company's commercial fuel management subsidiary. Micrelec also had substantial service and maintenance business with the likes of BP and Shell which was growing and profitable. Mr McCorkell said Triscan and Micrelec's retail fuel management businesses would not be merged although some departments, like R&amp;D, would be brought together. The market has known for some time that Micrelec would accept sensible offers and was is believed to have been approached by interested foreign buyers in January. It has suffered in the recession from oil companies cutting back on capital expenditure. Micrelec estimates that in the year to March 1992 it achieved sales of Pounds 16.5m and incurred a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 1.7m. Mr McCorkell said that for the deal to be non-dilutive in 1993, its first full year, Micrelec would have to make pre-tax profits of Pounds 2m, a figure he thought was attainable. Micrelec, which sold its Normand subsidiary in January for Pounds 7m, has cash balances of Pounds 5m. Mr David Willis, one of the two main shareholders, will stay on as managing director. Gearing after the bid is likely to be about 10 per cent, down slightly from the 12-15 per cent position after the Dollars 53m acquisition in March of Endevco, the US maker of pressure sensors and other electronic equipment. The acquisition will bring sales in Meggitt's electronics division to Pounds 60m, still behind its controls and aerospace activities.</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: S African golds lose nearly 3% Weakness in the price of gold bullion, which hit a low of about Dollars 382 an ounce in London trading during the session, made its effect felt on the Johannesburg gold shares index, which dropped by nearly 3 per cent. Dealers remarked that hopes that gold would attain the Dollars 400 level, which had been supporting prices during late September and early October, had receded, thereby resulting in heavy selling. The golds index closed 67 down at 2,224, with sellers also coming into the market after the release of US consumer expenditure data which showed a smaller than expected September rise. The industrials index was affected by the fall in gold, but managed to regain positive territory by the close, adding 6 at 6,604. The overall index slipped 27 to 5,723. Since reaching a year's high of 2,535 at the start of September, the golds index has fallen by 12 per cent, but remains 2.7 per cent up from its position at the beginning of January. Among the day's movers, Driefontein, the gold miner, slipped R2.75 to R64, while Western Deep declined R10 to R214. Gencor ended 25 cents off at R14.75. De Beers, which said it was increasing investment in Tanzania through its Willcroft subsidiary company, relinquished R2 at R98.55. Vaal Reefs finished R12 down at R416, while Freegold retreated R2 to R68 and Loraine softened 25 cents to R19.50.</p>

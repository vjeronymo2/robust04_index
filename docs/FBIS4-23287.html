			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria June 1 SAPA -- The National Peacekeeping  Force [NPKF] would be disbanded on Thursday [2 June], Defence  Minister Joe Modise said in a statement in Pretoria on  Wednesday. Mr Modise said the constituent forces would be  returned to their home units in preparation for the integration  of all the forces into the South African National Defence Force  [SANDF].    He said he was following a recommendation by the National  Peacekeeping Force Command Council, which was endorsed by the  Transitional Executive Council's sub-council on defence.    SANDF Chief Gen Georg Meiring would oversee the  demobilisation, Mr Modise said.    A passing out parade was being held for NPKF members at the  force's Koeberg Base in the Cape, a source at the NPKF said.  Force members would also be given certificates of commendation.  It was not known whether a similar parade was being held at the  NPKF's De Brug base at Bloemfontein.    The NPKF was formed in February to help keep peace during  the  April elections. After its first outing on the East Rand,  however, the NPKF was withdrawn to base and not used again.    It is understood that about 1,200 NPKF members who came from  Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation], the armed wing of the  African National Congress, would go to the Wallmannstal assembly  point north of Pretoria for incorporation into the new National  Defence Force.    About 2,800 members from the Transkei, Ciskei and Venda  Defence Forces will return to their forces of origin until such  time as those forces are incorporated into the SANDF.    It was not known what would become of the NPKF's commander,  Gen Gabriel Ramushwana, formerly head of state and armed forces  commander in Venda.</p>

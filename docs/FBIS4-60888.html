			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Presidential Council Member Aleksey Salmin </F> under the general heading "Treaty on Accord Is Open Book":  "Mechanism for Implementation Necessary, Presidential Council  Member Aleksey Salmin Believes"]    [Text] An immense amount of work has been done on the  draft Treaty on Civil Accord and various parties' interests have  been taken into account in it. Unfortunately, this has not  always come about harmoniously and there are problems in the  text itself. However, the main point is not that it has been  produced but the way this document will "work."    After all, this important document should be "built into" a  certain system of relations, therefore its fate is still not  determined even if its signing goes off smoothly.    The problem for the accord's potential participants, all  branches and centers of power on Russian territory, is for the  document to actually "begin to work." This means that there  should be a certain mechanism for its implementation. Such a  mechanism could be a genuine accord in parliament, in  particular, between several factions. A broad nationwide accord  is not even necessary but a more local one so as to adopt a  package of essential laws connected with security (on the whole,  personal security), and other laws, in particular, on economic  reform, as well as criminal and civil codes, and much else as  concerns legislation.    For this it is necessary that, on the basis of the treaty,  efficient coalitions are formed in both of parliament's  chambers, and it is also, of course, necessary for a genuine  accord to exist between Moscow and the Federation components.    So, a dynamic center is necessary to implement the accord so  that it does not remain only on paper but becomes a fact of  political life. Such a dynamic center could take the form of  permanent consultations at the highest level between  representatives of the various power structures. It would be  better if this is a permanent working group with a high level of  cooperation. Because, despite the fact that an important and  essential step has been taken, what is most important --  precisely that which lies at this document's heart -- still lies  ahead.</p>

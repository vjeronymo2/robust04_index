			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LONG BEACH OKS PLANS FOR 16-DEALER $57-MILLION AUTO MALL NEAR FREEWAY  </P> <P> More than 1 1/2 years after a task force recommended that the city develop an  auto mall to bolster its sales tax income, the City Council has approved a plan  to build a 16-dealer mall just south of the 405 Freeway between Orange and  California avenues.  </P> <P> Long Beach thus joins a host of other Southern California communities that have  created auto malls in the hope of laying a golden egg. Just next door to the  Long Beach mall will be a smaller one planned by the city of Signal Hill.  </P> <P> Long Beach Redevelopment Agency officials estimate it will cost the agency $57  million to buy the land and develop the site, which consists of nearly 90 acres  of old oil fields and industrial buildings. For the first decade, sales tax  income from the mall, an estimated $3.5 million to $5 million a year, will go  to the agency to help finance the project. But by the year 2000, the tax money  should start flowing into the city's General Fund, according to Community  Development Director Susan F. Shick.  </P> <P> For years, city car sales have been concentrated on "Auto Row" on Long Beach  Boulevard, where dealers clustered long before the concept of carefully planned  malls transformed the world of automobile transactions. But the general decline  of surrounding neighborhoods, lack of space for expansion and construction of  the light rail transit system down the middle of Long Beach Boulevard have all  made the boulevard less attractive to dealers and car buyers.  </P> <P> The city's sales tax income from car sales has been slipping and officials fear  dealers will leave for other communities if Long Beach does not build its own  auto mall where customers can stroll from one landscaped car lot to another.  </P> <P> Under the redevelopment plan approved this week by the council, the  Redevelopment Agency will buy the acreage from about 30 property owners, clear  the area, clean up oil-contaminated soil and sell the land to dealers, who will  pay for only a portion of the total mall costs. More than half the money to  develop the project will come from a $31-million agency bond.  </P> <P> Signal Hill is further along in developing its 18-acre, three-dealer auto mall,  the first part of which will probably open in 1990, according to Signal Hill's  redevelopment director. Shick predicted the first dealers would open in Long  Beach within two years.  </P></p>

A nighttime curfew was imposed on the town after Thursday's  incidents, which accompanied a strike by government workers and  schoolteachers, whose representatives met Civil Service Minister  Henri Rakotovololona.    Troublemakers got out of control and began attacking the  stores of the traders, known as Karanas, when schoolchildren  took to the streets as the negotiations were under way,  witnesses said.    Police used tear gas and made two arrests as the  demonstrators subsequently went to residential districts and set  the homes of some Karanas ablaze.    The wealth and success of the Indo-Pakistani community is in  stark contrast to the poverty of many residents in the  industrial town, which saw a similar outbreak of anti-Karana  rioting in 1987, observers said.    The 28,000 Karana control about 40 percent of the economy of  the Indian Ocean island, according to estimates, and the  community has not merged with other Malagasy peoples, even if  most of its members have lived in the country for four or five  generations.</p>

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Industry tries to fend off the VAT man: Michael Cassell on fears of what the Budget might hold IF THE imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel is a foregone conclusion, the growing threat that Mr Kenneth Clarke might widen the tax net still further has triggered a wave of intense lobbying to try to warn him off. In the next few weeks the chancellor can expect the usual pre-Budget avalanche of special pleading. This year, much of that pleading will be aimed at preventing an extension of VAT to more goods and services. The public will not escape the propaganda either. On buses, at airports, railway stations and in shops, the battle to fend off VAT on fares and the printed word is well under way. Among the most active campaigners is British Airways, which fears it could lose up to 500,000 passengers. Last week BA executives went to the Conservative party conference in Blackpool to press the airline's case to MPs and ministers. They pointed out that if VAT is applied at the full rate on air fares, a typical business return fare from London to Glasgow would rise by Pounds 40. Leaders of the Periodical Publishers Association were also present to warn ministers of the effect on education and literacy of a tax on the printed word. The association last week published a special edition of Magazine News devoted to VAT. It has also launched a national advertising campaign to reinforce publishers' claims that imposing the full VAT rate on magazines would cost more than 4,000 jobs and close as many as 1,700 titles. The newspaper industry is mounting its second national campaign in eight years against VAT on newspapers. The industry calculates that 245 local and regional papers would close which, it points out, could deprive some MPs of the most important constituency outlet for their views. The books sector, too, is putting up a fight. The National Book Committee, representing authors, booksellers and publishers, says the imposition of VAT would cut book sales by 5 per cent while raising only a 'paltry' Pounds 270m in tax revenue. Mr Tim Godfray, chief executive of the Booksellers Association, says 3,500 sales outlets have been asked to join an anti-VAT campaign. In spite of the political sensitivities, the prospect of VAT on children's clothes and some food items has not been ruled out. The British Retail Consortium, representing high street traders, will restate its views to Mr Clarke when it meets him this month. The overriding need for Mr Clarke to seek new sources of revenue means that all the arguments against the extension of VAT may fall on deaf ears. The best chance opponents have of winning the day may lie in the government's slim majority and the apparent readiness of some Tory backbenchers to spoil ministers' best-laid plans.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Sarajevo, April 15 (AFP) -- International  mediators David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg and special UN  envoy Yasushi Akashi were to try to meet Bosnian Serb leaders  Friday in a bid to end Serb harassment of UN troops and an  upsurge in Serb attacks on Moslem enclave, UN military sources  said.    They said the three would travel to the Serb stronghold of  Pale, where Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic is based, for a  meeting scheduled for 2:00 p.m. (1200 GMT). They did not  elaborate.    Vitaly Churkin, Russia's special envoy to former Yugoslavia,  has been in Pale, east of Sarajevo, for several days. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Preface to Shanghai of Contemporary China by </F> Zhu Rongji -- written on 25 March 1991"]    [Text] Shanghai of Contemporary China has been  published. This is a collective work specifically aimed at  reflecting the historical development of Shanghai since the  founding of New china.    Comrade Mao Zedong once said: "We should not only be good at  destroying the old world but also at building a new world." The  development of history has transformed, or is transforming, this  maxim into fact. Since Shanghai was liberated in May 1949,  under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the State  Council and with the vigorous support of various fraternal  provinces and cities, we have, after more than 40 years of hard  work, overcome difficulties and perils on our way forward and  transformed the former semicolonial, semifeudal "paradise of  adventurers" into a socialist new Shanghai full of vigor and  vitality.    In the course of building Shanghai into a new socialist  city,  what is most worthy of mention is the ten years since the  introduction of reform and opening to the outside world. During  these ten years, Shanghai, like the rest of the country,  experienced one of the best periods for its economic and social  development since the founding of the Chinese People's Republic  of China. These are the main features of the period: Reform of  the economic structure was carried out in an all-around way,  giving rise to a pattern in which all sectors of the economy  exist side by side on the premise of upholding socialist public  ownership as the mainstay; great strides were made in opening to  the outside world, and Shanghai's economy is marching into the  world arena in the forms of utilizing foreign capital, importing  technologies, running economic and technological development  zones, exporting labor, and contracting projects overseas;  significant progress was made in production and construction,  and Shanghai's economic strength increased considerably with the  completion of a number of key projects such as the Baoshan Iron  and Steel Complex's first- and second-phase projects, Jinshan  Petrochemical General Plant's second- and third-phased projects,  Santana Sedan Factory's first-phased project, new railway  passenger station, Yuejiang tunnel in Yanan East Road,  [Yaohua-Pierjinton] Glass Plant, color picture tube plant, and  cold-rolled sheet plant; in addition, projects under  construction include a subway system, waste water treatment  plant, the Nanpu bridge, the expansion of the Hongqiao airport,  and installation of program-controlled telephones. These  infrastructure facilities strengthened Shanghai's capacity to  develop its economy and improve its appearance. A change took  place in its industrial setup, and new progress was made in  advancing technology. The ratio of the service industry rose  from 21 percent in 1980 to around 30 percent. By transforming  secondary industry, the ratio of technology-intensive  enterprises rose to about 20 percent. Space, aviation, and  sedan-manufacturing industries and other new generation of  pillar industries are developing. The comprehensive functions  of a city are beginning to show themselves. Even though the  pattern of national income distribution has changed  considerably, Shanghai still retained its lead in per capita  income, in the realization of output value for every 100 yuan of  fixed assets, and in delivering profits and taxes to the state.  In terms of financial and foreign exchange matters, and in  allocation of commodities, Shanghai has continued to make  greater contributions to the state than other areas. At the  same time, the people of Shanghai have significantly improved  their material life, and they have made progress in education  and culture and in building a spiritual civilization. These  tremendous achievements have strengthened Shanghai's peoples'  confidence in carrying forward the socialist modernization drive  and enhanced their determination to overcome difficulties.    Now, history has entered the last ten years of this century.  Shanghai is now at a new starting line. In the middle and later  parts of the 1980's, the CPC Central Committee and the State  Council approved the "Outline of the Report on the Strategy for  Developing Shanghai's Economy," the "General Urban Development  Plan for Shanghai," and the "Report on Deepening Reform, Opening  Wider to the Outside World, and Speeding up the Transformation  of Shanghai's Economy into an Export-Oriented Economy." In  April 1990, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council made  the decision to develop Pudong and open it to the outside world,  thus mapping out the direction for Shanghai's future  development.    In accordance with the guidelines of the  Seventh Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee and  the documents mentioned above, the 11th Plenary Session of the  Fifth Shanghai CPC Committee, held in early January 1991, set  the strategic guidelines and goals for Shanghai's economic and  social development in the 1990's. They are as follows:  Invigorating Shanghai, developing Pudong, serving the whole  country, focusing on the world market; during the Eighth  Five-Year Plan and the Ninth Five-Year Plan periods, efforts  will be made to build Shanghai into an open, multifunctional,  and socialist modern city with a rationalized industrial setup,  advanced science and technology, and a high degree of spiritual  civilization. When the proletarian revolutionaries of the older  generation spent their Spring Festival of 1991 in Shanghai, they  strongly affirmed these guidelines and goals. They encouraged  Shanghai to do its work boldly, speedily, and successfully.    To realize this glorious, great, yet arduous mission, we  must  earnestly implement the principles, tasks, and policies set by  the Seventh Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee;  undertake major reforms that directly affect the national  economy, the people's lives, and economic development; focus on  developing Shanghai's economy; and do our best to invigorate  large- and medium state-owned enterprises. We must concentrate  on building infrastructural facilities, especially the  construction of housing to benefit the people, to satisfy them,  and to inspire them. We should continue to deepen education on  socialism, uphold the four cardinal principles, oppose bourgeois  liberalization, improve party work style, build a clean  government, rectify irregularities in various professions, and  strive to do a good job in building a socialist spiritual  civilization. We will train and bring up a contingent of cadres  who have a firm political stand, adhere to Marxism and  materialist dialectics, know their professions well, have a good  work style, and advance and assume responsibilities boldly to  lead the people of Shanghai to work hard in creating a better  situation for Shanghai's construction and reform.    In conclusion, I want to thank the comrades who worked  arduously in editing and publishing this book.</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Brazil leads emerging markets in December - Approval of President Collor's tax reforms added to the surge After lagging behind Argentina and Colombia for much of the year, Brazil's stock market came into its own in December, to take first place among the market indices published by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), part of the World Bank. Brazilian share prices rose 44.9 per cent in dollar terms, a strong performance stemming from growing confidence - particularly among foreign investors - that the country had started to get to grips with its economic problems. For 1991 as a whole Brazil was up 151 per cent in dollar terms, a performance which put it in fourth place in the IFC's comparisons, behind Argentina (up 392.5 per cent), Colombia and Pakistan. Contributing to December's surge of confidence were congressional approval of President Collor's tax reforms and the signing of a letter of intent to the IMF as part of negotiations for a standby facility. Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the IMF, who visited Brazil in December to receive the letter of intent personally from President Collor, said the standby will probably be approved by the IMF executive board when it comes up for approval on January 22. 'Brazil is still relatively cheap,' says a US broker following the market from London; the market is selling at around 6 to 7 times 1992 projected earnings. By comparison, Mexico ended the year at 14 times earnings. There is still scope for further strengthening of the Brazilian market, the broker adds, but current prices reflect the relatively high degree of country risk. Investor interest, particularly from abroad, has continued into early 1992, says Mr Tony Ewell of BZW's Latin American section. December's best performers were the big blue chips, he adds. In particular, utilities such as Electrobras and Petrobras benefited from the government's promise to the IMF to permit tariff increases which not only match inflation but provide a real return on capital. Colombia put in another strong performance in December, climbing 37.2 per cent in dollar terms. The market was opened to foreign investors in December, and only two foreign funds have so far applied for approval, though other applications are on their way. December's third-best performing market was Pakistan, up 30.4 per cent in dollar terms. There were no really bad falls in the month. The worst performing emerging markets were Korea, which declined 6.8 per cent in dollar terms, and India, down 1.1 per cent in dollar terms. Both these also fell in local currency. Chile, which was just negative in dollar terms (down 0.1 per cent), actually rose slightly in local currency terms, but that gain was offset by devaluation. For the year as a whole, Turkey halved in dollar terms, a drop largely due to devaluation. Indonesia was down by two-fifths, despite a strengthening currency. Greece fell 22.1 per cent in dollar terms.</p>

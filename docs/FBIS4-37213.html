			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, PLO Executive </F> Committee member and official in charge of financial affairs for  the Palestinian National Authority, by Sa'id Mu'addi in Jericho  on 19 May; from the "With the Events" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Mu'addi] Mr. Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi,  official in charge of financial affairs for the Palestinian  Authority: Today you arrived in Jericho. What would you like  to say after a very long absence?    [Al-Nashashibi] I would like to say that this is one of the  happiest days in my life. I extend greetings to our great  people, who waited for our return and with whom we have waited  to meet. This day will prompt me to do all that I can to fulfill  my duty in a manner that satisfies my people, my consciousness,  and my God.    [Mu'addi] What are the priorities in the economic field?    [Al-Nashashibi] Priorities in the economic field include  rebuilding the infrastructure. There is of course an emergency  reconstruction program, prepared through an agreement among the  World Bank, the donors commission, and the PLO, particularly the  Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction.  This program is called the emergency program. According to that  program, there are issues related to roads, transportation,  water, solid waste treatment, agriculture, industry, tourism,  education, and health. In my view, the private sector has to  take responsibility in housing, tourism, agriculture, industry,  and energy.    [Mu'addi] Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, you have not taken  part in the economic talks [between Israel and the PLO]. Do you  accept and approve of this [economic] agreement?    [Al-Nashashibi] No.    [Mu'addi] What are your reservations?    [Al-Nashashibi] That agreement was not based on my  legitimate right to build a Palestinian national economy based  on my national right to self-determination. Regrettably, that  agreement considered Israel's interests at the expense of the  Palestinian Arab people, who want to establish an independent  economy based on the economic charter of peoples and states that  gave all peoples the right to establish their national economy  away from any foreign intervention. Accordingly, I think we have  a legitimate right to establish this economy without having  obstacles and restrictions imposed on us and this point should  have been considered by the Israeli negotiators.    [Mu'addi] One final question. There are reports that Yasir  'Arafat is making his arrival here conditional on the financial  assistance from the donor states?    [Al-Nashashibi] President 'Arafat has not made any such  statements. The only condition he has set for his arrival is  that he must be convinced that his mission will be successful.  When conditions are appropriate, he will come here. Difficult  financial conditions are one of the problems we are all facing.    [Mu'addi] Mr. Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, official in  charge of financial affairs in the Palestinian Authority, thank  you very much.    [Al-Nashashibi] Thank you.</p>

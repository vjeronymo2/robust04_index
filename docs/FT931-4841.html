			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: Color Line profit doubles to NKr80m for year COLOR LINE, the Norwegian cruise and ferry group, said 1992 pre-tax profits nearly doubled to NKr80m (Dollars 11.35m) from NKr44m in 1991. Group operating profit rose to NKr313m from NKr212m, as sales rose to NKr1.67bn from NKr1.43bn. Mr Jon Erik Nygaard, chief executive, said the group's four cruise ferry lines between Norway, Denmark, Germany and the UK set new traffic records in 1992. Passenger volume rose 9 per cent, representing 1.9m passengers, and 80,000 freight units, an increase of 6 per cent. Net financial items rose to NKr233m in 1992 from NKr168m in 1991 due in part to a NKr31m non-capitalised currency loss on long-term D-Mark debt. Mr Nygaard said bookings for 1993 were satisfactory and showed continued development in the German market. Exportfinans, Norway's export lending institution, reported gross income up 17 per cent in 1992 to NKr312m from NKr267m last time. Net income rose to NKr225m from NKr202m. Loans disbursed in 1992 to the domestic export industry reached NKr4.35bn, up NKr300m.</p>

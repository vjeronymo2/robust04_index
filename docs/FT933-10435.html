			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: British Coal The government's haste to unload British Coal is perhaps understandable, as the clock is already ticking on the corporation's cosy five-year contracts with the electricity generators. If private mine operators are to stand any chance of making money, they will need more than the fag end of the current contract followed by an uncertain market after 1998. Trade buyers will only be interested in packages of pits which will repay their equity investment before the contract expires. Whether the government can deliver in short order is, however, another question. Knotty issues such as the separation of environmental liabilities, responsibility for employees and changes to safety regulations still need a great deal of work. Whatever the progress of the legislation, it may not be possible to resolve all of these technical issues before the end of 1994. The underlying market for coal is also deteriorating, with the prospects for production after 1998 dim. Abolition of the franchise market in electricity will increase uncertainty and push the generators towards short-term coal purchases. Gas and nuclear output will also squeeze coal's share of the base load market, while environmental legislation may make ageing coal stations uneconomic. Against this, it may be very difficult to sweeten British Coal sufficiently to attract outright buyers. Leasing pits to operators might prove simpler, even if it does not finally rid the government of the shadow of Old King Coal.</p>

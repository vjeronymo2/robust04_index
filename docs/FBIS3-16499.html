			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today, Belarus began to receive full gas deliveries  from Russia. Gasprom resumed supplying its earlier volume of  blue fuel to the Republic. By the end of Tuesday [15 March],  deliveries are expected to reach earlier [word indistinct]  volume of 54 million cubic meters. This was agreed by Russia's  Gasprom and the Belarusian Beltransgas during their negotiations  in Moscow.    A delegation of gas-industry specialists from Belarus,  headed  by Beltransgas Director Mikalay Macharnyak, went to Moscow for  the sole purpose of discussing conditions for repaying  Belarusian debts for Russian natural gas deliveries. In line  with agreements reached with Ukraine's partners, 150 percent [as  heard] of Belarusian debts for last year's deliveries will be  settled by financial means while 50 percent will be met by  supplying Russia's Gasprom with equipment and materiel. This  year's debt will be settled by financial means. A repayment  schedule for this quarter has already been agreed upon. An  agreement in principle has also been reached on the joint  ownership of property of the territory of Belarus, but the  actual Russian ownership share will be determined at a later  date. According to ITAR-TASS, it was determined that a final  resolution of the questions under discussion will be adopted  within the next 10 days.</p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SOLANA BEACH  </P> <P> Criminal charges will not be filed against a school bus driver who blacked out  and crashed into a video store Wednesday, the California Highway Patrol said.  </P> <P> Robert Wykowski, 39, told an officer that he had been treated for epileptic  seizures about 10 years ago, CHP spokesman Jerry Bohrer said.  </P> <P> Wykowski said his driver's license was suspended during the treatment period.  </P> <P> "There is no indication on his medical records," Bohrer said. "If it had shown  up, he wouldn't have qualified for driving school buses."  </P> <P> Wykowski failed to mention his condition, and the application for a bus  operator's certificate does not request such information, Bohrer said. However,  a medical form asks employees if they have had epileptic seizures.  </P> <P> When Wykowski's medical record was updated in August, he answered no to the  epileptic seizure question, Bohrer said.  </P> <P> "It appears he wasn't truthful," Bohrer said. "If he didn't tell the doctor,  there's no way the doctor can know."  </P> <P> Bohrer said the CHP has requested the suspension of Wykowski's bus driver  certificate.  </P> <P> Wykowski, who told investigators that he doesn't remember the crash, is  undergoing tests at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, where he is in  stable condition, a hospital spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> A driver for Mark IV Charter, Wykowski was transporting 11 children to  Fairbanks Ranch Country Day School. The children suffered minor injuries.  FRANKI V. RANSOM  </P></p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / EC backs de Larosiere for EBRD: Italy and Denmark withdraw their candidates at last minute THE 12-nation European Community reached a last-minute consensus last night to propose Mr Jacques de Larosiere of France as the EC candidate for the presidency of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The agreement, announced in a letter to EC leaders by Mr Phillipe Maystadt, the Belgian minister of finance, came at the end of an extra week of protracted negotiations between EC members in which the EBRD candidacy was part of wider horse-trading over the siting of the future European central bank. At the last moment Italy and Denmark withdrew their candidates - Mr Giuliano Amato, the former Italian prime minister, and Mr Henning Christophersen, the Danish EC commissioner - although the Italian decision in particular is believed to have been fiercely contested by politicians in Rome angry at French domination of key international financial institutions. The nomination of Mr de Larosiere, governor of the Bank of France and a former managing director of the IMF, does not mean he will automatically become the next president of the EBRD in succession to the disgraced former president, Mr Jacques Attali. The final choice will depend on the outcome of the complex two-tier voting system in which the G7 countries have a weighted vote proportional to their shareholdings, while the 57 governors of the bank, representing shareholder governments from both east and west, have one vote each plus an additional two votes wielded by the EC and the European Investment Bank. Neither the US, which is entitled to 10 per cent of the votes as the largest single shareholder, nor Japan, another G7 member with an 8.5 per cent voting share, have formally stated their preference. But Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, hinted strongly at an OECD meeting earlier this month that the US would vote with the EC. The EC consensus practically eliminates the possibility that the fourth candidate, Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, the former Polish finance minister, could be chosen to lead the bank which was set up two years ago to foster investment in the former communist states of east Europe. Day-to-day running of the bank over the last few months has been largely in the hands of Mr Ron Freeman, the American who heads the merchant banking division of the EBRD. He is expected to continue as the effective chief executive of the bank under de Larosiere.</p>

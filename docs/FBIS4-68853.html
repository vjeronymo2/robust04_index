			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Olha Zhukovska, candidate in juridical science: </F> "Why Are There So Many Vacant Places in the Hall?"]    [Text] The situation that has developed as a result of the  elections for the people's deputies of Ukraine is deeply  worrying. The 112 vacant places after the runoff election are a  clear sign of the imperfect nature of the Law of Ukraine, "On  the Election of People's Deputies of Ukraine."    The law is supposed to reflect the needs of real life. In  the  given case, the nature of the law, detached from contemporary  realities, became the reason for the delays in the elections.    Moreover, it is noteworthy that a rule which was not  previously a feature of the electoral law of Ukraine got in the  way of the elections having a normal result. This rule was  article 46 of the Law, by which the establishment of the results  of the election in the runoff election is carried out in the  order established by article 43 of the same law, which in its  turn provides that, "a candidate for deputy is considered  elected, that gets in the election more than half of the votes  of the voters who took part in the elections, but not less than  25 percent of the number of voters on the list of voters of the  given district."    This rule, with its contents, is intended to eliminate  situations in which the opinion of an insignificant number of  voters leads accidently to the election, as people's deputy, of  a person who had been able to get a relative majority, through  the scattering of votes over a large number of registered  candidates for deputy.    As for the runoff elections, this rule works in exactly the  opposite direction.    The views of a certain percentage of voters, who do not  share  the convictions of any candidate, lead to the situation in which  none of the candidates for deputy gets the necessary number of  votes. Unfortunately, this happened in many districts.    So, despite the fundamental idea of democratic elections,  according to which the results of elections are supposed to  reflect the will of the real majority of voters, the rule of  article 46 of the Law of Ukraine "On the Election of People's  Deputies of Ukraine," led to the directly opposite outcome: the  results of the elections were actually decided by an absolute  minority of voters, that was also a relative minority with  respect to those who supported both candidates.    In this way, the principle was violated which is included in  paragraph three of article one of the law of Ukraine, "On the  Election of People's Deputies of Ukraine"--"The basic principles  and bases of the elections of People's Deputies of Ukraine,"  according to which "the elections are carried out in 450 single  mandate electoral districts on the basis of an absolute  majority."    The special rule of paragraph two of article 46 of the Law  does not ensure that the principle in article one of the same  law will be achieved. But according to one of the axiomatic  bases of the general theory of the state and law, with respect  to the interrelationships of the juridical force of the rules of  law of different types, the rules-principles have a greater  weight than special rules, when the latter contradict the former.    Moreover, this result contradicts the basis established by  paragraph three of article two of the Law, according to which,  "any direct or indirect limitations concerning the electoral  rights of the citizens of Ukraine which depend on their  political convictions ... not provided by this Law, are  forbidden." (Since in fact, if both candidates that get to the  runoff election belong to the right wing (or the reverse), then  the participation in the elections of 4-5 percent of the voters  with other convictions would have to lead (and actually led) to  the candidates being deprived of the subjective right to be  elected, provided by article two of the Law, as something that  is not restricted by political convictions.) Here there is a  contradiction between the rule-principle and the special rule.    Such conclusions are harmful in themselves. But let us try  to  foresee a further turn of events: clearly, two rounds of voting  have indicated a more or less exact "distribution of forces" in  the electoral districts. There is no basis to expect any sort of  "explosion" of activity by the voters at the start of the summer  as well, when the runoff elections are supposed to take place.  Under these conditions, the runoffs this time will also not  provide really elected deputies, or what is more probable,  generally will not take place.    However, a large amount of money will be vainly spent  carrying them out, which could be directed to social assistance  for the population.    What is the legal way out of this situation? I think that it  is worth turning to the corresponding rule of the Law of the  Ukrainian SSR, "On the Elections of the People's Deputies of the  Ukrainian SSR" (article 54), according to which, in cases of  runoff elections, the candidate for people's deputy is  considered to be elected, who received in the runoff election  the greatest number of votes of the voters who took part in the  election. The introduction of corresponding changes to the rules  of article 46 of the Law of Ukraine, "On the Election of  People's Deputies of Ukraine," would be justified for many  reasons. Analyzing the situation which developed after the  elections of 27 March and 10 April, I turned to the transcripts  of the session of the Supreme Council of Ukraine at which the  text of article 46 of this Law was discussed and confirmed.    All who spoke proposed to introduce a rule to the Law, which  would not only simplify the elections, but would make it  possible to eliminate runoff elections. But as became known  after 10 April, the established goal of simplifying the  elections was placed, by the deputies themselves, in unrealistic  frameworks.    Here it is also necessary to emphasize that the  corresponding  role of article 43 (to which article 46 refers) does not  reflect, in actuality, the position of the deputies. In the  course of the discussion of this article, there were two  pressing and disputed points: the number of people who had to  come to the elections, and a numerically adequate threshold of  votes, for the candidates to be elected.    In the first, the point of view won concerning the need for  a  minimal number of persons on the list of voters, that is equal  to 50 plus one. As for the second, actually the objections do  not come with respect to the adequacy of 25 percent of the  number of persons on the list of voters, for the election of a  candidate; the objections come only with respect to the  principle of an absolute majority of votes, and in place a  relative majority was proposed, to make the process of the  elections easier.    In the voting, the question was put in such a way that there  could not be any sort of majority of votes. This is the  transcript of session 32, 18 November 1993 (Bulletin no. 32, p.  18). Presiding: "All this is clear. Let us find a compromise.  This compromise will lead to elections having taken place only  when 50 percent of the voters on the list come. But for there to  be fewer runoff elections, a rule of 25 percent from the general  list has to be introduced. This rule will decrease the number of  runoff elections, and will indicate the victor in the voting  more quickly. Right? Can all come together on such a position?    "Vorobyov speaks correctly--a relative majority, but not  less  than 25 percent of the voters on the lists.    "So, I ask you to vote for article 46 with the corrections  we  have made. To point three--the participation of 50 percent of  the number of voters, and in point four--as in the version of  the commission, that is--not less than 25 percent of the number  of voters on the lists.    "I ask you to vote for this version."    In this way, the deputies actually while passing the law  were  supposed to think that they were voting for conditions of  election, in which for the election of a deputy, it was enough  for him to get the votes of 25 percent of the number of voters,  on the list, without any sort of numeric limitations.    And the number 50 plus one applied to the condition for  indication of elections as being effective.    So the text of the rule in article 43, and, correspondingly,  of article 46, which refers back to the former, clearly does not  correspond to the will of the deputies. Perhaps we have before  us a typical technical mistake in combination with  misunderstanding. There is all the more reason to correct it, at  least concerning runoff elections, in order to complete in a  constructive way the process of forming the parliament. As  concerns the runoff elections themselves, the above mentioned  "noble goals" of creating conditions for an effective parliament  require, for bringing them into being, quite different concrete  steps.    Will making the changes being discussed to the Law of  Ukraine, "On the Election of People's Deputies" have any  signficant negative aspects? I do not think so.    Usually, as a general rule, a law ought to be stable. But  this principle exists first of all to ensure that the rules, by  which laws are implemented, are not changed with insufficient  grounds in the direction of limiting those laws (or total  abolition). From this, it is considered unacceptable in the  theory of the state and of law, to change or implement rules of  reverse effect, which lay down obligations, establish  limitations on laws, or prohibitions, and so on.    But in this case, it concerns the direct opposite: for a  change of rules in the direction of expanding the legal bases  for implementing laws and for implementing the opposing force to  these changes, that expand the boundaries for gaining the right  to be elected.    This concerns procedures. As for the legal content of the  proposed changes, they, unquestionably, would correspond to the  general goal of democratic elections--to form a parliament by  democratic means; and to the rules-principles given above, of  the Law of Ukraine, "On the Election of People's Deputies of  Ukraine."    Moreover, the social purposefulness of the corresponding  changes is apparent; it makes it possible to form an outstanding  parliament, and saves money and effort which otherwise would  have to be spent on carrying out runoff elections without  results.    The introduction of such changes would correspond by content  not only with the previous experience of our state, but of  democratic foreign states.    In France from 1958 to 1985, there was a majoritarian  system,  so that for someone to be elected a member of parliament, a  candiate in the first round had to get a complete majority of  votes, but in the second it was enough to get a relative  majority.    So I think it is worthwhile to make changes to article 46 of  the Law of Ukraine, "On the Election of People's Deputies of  Ukraine," with paragraph two in its final version: "The  candidate for deputy will be considered elected, that got during  the runoff election the majority of votes of the voters that  took part in the voting for another candidate," and to expand  the effect of these changes to legal relations which arose  before they were accepted.</p>

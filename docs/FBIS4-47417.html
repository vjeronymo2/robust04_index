Microscopic  observations were conducted on prosenchymal cells taken from  areas near the central vascular fiber sheaf of Vallisneria  leaves exposed to water samples fr 1-1.5 hours at  20-24C, using the chloroplasts as markers of  protoplasm movement. Weak toxicity elicited  20%-50% decreases  in movement or 20%-80% increases. Moderate  toxicity caused  decreases of 50%-80% or increases of  80%-150%. Severe  toxicity was seen at decreases of 80%- 90% and  increases of  150%-200%. Decreases of more than 90% and  increases of more  than 200% were lethal. Severe and lethal toxicity was  accompanied by observable structural changes in the cells.  Samples taken from the Dunay River in 1988 gave varying results,  from 311% to 0. The stimulatory effects seen in the upper  portions of the river were due to the presence of phosphates in  the water. Tests conducted in 1991 on the Dneper Reservoir did  not demonstrate any severe or lethal toxicity. Weak or moderate  toxicity was characteristic of the bottom layers of dam head  races, as well as various inlets small river mouths. Method  response was determined as a function of the concentrations of  Mn, Cu, Zn, and Ni. The data obtained demonstrate the  suitability of the method for evaluating the quality of natural  and waste water, as well as for screening new biologically-actve  compounds.

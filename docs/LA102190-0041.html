			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW TO VISIT THE PANTANAL  </P> <P> Getting there: Varig Brazilian Airlines flies from Los Angeles to Rio de  Janeiro four times weekly, and from Rio to Cuiaba twice daily, telephone (800)  468-2744. Round trip to Cuiaba costs about $1,675.  </P> <P> When to go: Best time to visit the Pantanal is during the dry season, May to  mid-November, when few tourists can be found and millions of migrant birds  return to nest.  </P> <P> Tours: For my trip, I used F&amp;H Travel Consulting, 4545 Baseline Ave., Santa  Ynez, Calif. 93460, (800) 544-5503. Run by two Brazilians, F&amp;H handled all  of my travel arrangements, and I paid hundreds of dollars less than if I had  attempted to do it myself. The cost is about $2,000 for five nights in the  Pantanal, including round-trip air fare, lodging, guide, ground transportation  and breakfasts.  </P> <P> Where to stay: Cabanas do Pantanal, MTConfiance Turismo Ltda., Rua Candido  Mariano 434, Cuiaba, Brazil, 011-55-65-321-4142 or 322-1353. Approximately $55  per person per night. Price includes land rides, fishing and a boat ride to and  from the hotel.  </P> <P> Hotel Pixaim, Porto Jofre, Brazil, 011-55-65-322-8961. Approximately $35 per  night for two. Breakfast included.  </P> <P> For more information: Contact the Department of Tourism, Brazilian Consulate,  3810 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1500, Los Angeles 90010, (213) 382-3133. S.D.  </P></p>

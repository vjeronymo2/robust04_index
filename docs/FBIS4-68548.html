			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anna Politkovskaya: "A Dead Season For Domestic </F> Journalism?"]    [Text] Any day now, the State Duma is expected to  adopt the federal law, "On the Order of Illuminating the  Activity of Organs of State Power in the State Mass Media,"  which seriously limits the capacities of Russia's journalists to  carry out their professional responsibilities. The newspapers  have already written about this--we are not the first here.  Nevertheless, the topic seems to us to be so important and  capable of significantly altering the political physiognomy of  Russia, that we have decided to return to it once again.    The draft law was developed under the direct leadership of  Mikhail Poltoranin, who is currently the chairman of the Duma  Committee on Information Policy and Communications, Deputy  Kirill Ignatyev, and two unknown jurists from some Academy of  the Deputy Corps. The first reading of the draft law passed  almost unanimously in the Duma, an occurrence which happens  there quite rarely. This time they were able to accomplish that  which even the president cannot seem to do--the document pleased  the overwhelming Duma majority.    Let us ponder over what this new law may actually bring to  each of our lives.    The draft law contains 20 articles. The first names the  specific object of regulations--these are the relations arising  in connection with the dissemination by the state mass media of  materials or announcements on the activity of the agencies of  state power of the Russian Federation and its subjects. The  second gives assurance that the proposed paper is no more and no  less than the ONLY (as if the Law on the Mass Media did not even  exist?--author's note) "standard legal legislative statute on  the procedure of such illumination." The third article explains  that henceforth we should understand specifically as agencies of  state power, i.e., those whom we should relate to this caste,  which with the receipt of either state position or deputy  certification, automatically acquire, in accordance with the  articles of the given draft law, a practically unlimited right  to speak on the air and to publish in printed publications  whatever it, this caste, sees fit.    It is proposed that the following should be considered as  agencies of state power: The president, the Federal Assembly,  the government, the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court, the  Higher Arbitration Court, representative and executive agencies  of the republics, krays, oblasts, cities, autonomous oblasts,  and autonomous okrugs. In short, very many people. And all of  them receive their piece of the television and radio air time.  Even if every other one decides to exercise this right, then we,  the viewers, listeners and readers, will have a hard time of it.  There will simply not be any time for anything else.    Article 7 obligates state television and radio to include in  its daily information programs, on the day of the appropriate  event, reports on:    1) "decisions and actions entering into the competency of  the  president or the Constitutional Court, or within the  jurisdiction of the houses of the Federal Assembly;" 2)  "announcements of the president, the houses of the Federal  Assembly, and the government;" 3) "speeches by the chairman of  the RF government, deputy government chairmen, and federal  ministers at meetings of the houses of the RF Federal Assembly;"  4) "press conferences of the RF President, the chairman of the  RF Government, the deputy government chairmen, chairman of the  Council of Federations, chairman of the State Duma, as well as  press conferences held at the decision of committees,  commissions, factions or deputy groups of the houses of the RF  Council of Federations"; 5) "other socially significant facts  regarding the activity of federal agencies of power."    According to Article 9, the specific conditions for airing  such announcements are also regulated: "In informational  programs of state audio-visual mass media, reports on... (read  preceding paragraph--author's note) must be broadcast  exclusively as an individual block at the start of the program.  ...These reports are not commented upon. The reports must be  accompanied by a video series of the given meeting... The  priority right to an interview in an informational or  informational-educational program on the question of the agenda  belongs to the speaker on the given question, the subject of the  right of legislative initiative, and the representative of the  profiled committee..." Furthermore, the LAW (!) establishes a  precise hierarchy, who must follow whom in giving the journalist  an interview. The journalist thus becomes that very same  microphone holder of communist times--a role which he had so  desperately tried to escape all these long years of perestroyka.    The draft law intervenes even into the very structure of the  television and radio programming: "The duration of a block of  announcements in informational television and radio programs on  the work of the Federal Assembly houses on the days of their  meeting must comprise no less than: 30 seconds--for programs  lasting up to 3 minutes; 1 minute--for programs lasting from 3  to 10 minutes; 2 minutes--for programs lasting from 10 to 20  minutes; 3 minutes--for programs lasting from 20 to 35 minutes,  and 4 minutes--for programs lasting over 35 minutes."    For violation of the numerous principles of the proposed  draft, administrative as well as criminal responsibility is  introduced, both for journalists who have not fulfilled the  requirements of the law, and for editors who have allowed  airing, for example, of an interview outside the hierarchy  established by the law. Moreover, soon the Duma will already  begin reviewing corrections to the Criminal Code, introduced by  that very same Committee on Informational Policy, in accordance  with which a journalist who has violated the effective  legislation in the sphere of the mass media may be deprived of  the right to work in his specialty.    We must point out that the draft of these corrections  concerns all journalists without exception--television, radio,  and newspeople representing state, independent, private--in  short any--publications, companies or studios. If the  editor-in-chief of a publication, company or studio nevertheless  decides to continue publishing or airing under a pseudonym the  materials of a journalist who has fallen into disgrace, then he,  the chief, will also be threatened with removal from his  position, and will lose the right to occupy it ever again in the  future!    In our opinion, everyone today simply must ask himself the  question of whether he is capable of working under the proposed  conditions. If not, then we must, for the n-th time, show strict  corporative solidarity in the face of the real danger of  infringing upon our professional rights!    And now about the main thing: We may banter as much as we  like about the unfortunate, clumsy articles which infringe upon  the right of journalists. But what bothers is something  else--the sad circumstance that the draft law has received  almost unanimous support. And for this there are at least two  explanations. First of all, the developers have placed a correct  stake on the vulnerable domestic world of those who, having  finally clawed their way to the top, want to be and to remain  the nomenklatura, having no intentions whatsoever of departing  from the political power scene together with the next elections.  As we know, the only terrible and real enemy on this thorny path  is the journalist. He is today regularly despised not only by  the entire Duma, but by the entire Federal Assembly, the  government, the presidential administration, and so on, and so  on, and so on. The journalist is blamed for the disintegration  of the Union, for the collapse of the economy, for the decline  of a stable state, for fanning hatred toward Khasbulatov's  Supreme Soviet, for the regional wars, and finally for  Zhirinovskiy. There is only one way to please this entire motley  crowd, and all at once: By bridling the mass media. This is  extremely necessary to all political parties and currents,  without exception.    The second explanation appears although not as superficial  as  the first, but nevertheless it too has received the right to  existence in the current political arrangement. The fact is that  in the current everyday dealings of the Duma, that "working  moment" which in common language is called "selling out" has  become rather widespread. According to the information of a  source who, for understandable reasons, asked not to be named in  the newspaper--a source who nevertheless engages in direct  lawmaking activity--this draft law has become the victim of a  deal within the Duma. The Zhirinovskiy followers have agreed not  to vote down a law which is important to the democratic and  sober minded deputies in exchange for the consent of the latter  to share their votes during the voting on the mass media. In  short, we--journalists and all our publications, studios and  companies--have become a change coin on the political scale.  They thought that we would survive anyway. But will we survive?    There is still time until the second reading, and that means  the final acceptance of the draft law into law. And we are  pinning great hopes on this, because it, as we know, is the  cure. Perhaps during Easter week those Duma members who owe  their emergence on the political scene entirely to the mass  media, glasnost and freedom of speech will once again check  their own moral scales to see what is dearer for them: A free  press or a deal with the Zhirinovskiy followers. We sincerely  hope that their common sense wins out.</p>

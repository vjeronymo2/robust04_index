			<p>This     press review series focuses on economic, social, and  demographic issues in the Maghreb countries of Algeria, Libya,  Morocco, and Tunisia.     MOROCCO     France Freezes Financial Aid to Morocco     London Arabic expatriate dailyAL-HAYAH has reported that France  will freeze nearly FFI billion in financial aid promised to Morocco  by the Beregovoy government and will limit other financial aid for  that country to short-term loans for Moroccan-French joint ventures  working on local projects.  French officials reportedly argued that  with the continuing economic downturn in France, reduced aid to  Morocco is justified in view of that country's foreign currency  reserves in excess of $3.5 billion and the stronger showing of the  Moroccan dirham vis-a-vis European currencies, especially the French  franc.  Furthermore, French officials were said to now give priority  to aid requests from Africa and other French territories.     The direct French financial aid packages for Morocco affected by  this decision were:     FF35O to 500 million in grants and financing for the Moroccan  budget deficit.     Nearly FF500 million in long-term loans with interest not  exceeding 2.5 percent.     Among the important French loans still programmed for Morocco in  1994 are:     FF300 million to expand the activities of ALCATEL in  telecommunications.     FF200 million to purchase two freighters.     FF160 million to continue nuclear energy research for peaceful  purposes and electricity production.     FF70 million for the Office of Communications.     FF81 million for the Office of Phosphates.     FF15 million for the Office of Electricity.     According to AL-HAYAH, French aid to Morocco has declined since  1990, because of the French policy that approves aid only to joint  ventures or for projects that provide for the purchase of French  goods and products.  This decline reportedly reflects France's  concern that its share of the Moroccan market has dwindled to 22  percent.  Sources cited by AL-HAYAH reported that the purpose of the  French aid freeze is to pressure Moroccan officials-to give  preference to French firms in local development projects.  (London  AL-HAYAH 11 Jan 94)     Ministerial Visit Nets Loan Agreement     Moroccan Prime Minister Mohamed Karim Lamrani led a delegation of  government ministers and other officials to Madrid in December,  where they reached agreement on a series of loans to Morocco  totaling 150 billion Spanish pesetas to purchase Spanish goods and  maintain the preferential fishing arrangement for 650 Spanish boats  operating in Moroccan waters.  A joint communique issued after the  visit affirmed Spanish willingness to offer financial support for  development programs in Morocco's northern provinces, as well as to  complete studies on plans for a Maghreb-Europe gas pipeline,  telecommunications networks via undersea cable, and a fiber-optic  communications line.     According to Rabat daily AL-ANBA', 1992 Spanish investment in  Morocco constituted 19 percent of all foreign investment in the  country.  The paper reported that Prime Minister Lamrani has stated  that more work is necessary "to encourage letting Spanish contracts  in Morocco, similar to French and EU contracts, in order to realize  a comprehensive and gradual development of the economy of the two  countries."  Lamrani also noted that several cooperative  educational, cultural and environmental projects were planned.     Lamrani acknowledged the need to solve the problem of  transporting people and goods over the Straits of Gibraltar,  especially when workers cross into Spain during the summer.  He also  acknowledged that the two countries were investigating ways of  stemming the tide of illegal Noroccan emigrants and illicit drugs  into Spain.

Moroccan authorities  asked EU representatives in Morocco to intervene "to end these acts  which harm not only Moroccan-Spanish relations, but Moroccan-EU  relations as well."  The incident took place the day after the  Moroccan-EU commission meeting on fisheries and one month after the  EU announced a grant of 155 billion Spanish pesetas to the Spanish  fishing industry to renovate its fleet and repair ports.  Disputes  continue between Morocco and Spain over the use of fishing beds that  have been declared off-limits during a "biological pause" to enable  stocks to replenish themselves.  According to a front-page article  in Rabat daily AL-'ALAM, the Spanish fishing lobby is putting  pressure on Morocco and the EU to reduce the duration of biological  pauses, and has objected to Moroccan boats fishing in areas that are  off-limits to Spain.  (Rabat L'OPINION 18 Jan 94; Rabat AL-'ALAM 6  Jan 94; Rabat AL-MITHAQ AL-WATANI 25 Dec 93)     Foreign Minister Addresses Ceuta, Melilla Question     Foreign Minister Abdellatif Filali reportedly told the Moroccan  Council of Deputies that Morocco still seeks to establish a joint  Spanish-Moroccan commission to study the future of Ceuta and  Melilla, even though he said King Hassan's 1987 letter to King Juan  Carlos requesting this has yet to be answered.  Regarding recent  discussions among Spanish parliamentarians concerning the  possibility of granting self-rule to the two cities, Filali opined  that the discussions would not lead to self-rule, but rather to  further development of the existing city government system.  (London  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT 21 Jan 94)     Spanish Investment in Melilla Being Studied     The Spanish Economics Ministry is reportedly studying a proposal  to fund development in Melilla.  The proposal would involve EU  cooperation and would provide up to 35 billion Spanish pesetas to  the city from 1994 to 1999.  The proposal would raise Melilla's  development budget to 53 billion Spanish pesetas over the next six  years.

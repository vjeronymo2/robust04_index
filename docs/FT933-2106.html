			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Doubts over future of City's cordon SERIOUS DOUBTS emerged yesterday over whether the security cordon thrown around the City of London in the wake of two IRA car-bomb attacks would be continued beyond its experimental phase. City police and the City corporation favour making the traffic restrictions a permanent feature in the belief that they have improved safety, cut serious crime and brought environmental benefits. However, senior ministers are believed to be opposed to using the traffic control scheme to combat terrorism on the grounds that it has been a propaganda coup for the IRA. City of London police commissioner Owen Kelly said yesterday that the traffic control scheme had been 'a key element in keeping the terrorists off balance'. He told a City seminar on security that the cordon had contributed to an 18.2 per cent drop in serious crime, mainly burglaries, in the City this year and helped to improve safety in the wake of the car bomb attacks. But he added that the cordon had not been universally popular and some members of the government were thought to be against it. He had the authority to run the scheme for six months and could renew it for a further six months but 'after that it is up to the government'. However, Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, who also addressed the seminar, declined to say whether he would support the continuation of the scheme. He said it would be up to the transport secretary 'to adjudicate at the time'. Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the policy and resources committee of the City of London Corporation said his understanding was that opposition came from the Department of Transport. 'It has improved security but it has also had good environmental benefits,' Mr Cassidy said. Metropolitan Police commissioner Paul Condon told the seminar, which was organised by London First, a private sector pressure group of leading bankers and insurers, that there was a need for greater vigilance, more use of closed circuit television and a change in the law to allow more random searches of individuals and vehicles. The cordon was set up three months ago after a bomb exploded in Bishopsgate near the NatWest tower and Hongkong and Shanghai bank in April killing one person and injuring more than 40. In April last year a bomb exploded at St Mary Axe killing three people and injuring up to 90. Editorial Comment, Page 19</p>

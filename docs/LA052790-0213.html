			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YELTSIN FAILS TO CLINCH PRESIDENCY, WILL TRY AGAIN  </P> <P> Radical reformer Boris N. Yeltsin failed Saturday to win a majority in  balloting for president of Russia, the largest Soviet republic, but said he  will start a new campaign Monday for another election.  </P> <P> The Congress of the Russian Federation will take new nominations then, and  Yeltsin said he will stick to his platform of transferring economic and  political decision-making power from central authorities to the republic --  despite opposition from Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  </P> <P> "I am not going to change on matters of principle," he said as he strode  through the Kremlin grounds after Saturday's runoff election in Parliament.  </P> <P> Gorbachev accused Yeltsin on Wednesday of being anti-socialist and said his  demands for Russian sovereignty would mean "the breakup of the Soviet Union."  </P> <P> In Friday's first round of balloting, Yeltsin won 497 votes, forcing a runoff  Saturday. Yeltsin received 503 votes in the second round; he needed 531.  </P> <P> His principal opponent, Krasnodar Communist Party chief Ivan K. Polozkov, won  473 votes in the first round and 458 in the second.  </P> <P> Also Saturday, Moscow city authorities pleaded with citizens to stop hoarding  food and accused the government of panicking the thousands who thronged shops.  </P> <P> Mass buying was sparked when Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov appeared on  television Thursday to outline government plans for a market economy, under  which basic food prices would soar.  </P> <P> In response to the chaos, the Moscow city council postponed until Monday a  two-week ban on food sales to out-of-town residents, which was to take effect  Saturday.  </P> <P> Moscow Mayor Gavriil Popov, appealing for calm, told a news conference: "The  situation in the city is getting critical. There is a real danger of things  getting out of control. Hundreds of thousands of people are in the shops."  </P></p>

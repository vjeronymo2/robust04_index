			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 24 (YONHAP) -- Deputy Prime Minister Yi  Hong-ku said Tuesday the government embargo on inter-Korean  economic cooperation will continue until the dispute over  Pyongyang's nuclear program takes a favorable turn.    In a speech to the Federation of Korean Industries, Yi said  inter-Korean economic cooperation including businessmen's visits  to North Korea are not being allowed due to the nuclear problem,  adding that "this will continue until the nuclear dispute takes  a turn for the better."    He said, however, that the government will take a flexible  attitude toward economic cooperation, considering the  development of the nuclear issue, in preparation for a variety  of opportunities that may come with the settlement of the  nuclear row. Yi was speaking before a group of businessmen  interested in South-North Korean trade at an event arranged by  Rep. Kang Kyong-sik of the Democratic Liberal Party and Rep. Yi  Pu-yong of the Democratic Party.    The participants, from major business groups, insisted on a  positive line in South-North trade to ensure economic  development in the long term, although they understand the  government's position of linking economic cooperation with the  nuclear problem.</p>

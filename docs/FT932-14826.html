			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / UK Company News: BP chief defends predecessor's pay-off Lord Ashburton, chairman of BP, has defended the Pounds 1.5m package of compensation and pension payments made to Mr Robert Horton, his predecessor who was ousted in a boardroom coup last summer. He told the annual meeting that 'the figures are in absolute terms large, and perhaps larger than are easily understood'. But, he said, the Pounds 780,000 paid in compensation was what Mr Horton could have expected to receive in court proceedings if the company had not agreed to pay. Some Pounds 723,000 was also made to the pension fund to ensure his pension rights were fully funded.</p>

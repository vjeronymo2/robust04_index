			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Sevindzh Abdullayeva, Viktor </F> Shulman]    [Text] Baku June 18 TASS -- It is necessary to fully  coordinate negotiations on Armenian-Azeri settlement, head of  the CSCE Minsk group on Nagorno-Karabakh Jan Eliasson said here  today.    Eliasson has returned from Baku upon the completion of  consultations in Yerevan and Stepanakert and met Azeri President  Geydar Aliyev tonight.    In his opinion, pulled efforts of the sides, the mediating  missions of CSCE and Russia will help to elaborate a common  concept of the problem solution. He said that cease-fire in the  conflict zone has begun an important settlement stage and the  settlement process should have the right direction.    It is also important to prevent a new escalation of combat  operations. That is why, the persons who are responsible for  further developments should estimate their chance correctly and  reach certain compromises in order to settle the conflict  peacefully and through political negotiations, said Eliasson.    The most correct way towards peace is gradual solution of  problems that have piled up over the conflict years. Each stage  should be connected with another in a single link, he noted.  Such a constructive approach will ensure the withdrawal of  Armenian troops from Azeri lands, return of refugees to places  of their permanent residence and security guarantees for  Karabakh Armenians, which is considered the most important in  the settlement by each side, said Eliasson.</p>

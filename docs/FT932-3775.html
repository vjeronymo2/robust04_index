			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Miners switch support to MBO MINERS AT the Betws coal mine in south Wales have voted to abandon their bid to run the pit. They now support a management buy-out team of four pit executives. Betws, in Dyfed, is one of 20 pits that British Coal is inviting the private sector to operate, having decided that they have no long-term future under its ownership. Mr Martin Cook, the Betws deputy manager heading the bid, will outline the buy-out proposal to Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, at a private meeting in London next week. Mr Cook said: 'The beauty of our scheme is that the colliery will remain in local hands, worked by local people. We are not in it to make a quick profit and then pull out as, we suspect, other independents might favour.' Mr Cook's team plans to extend the Betws colliery's life for up to 10 years, mining anthracite coal for which there is a strong demand. Last year more than 800,000 tonnes were imported. Mr Cook said the buy-out's adviser, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, had already had strong interest in the plan from City backers. Betws is one of five pits that were put out for tender on Thursday, the others being Rossington, Markham Main, Bevercotes and Clipston.</p>

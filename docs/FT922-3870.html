			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Maxwell pensioners to receive Pounds 2.5m help THE GOVERNMENT yesterday announced a review of pensions law to report within a year and emergency grants of Pounds 2.5m to deal with the plight of those worst affected by the theft from Maxwell company pension funds. Announcing the grants in the House of Commons, Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said: 'Rarely in the catalogue of crime has there been a fraud as callous and despicable as the pillaging of pension funds by Robert Maxwell.' He said the grants were not compensation for pensioners, but 'temporary, emergency funding' to help Maxwell schemes which were unable to maintain payments over the next few months. If the schemes turned out to have sufficient assets to meet their commitments, the funds - but not individual pensioners - would be expected to repay the emergency grants. The short-term funding is expected to last for five or six months at most, until after a court ruling on allocating the Pounds 100m of disputed assets frozen in the Common Investment Fund. Those first in line for assistance will be 240 pensioners in the Headington Pension Plan whose payments have been stopped, and 5,000 in the Maxwell Communication Corporation works scheme who face drastic reductions from July 1. The 'drip-feed' of temporary funding meets one of the main points urged on the government by the 100-plus all-party group of MPs campaigning on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners. The issue has been rising up the political agenda since more than Pounds 400m was found to be missing from Maxwell pension funds. Yesterday's announcement coincided with a lobby at Westminster in which up to 1,000 Maxwell pensioners took part. Mr Lilley was cheered by MPs for urging financial institutions which held more than Pounds 200m in Maxwell pension fund assets as security against loans to the companies to 'examine their consciences' about returning the money to help the pensioners. Last night about 20 Labour MPs tabled a Commons motion calling on the government to recover cash by using its sequestration powers. Though the pledge of Pounds 2.5m was seen as 'insultingly meagre' by Labour and some campaigners, some ministers had argued against providing any public funds at all, on the grounds that more pressure should be put on the banks and that it would be impossible to 'turn the tap off once it has been turned on'. There was also a general welcome for the independent and wide-ranging review of pension law and regulation, which will address the status and ownership of pension funds. Mr Lilley also said he would implement a provision of the 1990 Social Security Act which would make any deficiency of pension funds that have been wound up, a debt on the employer company. It has been a key demand of Maxwell campaigners. Mr Michael Meacher, shadow social security secretary, welcomed some of the measures, but said the total bore 'no relation to the full extent and depth of the government's moral and legal responsibility in this matter'. 'It's a very nice sort of cosmetic move,' said Mr Kenneth Trench, chairman of the Maxwell Pensioners Action Group.</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (21): Magnates rent hidden villas on the cliffs - Staying on / Andrew Hill finds plenty of big fish in Portofino Even if you have never been to Portofino, you may have heard of it. If you haven't heard of it, you've certainly heard of the people who have. Guy de Maupassant, Nietzsche, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Truman Capote, Rex Harrison and Richard Burton were all enchanted by the tiny Ligurian port. Its reputation for attracting the high life is such that it is probably the only fishing village in the world to have a Swiss watch named after it. There may not be many fishermen in Portofino now, but there are still plenty of big fish. Italian magnates rent the hidden villas barnacled on to the cliffs on either side of the cove, while the international crowd moor their giant yachts offshore or thread them between the fishing boats to reach the harbour itself. All summer, ocean-going eyesores float in front of the trompe l'oeil pastel facades, as ugly as two-storey caravans abandoned on a medieval village green. Tenders from Cunard cruise ships, anchored in the bay, shuttle passengers back and forth between their floating hotels and the luxury boutiques and expensive restaurants around the harbour, while fat American families wobble down into the village from the Dollars 520-a-night, 63-room Splendido just above the port. For those who can't get a hotel room in high summer, there are still a few options. You could make an early bid for one of the limited places in the village's new (and cleverly concealed) multi-storey car park. Alternatively, take the regular ferry from down the coast, or do as the Italians do and ride in on a Vespa from neighbouring Santa Margherita and Rapallo to stroll and gawp, fragrant focaccia - the local pizza-like snack - in one hand, scooter helmet in the other. Given its obvious popularity, it seems odd that Liguria's best-known resort is going out of its way to promote itself internationally. Yet Gianni Artioli, Portofino's mayor, insists that by the mid-1980s the village had an image problem. 'We'd slipped a little in quality: the village had become a holiday place and nothing more', he says. 'There was a need to do something, to stimulate something.' Like all good politicians, Artioli traces the transformation in local fortunes to the beginning of his own term in office in 1986. What started as a couple of evenings of jazz in the piazza last year became 'Portofino, Porto d'Arte', an ambitious summer arts festival. That means that you no longer have to be a gawper or a preener to enjoy Portofino in the summer, and there is a more eclectic mix of visitors on the waterfront. Italy's prime minister, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, is a frequent visitor to Portofino. This year Mr Berlusconi's alleged dinner-table indiscretions about allies and enemies made front-page news, and no doubt enhanced the takings of the Puny restaurant where he made them. Also there was Aldo Busi, the flamboyant bad boy of contemporary Italian literature. His dramatic monologue Clementina Gnoccoli (an extract from his book, Sodomies in Elevenpoint), was premiered in the village's 120-seat Teatrino during the festival. Not that Portofino is trying to shake off its glitzy image. As Paola Brusati Paleari, the festival's artistic director, puts it: 'The middle- to low-brow tourists don't find much which is interesting in Portofino.' The beaches on the promontory are disappointingly small, privately owned or occupied by regiments of pay-as-you-bronze deckchairs, and the former fisherfolk know that the average yacht owner will pay handsomely for local specialities such as pesto sauce or the triangular filled pasta, pansotti, and charge accordingly. But the village benefits from the festival. For example, the artistic initiative has just reached Castello Brown, perched above the harbour. The ancient fortress of San Giorgio, which was the setting for the feature film Enchanted April, was the residence of a Mr Yeats Brown, the British consul in Genoa who 'discovered' Portofino in 1870. This year, for the first time, the castle was transformed into a rough-and-ready exhibition space. Restoration of the interior should follow, together with the repainting of the extravagantly decorated facades of the fishing cottages in the harbour. In the meantime the exhibition - a collection of Italian fashion photography - will travel as far as Gothenburg and Yokohama, spreading the name of Portofino. Seeing the crowded centre in summer, you have to hope that greater fame will alert some tourists to the charms of Portofino out of season. Even the Splendido languished half-empty when it opened for the first time last winter. It does so again this year. Not that you see a more authentic Portofino in the closed season, just a quieter one. Thanks to conservation schemes, wild boar are supposed to have returned to the woods behind the harbour, but no amount of cultural initiatives can bring back, say, the village school or local life independent of the summer rush. 'In the south, you hear about villages which are empty because of poverty', says the mayor in a rare moment of nostalgia. 'Here, people have moved out because of wealth.' Yeats Brown has a lot to answer for. Andrew Hill was a guest of the Comune di Portofino and stayed at the Hotel Nazionale in the centre of the village, tel: (0185)-269575, fax: -269578</p>

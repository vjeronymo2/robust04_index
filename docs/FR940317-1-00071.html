			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.25  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Incident to service exclusionary rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A claim for personal injury or death of a member of the armed forces of the United States or a civilian employee of the United States that accrued incident to his or her service is not payable under this regulation. A property damage claim that accrued incident to the service of a member of the Armed Forces may be payable under 31 U.S.C. 3721 (subpart K) or the MCA (subpart C), depending on the facts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Property damage claims.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A claim for damage to or loss of personal property of a claimant who is within one of the categories of proper party claimants listed in &sect;536.163, which is otherwise cognizable under &sect;536.164, must first be considered thereunder. If a claim is not clearly compensable under subpart K, and it arises incident to a noncombat activity of the DA or was caused by a negligent or wrongful act or omission of military personnel or civilian employees of DOD, it may be cognizable under either the MCA or the FTCA. The claim, if meritorious in fact, will probably be payable under one authorization or another regardless of whether the claim accrued incident to the service of the claimant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Personal injury and death claims.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Only after the death or personal injury has been determined to have not been incurred incident to the member's service should subparts C and D be studied to determine which, if either, provides a proper basis for settlement of the claim. In any event, the rule in U.S. v. Brooks, 176 F.2d 482 (4th Cir. 1949) requiring setoff of amounts obtained though military or veterans' compensation systems against amounts otherwise recoverable will be followed. Other Government benefits funded by general Treasury revenues, not by the claimant's contributions, may also be used as a setoff against the settlement, for example,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Overton  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 619 F.2d 1299 (8th Cir. 1980).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) As the incident to service issue is determinative as to whether this type of claim may be processed administratively, the applicable law and facts should be carefully considered before deciding that injury or death was not incident to service. Such claims also are often difficult to settle on the issue of quantum and thus more likely to end in litigation. Moreover, the United States may well elect to defend the lawsuit on the basis of the incident to service exclusion and this defense could be prejudiced by a contrary administrative determination that a service member's personal injuries or death were not incident to service. Doubtful cases will be forwarded to the Commander, USARCS without action along with sufficient factual information to permit a determination of the incident to service question.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.26  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Property damage appraisers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Appraisers will be used as follows: (1) Appraisers should be used in all claims where an appraisal is reasonably necessary and useful in effectuating the administrative settlement of the claim. Appraisals may not be economically feasible in some cases involving property damage of less than $100 per item and the extent of damage may be determined by personal inspection and agreement with the claimant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Where an appraisal is considered necessary, the claims officer and claimant should mutually agree, whenever possible, upon a disinterested appraiser after determining the approximate cost of the appraisal. The method of payment should be agreed upon in advance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) If the claimant pays for the appraisal and can substantiate payment thereof by a paid bill or cancelled check, such cost is a reimbursable element of damage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) If the DA is absorbing the cost of the appraisal, payment is made from Appropriations, Operation and Maintenance, Army (AR 37&hyph;108, paragraph 3&hyph;74).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If a single appraiser cannot be agreed upon, a joint appraisal can be conducted (that is one in which an appraiser chosen by claimant and an appraiser chosen by the Government both examine the property and submit their respective appraisals). Joint appraisals should be coordinated and monitored by the claims officer. The cost of a single or joint appraisal should be commensurate with the amount of damage allegedly sustained and the fee charged by other appraisers for similar work.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Appraisals by other organizations within the DA, the other Armed Services, or other Federal agencies may be used in addition to or in lieu of independent appraisal when obtainable. Other organizations within DA may be called upon to furnish such appraisals; for example, engineer districts will furnish an appraiser, if available, in regard to damage to buildings or diminution in value of real property, provided the requesting office defrays travel expenses for the individual's TDY.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.27  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Independent medical examinations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) In claims involving serious personal injuries, for example, cases in which there is an allegation of temporary or permanent disability, the claimant should be examined by an independent physician, or other medical specialist, depending upon the nature and extent of the injuries. The necessity for, and the cost of, the examination should be commensurate with the severity of the injuries allegedly sustained and the fee charged by other examiners for similar work. To preclude duplication of effort and expense, both claimant and the claims officer must agree, in advance, upon the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The examiner chosen to conduct the examination and the location of the medical facility (whether governmental or civilian).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) That the examiner's report constitutes the best evidence of the nature and extent of claimant's injuries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The method of paying for the examination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The necessity for conducting the medical examination must be approved by the claims office having monetary jurisdiction over the largest claim or potential claim arising out of the incident. If a medical report is submitted in conjunction with the filing of a claim, such report should be included in the file.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Payment of a civilian examiner's fee can be accomplished in either of the following two ways:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Graham Mather article: "Roving Across Frontiers"] </F>   [Text] Many observers will share the balanced judgment of  Jim Thomas of the MSF [Manufacturing, Science and Finance] union  on BMW's acquisition of Rover: "It's a great shame that UK  ownership will be lost. However, we have two quality companies  coming together and they will be able to pool research and  development resources."    Why should it be a great shame for Rover to become part of a  larger European group? What is the downside of foreign  ownership? BMW's price looks good, jobs are secured, the merged  group will be a quality player in European and world markets,  its scale will attract new investment, its prestige will help  pull in the best managers and staff.    And yet and yet; the instinctive hesitation persists. Won't  key decisions now be taken by Germans? In the event of a  downturn, won't the British end be the first to suffer? More  generally, why are so many top-class, hi-tech British businesses  now being acquired by French or German companies?    The truth is that more overseas acquisitions of British  companies are both likely and desirable. They are likely because  Britain's post-war economic underperforrmance and the steady  devaluation of the pound against the mark, and more recently  against the franc, makes for a ratchet to overseas ownership.  Accommodating overall economic underperformance by devaluation  -- most recently on Black Wednesday -- eases political pressures  at home but increases the supply of the best British businesses  available to purchasers based in strong currency zones.    Rover is now a manufacturing star: but in the latest World  Competitiveness Report, British manufacturing is perceived to be  bottom of the list: 22nd out of 22 developed countries assessed.  The paradox is that our historical weakness in manufacturing  makes the exceptional performers tempting takeover targets.    Foreign ownership can be positively desirable. All the  evidence is that European or North American purchasers of  hi-tech companies have every incentive to give them maximum  business autonomy, to preserve their brand images, to allow  competing centres of excellence to flourish while squeezing  costs.    Where British businesses have achieved turnrounds on the  scale of that achieved by Rover, it would be crazy for their new  owners to lose their identities or make them mere outstations:  the purchaser needs their distinct strengths to help capture  markets that are at once larger and more discriminating.    The net effect of overseas interest in Britain's economy has  been foreign direct investment of more than 3 percent of GDP (in  1990) -- higher than manufacturing investment itself. This has  had a tangible result: by the end of the 1980s foreign-owned  firms were getting 45 percent more output from their British  workers than their British equivalents (a net output per  employee of 39,260 pounds compared with a domestic 27,157  pounds).    Rover is a textbook example of the process. It was rescued  from its past by Japanese investment. It was freed from  political control by privatisation. Now German resources can  turn the new group into a truly world-class player.    When heavyweight British businesses are acquired by foreign  owners of the scale and resources of BMW, there is no economic  disadvantage. The domicile of its ultimate parent has little or  no bearing on Rover's prospects; its parent's commercial  commitment and compatibility with the rest of the group are far  more important.    A new wave of acquisitions and mergers is likely to  accompany  global recovery, but it will be particularly acute in Europe as  the business community restructures to take advantage of the  large single market. Economic liberals, especially those who  supported both a floating currency and the single market, can  hardly complain as this integration takes place driven by  markets not politics and with competition laws in place to guard  against abuse.    Britain has forced upon itself the structural changes to  labour markets and state-owned industries which our European  rivals -- even those with fundamentally stronger economies --  have yet to face.    If we cannot be frank about the traditional weaknesses -- in  productivity, growth, and in stop-go economic lurches -- then  public understanding political backing and coherent strategy for  revival will all suffer. Equally, ministers must accept that the  widening of markets may mean more familiar names going to  foreign owners. At the same time, we must continue to remove  blockages impeding British business expansion overseas. British  Gas, National Power, PowerGen, British Telecom, Mercury, BAA and  other privatised success stories have huge expansion  opportunities, not least into France and Germany, as  liberalisation and privatisation get under way and public  procurement opens up. In many of these areas, the pace is too  slow, strong domestic monopolies are well dug in, and markets  are being protected.    Britain seems to be recognising that a German owner of Rover  could mark that company's rebirth, and be a sign of Britain's  liberal, open and strong economic positioning. But we are  entitled to expect that similar attitudes should prevail  elsewhere, as British-owned businesses start providing energy,  power, telecoms, transport infrastructure and other former state  services across Europe.</p>

			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 36 OF IRAQ'S 55 EMBASSY STAFFERS EXPELLED BY U.S.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration on Monday expelled two-thirds of the Iraqi diplomatic  staff in Washington and encouraged 34 other nations with embassies in Kuwait to  take similar steps against Iraq.  </P> <P> In Kuwait and Iraq, meanwhile, Iraqi military authorities intensified efforts  to round up foreigners. State Department officials said that over the weekend,  seven more private American citizens were taken into Iraqi custody.  </P> <P> The U.S. Embassy in Kuwait city is now operating only with its own water and  food supplies, which State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said are  sufficient for U.S. diplomats to hold out "at least several days" against the  siege by Iraqi troops. The embassy has been operating with its own electricity  generator since troops cut off its supplies, water and power from outside.  </P> <P> President Bush told a news conference in Maine that the United States is  requiring Iraqi diplomats to leave the country by Thursday, and he contrasted  that order with Iraq's policy of preventing American diplomats from leaving.  </P> <P> "Nobody will be held against their will," Bush said of the Iraqi diplomats.  "They're all free to leave."  </P> <P> The State Department spokeswoman said the expulsions were in response to Iraq's  recent violations of international law, including its efforts to annex Kuwait  and, "in particular, the illegal order to close our embassy in Kuwait."  </P> <P> Until now, Iraq has been allowed to maintain 55 of its nationals -- including  both diplomats and non-diplomatic staff members -- at its embassy in  Washington. The order Monday requires Iraq to cut its embassy back to 19  people.  </P> <P> U.S. officials acknowledged they chose the figure of 19 because it matches the  total number of American diplomats still working in Iraq and Kuwait. About 55  other American diplomats who had been working out of the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait  left that nation with the intention of leaving the region but were barred by  Iraqi officials from leaving Baghdad.  </P> <P> U.S. officials hinted broadly that if more American diplomats are forced out of  the U.S. embassies in Kuwait and Iraq, more Iraqis will be expelled from  Washington.  </P> <P> The President told reporters that the United States is "trying to keep a  reasonable parallel in terms of numbers."  </P> <P> Mohammed Mashat, the Iraqi ambassador to Washington, told reporters that the  U.S. decision to expel most of his staff was "uncalled for, unfair and unjust.  We feel we have been victimized once more." Mashat said the U.S. action will  reduce the effectiveness of Iraqi diplomats in Washington.  </P> <P> The U.S. order requires seven diplomats and 29 non-diplomatic staff members at  Iraq's embassy to pack up and leave the United States within 72 hours -- or by  4:30 p.m. Thursday. Included in the order is the embassy's entire commercial  section, which is responsible for promoting Iraq's trade with the United  States.  </P> <P> "We don't feel there's much need for the Iraqis to be here trying to buy at  this particular time," Tutwiler told a State Department briefing.  </P> <P> In addition, the State Department imposed a series of new restrictions on the  remaining Iraqi personnel at the embassy.  </P> <P> They will be prohibited from traveling more than 25 miles from Washington, and  they and their families will be given only single-entry visas to the United  States instead of the customary multiple-entry visas that allow them to enter  and leave the country virtually at will.  </P> <P> Furthermore, Tutwiler said, use of Iraqi Embassy funds for Iraqi students and  for other humanitarian needs will be "closely controlled." She did not explain  what this last restriction will mean.  </P> <P> The new restrictions do not apply to Iraq's United Nations mission in New York,  which will be allowed to continue operating at full strength.  </P> <P> On Sunday night, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State David Mack called in  representatives of the 34 countries to tell them about the new U.S. move  against Iraqi diplomats. Those nations have refused to close their embassies in  Kuwait despite threats from Iraq.  </P> <P> "The United States is urging other governments, particularly those whose  embassies have been affected by Iraqi actions in Kuwait, to consider taking  similar actions against Iraq's official and non-official presence in their  countries," Tutwiler explained.  </P> <P> Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger summoned Mashat, the Iraqi  ambassador, to the State Department at 9 a.m. Monday to inform him of the  expulsion order. Mashat himself was not covered by the order and will be  permitted to remain here.  </P> <P> "I was surprised when I was informed of this action," Mashat said later. " . .  . We will try to be cooperative with the United States, because we have nothing  against the American people."  </P> <P> State Department officials said Monday that over the weekend, two private  Americans in Kuwait were taken from their apartments by Iraqi soldiers. "Once  again, the Iraqis knocked on the door, and when the two answered they were  taken to the Regency Hotel in Kuwait city," said Tutwiler.  </P> <P> Four other Americans also were picked up in Kuwait on Saturday and brought to  the same hotel, where they and the others were held by Iraqi authorities. State  Department officials said they did not know how the four had been captured.  </P> <P> In addition, one private American in Iraq was taken away from his place of  work. U.S. officials did not know where this American was taken.  </P> <P> In all, State Department officials say, Iraqi authorities have rounded up 42  Americans inside Iraq and another 21 in Kuwait. They are the only Americans  under direct Iraqi detention or control, out of the total of about 3,000  Americans who were barred from leaving Iraq and Kuwait.  </P> <P> "In Kuwait, food availability appears adequate, although stocks of some items,  especially fruits and vegetables, are not plentiful," Tutwiler said Monday. "In  Iraq, we know that internal food prices are going through the roof for certain  commodities like rice and sugar, and we know that there are bread lines in  Iraq."  </P> <P> </P> <P> DIPLOMATS AT EMBASSIES IN KUWAIT  </P> <P> Many countries have refused to bow to Iraq's demands to pull their embassies  out of Kuwait and move their diplomats to Baghdad. Here is the status of envoys  at the embassies of a number of key countries:  </P> <P> Country: United States  </P> <P> Status: Defied order to close; embassy surrounded. Ambassador W.

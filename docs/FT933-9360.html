			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Television transmitter seeks flotation NATIONAL Transcommunications, the privatised engineering and transmitter arm of the old Independent Broadcasting Authority, is likely to seek a stock market flotation next spring. The Hampshire-based company was bought in October 1991 by Mercury Asset Management, the fund management arm of SG Warburg, for Pounds 70m. The beginning of January is the first permissible date for a flotation, which would raise money partly for an acquisition. The flotation could mean a windfall for NTL management, headed by chief executive Mr John Forrest. About 60 per cent of the 740 staff have shares in the company. NTL's main business is transmitting Britain's commercial television channels and radio stations. It is expected to have a turnover of Pounds 90m next year and profits of around Pounds 15m. The company has increasingly moved away from its basic activity, involving 51 high-power transmission stations and 912 local relay stations. Already 40 per cent of revenue comes from business developed since privatisation and the company hopes this will rise to 50 per cent by next year. One of the fastest growing areas is digital compression technology, where the television signal is turned into digital form. The signal is then compressed by removing unnecessary information so that a number of channels can be carried in the space previously occupied by one. NTL's customers include FilmNet, the European satellite television operator which plans to run three films on a single satellite transponder. Digital compression greatly cuts the costs of running both satellite and cable television channels. NTL is understood to be looking for acquisitions in digital compression. NTL is also interested in getting into the consumer end of the market through the development of the decoders needed to receive the compressed signals. It is also exploring the possibility of entering, with partners, the deregulated UK telecommunications market. Decisions on the timing of the flotation, and on fund-raising requirements, are likely to be taken this autumn.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- A suprapartisan group of  about 90 legislators announced Thursday [26 May] they will  launch a signature drive to drum up parliamentary support for  the completion of political reform efforts.    "We are determined to implement the next elections for the  House of Representatives under a new system," said Yuji  Tsushima, a lower house member of the primary opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP), in reading the group's statement.    The move comes in response to unabated calls from the LDP  and  the second largest opposition Social Democratic Party [of Japan]  (SDP) [SDPJ] for a general poll under the current multiseat  electoral system after passage of the fiscal 1994 national  budget.    At a news conference, Tsushima, chief initiator of the  signature drive, lashed such calls, saying, "it is never  pardonable to try to see a general election held under the  multiseat system."    The legislators aim to collect signatures from the majority  of the 511 lower house members by June 10 as the first step to  cap years of political reform efforts, he said.    Their action follows a demand earlier Thursday from a  private  panel on reform that the next general election be held under the  new system combining single-seat constituencies with  proportional representation.    The committee for the promotion of political reform, formed  in 1992 by industry, labor and media leaders, has supported  lawmakers of all parties who seek to revamp the nation's  political system and eradicate corruption in public life.    In January the Diet legislated a package of electoral reform  bills replacing the current multiseat system in the lower house  with a combination of 300 single-seat voting districts and 200  in proportional representation.    An independent panel of experts is currently splitting up  the  nation's multiseat constituencies into single-seat electorates  and is likely to decide shortly on guidelines for the  demarcation.    However, the LDP has threatened to submit a no-confidence  motion against the cabinet of prime minister Tsutomu Hata after  the Diet approves the budget, and the SDPJ has shown interest in  jumping on the bandwagon.    The LDP holds 206 seats in the lower house and the SDPJ has  74 against 178 in Hata's coalition, the first minority goverment  in 39 years.    The SDPJ's Masao Sakon hinted he and other party lawmakers  who support the signature drive may have to leave the SDPJ if  its leadership moves to cooperate in bringing down the Hata  government in a no-confidence vote.    "If such a situation arises, we may have to make a certain  decision," he said.    Tsushima also explained their move stems from their  political  morality, noting that nearly all Diet members were elected after  vowing to achieve political reform</p>

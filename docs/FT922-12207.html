			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Costs fail to deter Channel 5 bids AT LEAST three serious contenders are expected to bid for the Channel 5 franchise. They are Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian television entrepreneur; Mr Justin Dukes, the former managing director of Channel 4, and Mr Moses Znaimer, founder of City TV in Toronto, who is part of the Five TV consortium. The three are expected to go ahead with their bids in spite of the high initial cost of getting on air the new television channel, which will be able to reach three quarters of the UK's population. The contenders who have identified themselves so far say they believe they can cope with the terms of the licence, which were spelled out by the Independent Television Commission last Tuesday. Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest says it is going ahead with drawing up comprehensive plans. Five TV, which has been working for more than a year on the project, says it is delighted at the terms of the licence and the way the commission modified the rules to give the project a better chance of success. The commission has dropped its original intention of setting an extra charge of 5 per cent of the operator's net advertising revenue to go to the government. It has instead set a zero rate. Mr Dukes is pressing ahead with plans to bid with his Channel S project, to be based in Edinburgh. He is being advised by Rothschilds, the merchant bank. Other possible contenders include Mr Phil Redmond's Mersey Television and a Northern Independent Producers consortium. There are unlikely to be many credible bidders because of the scale of the costs compared with the likely size of the market. Another factor is that under the 1990 Broadcasting Act the channel will have to take on many of the programme obligations of ITV. The chosen operator must offer news, current affairs, and children's and religious programming. Overall Channel 5 must offer a service that is diverse and appeals to a wide range of tastes. Mr Dukes plans initially to offer a service of largely bought-in programmes. That is all the channel will be able to afford, he believes, because of the high initial costs. The winner of the licence not only has to pay for the transmitter system but also for the retuning of about 3m video recorders which will suffer interference from the Channel 5 transmission. Few think it will be possible to get Channel 5 on air for less than Pounds 100m. Mr Berlusconi, in partnership with Mr Mike Bolland, managing director of Channel X, is planning a more expensive schedule with a strong emphasis on film and TV drama produced in the UK. It will be combined with what Mr Bolland calls 'a mix of hard news and personality-based current affairs'. Five TV is planning a city-based channel which will launch with a service for London and use the funds from that to move on to other big UK cities. The concept is heavily influenced by Mr Znaimer, whose City TV in Toronto concentrates on local news, films and popular music. None of the leading contenders has all, or even most of its investors signed up. Possible investors, who include Time Warner, the world's largest media company, Mr Conrad Black's Daily Telegraph and two ITV companies that lost their franchises, Thames Television and TV-am, have been talking to potential bidders. At the moment Five TV seems to have one advantage. It has already carried out extensive technical work on the retuning of videos, including transmission of test signals to see how extensive interference will be. Five TV has also carried out detailed research on the cost of the retuning and how long it will take. The commission, fearful of being blamed for interfering with television reception for millions of viewers, has made clear that unless a bidder has demonstrated that it can solve and pay for the video problem it will not get over the initial quality threshold. If no one can offer a solution, the franchise will not be awarded. Ms Sue Stoessl, an advertising consultant who recently became director-general of the Market Research Society, believes that no one planning to finance Channel 5 with advertising will be successful. Ms Stoessl, who has been advising Northern Independent Producers, believes that only a subscription service stands a chance of being viable.</p>

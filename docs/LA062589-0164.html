			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The key poison in the herbicide Agent Orange, used extensively in the Vietnam  War, may kill animals but appears relatively harmless to people, experts in  long-term studies said at the National Environmental Health Conference, which  was held in San Antonio. Researchers presented the latest findings on  large-scale studies of the effects of dioxin, the toxic ingredient of Agent  Orange. Except for skin cancer, no major differences from normal levels were  found in the cancer and heart disease rates of 1,261 U.S. soldiers exposed to  the poison, according to a $50-million Air Force study. Also, no unusual deaths  or illnesses were found in 40,000 people tracked in a University of Milan study  following a 1979 Italian dioxin plant explosion that contaminated a nearby  town.  </P></p>

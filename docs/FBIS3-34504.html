			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] His Majesty King Husayn, accompanied by His  Highness Crown Prince Hasan, today visited the Prime Ministry,  where he met with Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali.  Al-Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir, chief of the Royal Hashemite Court,  attended.    His majesty chaired part of the Cabinet session, during  which  his majesty emphasized his support for and constant confidence  in the prime minister and ministers.    His majesty was briefed by the prime minister on the most  important topics discussed during the Cabinet session,  especially the general tax on sales and agricultural conditions  in the Jordan Valley.    His majesty reviewed his visits to the United States,  Croatia, and Austria, saying these visits were very successful.  He said: In the United States, emphasis was placed on the fact  that peace must be comprehensive and just and that Jordan cannot  accept the idea of signing a peace treaty and then go back to  discuss its provisions. The matters agreed upon in the common  agenda must be discussed first and when they are all resolved,  then discussion of a peace treaty can start within the framework  of the principle of comprehensiveness.    In this regard, his majesty said that some of the provisions  of the agenda could be implemented before signing the peace  treaty. If agreement is reached on territory or borders, then  Jordan will regain its waters within this context. He also said  he found understanding and positive response from President  Clinton and the U.S. Administration on this point in particular.    Regarding his visit to Croatia, his majesty stressed that  the  Jordanian soldiers there are fulfilling their duties with a  great degree of service and without bias and are demonstrating  good manners and prudence. He said the Jordanian peacekeeping  force in the former Yugoslavia is the second largest  international force after France. He also said he was pleased  to meet with the soldiers there.    Regarding his visit to Austria, his majesty said he met with  Austria's current and former presidents, as well as the Austrian  chancellor. He said he found a readiness and understanding to  increase cooperation between Jordan and Austria.    As for his visit to Syria, his majesty said the visit was  primarily made to offer condolences to President Hafiz al-Asad  on the death of his son. He said they also discussed issues  within the context of coordination between the two countries.  His majesty briefed President al-Asad on the impression created  with the U.S. side on the meeting between Presidents al-Asad and  Clinton. His majesty said he found that the U.S. President  created a positive impression of his meeting with Syrian  President Hafiz al-Asad.    His majesty then moved to speak about domestic issues. He  stressed the need to pay attention to the individual, stressing  that attention must always be given to the individual,  especially regarding his material needs, water, food, and  medicine. He said we must always develop scientific and  technological resources within this context and follow the  correct standards and specifications that will enable us to  protect the individual and provide the best quality products for  his basic needs.    His majesty said: We must pay attention to the individual's  education, especially at this phase. There are many challenges  awaiting us in the coming phase which dictate that the  individual must always be ready to bear and confront the  challenges that may face him in the future.    His majesty touched on certain domestic issues that must be  addressed by the government, particularly the fight against  narcotics, administrative control and reform, and awarding  productive employees and punishing wrongdoers. He said we must  address our issues with some degree of precision, because  generalization may create a distorted image of Jordan,  especially since some people may try to take advantage of this  situation.    Some ministers then reviewed some of the activities  conducted  by their ministries.    At the end of the session, his majesty gave statements to  reporters. [passage omitted]</p>

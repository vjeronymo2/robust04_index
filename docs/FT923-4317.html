			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Germany aims to lead in aerospace - The Farnborough Air Show GERMANY sees the weakness of the world aerospace business as a chance to take the lead there again. Mr Jurgen Schrempp, chairman of Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), aerospace arm of Germany's Daimler-Benz group, said it aimed to be Europe's new regional jet leader, a senior partner in the Airbus programme, an equal one in European military aircraft collaboration, and take a key role in Europe's space industry. Dasa would be a junior partner in Europe's turbo-propeller aircraft market, now led by the Franco-Italian ATR partnership. 'The current problems of the industry are not good for our profits, but there is a strategic opportunity for us and for European collaboration as a whole,' he said. When other European aerospace companies are retrenching, Dasa is continuing its drive to restore the German aerospace industry to European leadership, a source of concern to UK aerospace officials. Mr Schrempp said Dasa expected to complete its agreement to take a 51 per cent stake in Fokker, the Dutch group, by the end of November. Partnership with Fokker would form a basis for a new European grouping in the regional aircraft field, eventually extending to Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy. Collaboration on regional jets was Europe's only chance of survival in this sector. British Aerospace is reviewing its own regional jet activities. Dasa has now taken control of Germany's 37.9 per cent Airbus stake. Airbus' next challenge was to develop the new 600-seat jumbo jet. He suggested Airbus partners should consider links with the Russian aerospace industry to study developing a super jumbo. Dasa Daimer-Benz now had links with Mitsubishi of Japan. The EFA programme would have to cut costs, but he believed it would fly, probably in a modified version.</p>

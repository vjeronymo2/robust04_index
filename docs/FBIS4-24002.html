			<p>BFN     [Text] Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] leader  Afonso Dhlakama registered as a voter at the Polana Secondary  School today. Asked whether emigrants would vote, Dhlakama said  that was a different matter and what was important at the moment  was for him to register as a voter. Dhlakama once again accused  voter registration teams of failing to carry out their work  properly, but pointed out that the situation was not alarming.  The Renamo leader goes to Maringue today where he will leave  for Beira, Chimoio, and Tete.</p>

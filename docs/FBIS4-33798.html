			<p>BFN     [Text] Despite the economic limitations that Cuba currently  faces, the number of retired and pensioned workers supported by  the social security system has increased in the five years of  the special period. In today's edition, GRANMA points out that  this information was provided by Orlando Penate, director of  Social security of the State Committee for Labor. Penate points  out that in 1993 Cuba invested more than 1.63 billion pesos in  social security. This figure represents 4.3 million pesos  invested in the social sector every 24 hours, which does not  include the cost of assistance in that sector, which in 1993 was  approximately 35.9 million pesos.    In Cuba, the social security system's equation of  equilibrium  is based on the business sector's productivity, and its  development is determined by the global economy, which means  that greater efficiency is required from the business sector.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by "responsible military source" at the </F> Defense Ministry in Sanaa on 12 May]    [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful:    The heroes of our Armed Forces, with support and success  from  God, continue to fulfill their valiant missions in the battles  of confrontation against the forces of rebellion and secession  on all axes and sectors, inflicting on the deceived forces,  which are [word indistinct] paid by the secessionist and  criminal elements in the Socialist Party leadership, heavy  losses on all axes and sectors.    On the al-Tali'-al-'Anad sector, the valiant Armed Forces --  supported by the honorable citizens in al-Dali' who stood on the  side of unity, democracy, and Constitutional legitimacy --  managed to cleanse the various pockets in al-Dali' district in  general. The center of the district, the city of al-Dali', was  returned to Constitutional legitimacy. The remaining soldiers,  NCO's, and officers from the 'Abbud Brigade surrendered to the  forces of unity and Constitutional legitimacy. Quantities of  weapons, ammunition, and military equipment, stored in the  military pockets in this [word indistinct], were seized.    Our Armed Forces on the southwestern axis,  al-'Anad-(?al-Hayla) sector, managed to engage with the forces  opposing Constitutional legitimacy in parts of the al-'Anad Camp  fortifications, inflicting heavy losses on various equipment and  weapons. Our forces on that axis, which were deployed in  (?Kharad), were able to rearrange their situation to prepare for  continuing their combat missions.    On the Abyan-Aden axis, our valiant Armed Forces were able  to  counter the hostile offensives and inflicted heavy losses on the  troops of the secessionist and rebellious forces, forcing them  to retreat in defeat. On that axis, our forces seized a number  of T-62 tanks. The air defense heroes also downed a combat  aircraft.    With a courageous confrontation and high vigilance, the  Armed  Forces foiled the futile encircling attempt by units from Taysir  Brigade and what remained of the al-Wahdah Brigade and the 30th  Brigade. Our valiant Armed Forces destroyed and seized 21 T-55  tanks, four BMP armored vehicle, three (?Shilfa) vehicles, three  14.5 (?systems), two BMP-21 vehicles, and 18 trucks. Our Air  Force also carried out successful air raids against the  formations of Taysir Brigade and inflicted heavy losses on it.    Our Air Force also carried out air raids against 'Ataq  airport, Shabwah Governorate. Our planes returned safely to  base.    In general, fatigue is overwhelming all units of the troops  loyal to the secessionist and criminal elements in the Socialist  Party. This is apparent in their suicidal, destructive acts  which cannot be justified by any sound military logic, except by  the fact that they may believe the fabricated lies that are  broadcast by the media of the secessionist, renegade gang that  is hostile to the people, the homeland, unity, and democracy.  There is a great difference between what is happening in the  field on all axes and what is announced by those who are hiding  behind the citizens and the economic, services, and strategic  installations in Aden. Lies do not live long.    Here, we reaffirm our call to all brother officers, NCO's,  and soldiers in the units that are still under the control of  the secessionist, rebellious forces. They still can return to  the trench of right and reject the dictatorial orders they are  given to fight their suicidal, futile battle. Positions of  honor and dignity in the Armed Forces, the forces of unity and  Constitutional legitimacy, await them so that they can join  their brothers in the Armed Forces and all children of our  Yemeni people against the enemies of life, the enemies of unity,  democracy, and the enemies of the march of unity and progress.    In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. And  soon the unjust assailants will know what vicissitudes their  affair will take.</p>

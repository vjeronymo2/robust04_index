			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Gamsakhurdia 'mentally ill', says acting PM MR TENGIZ SIGUA, Georgia's acting prime minister, said yesterday that medical certificates had been located diagnosing Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia, the former president, who fled the country on Monday, as mentally ill. He also claimed that Mr Gamsakhurdia had seized Rbs200m (Pounds 1m) of state funds before his flight and embezzled more than Rbs1bn during his presidency. The president and 80 supporters were yesterday in a mountain retreat in Getokhobit in Armenia. The compound was surrounded by Armenian elite Omon troops, and Mr Gamsakhurdia's presidential Mercedes was said to be clearly visible inside. Mr Gamsakhurdia appeared on Armenian television in defiant mood, declaring he was still president of Georgia. A Georgian delegation sent to hold tripartite negotiations with Mr Gamsakhurdia and an Armenian delegation had been refused access, Mr Sigua said. He said Georgia was prepared to allow Mr Gamsakhurdia to be granted political asylum by Armenia provided he was barred from leaving the country. He also said that Mr Gamsakhurdia's diagnosis as mentally ill might preclude his being brought back to Georgia to face criminal charges. The acting prime minister, who was in Mr Gamsakhurdia's government until resigning in August last year, said he believed three diagnoses of Mr Gamsakhurdia as mentally ill had been made in 1956, 1959 and 1978. While he admitted that Mr Gamsakhurdia had been a dissident, and that dissidents in the Soviet era had frequently been declared mentally ill, he said that five of the six doctors involved were still alive and prepared to certify the diagnoses were genuine. The city of Tbilisi was returning to normality yesterday and the rest of Georgia was reported to be quiet apart from disturbances in the Zugdidi region of western Georgia, Mr Gamsakhurdia's homeland. A crowd of around 1,000 supporters of the president again met outside Tbilisi's central station, chanting slogans and carrying banners. Mr Jaba Iosseliani, one of the leaders of the military council which is in control of the republic, said the demonstration had been peaceful and there had been no need to break it up. In the city centre, damaged buildings around Rustaveli Avenue were being made safe. A government commission has estimated that 10,000 sq m of the city had been destroyed in the fighting, and reconstruction costs are likely to be up to Rbs1bn. More than 700 people have been left homeless.</p>

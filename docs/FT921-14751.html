			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Steel strike threatens in Germany as pay talks break down THE first strike in the German steel industry for more than 10 years loomed closer yesterday after pay talks broke off. An increased management offer, and a conciliatory proposal from union negotiators failed to break the impasse in the eighth bout of negotiations. As the wages commission of IG Metall, the country's biggest union, gathered later to plan strike action, the leader of the DGB trade union federation declared that the Bonn coalition and employers were 'back on the old confrontation course' with the unions. The roots of the current strife lie in union claims that wage earners have been obliged to pay more than their fair share of the costs of unification. Although they were assured by Chancellor Helmut Kohl that there would be no tax increases following unification in October 1990, they have since been burdened with a two-year 7.5 per cent income tax surcharge to pay for community works in the east. Cigarettes, heating fuel and petrol have also been laden with extra duties to raise funds for the five new states. Unions also claim that, while company profits have boomed thanks to increased sales to the former DDR, their real earning power has been eroded. The gap between employers and steel unions has, however, closed markedly, with management offering a phased deal worth 5.2 per cent, and the unions dropping their 10.5 per cent demand to a package worth 'just over 6 per cent'. Both sides seem increasingly anxious to avoid a strike. Steel companies are concerned that confrontation now with the country's 135,000 steelworkers might lead to greater conflicts later with the 4m engineering industry workers who have yet to put in their 1992 pay claim. Steel industry employees are also under psychological pressure from the likelihood of job losses later this year as rationalisation in the industry progresses. Thyssen, the biggest steelmaker in the country, is reviewing its production, while Krupp and Hoesch, two leading manufacturers are in the process of merging. Even so, the structure of the three-stage IG Metall proposal, ending with a 6.7 per cent increase for the last four months of the one-year deal, was unacceptable to employers. IG Metall's wages commission was expected to declare the negotiations with management formally at an end and call a strike ballot. The first union claims for increases of about 10 per cent ran into early opposition when they were put in late last year. Resistance has hardened since Christmas as economists have steadily downgraded their forecasts for west German economic growth this year. The government, which will shortly publish a situation report showing that growth in the west could be as low as 1 per cent, has lately piled on the pressure for restraint.

According to judicial sources, the incident occurred last  night on the Pan-American Highway, in Santa Cruz Michapa  jurisdiction, 20 km from San Salvador, in Cuscatlan Department.  The reports said that the vehicle Perdomo was driving was  machine-gunned, and that his wife, Rosa de Perdomo, and their  daughter were seriously wounded. The three of them were  returning to the capital from eastern El Salvador.    Authorities said today they have no clues to determine if  the  attack was politically motivated or if it was carried out by  common criminals who hold up vehicles on certain points of the  highway at night, shooting at the drivers when they refuse to  stop. Ambassador Bermudez said today she has no further details  on the incident, adding that Perdomo's body will be returned to  Panama tomorrow.    Perdomo had been working for the IICA -- which is an OAS  regional organization -- in El Salvador for approximately two  and a half years.    Perdomo's wife, who is recovering at a private hospital in  San Salvador, is the key witness to help authorities clear up  this incident, in which a Panamanian citizen was killed in El  Salvador.</p>

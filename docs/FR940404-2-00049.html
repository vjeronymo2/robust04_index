Not later than October 24, 1995, DOE must determine whether the voluntary programs thus created by members of those industries are consistent with the objectives set forth in the legislation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to determine what specific criteria will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the voluntary programs, the Department will hold two public meetings and invite interested parties for each program to offer suggestions concerning methods of evaluation. All persons are hereby given notice of the opportunity to submit written comments and to attend the public meetings.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Written comments in quadruplicate must be received by May 12, 1994.

Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT; Pub. L. 102&hyph;486) identified several new categories of products and equipment for inclusion in a range of required and voluntary testing and information programs to promote energy efficiency. Under sections 125 and 126 of EPACT, the Secretary of Energy, after consulting with industry associations and other interested organizations, is to provide technical and financial assistance to support voluntary national testing and information programs for those types of commercial office equipment and luminaires that are widely used, and for which there is a potential for significant energy savings as a result of such programs. These test procedures will provide information that when conveyed to consumers, will enable purchasers of such equipment to assess the energy consumption and potential cost savings of alternative products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

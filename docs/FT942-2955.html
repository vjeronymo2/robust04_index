			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Green light for Sweden-Denmark link: Stockholm environment minister resigns over Dollars 3bn bridge and tunnel project Sweden's centre-right government yesterday gave a final go-ahead for the construction of a Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) bridge and tunnel link across the Oresund between Sweden and Denmark, one of the biggest infrastructure projects in Europe. But the long-delayed decision prompted the resignation of Mr Olof Johansson, the environment minister and leader of the Centre party, shaking the hitherto stable foundations of Prime Minister Carl Bildt's four-party coalition three months before a general election. A row over the environmental impact of the 17km road and rail link between the southern Swedish city of Malmo and Copenhagen had held up the project for months, threatening to split Mr Bildt's government and straining relations with Denmark, which is anxious to proceed. Mr Bildt was confident yesterday he had avoided the break-up of the government, as Mr Johansson agreed his three party colleagues in the coalition would stay on as ministers despite their objections to the Oresund link. But their decision is likely to be questioned at a Centre party national conference this weekend. Mr Johansson's resignation was also the first split in the cabinet since the government took power in late 1991, and is an unwelcome blow for Mr Bildt, as the coalition is trailing far behind the opposition Social Democratic party in the polls ahead of the election in mid-September. But the green light for the link, which will be Sweden's first fixed link to its main markets in Europe, was warmly welcomed in Copenhagen and by business leaders in both countries. Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the Danish prime minister, said: 'I am pleased by this decision, which means Denmark can now go ahead with the land-side construction work which was suspended while the Swedes arrived at a decision.' The joint Swedish-Danish consortium set up to build the link said the tender process would begin within weeks, with the selection of prequalified companies. A total of 20 international consortia, involving some 50 companies from around the world, have expressed interest in the project. Full tender details will not be available until late autumn, as environmental specifications are not yet ready. First contracts for the tunnel section are expected to be signed early next year. The project, originally agreed between Stockholm and Copenhagen in 1991, is already about a year behind schedule because of the Swedish delays. Estimated at 1990 prices to cost DKr20bn (Pounds 2bn), including all the mainland construction on both sides, the link is now unlikely to open before the year 2000. Together with the Storebaelt link between the Danish islands of Zeeland and Funen already under construction, the Oresund bridge and tunnel will give the Copenhagen and Malmo regions swift access to the rest of continental Europe. Their total population of 2.3m makes them Europe's eighth largest in terms of purchasing power. But the Oresund project has faced strong opposition from environmentalists from the start. Their main concern has been that the bridge section will impede vital salt water flows into the already heavily-polluted Baltic Sea. Mr Bildt said yesterday the environmental conditions being set for the constructors would ensure a 'zero solution' under which salt water flows would not be reduced. 'This is the greenest bridge you can build,' he said.</p>

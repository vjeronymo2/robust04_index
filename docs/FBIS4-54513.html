			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Stipe Mesic, chairman of the Croatian </F> Independent Democrats, by unidentified studio announcer -- live]    [Excerpts] [Announcer] Our guest this evening is Stipe  Mesic, the newly elected chairman of the Croatian Independent  Democrats [HND]. [passage omitted]    You addressed particularly sharp criticism at Croatian  policy  in Bosnia-Herzegovina. You say that the policy was implemented  by the wrong people and even by war criminals. Who have you  been supporting in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which people, and which  policy?    [Mesic] In Bosnia-Herzegovina we support the survival of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The people of Bosnia-Herzegovina are to  choose who will represent them -- Croats and Muslims, and even  Serbs who want Bosnia-Herzegovina.    We follow this logic: The disintegration of  Bosnia-Herzegovina would make possible the creation of a Greater  Serbia. The Greater Serbia, strengthened by the so-called  Srpska republic in Bosnia-Herzegovina, would never approve of  the separation from Krajina and the areas they are currently  holding in order for these areas to join Croatia. That would be  practically impossible to do, and Croatia would be maimed.    The danger for Croatia would be enormous if a Greater Serbia  were created. This is why we want the world to adhere to the  principles it advocates, which means that borders must not be  changed and that Serbia must return to its borders. [passage  omitted]    [Announcer] You said that you will be oriented toward the  future. In concrete terms, at the moment, how do you see the  denouement of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Mesic] Currently the greatest danger is coming from those  who want to prevent the implementation of the Washington  Agreement. They are very loud and they do not stop short from  public appearances. One cannot help wondering what they are  doing behind the scenes. They want to prevent the main thing --  the implementation of the Washington Agreement -- by erecting  certain barriers, by insisting on some details.    [Announcer] Do you see the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina in a  federation of Croats and Muslims?    [Mesic] Of course. If we start procrastinating now -- on  whether a Croat will be the prime minister or the president of  the republic; whether this or the other one will hold the  position in the first year -- that is completely irrelevant if  we want Bosnia-Herzegovina to survive. If it does not happen  this year, it will happen next year. One year is a short time.  If there is goodwill and a political decision, there will be no  problem. However, those who favored a division of  Bosnia-Herzegovina cannot implement the Washington Agreement,  and this should be stressed. We are in favor of its  implementation, which means that we must force them to implement  it through our influence.    [Announcer] And, finally, what do you expect from the next  session of the assembly? Will the HDZ [Croatian Democratic  Union] have a majority?    [Mesic] [passage omitted] The balance of power in the  assembly has now changed. The relations have changed.  Specifically, the HSP [Croatian Party of Right] is not what it  used to be and neither are IDS [Istrian Democratic Assembly] and  the HDZ. There is a new balance of power. We should sit down  and make a gentleman's agreement. We must not consider each  other enemies because we belong to different parties. [passage  omitted]</p>

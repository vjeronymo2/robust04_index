			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Accounts plan 'will reform Whitehall' Changes to public-sector accounting practices in last month's Budget may be one of the government's most important Whitehall management reforms, the Social Market Foundation says today. The foundation, an independent think-tank, says that insufficient attention has been given to a Budget comment by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, calling for a move to 'resource accounting'. At present most public-sector organisations formally account for the flow of cash for their regular operations. But there is little accounting of the use of capital to meet the costs of maintaining resources such as land, buildings and large equipment, or of the extent to which these items might have depreciated. Mr Evan Davis, the report's author, says the introduction of such accounting in the public sector would rank alongside market testing, the introduction of executive agencies and the private finance initiative in its impact on the restructuring of Whitehall. He says that the move would make it easier to reveal the full costs of delivering services. The cost of a capital item would not, for example, be carried on the day it was bought, but would be spread through accounts as though the item were leased. Another consequence would be to encourage the private sector to compete for the provision of public services. Mr Davis says that the private sector cannot easily compete in the provision of capital goods to the state because Whitehall disburses grants for capital in a broadly discretionary way. But he says that the introduction of resource accounting would 'sort out the problem of capital so that it does not have to be given out free of charge in big occasional blocks to lucky recipients'.

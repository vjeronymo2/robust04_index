			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORE ON CONVENT AT DEATH CAMP  </P> <P> Being a survivor of Auschwitz-Birkenau, people often refer to me as the "lucky  one." But, just how lucky was I?  </P> <P> In December of 1944, the Nazis forced me to leave Auschwitz on a death march to  escape the Soviet army which was rapidly approaching. But I left behind the  ashes of my beloved mother and 14-year-old sister, who were murdered there with  3 million other Jews. Their remains are scattered on the grounds of Auschwitz,  the largest Jewish burial ground in all the world.  </P> <P> Two years ago I finally mustered the courage to return to this holy cemetery. I  was stunned to see a Catholic convent on these sacred grounds, so saturated  with Jewish blood.  </P> <P> I realized that the presence of the nuns here was the beginning of the final  revision of the most infamous Nazi concentration camp, its gas chambers, and  crematories.  </P> <P> We, the survivors of the Holocaust, will protest!  </P> <P> RENEE FIRESTONE, Beverly Hills  </P></p>

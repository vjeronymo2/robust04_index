			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] Today's newspapers highlight the need to maintain  the Arab boycott of Israel until its causes are removed. They  also discuss U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's  current tour of the region.    In one of its commentaries, AL-THAWRAH discusses the  importance of the Arab boycott of Israel and the attempts to end  the boycott.    The paper says: What amazing logic that calls for canceling  the Arab boycott of Israel before reversing the Israeli  occupation of the Arab territories and its consequences!    The paper notes that the Arab boycott was a natural result  and a position adopted by the Arabs in self-defense in the face  of Israel's aggressive policy and its expansionist ambitions  toward the Arab nation.    AL-THAWRAH adds: Israel has not changed its function and  role in the service of expansionist ambitions, based on  plundering the wealth of the Arab nation and undermining its  political and economic status. Canceling the boycott,  therefore, while Israel continues to adopt an aggressive policy,  has two aims: Stripping the Arabs of their right to use the  boycott as a legitimate weapon in the face of Israel's ambitions  and aggressive policy; and sabotaging the peace process and  efforts for peace.    Concluding, the paper says: Israel's policy, in all its  manifestations, is the only reason that the Arabs, primarily  Syria, adhere to the Arab boycott as a regimen to immunize Arab  existence against the danger of Israel's inclination for  expansion and aggression. Developments on the ground have  proven that Israel will never abandon this inclination, even  under the peace process and efforts to make it succeed.    On the same issue, AL-BA'TH says: In order to prevent the  peace process from becoming divorced from its objectives, there  is now a pressing need to rectify the course of this process  since the Rabin government has tried to derail the process and  distort the basic substance through a series of attempts to  circumvent the issues. These attempt began in Madrid and are  still continuing today.    AL-BA'TH says it is the role of the U.S. secretary, who is  visiting the region to intensify his efforts, on behalf of his  administration that sponsors the peace process, to advance this  process.    AL-BA'TH stresses Syria's full right to give its frank  opinion, as usual, and to give a final say on the course of the  peace process, particularly regarding a full Israeli withdrawal  from the Golan and the rest of the occupied Arab territories.    Concluding its commentary, AL-BA'TH stresses that Syria's  demands have never departed from the foundations of the peace  process, which was launched on the basis of international  legitimacy and relevant UN resolutions.    In another commentary, AL-THAWRAH speaks about U.S.  Secretary  of State Warren Christopher's tour of the region, asking the  world and the U.S. Administration to identify the party that is  obstructing the peace process and pushing it toward a dead end,  and to take action to deter that party.    AL-THAWRAH stresses that the political process lacks  vitality  and vigor because of the continued Israeli policy of maneuvering  and that sincere efforts need to be made now to press for the  implementation of UN resolutions and the exchange of land for  peace. The paper asks Washington to quickly fulfill its  obligations and pledges so as not to undermine its credibility.    AL-THAWRAH concludes by stressing the constant principles in  Syria's policy and its sincere attitude toward peace and  adherence to its just demands to preserve our national and  pan-Arab rights and ensure their return in full.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], the PFL  [Liberal Front Party], and the PTB [Brazilian Labor Party] have  reached an agreement in Brasilia, formalizing an alliance to  support the presidential candidacy of Senator Fernando Henrique  Cardoso. The parties have yet to designate Cardoso's running  mate, on the grounds that the alliance does not focus on  specific names but on a program of government.    The presidents of the three parties reiterated that the  alliance focuses on a program of government, not on names,  adding that the starting point is the program of the PSDB. The  PFL, however, made suggestions that will be included in the  government proposal.    PSDB President Tasso Jereissati said the three parties have  formed an alliance to provide conditions for governing the  country.    Senator Cardoso said the alliance does not just seek to win  elections but to implement a joint government, adding that he  expects other parties to join the alliance. He said:    [Begin Cardoso recording] I have talked a lot with [Social  Workers Party President] Alvaro Dias and we might reach  agreement, if not at a national level at least in several states  -- like in Brasilia, where talks are on an advanced stage. I  believe we will be able to do the same thing in other regions  too. Alvaro Dias will run for the post of governor in Parana.  I told him that my party has joined other parties that have  their own candidates, thus I can continue to communicate and  personally support him. [end recording]    After formalizing the alliance, the presidents of the PTB,  PSDB, and PFL met at Senator Jose Eduardo Vieira's office to  discuss the campaign strategy.</p>

			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / British Gas board meets on price ultimatum THE BOARD of British Gas met late yesterday for last-minute consultations over the new tariff price formula suggested by the company's regulator, the Office of Gas Supply (Ofgas). It looks increasingly likely that the company will accept the proposals, which will impose tough controls on the prices British Gas can charge its 17m domestic gas users for the next five years. If British Gas rejects the formula, it will have to submit its arguments to a full investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. That would involve the disclosure of additional information showing exactly where it makes its profits. The new formula will set a limit on the inflation-related price rises British Gas can impose on domestic users. That will be done by increasing the efficiency factor, which has to be taken off the rate of inflation to achieve the rate at which gas prices can rise. By raising the efficiency factor to 3 to 5 percentage points from its present level of 2 percentage points, Ofgas will force the company to trim its costs, possibly by cutting jobs. The regulator is also expected to insist that British Gas does not pass through the full rise in its North Sea gas costs to users in an attempt to make the company develop its own gas fields more efficiently. Mr James McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas, may also announce today a new set of service requirements for British Gas to uphold since consumer groups have urged that efficiency cuts should not affect service standards. The regulator is putting additional pressure on the company over negotiations it is holding with two power station ventures on the price of gas after the company's 35 per cent price rise for new power station gas purchases in March. Mr McKinnon would like to see Thames Power and a Mobil/Eastern Electricity power station venture agree to take gas under the new price schedule, but to seek and win damages through the civil courts that would reduce the price of their gas to the pre-increase level. Other electricity companies are watching the talks closely and are threatening a round of writs if the two new power stations are given what they see as preferential treat-ment.</p>

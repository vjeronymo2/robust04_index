			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Patrick Wintour article: "Blair Blames `Uncaring' Society </F> on Tories"]    [Text] Tony Blair, the Labour leadership favourite,  yesterday attacked the Conservatives for ripping apart the  social fabric of society and claimed Labour's task was to  rebuild Britain as a strong civic society, "sustaining stable  community and family life."    In his first speech since John Smith's death, Mr. Blair took  an uncompromising and unashamedly moral tone to argue that  strong employment and education policies were central to  national renewal, and condemned modern Tory liberalism for  producing "an atomised, uncaring rootless society" that was  bound to breed crime and alienation.    "Over the past few years, there has developed a keen belief  that we have lost our sense of purpose and direction as a  country," he said. "One reason surely is that we have lost our  identity as a country. The growth of social division,  inequality and the disintegration of the family And the  community have torn us apart."    Mr Blair said the task of the left was not to replace the  Tories' crude individualism with old notions of an overbearing  paternalistic state. "The task is rather one of national  renewal, rebuilding a strong civic society and basing it on a  modern notion of citizenship where rights and duties go hand in  hand, where the purpose of social action is to develop  individual potential, not subjugate it. We have to counter the  belief ... that action by society to improve social conditions  and notions of personal responsibility are incompatible."    He argued that his vision did not represent a change in the  left's traditional philosophy, but instead a rediscovery,  pointing out that in the l9th and early 20th centuries, families  were brutalised by the industrial revolution as they are today  by crime, drugs, unemployment and social breakdown.    "The history of workers' cooperatives, the friendly  societies  and the unions from which the Labour Party sprang is one of  individuals coming together for self-improvement and to improve  people's potential through collective action. We need to  recreate for the 21st century the civil society to which these  movements gave birth m the 20th century."    The speech will inevitably be contrasted with that made at  the weekend by the shadow chancellor, Gordon Brown. But the two  were made in very different contexts, with Mr Brown delivering a  wide- ranging platform speech and Mr Blair offering a  philosophical approach in a seminar organised by the Institute  of Economic Affairs and the Family Civic Trust.    He argued: "It requires not a PhD in philosophy, merely a  degree of common sense, to understand that if children grow up  in a culture of low opportunity, poor education and unstable  family life, then notions of good conduct and mutual respect are  likely to disappear."    Mr Blair's supporters suggested the speech showed that he  would not change his beliefs or style to win the election and  that his concerns had a wide appeal in the public.    Nevertheless, after the European elections, Mr Blair is  going  to have to move out of the social field and prove his mettle on  the economic issues.</p>

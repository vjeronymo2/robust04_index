			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Small companies to shun Cadbury The majority of smaller quoted companies do not intend to comply fully with the Cadbury code of corporate governance, says a survey by accountants Coopers and Lybrand released yesterday. Of a sample of 84 medium-sized and small listed companies outside the top 350 FT-SE companies, 55 per cent said they did not intend to follow every aspect of the code. Eighteen per cent said they were making no changes. Intention to comply declined with company size. Nearly two-thirds of those with turnover below Pounds 50m a year said they would not comply fully, falling to 42 per cent for those above Pounds 50m and 17 per cent for the top 200 FT-SE companies, according to an earlier survey. Companies expressed concern about the burdens and costs of implementing the Cadbury code and said its introduction was too swift. The elements of the code which they planned not to comply with were tied to those with which they disagreed in principle. One-third opposed the recommendation for boards to have at least three non-executive directors and 58 per cent disagreed with the idea; 30 per cent did not intend to comply with the requirement for an audit committee; 12 per cent did not plan to make a clear division of responsibilities at the top of the company; and 11 per cent had no plans to create a remuneration committee. Sir Brian Jenkins, a senior partner with Coopers, said: 'As things stand, smaller companies will face the stigma of stating non-compliance with the code which in many ways has been developed with the larger company in mind.'</p>

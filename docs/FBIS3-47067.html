Hata, who is also deputy prime minister, is scheduled to  have  separate talks later in the day with Chinese Foreign Minister  Qian Qichen and Premier Li Peng. Hata will meet President and  Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin on Sunday before  returning to Tokyo later the same day.    Talks between Hata and Qian, who met twice last year -- in  New York in late September and in Seattle in November -- will  cover bilateral and international affairs, according to Foreign  Ministry officials.    The two foreign ministers will discuss the situation on the  Korean peninsula as well as problems concerning North Korea's  suspected development of nuclear weapons, the officials said.    Japan is likely to call on China to urge Pyongyang to accept  international inspections of its nuclear facilities, since  Beijing has the "largest official channel" with Pyongyang, they  said.</p>

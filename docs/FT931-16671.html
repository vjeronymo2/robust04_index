			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Sharp bond rally fails to boost share prices Wall Street US STOCK prices ended mixed across the board yesterday, in spite of more good economic news and a sharp rally in bond prices, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 8.11 at 3,309.22. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 0.33 off at 435.38, while the American SE composite lost 1.88 at 397.35 and the Nasdaq composite was 5.15 lower at 671.80. Trading volume on the New York SE came to 201m shares, and declines outnumbered rises by 1,043 to 878. Prices opened solidly firmer, with the Dow advancing almost 15 points in the first half-hour of trading, as investors went in search of bargains after the New Year's Eve sell-off. The buying, however, quickly petered out, and for the rest of the day blue chips moved in a narrow, but positive, trading range while many secondary stocks weakened. More good economic news, in the shape of a much larger than expected 2.1 per cent rise in November construction spending (its highest level for more than two years), failed to boost sentiment. Investors also ignored a strong bond market, where the benchmark 30-year government issue climbed almost a full point. Market watchers said investors were probably holding their fire until Friday's important jobs data, which is expected to give the best reading yet on the state of the economic recovery. Among individual stocks, leading industrial issues were mixed. IBM, which took a dreadful beating in 1992, started the new year on a negative note, dropping back from an early gain to end Dollars  1/4 down at Dollars 50 1/8 after volume of 3.5m shares. Merck rose Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 43 7/8 , Eastman Kodak put on Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 41 1/8 and Du Pont added Dollars 1 at Dollars 48 1/8 . Motor shares were buoyant, aided by hopes that rising consumer spending will boost car sales this year. General Motors appreciated Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 32 3/4 , Ford Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 44 and Chrysler Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 32 5/8 . Helene Curtis moved ahead Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 43 1/8 after the Chicago-based cosmetics company announced a fiscal third-quarter profit of 44 cents a share, up from 36 cents a year earlier. Hubco strengthened Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 18 1/2 on the American Stock Exchange amid reports that analysts' estimates of Dollars 1.70 a share for 1993 earnings could be far too conservative. On the Nasdaq market, selected leading technology stocks eased. Microsoft dipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 85 1/8 , Apple Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 58 1/4 and Intel Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 86 1/2 . Canada TORONTO stocks finished mixed as a dropping gold bullion price hammered precious metals shares. The TSE 300 index edged up 0.6 to 3,351.0 but declines outpaced advances by 294 to 276. Volume was a fairly heavy 30.9m shares. COMEX gold closed weakly but above a seven-year low hit earlier in the day. The February contract was finally down USDollars Dollars 4.70 at USDollars 328.40 an ounce.</p>

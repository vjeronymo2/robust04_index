			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Survey of Korea (2): A hard climb up the ladder / A look at progress towards industrialising the economy Once known as the Miracle on the Han, the Korean economy has reached a crossroads. It can adapt and join the ranks of the industrialised nations; or, crippled by dwindling productivity and com- petitiveness, the heavy hand of government intervention and restrictive regulations, it can follow the downward track of Japan, its neighbour. Mr Il Sakong, a former minister of finance and now chairman of the Institute for Global Economics in Seoul, says: 'Korea has reached an awkward stage of development. It is a Newly Industrialised Economy but not quite yet an industrialised economy. It is about to enter this new stage of industrialisation to join the ranks of the industrially advanced nations. The question is how it will move up this ladder.' For Korea to become a mem- ber of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, as it plans to do in 1996, it must adhere to its programme of deregulation, especially in financial markets; improve labour com- petitiveness and efficiency; maintain downward pressure on both wage and price inflation; open domestic markets to outside competition and introduce housing and land reforms. There are also public sector issues to be tackled. To do so will not only win Korea credits in the eyes of the OECD; it will also secure the next phase of economic growth. It is a tough task, but one which the government at any rate believes it is up to. South Korea's first civilian president in 30 years, Mr Kim Young- sam, is regarded as reformative and forward-looking, although whether he can overcome the vested interests and lower ranks of ministry officialdom is a question over which many analysts harbour doubts. Last April, Mr Kim's administration unveiled a five-year economic plan to restructure the fiscal system, slapping taxes on speculative property gains and scaling back taxes charged to foreign investors, and to liberalise financial markets, turning the present government- orchestrated system into a market-based version more akin to those in the rest of the developed world. The five-year programme for financial liberalisation, introduced last year, aims to overcome the inefficiencies bred by the non-price allocation of credit, both in the economy as a whole and in the financial sector itself. Under the plan, lending rates and then deposit rates will be freed at the same time as the government loosens its grip on international capital movements. However, the guiding principle is for gradualism - a policy which, while avoiding all the mayhem of a 'big bang' approach to deregulation, may not best serve Korea at a time when so many of its neighbours are attracting foreign cash and technology. Industrial development may also come too slowly to keep up with the rest of the world. Korean industry has lost its competitive edge at a time when world demand is on the upswing. Economists reckon there are too many vested interests and interlinked issues to allow for speedy progress. Mr Lee Hahn-koo, president of Daewoo Research Institute, says: 'We need foreign investment, and the govern- ment wants to reduce the obstacles to investment. But it cannot be so speedy because the public mentality does not change so speedily. I believe we are now starting to get out of that vicious circle, but not so fast.' The government is eager to avoid any currency apprec- iation, which would hurt trading competitiveness. Mr Shin Myoung-ho, assistant minister of finance says: 'There is a trend towards liberalisation, and so foreign governments and companies want us to speed our pace. But we have also to take into consideration some disturbances to the macroeconomic variables. 'There is still a substantial gap between domestic interest rates and international rates, so if we open up capital movement at this stage, we could suddenly have a huge inflow resulting in a sharp appreciation of our currency, or excessive liquidity causing inflationary trends.' For now, inflation is pitched to end the full year at under 6 per cent, despite a bad harvest which sent food prices soaring - although many Korean economists expect it to rise sharply next year. This is twinned with an upturn in the economy, which this year is forecast to grow at 7.6 per cent. Interest rates, now close to the record lows of 1982, are also expected to remain soft until 1996. Less positively, the current account is on track to move back into the red this year (after posting a modest Dollars 500m surplus in 1993, which ended a three-year run of deficits) as imports, largely capital goods, surge. However, Baring Securities is looking for improvements in the second half of the year which will contain the 1994 deficit at a manageable Dollars 1.9bn, or 0.5 per cent of GNP. Mr Lee, who is not confident of Korea's ability to continue riding this wave after two years' stagnant growth, points to several factors which could further undermine Korea's climb up the industrialisation ladder. He says that if the yen starts to depreciate against the dollar, so enhancing the price of Japanese exports, and demand from China retreats as its growth slows and its own industry becomes an ample source of oil and steel, Korea could find its trade flows are penalised. He also questions whether Korea can adapt to compete in the national arena. Wage rises are out of line with improvements in productivity. Korea boasts the most expensive workforce in Asia after Japan, and Mr Lee estimates wages this year will rise around 12-13 per cent, in line with union expectations. However, Mr Il believes that a restructuring of industry into more sophisticated value-added areas will enable Korea to regain its competitive edge, and says companies have started out on this path by upping their investment in R&amp;D in acknowledgement of the changing nature of competition, which now comes from the developed world. 'Companies themselves are in a transitional period. In financial structure terms, Korean companies have a high debt to equity ratio compared with the advanced countries, while R&amp;D capabilities are not as high. 'But they realise they can no longer remain competitive the way they are now, so they are taking steps towards intensified R&amp;D and restructuring - but it is just beginning. If they are successful, of course the Korean economic restructuring will succeed, but it all depends on the companies' performance. And, based on our track record, I think we will do it. The question is how long it will take,' he says.</p>

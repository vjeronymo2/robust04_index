Only time will tell  whether this event will turn out to be a Christmas gift to the  country, but for now this is what Yuriy Baturin told IZVESTIYA's  correspondent about the circumstances surrounding his  appointment to the new position.    President Yeltsin telephoned Baturin in his Kremlin office 5  January and said, according to Baturin, literally the following:  "I have come to the conclusion that it would be right for the  president to have an assistant for national security. I would  like you to be this assistant."    Doctor of Juridical Sciences Yuriy Baturin was offered his  former position in the president's administration in April 1993  and had almost two months to think it over and accept, with his  formal appointment coming on 2 June 1993. But the tone in which  the president's new request was couched ruled out any delays and  Baturin agreed immediately. Being no doubt in possession of  much more extensive information than he can reveal today,  Baturin realized at that moment the precise nature of the danger  threatening the president, the state, and Russia, the diverse  interconnections, and the reason why a certain role in  preventing this danger was being assigned by Boris Yeltsin  precisely to him.    When describing Yuriy Baturin it is evidently necessary to  dwell primarily not on his businesslike qualities, no matter how  high they might be, but on his personal qualities. Being in  many regards an "outsider" in the president's administration and  a highly obstinate person who only superficially accepts the  apparatus rules in operation there, Yuriy Baturin has  nonetheless succeeded in integrating within the presidential  apparatus, primarily due to the fact that he lacks personal  political ambitions (his ambitions lie in some different  sphere). He has the rare ability to abandon his personal  motivation outside the offices he has occupied and, thanks to  this, many people both in Yeltsin's apparatus and in Gorbachev's  apparatus earlier on have found him to be an obstacle that is  difficult to surmount, rather than a rival in the struggle for  power and influence.    Baturin asked just one question during his 5 January  telephone conversation with Yeltsin: Would he be able to carry  on performing his duties as assistant to the president for legal  affairs? The president replied that the nature and volume of  his new duties would hardly allow him to physically cope with  that, although there are no objections at all in principle to  Baturin continuing to assist the president also in the sphere of  his legal policy. A new assistant will evidently be appointed  to replace him, someone from among a number of qualified jurists  whom Baturin himself would be able to nominate, although the  final choice will rest with the president.    During his conversation with IZVESTIYA's correspondent,  Yuriy  Baturin refused to offer an exhaustive definition (not even a  list of general functions) of the extremely broad term "national  security," claiming that it would be more appropriate to do so  not in a newspaper interview but in the concept of national  security which ought to be elaborated on a priority basis with  his participation, but the principles and details thereof have  not yet been coordinated with the president.    His appointment to the new position came as a complete  surprise to Baturin and to everyone else, as did the earlier  edict disbanding the Ministry of Security, which the former  assistant to the president for legal affairs saw only after it  had been signed. But, since the end of December, on Yeltsin's  instructions, and in his former capacity, he has been taking  part in elaborating the Statute of the Federal  Counterintelligence Service [FCS] jointly with the former  leadership of the Ministry of Security, reported to the  president on this matter, and the latter was evidently pleased  with it. His practical experience of work with security organs  is evidently limited to this.    Already exercising his new powers as assistant to the  president for national security (incidentally, he is the only  one of the president's assistants whose range of duties is  enshrined in an official description of his office), during the  Christmas holidays Yuriy Baturin met with FCS Head Nikolay  Golushko and his first deputy Sergey Stepashin, and had a  separate meeting with Colonel General Nikolayev, chief of the  Federal Border Service.    Baturin will evidently have meetings in the very near future  with the leadership of the Army, the MVD [Ministry of Internal  Affairs], the Foreign Intelligence Service, and other structures  which are conventionally described as "power structures." The  separation of powers with the Security Council, which will  continue to function under the president, is being clarified.  According to Baturin, his appointment has not resulted in any  changes regarding the future of leaders of the Presidential  Protection Directorate, which has recently expanded its activity  beyond the limits of strictly ensuring his personal protection  right up to the setting up of its own analysis subunits.    Answering a question about the way his new activity fits in  with his former beliefs, Baturin replied that he does not intend  to "convert" and adapt his well-known and firmly held legal  beliefs to some new tune. Especially since the law offers the  basic system of security for citizens and the state alike. But  the special services, whose activities will henceforth be in his  charge, by their very nature operate in conditions of extreme  necessity -- so who but a legal expert is best placed to define  the criteria of such necessity and the limitations for any  retreat from overall law and order permissible under extreme  necessity, if it were to arise at all?    Yuriy Baturin evidently attaches priority importance in the  sphere of national security to the creation of powerful  analytical subunits which should, from this specific point of  view, evaluate the objectives of the Russian state's national  policy, including economic, legal, foreign, domestic, and  regional state policy, as well as the means used to attain these  objectives. Security primarily means the security of citizens,  the president is perceived as the main guarantor of this  security bearing total responsibility for it by virtue of his  office, and state security is conceived in the key of the  concept of a rule-of-law state, in other words a state which  attaches paramount importance to the interests of its citizens  and not of its functionaries.</p>

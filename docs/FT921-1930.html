			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Minding Your Own Business: When computers help to bring home the bacon - A couple whose rural idyll is funded by two very distinct businesses AN ODD message echoes out from the answer phone at the McGrath's home in the hamlet of Runnington. 'This is Somerset Computer Services and Dancing Pig printing and design at the Bell and Birdtable,' it says. 'Whether it's computer services, printing or meat and vegetables from the smallholding you are interested in, please leave your telephone number.' It is the dream of many to flee The Smoke and set up shop in a rural idyll as far as is practically possible from the grind of big city life. Kieron and Anne McGrath have done just that. They escaped London in 1981 and bought a small house and a three acre plot in Somerset. Eight years later, when Kieron no longer wanted to be away from home as a navigation technician for a US oceanographic company, they added a computer service and desk top publishing business in nearby Taunton to the smallholding. The couple love living in the heart of the West Country and being their own bosses. But it is not all milk and honey. 'There's a lot of hard work and a lot of stress,' says Kieron. It is not wildly profitable either.' Last year the computer and design business had a turnover of Pounds 30,000 and Kieron took a salary of just Pounds 7,000. The previous year, turnover was Pounds 16,000 and Kieron extracted nothing. Anne, a former buyer for Liberty's, readily concedes that making a living out of a three-acre patch of turf is a pipe dream. 'If you can provide cheap food for yourselves and enjoy working on the smallholding, then any profit is a bonus.' With pigs, sheep, ducks and hens, vegetables of the slightly more unusual variety and flowers for commercial sale, the Bell &amp; Birdtable smallholding sold Pounds 6,000 worth of produce last year on which it made a Pounds 1,000 profit. It does mean that shopping will not break the bank. 'Our weekly food bill is about Pounds 10 to Pounds 15,' Anne says. What glues the couple's finances together is Anne's yearly income of Pounds 6,000 from a trust fund. Kieron bought an Amstrad computer for his own use in 1987 and found himself drawn into helping friends wrestling with computer systems in their small businesses. He had no experience of desk-top publishing but a chance meeting with a graphics designer living across the field in Runnington started the ball rolling and the two of them started working together at the end of 1990. Since then he has bought a Quadram by Trader Desk with a 40 megabyte memory and an even faster machine, a Dan Technology with 210 megabyte hard disc for Pounds 1,800. With a scanning device which can read a hand drawing and transpose it onto a computer screen, Kieron says this gives him an adequate desk-top publishing system. Kieron is determined to keep the business in his own hands but the economics do not work in his favour and he knows it. The two graphic artists he employs charge Pounds 15 an hour. For many clients, Kieron adds a surcharge of just Pounds 2.50 for the company's hourly rate. 'We have to be very careful how much we charge. Companies down here are unhappy paying more than Pounds 20 an hour. A few might go up to Pounds 25. You have to work hard encouraging people to spend.' Customers for the design business which uses the trade name Dancing Pig, and counts for two-thirds of turnover, include the Rural Development Commission, a Devon springwater supplier, a willow furniture maker in Bridgwater and a local independent school. Contracts range from a leaflet or prospectus to helping shift a 'corporate image', if that is not too grand a term for tiny companies fretting about a naff logo or duff brochure. Kieron is also worried about competition. 'There isn't much around here at the moment but the cost of entry into this business is coming down and down. I think we'll have to start offering some form of marketing service.' For the time being, the little company has to cope with more mundane problems. Forced to leave its premises - one office and use of the boiler room in a local authority assisted block (rent Pounds 35 per week) - it is moving to another subsidised location ten miles away. It is also making its first foray into advertising, spending Pounds 400 for one year in Yellow Pages. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Anne explains what she has to do to make even a small profit. 'You must start vegetables off in optimum conditions and you must offer customers something a bit different.' For the first half of the plan, vegetables and flowering plants at the Bell &amp; Birdtable spend the early part of their lives in a 'propagating' environment - alias a former bedroom. Growlights consume a miserly 2.5p of electricity a day and the heater sips a gallon of paraffin a week. For the second part, Anne cultivates somewhat unusual vegetables such as eight varieties of lettuce, purple and yellow beans, squashes and peppers. It is pork though that is the biggest seller, the small-holding is home to 22 squealers. 'With commercial producers, pigs are usually killed at about 15 weeks, kept in small pens, fed to put on weight quickly and producing soft meat with no muscle,' Anne says. 'Thin skin makes for weak crackling. I keep my pigs outside all the time to the age of six and a half months and feed them on barley and soya mix with no animal protein. Many pigs are also fed whey but I don't feed them any milk products.' Anne sells her produce at the door and to local restaurants and pubs. 'Selling to shops is a dead loss because of the margins.' She has four freezers, each bought for just over Pounds 200 and sells half pigs at Pounds 1.50 a pound, smaller leg portions going for Pounds 2.60 a pound. Although decamping into the countryside has not proved lucrative so far, 'it is a wonderful place to live though,' Kieron says. The Bell &amp; Birdtable, Runnington, Wellington, Somerset TA21 OQW.

			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Arts: Die lustigen Weiber von Windsor - Shakespeare in London Sam Wanamaker's grand design of a faithfully reconstructed Globe Theatre close to the original site took another step forward at the weekend with a production of Die lustigen Weiber von Windsor by the Bremer Shakespeare Company. The weather on Friday was not kind, but not quite cruel enough to prevent the show going through to the end. If the sun had shone, the superlatives in this piece would be even stronger. For I do not share the general British scepticism that Wanamaker is pursuing a heroic endeavour doomed not to come off. He has been at it now for over 20 years and the arguments for what he is trying to achieve become stronger with time. In the first place, the international audience for Shakespeare is greater than the British. There are imitation Globe Theatres strewn around the world, though none with the advantage that could accrue to one set in the heart of Shakespeare's London. The site is on the south bank of the Thames more or less midway between the Royal National Theatre on the same side of the river and the Royal Shakespeare Company's Barbican home not far across the waterway. All three sites are just about within walking distance of each other, and would be even more comfortably so if Wanamaker's further dream of a pedestrian bridge across the river were realised. The concentration of three theatres in broadly the same area would add to the attraction, especially to foreign visitors. Both the RNT and the RSC stand to benefit from the Globe going ahead. I also think that Shakespeare is very good in German, as the Bremer production, brought to us in association with the Goethe-Institut, showed. As we have already seen from the Schiller Theater's interpretation of Macbeth, the Germans take a less deferential approach to Shakespeare than some of our own directors. That does not mean that they are always right, but it does help to demonstrate the Bard's infinite variety. Die lustigen Weiber (or in other words The Merry Wives of Windsor) is a perfect example. Some of the language and contemporary allusions are hard enough to understand in English. But it is a marvellous comedy designed to take liberties with, which perhaps explains why it has been the base for several operas. The Bremer production looked as if it had added components especially for London. Characters carry their bits and pieces in Harrods bags. A search for a marriage partner is pursued by consulting the (obviously newly introduced) agony column in the Evening Standard. When things go wrong, as in Friday's conditions frequently they did, the characters address the audience in English. There is a cast of only five - true to the Shakespeare tradition, all men. One of the revelations is that it is the arms rather than the legs that tell the men from the women. Erik Rossbander is a splendid Anne Page, almost better when just gesturing than when speaking. The triumph is Norbert Kentrup's Falstaff. The Germans do these things on the grand scale. No padding is required - we know this because for much of the time he wears a see-through nightshirt: he is just enormous, bigger even than Helmut Kohl, and remarkably good natured to boot. Note his entrance, dripping wet, after the interval, having just been thrown in the river, which in this case is conveniently nearby. Whether you understand German becomes immaterial. ***** The Bremer company specialises in Shakespeare and has done 17 productions since it was founded 10 years ago. Possibly The Merry Wives, which is largely in prose, is a natural for a British audience. One wonders what it would do with As You Like It, the RSC's production having arrived at the Barbican from Stratford. David Thacker's direction is notably austere, almost to the point of removing the comedy. But there is is one wonderful performance by Kate Buffery as Rosalind, the heroine who dresses as a boy in pursuit of her love. At times she commands the entire, almost bare stage, and could equally well be the hero. Every Shakespeare production is different. That is why we can take more. The Globe Theatre could become a permanent fixture in a year, given another Pounds 2m.</p>

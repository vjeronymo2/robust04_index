			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] In a press interview before leaving for Syria,  brother Jalal Talabani, secretary general of the Patriotic Union  of Kurdistan [PUK], said: [passage omitted] I will visit Syria  first before going on to Europe, Egypt, and possibly Saudi  Arabia. [passage omitted]    The main aim of my tour is to strengthen and consolidate  Kurdish political activity abroad, explain conditions in  Kurdistan, and request aid to rebuild Kurdish society. We will  also demand that the blockade imposed on Kurdistan be lifted,  that a solution be found for our problems, and that the  necessary protection be afforded to Kurdistan. We will ask the  United States and Europe to help us with weapons and training so  that we can form our own main protection force in the Kurdistan  region. We will also ask them to help us build a modern police  force capable of safeguarding security and stability in  Kurdistan. We will ask them to continue their aerial protection  on a permanent basis. With these three methods, we can provide  the necessary protection for Iraqi Kurdistan. We will also try  to increase the humanitarian aid for the Kurdistan region's  people and explain the situation in Kurdistan. [passage omitted]    On the Iraqi regime's threats to launch an offensive against  liberated Iraqi Kurdistan, especially following the renewal of  the UN sanctions on Baghdad, brother Talabani said: I believe  the ruling dictatorial, fascist regime in Baghdad is serious in  its threats. The attempt to attack the Kurdistan region is one  of the dreams of the dictatorial regime. But we have seen the  miscalculations of the head of the defeated Iraqi regime, such  as his war against Iran and his occupation of Kuwait. He also  made many mistakes during his war against Kurdistan. I believe  his mistakes this time will be added to his previous mistakes.  I believe the regime is serious in its threats but I am not  afraid of these threats. If the regime embarks on such a  desperate attempt, it will help us to liberate the remaining  parts of occupied Kurdistan. The regime will meet its doom,  because the Kurdistan people are prepared for sacrifice. The  peshmerga forces in Kurdistan are prepared to confront the  enemies. The international coalition forces will deal a deadly  blow to the dictatorial regime's force. If the regime's forces  come under air strikes, they will suffer utter defeat, not only  in Kurdistan, but elsewhere in Iraq. [passage omitted]</p>

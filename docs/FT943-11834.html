More tables had to be procured yesterday outside the press room to accommodate extra releases spewing forth from an unusually decisive European Commission sitting for its last meeting before the summer break. Hiding among the pile were a few paragraphs to the effect that the Commission had struck a deal with Arbed, the Luxembourg steel-maker that is buying into Germany's Klockner Werke, whereby Arbed would close a steel mill as part of a debt write-off already agreed with Klockner. Only problem was, the decision had not yet been taken and officials said the statement should be considered void. A decision was taken some hours later.</p>

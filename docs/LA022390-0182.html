			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHRISTENSEN GOES OUT FOR NEW CHALLENGE -- BASEBALL  </P> <P> A player wearing a green Oakland A's jersey, No. 32, stretches near the batting  cage. He has a muscular upper body. Long, curly strands of hair extend beyond  his baseball cap.  </P> <P> The man looks a lot like Todd Christensen, a former football player, the guy  who played tight end for the Raiders.  </P> <P> Funny. It is Todd Christensen.  </P> <P> He wears no shoulder pads, no silver and black. He does not run a post pattern  toward second base. He wields a baseball bat and steps into the box.  </P> <P> He bunts the first two pitches. Then he sends the next one soaring toward the  right field fence. Tell it goodby.  </P> <P> "That was pretty exciting," Christensen said later. "I thought, 'What's there  to this? It's easy.' "  </P> <P> Christensen injected color into another faceless, emotionless day of Lockout  '90. He came to Scottsdale Community College for a tryout with the world  champions.  </P> <P> Though he did not expect an instant contract offer -- and didn't get one --  this was not an exercise in comedy. Christensen seldom smiled.  </P> <P> His agent, Alan Hendricks, called A's General Manager Sandy Alderson last week.  Alderson, remembering a 1987 interview with Christensen on ESPN's "SportsLook,"  gave the request more than idle thought.  </P> <P> When told of Christensen's inquiry, Walt Jocketty, the A's director of baseball  administration, laughed. After watching Thursday's tryout, he figures it was  worth a couple of hours on an otherwise quiet February day.  </P> <P> "We did it as a favor," Jocketty said. "I think he wanted to get some sense of  what we thought of his ability.  </P> <P> "There are definitely some basic skills there. But at his age, there's too much  to do in too little time."  </P> <P> Christensen is 33. That's two years too young to play in the senior baseball  league, a more likely destination for this strange odyssey.  </P> <P> The Raiders released him last fall after a decade as one of the NFL's top tight  ends. He caught 95 passes in 1986. He played in four Pro Bowls.  </P> <P> But he had not played baseball since his days at Sheldon High School in Eugene,  Ore. His career there was impressive enough for him to be taken in the 1974  baseball draft.  </P> <P> But Christensen preferred to play tight end at Brigham Young. Baseball waited  for more than 15 years. Then, driven partly by curiosity, partly by  competitiveness and partly by ego -- not, he stressed, by money -- he began  working out in Los Angeles in December.  </P></p>

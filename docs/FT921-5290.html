			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / EC unity sought for Earth Summit MR Carlo Ripa di Meana, EC environment commissioner, warned yesterday that unless the EC could put together 'a strong, unambiguous position,' he would not attend the UN Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June. Mr Ripa di Meana listed five requirements, stressing particularly the need to agree on a location for the blocked European Environment Agency (EEA), and for a coherent policy to combat global warming. 'We must go to Rio, as it were, with a dowry,' he said. 'If we do not have this, I will not be participating in the conference, which will become a carnival of declarations in Copacabana.' The Portuguese presidency of the EC has to select a site for the EEA by March 23, after a Commission idea to rotate the headquarters was shelved. France is blocking agreement until Strasbourg is confirmed as the definitive home of the European Parliament. Some officials believe Paris may now prove more pliable, faced with a rise in support for ecologists in regional elections later this month. Copenhagen has been tipped as the likely seat of the EEA. The EC would look 'ludicrous' at Rio unless this impasse is unblocked, the commissioner said. It would be 'vulnerable to the elementary remark that the Community has not set up its agency because it cannot agree where to put it.' On the Commission's controversial plan for a mixed carbon and energy tax to cut carbon dioxide emissions, Mr Ripa di Meana said: 'We have to make up our minds and adopt the proposal ..if we adopt this position, movement will be possible among our &lt;trading&gt; partners.' While Mr Ripa di Meana acknowledged that economic conditions may not allow the EC to go ahead with a tax unless the US and Japan could be persuaded to follow suit, he believes they are unlikely to do so unless the Twelve clearly demonstrate they are serious about using fiscal instruments to defeat the greenhouse effect. The Commission yesterday formally endorsed plans to phase out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other ozone-depleting substances by the end of 1995.</p>

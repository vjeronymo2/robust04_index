			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GALANTER BACKS LAKE OVER YAROSLAVSKY  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter on Wednesday bucked council  tradition by reaffirming her support for Laura Lake over fellow Councilman Zev  Yaroslavsky in the 5th District race.  </P> <P> "I owe Laura personally and politically a great debt," Galanter said. Lake not  only played a key role in Galanter's successful campaign against Councilwoman  Pat Russell two years ago but took Galanter's mother into her home after  Galanter was stabbed by an intruder at her home during the 1987 campaign.  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky, who supported Russell two years ago, said of Galanter Wednesday,  "I understand her personal relationship with Laura, and I respect it."  </P> <P> Galanter endorsed Lake, a fellow environmentalist, in September when  Yaroslavsky was expected to give up his council seat to run for mayor.  Yaroslavsky decided earlier this month not to challenge Mayor Tom Bradley,  citing polls showing him to be unbeatable. Instead, he decided to seek  reelection.  </P> <P> It was not known until Wednesday whether Galanter, who went to Antarctica the  day after Yaroslavsky's announcement, would continue to back Lake.  </P> <P> It is rare, but not unheard of, for members of the city's small rather  collegial body to endorse a challenger over an incumbent. Yaroslavsky, along  with Councilman Marvin Braude, ignored council etiquette by endorsing Mike Woo  in his successful 1985 campaign against Councilwoman Peggy Stevenson. Braude  supported Galanter in 1987.  </P> <P> Speaking at a City Hall news conference, Galanter, who was elected to represent  the Los Angeles International Airport area on a slow-growth platform, avoided  criticism of Yaroslavsky. A major theme of Lake's campaign is that Yaroslavsky  has failed to slow development in the 5th District, a charge that Yaroslavsky  denies.  </P> <P> Also challenging Yaroslavsky in the April election are Jack McGrath, who  managed Yaroslavsky's first successful campaign in 1975 and served as the  councilman's chief deputy; urban planner Ryan Snyder and artist Henry Hill.  Steve Saltzman, a former Bradley aide and co-chairman of Yaroslavsky's 1985  reelection campaign, dropped out of the race last week.  </P></p>

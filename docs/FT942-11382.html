			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Italians stall deal to purchase Ekostahl The future of eastern Germany's largest steel mill was yesterday thrown into jeopardy after Riva, the Italian privately-owned steel company, said it could not acquire the plant under the current arrangements. Officials from the Treuhand privatisation agency said however, that a new round of talks would take place next week. Earlier in the day, Ms Birgit Breuel, Treuhand president, and Mr Emilio Riva had met in Berlin in an attempt to solve the dispute between Riva and IG Metall, Germany's large engineering union. At issue is the way in which Riva will reduce the workforce this year, what it will do with Ekostahl's subsidiary companies, and the composition of the supervisory board. If Riva decided at this late stage in the negotiations not to buy Ekostahl, it would further weaken attempts by the Treuhand privatisation agency to privatise the loss-making mill, as well undermine chances for securing 3,000 jobs at the plant. It would also represent an acute embarrassment for Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister, who had last year successfully lobbied the European Commission to back a DM1bn (Dollars 500m) modernisation package for Ekostahl. That deal undoubtedly made Ekostahl a more attractive proposition for Riva, but at the same time it enraged the west German steel manufacturers, who have had to make substantial cuts in order to reduce over-capacity. It had been earlier agreed that Riva would reduce the 3,000 workforce by 700 by the end of this year. IG Metall had assumed the workers would be phased out. But Riva intended to put them on 'zero' short-time work from May 1, effectively removing them from the mill altogether. Moreover, both sides cannot agree on the 11th person on the supervisory board. Ten seats are equally divided between workers' representatives and Riva, while the 11th is supposed to be neutral. 'A serious clash between two different cultures has taken place at this late stage,' a Treuhand official said. He denied that Riva, faced with overcapacity in the steel industry throughout the European Union, was simply using the dispute with IG Metall as an excuse to pull out of buying Ekostahl altogether. 'We do not see any hidden motive in this dispute,' the Treuhand official continued. 'Riva has been confronted with a tradition of seeking consensus within German industry, while the unions have been confronted with a typical medium-sized private Italian company which is used to making its own decisions as it sees fit,' he added. Riva, however, has had previous experience with Germany's industrial relations. It bought the east German steel plant at Hennigsdorf in 1992.</p>

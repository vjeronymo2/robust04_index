			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: Bowthorpe bids for Penny &amp; Giles BOWTHORPE HOLDINGS, the electrical and electronic components maker, yesterday launched a Pounds 30m agreed bid for instrument manufacturer Penny &amp; Giles, sending the target's shares leaping 32 per cent in a falling market. Penny &amp; Giles shares closed 75p higher at 310p yesterday in response to the offer. Mr John Westhead, Bowthorpe's chief executive, said Penny &amp; Giles would fit the group's strategy of exploiting niche markets. 'We aim to get it into the top three position around the world,' he said 'That is what we are good at.' Bowthorpe shares ended the day just 2p down at 234p. The company already holds just under 30 per cent of Penny &amp; Giles. Bowthorpe is offering 136 new shares for every 100 Penny &amp; Giles shares. Alternatively, Penny &amp; Giles shareholders may elect to take 1 new Bowthorpe share and 84p cash for every one of theirs. Based on last night's prices the offer values Penny &amp; Giles shares at 318p. Mr Westhead said the deal with Penny &amp; Giles offered global synergies. For example, Bowthorpe had businesses in the US which manufactured products complementary to Penny &amp; Giles's output in the UK. About 80 per cent of Bowthorpe's sales were outside the UK, said Mr Westhead, with 60 to 70 per cent manufactured abroad. Penny &amp; Giles exported about 40 per cent of its business. 'The emphasis will be on growth outside the UK', he said. The deal was likely to dilute Bowthorpe's earnings by less than 2 per cent, said Mr Westhead. He added, however, that the dilution would be eliminated within 18 months. The new Bowthorpe shares will be eligible for the 4.43p final dividend announced in the annual results last month. Bowthorpe reported an 11 per cent decline to Pounds 40.3m in the year to December 31.</p>

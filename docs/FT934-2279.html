			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Arafat visits London with Mideast peace in balance Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, arrived in London on a two-day official visit yesterday with the future of the Middle East peace process finely balanced. The PLO and Israel agreed on Monday that negotiations over the implementation of the September 13 declaration of principles were in crisis following the fruitless meeting between Mr Arafat and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, in Cairo at the weekend. The two sides had set a target of December 13 for the start of Israeli troop withdrawals from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. But the talks have foundered over the control of border crossings, the size of the territory to be administered by the Palestinians around Jericho, and the Israeli troop presence required to protect Jewish settlers in Gaza. The two leaders have agreed to meet again before the end of next week and Mr Arafat repeated yesterday that he was still hopeful an agreement could be reached. The failure of Israel to begin the troop withdrawal as scheduled has sparked bitterness among Palestinians in the occupied territories, where violence again flared yesterday with two Arabs shot dead in Gaza and another 12 wounded during clashes with Israeli forces. Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, yesterday urged Mr Arafat to be firm in opposition to violence and to reassure Israelis the risk they had taken for peace was reciprocated. He also urged the PLO to persuade Arab countries to relax the trade boycott against Israel and to build up bilateral contacts as soon as possible. Before leaving Strasbourg for London yesterday, Mr Arafat said that the entire credibility of the peace process would be a stake if Israel failed to honour the April 13 deadline for completing its military withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. The PLO leader was responding to a statement from Mr Rabin in which the Israeli leader stressed there was nothing sacred about any of the dates set out in the declaration of principles signed in Washington. If Mr Rabin said that, 'there is doubt for the credibility of the peace process,' added Mr Arafat. The PLO leader is due today to hold talks with Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, before leaving for Dublin. Meanwhile the remaining 215 Palestinian deportees from the 415 who were expelled a year ago from the occupied territories to southern Lebanon, were informed by Israel that they could return home today. Most support radical Islamic groups.</p>

			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'CROSSROADS FOR CHILD CARE'  </P> <P> Your excellent editorial states, "Two senators whose views of the world do not  mesh -- Democrat Chris Dodd of Connecticut and Republican Orrin Hatch of Utah  -- are sponsoring this important child-care bill. Their measure would help  states create new child-care programs, establish safety standards for operating  those programs and help poor families pay for their children's care."  </P> <P> Any money invested in the children of America is worth the investment many  times over. My sincere blessings go to these two senators.  </P> <P> JAIME B. VEGA  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

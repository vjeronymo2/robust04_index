			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Argentina braced for general strike Argentina's opposition parties and breakaway trade unions say they will bring the country to a halt today with a general strike to protest against the free-market policies of President Carlos Menem. The strike follows a march by the same groups three weeks ago that brought 100,000 protesters to Buenos Aires in one of the largest anti-government demonstrations since Mr Menem took office in 1989. Mr Menem attacked the strike call as 'capricious' and declared it illegal. Mr Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister, predicted the strike would be a 'failure'. He added: 'It is political. It is clearly illegal.' Mr Armando Caro Figueroa, labour minister, warned that declaring the strike illegal would allow employers to sack striking workers. Previous general strikes against Mr Menem's Peronist government by the Peronist-dominated CGT union confederation have been half-hearted and have always failed. Mr Menem has skilfully co-opted union leaders while restricting union rights first granted by the movement's founder, Juan Peron, when president in the late-1940s and mid-1970s. However, pressure is coming from public-sector unions that quit the CGT and from younger industrial union leaders who feel unrepresented by the Peronist old guard. They are allied to the Frente Grande, a rising opposition party comprising disaffected Peronists and leftists, which is prominent in organising the strike. The strike call follows the government's announcement last week of a sharp rise in unemployment. Unemployment, measured twice a year, rose to a record 10.8 per cent in May from 9.9 per cent in October last year.</p>

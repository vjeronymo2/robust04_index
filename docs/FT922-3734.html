			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Congress tries to kick deficit habit CONGRESS will today begin debate on a last bulwark against the ever-spiralling US fiscal deficit: an amendment to the constitution to require the president and Congress to balance the budget. Neither Republican President George Bush nor the Democratic majority in Congress has shown much appetite for taking the tough decisions necessary to comply with such a constitutional amendment, such as raising taxes or slashing spending. Nevertheless, both Mr Bush and an improbable coalition of Democrats such as Senator Paul Simon of Illinois and Representative Charles Stenholm of Texas have joined forces to press for the amendment. The balanced budget amendment has lost momentum in recent weeks as it encountered stubborn opposition from senior Democrats, led by Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia. Still, the measure has kept up a good head of steam and is thought to stand a fair chance of winning the required two-thirds majority in a House of Representatives vote expected tomorrow, even if it then faces a rougher ride in the Senate. Senator Byrd likens the amendment to everybody's favourite granny: cute, but toothless. 'You cannot gum the deficit to death,' he told his colleagues. If passed by the necessary majority in both houses, the amendment would need to be ratified by three-quarters of the US's 50 states to take effect. The campaign for a balanced budget amendment has won much of its support, particularly in the House, from legislators anxious to redeem themselves with voters who have expressed increasing disgust at Washington's apparent gridlock, as well as at members' exploitation of the liberal overdraft policies of their House bank. But its backers have also tapped a national undercurrent of concern at the mounting national debt, which has quadrupled to more than Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.1bn) in the last decade. The drive for a balanced budget amendment mirrors in some respects the appeal of Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire who has built his still undeclared presidential campaign heavily on the need to tackle the deficit, and on Washington's inability to get the job done. The budget deficit this year is expected to set a new record at Dollars 400bn, or nearly 6.9 per cent of gross domestic product. Although this deficit would, on the administration's projections, fall in the mid-1990s as the cost of bank failures dwindles, it would start to rise again in 1997, both in cash terms and as a proportion of GDP. Net interest this year is estimated by the Congressional Budget Office at Dollars 201bn, more than 18 per cent of total tax revenue. Last week, Mr Bush threw his weight behind the amendment in a news conference. But he and the amendment's congressional backers look rather like alcoholics begging their friends to take away the whisky bottle, while simultaneously trying to hold on to their jobs as barmen.</p>

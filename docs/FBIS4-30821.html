			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vesna Kostic and Aleksandra Bilanovic: "The </F> Rigging of Life"]    [Excerpt] "We cannot be under blockade. Perhaps in  a thousand years (the embargo could have some effect). But a  few years? That is nothing."    -- Slobodan Milosevic, president of Serbia    "1.2 million children are starving in the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia."    -- Vlada Curguz, chairman of the Commission for Cooperation  with UNICEF    The balance of the United Nations' two-year sanctions  against  Serbia and Montenegro is suspended between these two recent  statements. The leadership and the policy has not changed,  while the price was paid -- generally patiently and voluntarily  -- by the population.    It is doubtful that the citizens are aware of this, because  according to Dragan Popadic, professor of social psychology,  "the sanctions affect the tissue of society in the same way  radiation does: At first glance nothing seems to be changing  and life goes on as usual. Like some irradiated organism,  society becomes gravely ill without noticing it due to the still  existing facade that things are functioning normally."    On the second anniversary of an unheard-of international  isolation of a country, the Yugoslavs can conclude that,  according to calculations of the Center for Development and  Economic Policy of the Federal Ministry for Science and  Development, they have lost some $45.117 billion. Zarko Katic,  minister of transportation in Serbia, claims that this economic  branch alone lost some $10 billion. The social product has been  halved. This calculation does not include the other expenses  caused by the blocked financial assets and property (20 sea and  43 river vessels, and six aircraft, whose value exceeds $600  million), and the loss of capital caused by the conversion of  property into consumption. If the sanctions stay in place until  2011 -- the Center assesses -- the cost of the blockade could  mount to $147.334 billion. No one has yet calculated what will  happen after a thousand years.    Infant mortality has climbed to 21.7 percent in 1992, while  mortality among diabetics has doubled. Every other child in  Belgrade is anemic; out of every 100 children hospitalized in  1989, 1.45 died, while last year this number climbed to 2.07.  In the first year of the embargo, mortality among old people  increased from 501 percent in comparison to the distant 1986.  The number of murders in the same period rose by 49 percent,  and suicides by 22.8 percent. With an unemployment rate of 40  percent among the able, working population, Yugoslavia tops the  international charts. [passage omitted]</p>

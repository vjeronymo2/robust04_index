			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Letter: Housing associations see threat to their future from government plans to make cuts in grant rates Sir, Your leader on housing policy neatly highlighted the dilemma facing housing associations. Notting Hill Housing Trust has had, in almost 30 years of existence, one overriding objective. It is to help those without a home or who are poorly housed, to find one and then enjoy its benefits. The way in which we have achieved this objective has changed with different funding arrangements that have existed over that time. The 1988 Housing Act is perhaps the most significant change we have had as it required us to raise private finance to go alongside public funding. We have successfully responded to this challenge and increased the provision of new homes. The suggestion that the government should reduce the element of public funding of a new home and seek to increase the amount of private finance that we have to raise has substantial implications on wider social policy. In the areas of inner London where we work the cost rent of a three-bedroom home would rise from Pounds 67 to Pounds 102 per week. The average income of our new tenants is currently Pounds 100 per week. Those housed at these rents are trapped and dependent on benefits. For a government committed to reducing a dependency culture and seeking to promote employment and growth, this proposal makes no sense. Donald Hoodless, group chief executive, Notting Hill Housing Trust, 26 Paddenswick Road, London W6 0UB</p>

Mark Robinson, 47, Tory MP for Somerton and Frome and a  former minister, and Tony Worthington, 52, Labour MP for  Clydebank and Milngavie, were taken on Wednesday night with  Action Aid external relations manager Jeff Chinnock.    The MPs were abducted near Erigavo, northwest Somalia,  during  a week-long fact-finding mission in the Horn of Africa country  wracked by famine and bloody feuds between local warlords.    A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We can confirm that they  are at the Action Aid office in Erigavo and we understand they  will fly out tomorrow."    The spokesman said it was too dark to consider flying the  released men out tonight.</p>

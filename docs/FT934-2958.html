			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium prices resume uptrend Rumours yesterday of a Russian smelter closure and buying by New York investment funds sent the London Metal Exchange aluminium price bouncing up to its highest level for two months. Fund buying in the morning was probably stimulated by the buoyancy of other metals prices this week, analysts said. But it was met by aggressive selling by producers. Then came widespread rumours that the Krasnoyarsk smelter in Russia, an 800,000-tonnes-a-year monster and the biggest in the world, was to close and be refurbished. Kaiser Aluminium of the US is known to be working on a Dollars 50m project to upgrade about 90,000 tonnes of capacity at the smelter. There was no confirmation of the total closure rumour so the market then concentrated on suggestions that the smelter involved was the smaller Novokuznetsk plant in Siberia. VAW of Germany has said it will help modernise this 280,000-tonne-a-year plant in stages. Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, said the market reaction - short-covering sent the three-month aluminium price to Dollars 1,138 a tonne - was 'a bit overdone.' By the close the price had eased to Dollars 1,127.50 a tonne, up Dollars 26.75.</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: CINVen to manage Royal portfolio CINVen, the UK's second largest venture capital company is to take over management of the private equity portfolio of Royal Insurance Asset Management, writes Richard Gourlay. Royal Insurance will invest alongside the pension funds of Barclays Bank, British Rail and British Coal, all of which are already managed by CINVen. CINVen takes over Royal's Pounds 40m private equity portfolio. Royal is the latest to hand management of private equity investments to other professional managers. Royal will be investing as much as Barclays and the British Rail pension funds in any CINVen deals, all of which individually invest slightly less than the British Coal pension fund. Schroder Ventures, meanwhile, has closed a Pounds 140m buy-out fund, the group's third fund. Mr Peter Smitham, managing partner, said Schroders' success 'gave the lie' to the view that it was almost impossible to raise funds for new venture capital invest-ment. The fund's closing was delayed by the departure of Mr Jon Moulton, who resigned after a disagreement over strategy.</p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLONIAL POWERS  </P> <P> "The Peril of Strange-Bedfellowship" by Cheryl Benard (Commentary, Oct. 15) was  excellent reading. She has very nicely and justly sympathized with the  villain's (Saddam Hussein) position.  </P> <P> Truly, the colonial powers have divided the world to their advantage by  artificially dividing countries. They did not care about the consequences to  the local population.  </P> <P> They punished a big country like Iraq by giving it only one port, Basra, while  they rewarded the tiny Sabah family with immense oil wealth and good ports.  Look at Malaysia and oil-rich Brunei! Whatever British Prime Minister Margaret  Thatcher says about right and wrong, a lot of blood and atrocities could have  been avoided if tiny Britain had not gone out to conquer the world.  </P> <P> The atrocities that the British committed in India during their rule are  unforgivable. Hundreds of thousand innocent people died during the partition of  India and Pakistan. The same for Palestine.  </P> <P> Now the British talk about democracy and justice! They forget the days when a  tiny island like Britain made most of the world its slave.  </P> <P> O. VASAN  </P> <P> Yorba Linda  </P></p>

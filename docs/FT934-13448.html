			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: Johnson &amp; Johnson advances by 9.7% A LOWER effective tax rate led to a 9.7 per cent advance in net income at Johnson &amp; Johnson during the third quarter, the US healthcare products group announced yesterday, writes Richard Waters. Pre-tax earnings climbed by only 2.5 per cent, but after-tax profits jumped from Dollars 414m, or 63 cents a share, to Dollars 454m, or 70 cents. The strong US dollar restricted sales growth to less than 1 per cent in dollar terms. Sales climbed by 7.1 per cent in local currency terms, but after translation into the US currency rose only to Dollars 3.51bn, from Dollars 3.48bn a year before.</p>

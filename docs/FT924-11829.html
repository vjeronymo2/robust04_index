			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / TUC steps up campaign for pits THE Trades Union Congress is launching a national advertising campaign today to attract support for the second demonstration against pit closures this Sunday and to sustain the momentum of its broader Recovery Campaign. The TUC Recovery Campaign has spent about Pounds 200,000 of union money on the advertising and demonstration but hopes to raise much more money from the public. News of the intensifying media effort emerged after Mr Roy Lynk, president of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, ended his seven-day sit-in at the Silverhill mine in Nottinghamshire. Mr Lynk also hinted that he might change his mind about not standing again for the union leadership in next month's election. UDM members, mainly based in Nottinghamshire, have been as outraged by the pit closure announcement as their fellow miners in the Yorkshire-based National Union of Miners, but there is little chance of a rapprochement between the two unions and the UDM is unlikely to have an official presence on Sunday's march. Other publicity efforts include leafleting outside the Rugby League World Cup Final between Great Britain and Australia on Saturday. The British team is sponsored by British Coal. Although the TUC hopes that its Sunday demonstration will attract broader support than Wednesday's NUM demonstration, some officials fear that many miners cannot afford to travel to London twice within a week. The TUC committee co-ordinating the campaign yesterday urged affiliated unions and TUC regional committees to establish links with the 10 'Heseltine pits' that have won only a temporary reprieve. The TUC may also attempt to build on the success of postponing British Coal privatisation and give an extra push to the campaign against the privatisation of British Rail. Yesterday a campaign backed by more than 60 bodies including the rail unions, was launched against privatisation.</p>

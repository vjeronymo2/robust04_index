			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Food and Drink: Learning at lunch - How Nicholas Lander ate and judged five lunches I KNOW that there are some people out there who, perhaps for commercial reasons, eat lunch out every day of the week. But I have never done so. When I was a restaurateur, lunch was one course at 3pm and now that I am a reviewer, I try to space out my pleasures. That is until last week when I judged a new culinary competition, Prix des Deux Cartes, devised by wine importers Domaines, Drouhin &amp; Associates. This challenges chefs and sommeliers to create a menu and choose four wines to match and enhance the food. There was a substantial reward for all who reached the necessary standard. The five judges were: Michel Roux, of the Waterside Inn, Bray; Charles Metcalfe, wine writer; Bill Baker, wine merchant; Victor Ceserani, whose book Practical Cooking has sold 1.5m copies since 1962 and is the 'bible' for any catering college student; and myself. We met in December to judge 70 written entries, without knowing their origins. Surprisingly, we eliminated all the London entries at this stage, including The Dorchester, The Inn on the Park and Les Saveurs. The five finalists were: Burgh Island Hotel, South Devon (tel: 0548-810514); the Waterside Inn, Bray (0628-20691), although Roux neither knew it was being entered nor judged the meal; Lucknam Park, Wiltshire (0225-742777); One Devonshire Gardens, Glasgow (041-339-2001) and The Old Swan Hotel, Harrogate (0423-500055). All five achieved high marks with various food and wine combinations. Burgh Island overcame the problem of having to prepare John Dory on a Monday by bringing the fish, landed on Sunday in Newlyn, Cornwall, to London by train. The Scottish entrants drove eight hours in a hired van with their own cutlery, crockery and tartan ribbons for the napkins. They also brought their own ingredients; a 14lb wild salmon from Loch Lomond - delicious with a Joseph Drouhin Rully Blanc 1990 - and a saddle of one-year-old roe deer shot in Aberdeenshire and hung for 12 days. The Waterside Inn executed a cassolette of scallops and langoustines memorable for the quality of the fish and the flavours of the vegetable nage. Lucknam Park dazzled with its amuses-gueules - chilled Helford oysters and scallops with a pepper confit - as well as its first course, tortellini of jerusalem artichokes with a truffle butter sauce. The Old Swan's cooking was considerably enhanced by Mark Kirby, a young man who had joined the hotel three weeks earlier and been rapidly promoted because its sommelier had fallen ill. But at the end of every meal, when the chef and sommelier joined us for coffee, I and the other judges felt disappointed. This was partly because only the team from Glasgow (its sommelier is called Johnnie Walker) had approached the competition scientifically and sat down to test the food and wines at one sitting. The others tested haphazardly and made silly mistakes. The sommelier from Lucknam Park tried to 'create a contrast' by matching a rich chocolate pudding with a rare vin de paille 1982 from Chapoutier. He succeeded only in creating what fellow judges Baker and Metcalfe described as 'a disaster'. The Waterside Inn's team produced a savarin of pears and ginger that was overwhelmingly sweet for the late harvest Gewurztraminer 1990 from New Zealand. Only Burgh House found a good dessert and wine combination by serving a simple apple pastry with a delicious 1986 Sauternes Chateau Rieussec. More seriously, although the first courses were excellent, in four out of the five meals the main courses and the wines chosen were just not well matched. Had I been a paying customer I might have felt more than disappointment. These feelings were articulated by Victor Ceserani. He began with a compliment, then dished out the constructive criticism, based on 50 years in professional kitchens. Do not put shallots and chives in your amuses-gueules  -leave the customers' palate clean for the first course; do not get carried away with the reduction of your stocks or they become too heavy; do not overdo the ratio of stuffing to meat, it should be 50:50; and, for two of the chefs, a warning against putting too much sauce underneath the main course. The competition left five British chefs and sommeliers more aware of the potential and pitfalls of matching food and wine. Three teams, from the Waterside Inn, One Devonshire Gardens and Lucknam Park will learn more on the trips they have won to European vineyards. And, after a week, it has left five judges just a little bit plumper.</p>

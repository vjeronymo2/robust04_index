			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Skopje, 17 Jan (TANJUG) -- The Macedonian press  today quotes a statement by the U.S. Army Chief of Staff General  Gordon Sullivan that the American Army is ready to prevent any  aggression against (the former Yugoslav Republic of) Macedonia  and to provide humanitarian aid for Macedonia.    Gen. Gordon yesterday spent several hours in Macedonia and  visited American soldiers with UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]  and two blue helmet observer positions. Before his departure  from Skopje he said that he was very satisfied with UNPROFOR's  mission on preserving stability in "this important region." The  U.S. Army Chief of Staff ruled out the possibility of increasing  the contingent of U.S. soldiers with UNPROFOR stationed in  Macedonia. Asked what his opinion was about a possible NATO  military intervention in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, he  briefly said that he was a soldier, not a diplomat. Gen.  Sullivan also had a meeting in Skopje with the chief of general  staff of the Macedonian army, Colonel-General Dragoljub Bocinov.</p>

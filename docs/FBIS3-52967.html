			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hanan 'Ashrawi by Ben Segenreich in Tel </F> Aviv; date not given: "Against a Monolithic Authority"]    [Text] [Segenreich] Is your refusal to accept a public  office meant as a criticism of PLO leader 'Arafat?    ['Ashrawi] It is not a matter of individuals. We have a  leadership that has not lived in its own country, with its own  people, with a system of accountability, of control, and  critical commentary for a long time. It has to change from  being a liberation movement to a governmental system. The  working methods and thinking patterns of the past are no longer  valid. An internal reform is necessary.    This transition will be very painful, and a number of  mistakes have already been made. During the next phase we must  ensure that the new government respects citizens' rights and is  truly democratic, that we do not follow the example of many  Third World countries wherein a monolithic authority puts  itself, not the people, at the center.    [Segenreich] Is 'Arafat accumulating too many offices, too  much power?    ['Ashrawi] Of course, the PLO leadership should be more open  and more democratic. It should decentralize and enable  co-determination on the basis of talents and capacities. The  old decisionmaking process is no longer valid. We need  efficiency, openness, and control.    Whether the PLO is capable of effecting this change remains  to be seen. The real test will come after the introduction of  self-rule.    [Segenreich] A group of Palestinian businessmen and a  delegation led by Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi recently presented  suggestions for reforms in Tunis. Do you support this pressure  on 'Arafat?    ['Ashrawi] I support the principle. Some time ago, a group  of Palestinians from the occupied territories -- mainly  delegates to the negotiations -- went to Tunis and worked out  suggestions and structures there, such as criteria for  appointing people to public offices. These suggestions were  presented to 'Arafat; he agreed to them -- but, unfortunately  they have not been put into practice.    [Segenreich] Should the key positions be given to people  from among the PLO leadership in Tunis, or to local leaders?    ['Ashrawi] There should be a good mix. The people who have  permanently lived in a coherent Palestinian society should get  an effective say. They are entitled to this because they have  worked here under the most difficult circumstances and have  gained the people's confidence. No group should exert power at  the cost of another.    [Segenreich] Is it right that just before Palestinian  autonomy should come into effect there have been little  preparations, and there is almost a state of chaos?    ['Ashrawi] This is an exaggeration. There is no chaos, but  we are not all that well-prepared, either. Some administrative  authorities and economic institutions are already in existence,  but they are not prepared to such an extent that we could take  over business tomorrow. It will be a difficult process, we will  have to grow into the job.    We will have to make use of the technical knowledge of those  who worked in the Israeli military administration, we will also  have to use the enormous human resources of Palestinians all  over the world and use their talents in establishing our nation,  without any nepotism.    [Segenreich] What do you think the schedule will be for  introducing autonomy? Some people say that the necessary time  should be spent over this, since a good agreement is more  important than a good schedule.    ['Ashrawi] A flexible schedule would be very dangerous. The  withdrawal of Israeli troops should be concluded by 13 April,  even if it is begun with a delay. And the elections have to be  held before 13 July. This is the test of both sides'  credibility and of the real democratic nature of the new regime.</p>

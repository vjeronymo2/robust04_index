			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / First-day covers scheme welcomed The Office of Fair Trading has welcomed a Royal Mail plan to assist independent producers of first-day covers. Mr Anthony Buckingham, managing director of Benham, an independent first-day cover producer in Folkestone, Kent, said he had complained to the OFT that Royal Mail was charging almost face value for stamps while the Philatelic Bureau, Royal Mail's in-house operation, had to pay only the production cost of stamps for its covers. Now the Royal Mail plans a scheme to enable independent producers to claim a rebate on stamps affixed and cancelled on their first-day covers.</p>

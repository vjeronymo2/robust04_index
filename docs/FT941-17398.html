			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Number may be up for French France is considering adding two digits to all telephone numbers, lengthening them to 10 digits, to keep ahead of an unexpected surge in demand for new phone lines, the Industry Ministry said yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris. The move, tentatively planned for the end of 1995, would prevent France from running out of phone numbers one decade after it added an eighth digit to all lines. Between 1985 and 1993, the number of lines surged to 31m from 23m as fax machines and mobile phones took hold. Under the plan, the first digit would be 0, with the second being a new area code.</p>

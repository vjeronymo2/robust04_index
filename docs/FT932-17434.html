			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Electricity price rise for Ulster industry INDUSTRIAL consumers of electricity in Northern Ireland are to pay up to 9 per cent more from today, it was announced yesterday, Michael Smith writes. The move is in spite of a government promise last week of at least Pounds 10m to curb rises. The increases come at a time when electricity companies in England and Wales are freezing or reducing prices. Domestic customers of Northern Ireland Electricity will have to pay 2.3 per cent more or 6 per cent if they use off-peak Economy Seven. Mr Nigel Smith, local director of the Confederation of British Industry, said it was very worrying. Northern Ireland Electricity, which is to be privatised in the summer, said electricity in the province was on a different system to that in England and Wales. More than 80 per cent of electricity was generated from oil in Northern Ireland and the benefits of cheaper coal, which English and Welsh consumers were enjoying, were less.</p>

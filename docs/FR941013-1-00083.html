			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Selection of Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under CAA section 114(a), the EPA may require any owner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or operator of a source subject to a NESHAP to establish and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintain records as well as prepare and submit notifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and reports to the EPA. General recordkeeping and reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for all NESHAP are specified in the Part 63  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general provisions (40 CFR 63.9 and 40 CFR 63.10). All  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recordkeeping and reporting requirements were selected for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with these Part 63 general provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Emissions Averaging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Emissions averaging is an approach used by the EPA for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain other NESHAP rulemakings when the average level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions from individual facilities in the source category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remains relatively predictable over extended periods of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time. Application of this approach allows a facility owner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or operator to obtain emission credits by reducing emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from specific emission points at the facility to a level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less than that required by the rule. These emission credits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can then be used to offset emission debits created at those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission points at the facility that are not controlled to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the level required by the rule. Under the EPA's emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> averaging policy, a facility owner or operator must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate that the overall emissions average determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the facility will not result in greater risk or hazard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to human health or the environment than would occur by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complying with the rule requirements at each individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission point.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the development of the proposed rule for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> off-site waste and recovery operations source category, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA considered including an emissions averaging approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the statutory requirements of the CAA do not allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions averaging between different sources. As explained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in section II.D of this notice, the EPA is proposing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source for the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be each emission point type (e.g., each tank, container).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, using a facility-wide emissions averaging approach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i.e., establishing a single average organic HAP emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level for the entire facility) is not appropriate for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, independent of the definition of source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the EPA selects for this rulemaking, the nature of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> day-to-day operations at off-site waste and recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations facilities complicates and discourages the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application of an emissions averaging approach to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NESHAP. At an off-site waste and recovery operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility, wastes or recoverable materials are often received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from many different generators. The quantities of materials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received from these generators can vary from very small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amounts ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , a single 55-gallon drum of a particular waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or recoverable material) to very large amounts ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multiple truck or railcar loads of a single material type).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, the quantities of waste or recoverable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material received as well as the compositions and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations of organic HAP in these materials are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constantly changing over short periods of time ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , daily,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weekly). On a given day an off-site waste and recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations facility can receive wastes or recoverable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials from one group of generators and the next day the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility can receive new wastes or recoverable materials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from a completely different group of generators. Because of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this operating mode, it is difficult to predict the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantities and organic HAP characteristics of the waste or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recoverable materials that will be received at an off-site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste and recovery operations facility over a future period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of time. Thus, operating the off-site waste and recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations facility so not to exceed a specific overall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average organic HAP emissions level would require the owner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or operator to rigorously monitor and regulate the flow of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes and recoverable materials into the facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> throughout the entire averaging period used to determine the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified average emissions limit. This would require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sampling each load of incoming material, updating the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions averaging calculations, and possibly restricting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantities of waste or recoverable material with certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organic HAP compositions that enter the facility during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remainder of the averaging period to ensure the facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not exceed the specific average organic HAP emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit. The EPA believes this would be a complex and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resource intensive task for off-site waste and recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations facility owners and operators to implement and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for regulatory agency personnel to monitor and enforce.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA decided not to allow emissions averaging in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule for the off-site waste and recovery operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source category because such an approach is not appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for this source category. The EPA requests comments on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feasibility of applying emissions averaging to the off-site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste and recovery operations source category and requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information and data that would be necessary to support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development and implementation of an emissions averaging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

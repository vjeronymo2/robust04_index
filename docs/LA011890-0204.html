			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> RAIL TRANSIT RUNS ON CASH, OFFICIALS LEARN  </P> <P> Bright images of sleek monorail trains traveling between -- and within --  gleaming office towers excited a gathering of city, county and regional  officials here Wednesday, but their enthusiasm was tempered by the reality that  the success of rail transit in Orange County will depend on public support and  money.  </P> <P> "This is much more of an art than a science," transportation consultant Alan  Wulkan cautioned the more than 70 people who attended the briefing on two  ongoing, countywide rail transit studies.  </P> <P> The briefing, sponsored by the Orange County Transportation Commission, was  held at the Garden Grove Community Center.  </P> <P> One study, aimed at planning commuter or regional passenger train service along  the Los Angeles-to-San Diego route currently served by Amtrak, is being  conducted by Irvine-based Fluor Daniel Corp. at a cost of $238,000. The second  study, actually a plan for countywide rail transit in the year 2010 and beyond,  is being conducted by the Los Angeles-based firm of PBQ&amp;D at a cost of  $400,000.  </P> <P> The Transportation Commission held Wednesday's briefing to invite city, county  and regional officials to participate in the two studies, which will be  completed within 18 months.  </P> <P> Five central Orange County cities are already are discussing the possibility of  a monorail system. Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young, a leader in that effort,  cautioned that while the commission's countywide planning perspective is  necessary and desirable, it shouldn't "delay or dampen, or in any way hold back  the entrepreneurial effort on the part of one or more cities."  </P> <P> A slide show of monorails, skyway people movers and other forms of rail transit  in places such as Disney World, Detroit and Miami was screened, while  PBQ&amp;D's Wulkan carefully pointed out that many key issues, such as  development densities, financing, and links to other forms of transportation  must be considered.  </P> <P> During a question-and-answer period, members of the audience, which included  mayors and council members from many Orange County cities, pointed out that  rail transit is a popular concept these days because of near-paralysis on the  freeways. But they said they also were worried that some people will be put off  if they have to live near a rail station that does not blend in with their  communities.  </P> <P> Asked how people will be persuaded to ride a rail transit system once it's  built, Wulkan said: "Marketing."  </P> <P> After the meeting, La Palma Mayor Eva Miner said OCTC's rail effort is  praiseworthy, but added that financing will be up to taxpayers.

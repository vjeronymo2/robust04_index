			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara--The day after Prime Minister Tansu Ciller  disclosed her bitter austerity program, official statistics  revealed that Turkey's domestic debt stock at the end of 1993  reached an all-time high of TL [Turkish Lira] 356.5 trillion, or  27 percent of the gross national product (GNP).    The debt stock had accounted for a lower 23.3 percent of the  GNP in 1992.    The Treasury said on Wednesday [6 April] that the government  during the entire year of 1993 incurred fresh borrowing worth TL  577.7 trillion but repaid some of this, leaving a net borrowing  amount of TL 160.6 trillion.    It said the debt stock rose by a radical 83.6 percent from  TL  194.2 trillion at the end of 1992.    The original program target was a debt stock of TL 251.7  trillion for the entire 1993, but this had been exceeded as  early as last August.</p>

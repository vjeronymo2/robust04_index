			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / PM under pressure to promise referendum on Europe Mr John Major faces growing pressure to promise a referendum on the next step of European integration in an attempt to unite the Conservative party and bolster his faltering leadership. Leading figures on both sides of the party believe a pledge to hold a referendum on issues such as a single European currency may be the only way to bridge divisions among Tory MPs. Mr Major is understood to believe that promising a referendum now on unspecified changes in the European Union which may be proposed after the EU intergovernmental conference in 1996 is fraught with difficulties. But he has not ruled it out if the crisis deepens. However, reports that the Liberal Democrats may back demands for a referendum on proposals for a closer union also increase pressure on the prime minister. There were clear signs of division within the cabinet over such a referendum. Two ministers with anti-European credentials did not rule out the prospect, but Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, came out heavily against it. Mr Michael Howard, the Home Secretary, said that in the run up to the European elections he did not want to talk about the changes to European institutions that will be considered in 1996. Mr John Redwood, the Welsh Secretary, also said the government should decide whether to hold a referendum after proposals for a single currency are finalised. But Mr Clarke, a committed pro-European, said the idea could only confuse voters. He told BBC Radio's The World This Weekend: 'The difficulty, as other countries found during the Maastricht debate, is that when you have a referendum, people do not answer the question in front of them.' Mr Clarke's views contrast with some pro-European backbenchers who believe a promise to hold such a referendum is the only way to heal the division over Europe. Some MPs also believe that Mr Michael Heseltine, the Trade Secretary, could promise a referendum as a way of uniting MPs around his candidacy if there were a Tory leadership contest this autumn. Speculation over a referendum pledge coincided with renewed Tory criticism of the way ministers had conducted themselves in last week's local elections. Mr David Mellor, the former Heritage Secretary, strongly attacked Mr Michael Portillo, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, and hinted that he should be a victim in any cabinet reshuffle. Mr Mellor said Mr Portillo 'need not have . . . made a mess' by creating controversy over Europe in the last week of the campaign.

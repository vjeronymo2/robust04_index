			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WINNING LANDMARK JOB BIAS SUIT LEAVES A MIXED LEGACY;  </P> <P> SCHOOLS: ONE WOMAN CREDITS THE CASE FOR BEING MADE A PRINCIPAL, THE OTHER  BLAMES IT FOR IMPENDING DEMOTION FROM ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL.  </P> <P> Irena Szewiola and Pat Joyce were an unlikely pair of heroines. Joyce, a former  gym teacher, and Szewiola, a former typing and shorthand teacher, were the sort  of 1950s career women who had been taught that to get along you had to go  along.  </P> <P> But in 1980, Szewiola and Joyce decided to stop going along. The two women --  who for years could not advance beyond assistant principal -- filed a landmark  lawsuit seeking to force the Los Angeles Unified School District to promote  more women. It was an action that gambled their own careers on behalf of 20,000  colleagues. The class-action lawsuit charged the district with discrimination  against women seeking to advance from the classroom into the ranks of  management.  </P> <P> A decade later, the women look back at the battle from different vantage  points. Joyce is a successful principal at Columbus Junior High School in  Canoga Park. She credits the suit for her job. But Szewiola (pronounced  Chevy-ola), now an assistant principal at Francis Polytechnic High School in  Sun Valley, is about to be demoted and believes her role in the suit is  responsible for her downfall.  </P> <P> Like the women themselves, the agreement that settled the lawsuit in June,  1980, has met with mixed success. There has been a huge increase in the number  of female principals and administrators in the nation's second largest school  district. But men still command the highest posts.  </P> <P> The percentage of elementary school principals who are women went from 35% in  the fall of 1980 to about 65% now. The percentage of female principals at  junior high schools went from 16% to 42% and at high schools from 8% to 37%  during the same 10 years.  </P> <P> In the fall of 1980 there were no women working as principals at the district's  39 adult schools and occupational centers. Now there are 11. School board  member Roberta Weintraub, when she asked at the time why there were none, said  she was told by district officials that women could not run the schools, which  offer classes at night, because "they had to be home to cook dinner."  </P> <P> Weintraub, who is credited with pushing a recalcitrant board to settle the  lawsuit, said the changes since then, though significant, have yet to meet her  ultimate goal: appointment of a female superintendent.  </P> <P> Despite changes in the lower management ranks, district Supt. Leonard Britton  and his top three deputies are men, as are most of the third tier of school  district bosses, known as associate superintendents.  </P> <P> Critics of the settlement, called a consent decree, say the yearly promotional  goals set by the district were not needed, that growing numbers of women would  have been promoted to top positions anyway.  </P> <P> But Tom Hunt, one of several lawyers who worked in behalf of the women, said  statistics at the time showed clearly that although a majority of classroom  teachers were women, most of their bosses were men.  </P> <P> "When we put the facts together we determined that the people doing the  promoting were primarily all male," said Hunt, who had experience with similar  discrimination cases. "Not surprisingly, if you are a white male, unless your  consciousness has been raised, there is a tendency to pick people who are  similar to you."  </P> <P> Richard K. Mason, one of the attorneys who worked on the case for the school  district, said his side had statistics of its own. The district could show that  it had not engaged in discrimination because women were being promoted in  roughly the same proportion as they applied for the jobs, he said.  </P> <P> "But admittedly in the early 1970s the application rate of women for many jobs  was low," said Mason, who still works for the district.  </P> <P> Richard Grey, who worked with Hunt on the case and now works in the Los Angeles  city attorney's office, said the reason was women were discouraged from  applying because they believed the effort was worthless. Many at the district  believed that "women were happier as teachers," therefore very few applied for  administrative jobs, he said.  </P> <P> Although both sides believed they would win in trial, they agreed it would be  costly and time-consuming.  </P> <P> After several months of negotiations, the two sides agreed on a settlement in  which the district promised to promote women at the same rates that they  applied for jobs such as assistant principal and higher. The district also  agreed to annual goals of having at least 40% of those applicants be women,  targets that have been met every year since then.  </P> <P> "The time was ripe," said Mason, speaking of the district's settlement  agreement, which was eventually approved by a federal judge.  </P> <P> In April, the school board indicated that it would extend the terms of the  consent decree after its expiration in June. Board members Jackie Goldberg and  Rita Walters asked this month that its provisions be extended to women working  for the district in jobs other than teaching.  </P> <P> Walters -- the only other current board member who was also on the board at the  time the consent decree was signed -- said the agreement was significant.  </P> <P> "But for the most part it would have probably happened anyway because of events  external to the district," Walters said. "There was a strong push for women's  rights that, as far as I am concerned, was long overdue."  </P> <P> Weintraub, who was and remains a political adversary of Walters on the board,  came to the same conclusion following a meeting with district women who let  loose with years of accumulated complaints. Weintraub found parallels in her  own life at the time.  </P> <P> "I was expected to be home and God forbid I didn't have dinner on the table,"  said Weintraub, a conservative who less than a year earlier had been elected to  the board based on her opposition to mandatory busing. "The whole issue hit  home for me and became overwhelming. No one was going to hold me down any  longer."  </P> <P> Szewiola and Joyce attended the meeting with Weintraub. The following month  they sought legal help to prepare their lawsuit.  </P> <P> Joyce had been an assistant principal for 18 years, placing several times near  the top of the promotion list. But in every instance, a man got the job.  </P> <P> "I didn't know why I was being passed over," said Joyce, 63. "It seemed they  used all kinds of excuses."  </P> <P> Shortly after settlement of the lawsuit, Joyce finally made principal. She  credits the agreement for her promotion.  </P> <P> Szewiola's career is not headed for such a storybook ending. She was  transferred eight times before the lawsuit and has been moved five times since  the settlement. District officials say privately she is being demoted because  she cannot get along with people.  </P> <P> Szewiola, an administrator for 22 years, denies the charge and says the action  is in retaliation for her outspoken participation in the lawsuit.  </P> <P> "You can kill somebody with rumor and that is what they've done to me," said  Szewiola, 62.  </P> <P> The school district, through its attorney Mason, denies the charge.  </P> <P> Although Szewiola said she has not given up fighting to retain her position,  her chances are slim. She said she cannot afford to retire and therefore faces  the prospect of teaching a subject that no longer resembles anything like the  business courses she taught during the 1950s and 1960s.  </P> <P> "In 22 years shorthand has been replaced by word processing and I am not  trained in word processing," Szewiola said. "But I must go back to the  classroom because I have to work."  </P> <P> Phyllis Cheng, who for several years was director of the district's sex equity  commission, said she believes Szewiola is being punished partly because of her  strong personality and tendency to lock horns with superiors, attributes that  district officials use to label her a troublemaker.  </P> <P> "Whether they like her or not, she has done something heroic for all women in  the district," said Cheng, who no longer works for the district. "The sad part  is that nobody comes up to her and says, 'I appreciate you putting your name on  that suit and making it better for the rest of us.'

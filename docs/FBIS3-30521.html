			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Maja Narbutt from Vilnius: "Poland-Lithuania: </F> Fifth and Last Round"]    [Text] The next round of Polish-Lithuanian negotiations on  the state treaty will be held in three weeks. Lech Walesa's  special envoy, who on Thursday [3 February] spoke in Vilnius  with [Lithuanian President] Algirdas Brazauskas for the second  time, said optimistically that it will be "the fifth, and  probably last round."    Andrzej Zakrzewski, secretary of state in the President's  Office, suggests that the controversial issues which kept  delaying negotiations on the treaty have in fact already been  resolved.    The bone of contention was first of all the evaluation of  historical events, especially the so-called Zeligowski mutiny  and its consequences. For over a year, the Lithuanians firmly  rejected Polish suggestions that the evaluation of the past  should be left to historians. On Thursday in Vilnius, it was  established that part of this declaration pertaining to the  evaluation of the past would constitute the treaty's preamble.  Different parts of it will be included in the speeches of the  Polish and Lithuanian presidents, who will deliver them when the  treaty is signed. However, Andrzej Zakrzewski added that "this  is what will probably happen." The final decisions will be made  during the fifth round of negotiations, held in Warsaw. His  statement suggests that the Polish side decided that the  formulations proposed on 3 February in Vilnius, concerning the  evaluation of the past, are acceptable.</p>

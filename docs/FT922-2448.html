			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Lep pension fund has Pounds 900,000 shortfall after property deal THE PENSION fund of Lep Group is showing a Pounds 900,000 shortfall following a property deal last year with the freight-forwarding and security company. Trustees of Lep Group's pension fund have written to members telling them of the shortfall. They have calculated that if the pension fund and group had been wound up in January benefits for present employees were only 88 per cent covered. Transfers out of the pension fund by former employees have been suspended. Last June the trustee company agreed to pay Pounds 12.4m for Coombe Hill House, just as Lep's problems began to emerge when off-balance sheet property finance came on balance sheet and the company's debt rose to more than Pounds 400m. Profits collapsed and a standstill agreement was signed with its banks. Coombe Hill House has now been valued at only Pounds 8.5m. Lep blames the continued weak property market. The deal represented a high proportion of the pension fund's Pounds 28m of assets at a time when self investment has been criticised in the pension industry. Mr Paul Baines, director of Charterhouse, Lep's financial adviser, said: 'I am sure that this was not the first case of a pension fund buying assets from the company.' Lep had also agreed to increase its contribution significantly in order to eliminate the shortfall within two to three years. The group was now proposing that Pounds 180m of its Pounds 530m debts should be converted to equity. Details of the conversion have yet to be fixed, although the banks were likely to end up with a substantial portion of Lep's shares. Mr Baines said he hoped the reconstruction would be in place by next month.</p>

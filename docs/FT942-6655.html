			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Survey of Residential Property (9): The shining light that's an artist's holy grail - Studio living / A look at properties with space, shelter and light which may appeal to art and crafts people Studios are rarities in the property market. I mean real studios, not shoe-box studio flats which are little more than a tiny kitchen area and bathroom with a small living/sleeping/eating area dominated by a futon that is both sofa and bed. They resemble studios only in their open-plan design. The job of true studios (or ateliers) is to provide space - lots of it  - plus light and shelter for artists and craftspeople to work in. Often, they are so roomy that the artist also lives there - or cannot afford anywhere else to live. But room for art is their prime purpose. Large windows are essential, whether skylights or in the wall. Traditionally, they should face north to provide a steady, subdued light which the sun's daily cycle will not affect - a need that probably began with portraiture. But not everyone wants a steady light, says artist Jeff Clarke. For painting objects, a bright variable light is challenging - as it is for painting landscapes at different times. If you are a sculptor with shrieking electric drills, or a potter, or the work is smelly, Clarke advises moving away from a house. Old farm buildings are ideal if they have water and electricity. Barns have the space, and a cow shed (which will have drainage) makes a good potter's workshop with room to house the kiln. The ACME Housing Association, a registered charity founded in 1972, takes old industrial buildings for artists to use as work space. The buildings are in London - Brixton, Camden, Hackney and Stratford - apart from an old fishermen's net loft in Porthleven, Cornwall. Artists pay about Pounds 3.80-Pounds 4 per sq ft all in, or about Pounds 40 a week for 500 sq ft. This imaginative scheme has helped artists such as Helen Chadwick and Rachel Whiteread, the recent Turner Prize-winner. Now, ACME is looking for a large industrial building where it could offer both living and working space. Few studios keep their original proportions after conversion to bourgeois residential use. But artists and others continue to use those where Turner's students worked in Glebe Place, Chelsea SW3, off the King's Road in west London. Two are on offer from De Groot Collis. Above the front door of No 69 (price Pounds 795,000), Turner's name can be seen in relief red brick. No 54 costs Pounds 895,000. The same agent is selling 1 Mallord Street, SW3, where classical pianist Louis Kentner lived and played for 45 years. It has three double bedrooms and a 30ft-long studio. At Pounds 1.25m (down from Pounds 1.4m), this is a far cry from impoverished artists. No 28 Yeoman's Row, SW3, off Brompton Road and placed ideally to look after all spiritual, cultural and material needs - the Brompton Oratory, Victoria &amp; Albert museum and Harrods are nearby - is a double-fronted house with three splendid studios. The agent is Egerton, and the price for a 53-year lease (from Smith's Charity and, perhaps, enfranchiseable) is Pounds 775,000. No 6 Stratford Studios, W8, is an elegantly restored, late-19th century studio in a group off Stratford Road. It has three double bedrooms and costs Pounds 850,000 (from Strutt &amp; Parker). The wooden floor of the studio room is in such good condition that you could never dare to drip paint on it. But it makes a superb house. No 404b Fulham Road, SW6 remains in use as an artist's studio with unpretentious, semi-open plan living space for one or two people and room for a possible extension. The glory of the garden is a fig tree, 300 years old and said to be the oldest and largest in England. A Tree Preservation Order protects it. The price for the Fig Tree Studio is Pounds 240,000 (from Aylesford). Farther out from central London is a studio at Eyot Green, W4, a side road off Chiswick Mall opposite Chiswick Eyot in the river Thames. (Walk along the mall and you have a fine view of the annual Oxford and Cambridge boat race.) Although it has two bedrooms and a bathroom on the ground floor, this is another proper studio with a huge space on the first floor where all of life can happen. Foxtons is selling it for Pounds 175,000.

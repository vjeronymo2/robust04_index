			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: HSBC tumbles International banking group HSBC Holdings won the dubious honour of being the day's worst performer among FT-SE 100 constituents as the market continued to reflect on Monday's interim figures. The shares tumbled 32 to 717p in trade of 5.1m, with Goldman Sachs, UBS and Morgan Stanley mentioned among brokers that advised investors to switch out of HSBC and into Standard Chartered, while other securities houses were said to have simply hung a straight 'sell' recommendation on the stock. HSBC reported a big increase in headline profits on Monday, but the market was surprised and disappointed by the sharp fall in dealing profits at the group's subsidiaries Midland Bank and Hongkong Bank. However, several brokers still see value in the shares and have recommended investors to buy the stock on weakness. Mr Ian Poulter at Yamaichi Securities continues to favour the stock and said investors should focus on 'the growth in income (other than dealing profits), particularly in the Asia Pacific region'. Paribas Capital Markets also remains positive on HSBC and said: 'The recent weakness in the shares is an excellent buying opportunity.' Standard Chartered closed 8 ahead at 258p after trade of 2.1m shares.</p>

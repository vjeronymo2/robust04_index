			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Savings Bonds Division moving to US Bureau of Public Debt The Treasury is moving its Savings Bonds Division into the Bureau of Public Debt and is eliminating several political appointments from the US Mint, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, said yesterday, AP-DJ adds. The restructuring steps are aimed at cutting bureaucracy and improving customer service, Mr Bentsen said in a press release. 'In both cases, we looked at the environment we're operating in and we said it's time to change. What made sense a long time ago doesn't make sense now.' Incorporating the Savings Bonds division into the Bureau of Public Debt will help improve the marketing strategy for bonds, he said.</p>

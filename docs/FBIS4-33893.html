			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Oscar Navarro Cuevas from the "ACIR Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Text] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari met privately  with Fidel Castro, president of the Cuban Councils of State and  Ministers. Cuban President Fidel Castro accompanied the Mexican  president to the Protocol House of the Cuban Government where  Salinas rested a few minutes before beginning his meeting with  his host. Prior to this, at the Jose Marti International  Airport, Salinas reviewed a Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces  honor guard.    Salinas also did something unexpected. He walked to where a  group of people were standing behind the security line and  personally greeted them. The Cuban and Mexican national anthems  were played during the official welcome ceremony at the airport.  Salinas stood with his arms down while President Castro saluted  with his right hand.    The presidents left the airport in a limousine adorned with  the Cuban flag on the right side and the Mexican flag on the  left. The limousine drove down the main runway from where a  huge placard with Salinas' face could be seen as well as other  placards reading: Long Live the Friendship Between the Peoples  of Cuba and Mexico, and Welcome, President Salinas de Gortari.    All along the route to the Protocol House were placards  reading: Long Live the Friendship Between the Peoples of Marti  and Juarez, and Long Live the Unbreakable Friendship between  Mexico and Cuba. Cuban radio stations carried live coverage of  the Mexican president's arrival in Cuba and his arrival at the  Cuban Government House. Here, the two presidents met privately.  At the end of the meeting, Castro hosted a lunch for the  Mexican president. After lunch, the two presidents met again to  discuss the many topics on the bilateral agenda.    According to statements by Castro during an interview, the  most important subject discussed was attracting Mexican capital  to Cuba. While at the Protocol House, Castro told the press his  country's foremost relations with the hemisphere are precisely  with Mexico.    During the meeting with the Mexican press, Castro also  talked  about the situation in Chiapas, the blockade Cuba is  experiencing, the recent incidents in Mexico, and his life.  Castro said the incidents that have occurred in Mexico saddened  and pained him.    [Begin recording] [Navarro Cuevas] I have seen with concern  and pain the problems Mexico has experienced, Fidel Castro,  president of the Councils of State and Ministers, said.  Interviewed shortly before the arrival of Mexican President  Salinas, Castro said he would not be a realist if he were to say  all is rose-colored in Mexico, especially in light of the  situation it is experiencing. The Cuban leader explained,  however, Mexico is not an isolated case; he said similar things  are happening in other countries as a result of the lost decade  [decada perdida]. Regarding Chiapas State, Castro said:    [Castro] You have asked me a very difficult question. Why?  Because it is a question that concerns Mexican domestic affairs,  and I am not the one to analyze those things. I do believe,  however, [words indistinct] social problems and conflicts, but  the situation is not only a Mexican situation; it is a situation  that affects the whole hemisphere. [Words indistinct] the  famous lost decade [words indistinct] problems. For example,  [words indistinct] per capita is the same as 16 years ago.  [Words indistinct] many social and economic problems that have  accumulated. I would say those are factors that cause an [word  indistinct] imbalance and create problems as the ones we see in  Chiapas.    [Navarro Cuevas] Regarding the U.S. economic blockade  against  Cuba, a blockade that has lasted more than 30 years, Castro said  it is the oldest blockade in history and it has been confronted  by the longest resistance. He said investments are slowly  returning to Cuba and are being consolidated on the island.  Castro said if he were born again, he would do the same all over  again, only better. Castro also said he would love to live more  than 100 years. When asked if he hoped to do more in his life,  Castro said he has been commander for more than 30 years. He  said this title was given to him in Mexico.    In conclusion, the president of the Councils of State and  Ministers said he is not a neoliberal and he would not talk  about that because some of the countries that will attend the  fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia,  would not like it, and those countries are his friends.

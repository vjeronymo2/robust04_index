			<p>BFN     [Text] Prosecutor General Magistrate Munif 'Uwaydat met  with Judge Joseph Furayhah, judicial investigator into the  Sayyidat al-Najat church at the Palace of Justice this morning.  Furayhah briefed 'Uwaydat on the investigation process of the  bombing of the church in Zuq Mikha'il.    After the meeting, Judge 'Uwaydat made a statement in which  he denied a report published by the newspaper AL-DIYAR yesterday  that he had exonerated the Lebanese Forces as an establishment  of the charge of bombing the Sayyidat al-Najat church. He said  the aforesaid newspaper's headlines differ from the article's  text. He noted that what he really had said was that a judicial  finding can only be decided on after completion of an  investigation and will be declared subsequently in an  indictment. He said that this rule pertains to the judicial  procedure mechanism and does not mean anyone has been cleared,  as the paper incorrectly concluded.    He regretted the use of his statement for narrow-minded  political purposes and as a pretext for a defense in the media  aimed at detouring the investigations from their natural course.  He noted that we need to continue the investigations in an  objective atmosphere and in strict secrecy free from distortions  of facts.</p>

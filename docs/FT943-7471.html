			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Underwriting profits It is hardly surprising that the Inland Revenue is examining whether sub-underwriting commissions received by pension funds can be brought into the tax net. A recent study for the Office of Fair Trading concluded that profits from underwriting were excessive. And, much as the pension fund industry protests that one-off disasters like the 1987 BP share sale can wipe out years of profits, to the outside world the business looks like money for old rope. Tax officials are unlikely to be put off by arguments that the sums of money are just not worth collecting. The issue will turn, in the first instance, on the almost theological question of whether pension funds are engaging in a trade when they sub-underwrite share issues. That, in turn, revolves around whether the activity is a regular or only an occasional source of profits. If the industry loses this point, it will fall back on the argument that, in sub-underwriting issues, it is effectively selling issuers put options. So any trading it is engaged in is option trading - an activity where it already has tax exemption. The industry's final line of defence will be that taxing sub-underwriting fees will push up the cost of capital. All other things being equal, taxing the commissions would tend to increase the cost of capital because sub-underwriters would put up their fees or leave the market. But, if profits are as high as most observers think, a tax could be easily accommodated without any adverse effect.</p>

			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Rump Yugoslavia dismisses 38 generals THE RUMP Yugoslav presidency yesterday purged the top ranks of the military establishment in a move which gives Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia, full control over the army. It also marks the final transformation of the Yugoslav forces into a Serbian army. The dismissal of 38 ex-communist generals and several admirals follows a two-month smear campaign in the state-run Serbian media of the army's performance in the war with Croatia and its failure to quash the republic's independence. The dismissals include General Blagoje Adzic, the acting defense minister, who 'officially resigned'. He has been replaced - as chief of staff - by General Zivota Panic. The defence ministry will be filled by a civilian. Tanjug, the Belgrade-based news agency, also reported the sacking of Gen Milutin Kukanjac, commander of the federal army forces in Bosnia, whose headquarters is in Sarajevo. The sackings allow middle-ranking, and younger Serb officers to run the army. These officers have little in common with their communist Yugoslav superiors whom they accuse of conducting a 'soft' campaign in Slovenia and Croatia after both republics declared independence in June. The purging of top army ranks will pave the way for the withdrawal of the Yugoslav federal army from Sarajevo, and those regions of Bosnia not controlled by Serb irregulars. The revamped Yugoslav federation, consisting of Serbia and its close ally Montenegro, have ordered its citizens who are soldiers, to withdraw from Bosnia. But diplomats yesterday said this was cosmetic because it leaves behind 40,000 Bosnian Serbs and all the army material. The purge coincides with renewed clashes in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina, and an agreement between Serb and Croat leaders to carve up the newly independent republic. The European Community yesterday denounced the plan which, besides leaving Bosnia's 2m Moslems without a homeland, undermines any attempts by the international community, and the UN to broker a peace in Bosnia. Radio Sarajevo reported fighting between Serb irregulars and Bosnian territorial defense in several regions of the capital. At least 500 people have been killed and over 450,000 forced to flee. Mr Marrack Goulding, the UN undersecretary, on a mission to assess the feasibility of deploying a peacekeeping force to Bosnia, condemned 'the indiscriminate and random shelling of civilian targets.'</p>

			<p>941108 FT  08 NOV 94 / Albanians reject new constitution: Referendum blocks president's attempt to increase his powers Albanian voters have overwhelmingly rejected a constitution drafted by President Sali Berisha which would have further shifted the balance of power from parliament to the already powerful presidency. Preliminary results indicate that more than 60 per cent of voters rejected it in a weekend referendum called by Mr Berisha in breach of the existing constitution. The revised communist-era document in force since 1991 reserves the right of drawing up and approving a new constitution to parliament. But Mr Berisha, whose Democratic party won a landslide victory in the 1992 elections, has faced mounting opposition in parliament and within his own party for his increasingly autocratic style. As a result he has lost the ability to force legislation through parliament. Last month more than a third of MPs from the government party abstained in a parliamentary vote which deprived President Berisha of the majority needed to legalise a referendum by which he sought to by-pass parliament. The outcome of the vote is thus a striking confirmation of Albania's conversion to democracy after decades of dictatorial rule by Mr Enver Hoxha and his Communist party minions followed by only three years of multi-party politics. But it also marks a severe personal blow to Mr Berisha. The former heart surgeon presided over a spectacular economic recovery from the ruins of the bankrupt autarchic system inherited from 45 years of communist rule. However, he antagonised many former supporters by riding roughshod over parliament and by an increasingly personalised style of government. Rejection of the proposed constitution is expected to embolden the various opposition groups, including the former communist Socialist party whose leader Mr Fatos Nano was jailed for alleged corruption last year. It is also expected to encourage opposition parties, such as the Democratic Alliance led by Mr Gramoz Pashko, to patch up their feuds and press for early elections. But the electorate's refusal to endorse the new constitution, which would have given the president the power to appoint and dismiss the prime minister, appoint ministers and preside over the supreme court, will further delay Albania's entry into the Council of Europe. One of the requirements of entry is a legitimate, democratic constitution. But Albania also faces objections from Greece because of alleged discrimination against the ethnic Greek minority in the south.</p>

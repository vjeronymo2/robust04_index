			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Sell gold, IMF urged MR Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, yesterday suggested that the International Monetary Fund should sell some of its gold to help finance IMF assistance for the poorest developing nations. In his speech to the IMF's policy-making interim committee, Mr Lamont said he 'would not rule out some modest sales of IMF gold to fund at least part' of a successor to the IMF's extended structural adjustment facility (ESAF) which provides funds at token interest rates to poor developing nations carrying out economic reforms. The ESAF totals SDRs6bn (about Pounds 5.5bn) and is due to expire next November. The industrialised countries that provide the fund have so far been unable to agree on how to finance a successor, largely because of the budgetary constraints on most of them. British officials said preliminary discussions had been held in the IMF board of directors about whether to sell some of the Fund's gold. Although Mr Lamont put forward the idea in his speech yesterday, he is not committed to it, they said. 'He wants to see the issue explored,' one added. One suggestion put forward by the British Treasury was that the IMF should sell between 10m and 15m ounces of gold over 10 years to provide about half the funds needed for new ESAF funds. Because ESAF costs only build up gradually, the gold sales would not need to begin until 1996. Britain is keen for the international community to agree on a successor to ESAF because it believes it is a good policy instrument for spreading sound economic policies in developing countries. The UK also has close ties with many of the countries that use ESAF funds, particularly in Africa. The IMF sold gold in 1976 to set up a trust fund that was a precursor of ESAF and also provided finance for developing countries. However, the present IMF management has been hostile to further gold sales. Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, has described the IMF's gold as the 'jewel of the family'. The IMF's gold holdings amount to 103.44m ounces and are valued conservatively at 35 special drawing rights an ounce in the IMF's accounts. A substantial obstacle to IMF sales of gold is the condition that they must be approved by 85 per cent of the total voting power of the Fund's members.</p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Travel: Why things are stirring in Amman - Jordan's capital is transforming 'WHAT'S THERE to do in Amman?' is a question often heard among Jordanians (and expatriates) as they ponder how to while away their evenings in the kingdom's sleepy capital. Whether they are cruising the streets of up-town Sheisani in their new Mercedes-Benz or smoking hubbly-bubbly from a discoloured water pipe in a down-town cafe, the discussions are nearly always the same. Locals complain that Amman is a 'village' compared with Beirut, Cairo, Damascus and Baghdad before the Gulf crisis. They moan that there is only one nightclub 'where no one ever goes', a handful of bars (three, according to most right-on Jordanians), and a limited selection of restaurants. Boredom, frustration and nostalgia for a different life or better place are common among residents of Amman. Yet things are changing. Over the past few years the city has been transformed irrevocably. A construction boom has expanded the once-small dusty outpost east of the Jordan River to a sprawling urban complex which continues to eat up the surrounding desert. And the arrival of some 350,000 Palestinians has diversified Amman's already multifarious society. Thousands of Iraqis have also sought refuge in Amman away from Saddam's iron fist and Iraq's ravaged economy. And, as residents are constantly reminded in Amman, Jordan now has democracy. To a tourist whose Jordanian itinerary will invariably include the Nabataean city of Petra, the Dead Sea, the desert at Wadi Rum and perhaps a few nights in Amman, changes to the capital's life have to be taken on trust. Even to Jordan's social moaners, the variety of what is available has to be pointed out. Culturally, Amman is breaking new ground in art and theatre. Most notable are the Iraqi and Syrian artists whose exhibitions are advertised regularly in the newspapers. There is an increasing number of new galleries where prices are cheap. And an interest in contemporary regional art is slowly becoming fashionable among Amman's middle class. More dramatic is the effect of political change, which is causing a revolution in the kingdom's theatre. One group of local thespians, 'Ahlan Nabil and Hisham', has taken the process of political pluralism and freedom of speech to the stage with a nightly comedy that caricatures ministers, parliamentarians and even, cautiously, members of the royal household. Although still reeling from the shock of political satire, many Jordanians express hope that the democratisation process will release other forms of entertainment from the strait-jacket of the past. The poorly-attended local cinemas, for instance, still suffer from over-enthusiastic censors who strip the latest Hollywood blockbusters of nearly all scenes of tenderness, love, passion and lust. Those determined to find out what has been cut simply go to the nearest video shop and rent an uncensored version. Increased liberalisation, however, is far from guaranteed by the democratisation process. The Moslem Brotherhood has already attempted to push through a parliamentary bill to ban the sale of alcohol in the kingdom. Further, the brotherhood was almost successful in passing a law to segregate men and women in public swimming pools and gymnasiums. In concert with Amman's cultural and political changes, the city itself is undergoing an extensive facelift. A construction boom has added some 20,000 new buildings, including villas, mansions and palaces being built by returnees from the Gulf. A recent survey showed Amman to be the most expensive capital in the Arab world. Although there is a lack of cement to sustain the construction boom, Amman can no longer be described as a backwater. It is still not Cairo, Damascus or Baghdad. But give it another five years and even the socialites may not want to leave.</p>

			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Shake-up at Treasury as Burns succeeds Middleton MR JOHN MAJOR ruffled Whitehall's establishment feathers yesterday with the announcement that Sir Terence Burns is to replace Sir Peter Middleton as the permanent secretary to the Treasury. The appointment, triggered by Sir Peter's decision to switch to the private sector as a deputy chairman of Barclays Bank, signals the accession of a relative outsider to perhaps the most important job in Whitehall. Sir Terence has been in the Treasury since 1980 as the government's chief economic adviser but became a permanent civil servant only two years ago with his appointment as a second permanent secretary. He now takes a post which formally ranks second to Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary, but in many respects carries equal influence. The 47-year-old Sir Terence, a down-to-earth northerner who shares Mr Major's passion for soccer, has been closely associated with the government's economic policies since helping to frame the Medium Term Financial Strategy in 1980. His appointment was pressed by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, against the established convention that the job should have gone to a long-serving Whitehall insider. The Treasury expectation was that Sir Peter's replacement would be Mr Nigel Wickes, senior official responsible for overseas affairs. Mr Wickes is one of three second permanent secretaries - essentially deputies to Sir Peter. Mr Lamont, who has already upset Treasury traditionalists by choosing a relatively junior 30-year-old as his private secretary, insisted that Sir Terence was the best man for the job. That judgment was backed by Mr Major who established a close relationship with Sir Terence during his own chancellorship. Mr Major earlier showed his willingness to bypass Whitehall's carefully built promotions ladder when he appointed Mr Gus O'Donnell, a Treasury economist, as his Downing Street press officer. One minister with close contacts with the Treasury said last night: 'There will be plenty of elegant noses put out of joint, but this is the new regime.' Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor, was told of the promotion in advance because of Sir Terence's long association with the present government. It is thought that Mr Smith, who has met Sir Terence on several occasions and is known to like him, took the view that the new permanent secretary would accept Whitehall conventions and be happy to serve a Labour chancellor. One Labour official said: 'He has never advertised any political connection with the Tories.' The 57-year-old Sir Peter, whose move to Barclays will be delayed until November under the rules for outside appointments for civil servants, has been permanent secretary since 1983. On becoming third deputy chairman at Barclays, Sir Peter will take over one of the banks' toughest jobs. He is scheduled to become chairman of the bank's capital markets and investment banking operations. He will succeed Sir Martin Jacomb, the barrister brought in by Barclays in 1985 to mastermind the creation of its investment banking operations, Barclays de Zoete Wedd, at the time of the Big Bang reforms in the City. Sir Terence was told about his new job at the Treasury on Tuesday evening. He was said last night to be 'delighted' by the appointment. He was first appointed to the Treasury by Sir Geoffrey Howe, the former chancellor, from a career in research and economics consultancy at the London Business School. Until his appointment Sir Terence had never met Mrs Margaret Thatcher but the two were subsequently said to have got on well. Sir Terence has a reputation as a pragmatist in the area of economic theory, willing to change his mind when the occasion demands. In the late 1970s, he argued against Britain joining the European exchange rate mechanism, but in more recent years he has been a staunch advocate within the government of British entry - which took place in October last year. Sir Terence, a season-ticket holder at Queens Park Rangers, the London football club, relaxes on the golf course and by playing the recorder. He will receive a salary of Pounds 96,210, a Pounds 20,000 increase on his current pay. The Treasury is not appointing a successor to Sir Terence for the time being. The post of economic adviser will be filled on a temporary basis by Ms Rachel Lomax, Sir Terence's deputy. The unexpected resignation was announced yesterday of Mr Howard Macdonald, chairman and chief executive of NatWest Investment Bank, the troubled subsidiary of National Westminster Bank.

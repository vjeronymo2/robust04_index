			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from "The Regional Desk"] </F>   [Text] For much of the past decade, Southeast Asia's  economic growth has been the envy of the world. The region has  been held up as a model of development by the World Bank and its  success has led to a rethink of the way economies are managed in  the recession-mired West. In its recent annual survey, the Asian  Development Bank predicted the area's leading economies would  continue to crackle along at close to double-digit pace for at  least the next two years and perhaps until the end of the  decade. With a new World Trading Order coming into effect, China  emerging as the fourth global economic engine and old political  boundaries to trade being swept aside, prospects for the  Southeast Asian states have probably never looked brighter.    But as this promise of a seemingly unending boom unveils,  there are also more than a few clouds looming on the horizon.    Among the flashpoints for anxiety are the political upheaval  in Japan, a growing balance of payments deficits in Indonesia  and the Philippines, the trade dispute between China and the  United States and manpower shortages.    Possibly the most entrenched problem facing all the Asean  states is flagging foreign investor interest.    According to a survey by Merrill Lynch International Bank  released last month, 1993 data on direct foreign investment  largely confirms earlier suspicions that the sub-region's  attractiveness is slipping as foreign firms focussed more on  China, India and Vietnam. Other than the Philippines, which  reported a sharp 85 percent jump in investments to $529 million  in 1993, the other three developing economies of Southeast  Asia--Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia--all registered declines  in approved investments for the second consecutive year.    Thailand and Malaysia were the worst hit. Approvals for  foreign equity fell 68.1 percent to $233 million in Thailand,  and dropped by over 60 percent to $912 million in Malaysia.    Indonesia experienced a more modest four percent fall in  approvals to $7.72 billion in the same period.    Much of the surge in foreign investment, which fuelled the  Southeast Asian boom in the early 1980s was driven by the need  of Japan and other nations, hit by appreciation of their  currencies, to maintain export markets abroad.    "With diminishing importance of low-cost labour as a key  investment criteria, and the emergence of big domestic markets  like China and India, Southeast Asian nations will need to  develop a new set of comparative advantages to revive investor  interest," the Merrill Lynch report said.    Finance analysts expect the next wave of foreign investment  into Southeast Asia to target the services industries if host  governments are prepared to lay out the welcome mat. This would  mean more conventional ways to attract investments such as more  business-friendly policies, cutting red tape and ensuring a good  operating climate supported by strong infrastructure, bankers  say.    For many foreign investors, the objective now is to seek  access to domestic markets. But investment laws in most Asean  nations, particularly Indonesia and Malaysia, are only liberal  on permissible foreign equity if the bulk of production is for  export.    By comparison, China and India allow majority-owned foreign  ventures in a wide range of industries, and the two countries  are reaping the benefits of their more liberal laws. Investment  approvals for China last year rose by more than 385 percent to  $58.12 billion in 1993. In India, they jumped 93.7 percent to  $2.91 billion.  <H5>  Infrastructure Woes </H5>   In addition to the requirements of the private sector there  is an even greater need within the region for investment to  address heavy infrastructure shortcomings if growth is to be  secured, bankers and analysts say.    The ADB estimates that Asia--excluding Japan--will need  nearly one trillion dollars in the next decade for  infrastructure such as roads and power plants telecommunications  and railways to maintain economic growth.    Urging the region to raise spending on basic development by  40 percent the ADB warned in its annual report that "any lag in  the supply of infrastructure will undoubtedly slow down  development over time, even if all other factors are favourable".    Power and transport needed most new spending. Each sector  required $300-350 billion in investment, telecommunications $150  billion and water supply and sanitation up to $100 billion by  the year 2000.    The sheer size of the amount of money needed will require  governments, many who are already pressed by growing budget  deficits, to look past traditional sources of capital such as  the World Bank and the ADB.    "It is becoming apparent that our needs will outstrip the  resources of these institutions. We must turn to private capital  providers," Indonesia's Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad said at  the recent Apec Finance Ministers meeting in Honolulu.    But while regional governments are aware of the need for  long-term investment funds, many fear that real flows of private  capital, and in particular speculative "hot" money into stock  markets will lead to instability. They argue that at the moment  there are no guarantees on the nature or direction of capital  flows except regulation.    The investor economies, such as the United States and Europe  argue that regulation does little to attract capital. Washington  was particularly active at the Apec finance minister's meeting  pressing Asian economies to further open their financial markets.    But with financial services excluded from the Uruguay Round  accord which was signed in Marrakesh earlier this month, Asian  nations have won some breathing space to resist Western demands  for further liberalisation.    Early indicators suggest that in the interim they are  cautiously taking steps to remedy the problem. Southeast Asian  capital market regulators agreed earlier this month to set up a  forum to evolve common procedures for tapping overseas funds and  beef up enforcement of laws governing their fledgling markets.    Thailand granted offshore status to 34 foreign banks in  March  last year. Asean countries are also looking at sources closer to  home to raise capital. The Kuala Lumpur based Asean Institute,  which was launched in 1991 as a private sector initiative to  promote closer economic ties among the six member countries  announced plans last week to launch a 1-million ringgit (US$40  million) investment fund next month that will specialize in  Southeast Asian economies.    Singapore, traditionally an investor in established  capitalist economies, is targeting developing Asian nations for  20-30 percent of its reserve capital.    Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said Singapore would be looking  at Vietnam, India and even Burma for regional investment  opportunities, but primarily to China.  <H5>  Changing Economic Landscape </H5>   While the rapid emergence of China as an economic power has  diverted foreign investment funds from Southeast Asia, the Asean  states are also ideally positioned to profit from the giant's  growth.    "China took up the slack of the stimulus from advanced  countries," Lawrence Krause of the Pacific Economic Cooperation  Council [PECC] said at the forum's 10th international general  meeting in Kuala Lumpur in March.    "China's imports have grown by more than 25 percent in the  last two years and a growing share of imports are coming from  the PECC countries," he said.    Access to the huge internal markets of China and India,  which  have a combined population of two billion, is expected to help  maintain Southeast Asia's dynamism and reduce its vulnerability  to adverse trends in markets in the industrial world.    But in the short term, the rapid growth of the Chinese  economy -- a world leading 13 percent last year -- poses  problems of its own.    China's sizzling growth is widely viewed as unsustainable  and  the government, wrestling with the social problems of runaway  inflation and the spiralling costs of domestic investment, is  expected to slam on the monetary brakes soon. Such action could  lead to a drastic decline in economic activity.    "With the Pacific region so dependent upon the economic  outcome in China, there is much concern that an extreme cannot  be avoided," Krause said.    Adding to concerns about China, is Washington's threat to  strip the country of preferential trade status unless it  improves its human rights record. If carried through, the move  would affect billions of dollars worth of exports and trigger a  trade war that could shave several growth points off many of the  economies in Asia. A similarly bitter dispute between Washington  and Tokyo over access for US companies to Japanese markets could  also have a destabilizing impact on economies in the region.    Japan, already hampered by a strong yen, structural  imbalances and balance sheet adjustment after declines in equity  and real estate prices, is just beginning to show signs of  recovery from its most serious recession since the last world  war. A rupture in trade ties with the United States would be  devastating to its weak recovery and damaging to its trading  partners. In 1993, for the first time, Japanese trade within the  region was greater than that with the United States. The US and  Japanese economies are so heavily interdependent, however, that  any fallout between the trading giants would have serious  repercussions with its smaller trading partners.  <H5>  Aids and Social Problems </H5>   While economic growth has spawned a growing middle class,  Asia's success hides the largest concentration of poor in the  world.    The ADB's usual optimism was tempered this year by concern  over unchecked population growth, urban poverty, environmental  decline and the spectre of an uncontrolled Aids epidemic among  Asia's teeming billions.    The growing Aids epidemic could force nations to change  their  development priorities towards greater efforts to reduce  poverty, the bank said.    Regional bankers also note shortages in skilled and  semi-skilled labour and political instability in Indonesia and  Thailand as areas which could help prevent the Southeast Asian  states from making their apparent date with development.</p>

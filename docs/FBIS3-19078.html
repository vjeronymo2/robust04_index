A statement after the four-and-one-half-hour meeting said  that the officials from the four countries reviewed the  implementation of Operation Provide Comfort II and the situation  in northern Iraq.    Representatives to the meeting were Deputy Foreign Minister  Ozdem Sanberk, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for European  and Canadian Affairs Stephen Oxman, British Assistant  Undersecretary for Middle East Affairs Michael Burton and French  Foreign Minister for North Africa and Middle East Affairs Denis  Bauchard.    "The sides expressed satisfaction with their ongoing  cooperation, which deters the renewal of fighting and provides a  framework in which humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people in the  north can be met," the statement said.    The statement read by Sanberk called on the Iraqi Government  to remove all the economic restrictions and embargoes it imposed  on the northern Iraqi people.    "The participants reiterated their governments' commitment  to  the preservation of the independence, unity and territorial  integrity of Iraq -- principles on which relevant UN Security  Council resolutions are based, and which reflect the common  stand of the international community," it said, also stressing  that they "reaffirmed their determined opposition to all acts  and efforts that may lead to the division and dismemberment of  Iraq."    The parties in the meeting repeated their strong  condemnation  of terrorism and their "full support for Turkey's right of  self-defense against the acts of violence of separatist terror  organization PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]."    The statement added that the sides also emphasized that the  territory of Iraq should not be a safe haven for the terrorists.    Concerning the economic losses Turkey suffered because of  the  embargo on Iraq, the statement said France, Great Britain and  the United States reitrate their appreciation for Turkey's  attitude during and in the aftermath of the Gulf crisis and  recognized the continuing heavy economic burden on Turkey.    "They will consult further for ways and means for  alleviating  that burden," the statement said.</p>

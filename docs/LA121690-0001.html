			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW A VAIN LITTLE MAN SAVED ENGLAND;  </P> <P> TRAFALGAR COUNTDOWN TO BATTLE, 1803-1805 BY ALAN SCHOM (ATHENEUM: $24.96; 421  PP., ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> Of perhaps only one man can it be truly said: He saved England. Yet Horatio,  Lord Nelson, the vain little man whose statue stands atop a tall pillar in  London's Trafalgar Square, is deserving of that accolade, for with inferior  numbers of men, ships and guns, he crushingly defeated in a single great battle  the combined fleets of France and Spain, and in so doing he saved Britain from  a near-certain invasion by Napoleon's armies.  </P> <P> The Battle of Trafalgar (Oct. 21, 1805), was indeed the "greatest British naval  victory in history." Although often treated as an isolated naval engagement, it  actually was the culmination of the British Royal Navy's 29-month campaign to  thwart Napoleon's elaborate invasion plans.  </P> <P> Schom, drawing upon both French and British sources, has here placed the battle  in its proper historical perspective. In the process, he has given full credit  to Adm. Sir William Cornwallis (younger brother of the general who surrendered  to Washington at Yorktown), a modest man who deserved, but failed to receive,  as much credit as did the honors-avid Nelson for the ruination of Napoleon's  schemes.  </P> <P> Previous historians have overlooked or disparaged the enormous achievements of  this exceptional officer, but it was Cornwallis, the "unobtrusive hero," who  commanded the Channel Fleet, and it was through his mastery of naval strategies  that Britain was able to control the English Channel for more than two years  before the Battle of Trafalgar.  </P> <P> In all seasons, Cornwallis' ships successfully blockaded the French and then  the Spanish ports as well. Not only were the French and Spanish fleets rendered  otiose, but Napoleon's great armada of 2,343 transports, built at enormous  expense to carry 167,500 men across the English Channel, was forced to lay idle  and useless in its ports.  </P> <P> It was Cornwallis who created and sent to do battle with the "Combined Fleet"  of France and Spain the British fleet commanded by the "more flamboyant and  charismatic Nelson." Never recognized nor rewarded for his singular  achievements, Cornwallis was, in fact, relieved of his command soon after  Trafalgar, and put permanently ashore.  </P> <P> Schom also gives full credit to William Pitt, who became prime minister in May,  1804, for it was he who raised a mighty army to fight on the beaches should the  French invade and, more important, reinvigorated a Royal Navy that had become  run-down and demoralized by neglect.  </P> <P> Of particular interest is the author's full account of the French side of the  naval campaign: the unique problems they faced and the extraordinary  personalities involved. Foremost, of course, was Napoleon, declared emperor on  May 18, 1804.  </P> <P> To say that Napoleon was a difficult man to serve under would be a monumental  understatement. He never understood naval affairs and he was given to towering  rages when his admirals refused to obey his commands or were incapable of  following them. His orders, sometimes capricious, frequently changed too  quickly to be carried through. He devised no fewer than seven separate plans  for the invasion of England; none was executed.  </P> <P> It must be admitted that the behavior of some of the French admirals,  particularly that of the aristocratic Vice Adm. Pierre-Charles Silvestre de  Villeneuve, would have driven even a mild-tempered leader to distraction.  Villeneuve, full of excuses for not sailing when ordered, deliberately  disobeyed Napoleon's direct orders. Even with superior ships in superior  numbers, he lacked confidence in his ability to defeat the British, and when he  finally did put to sea from Cadiz it was only because he had learned that his  replacement was on the way. In the battle off Cape Trafalgar that followed, his  orders were so erratic that he baffled not only his own admirals and captains  but Nelson as well.  </P> <P> Schom, a former professor of European and French history, has the rare ability  to describe naval affairs and naval battles in words readily understood by  landlubbers. He also obligingly spares the reader the burden of translating  French quotations. Aided by some simple and excellent drawings, his  descriptions of the several individual battles which compose the tumultuous  battle of Trafalgar are superb. This was no easy task, for not only were the  movements of the ships often complex but, to add to the confusion, engaged in  the battle were both French and British ships named Surefire, and both a  British and a French ship namedNeptune and a Spanish Neptuno. Both Nelson and  Villeneuve had said that they wanted a "pell-mell battle," and the bloody  conflict that ensued certainly was that. The "Combined Fleet" of 33 ships --  six more ships of the line than Nelson could command -- carried 2,568 guns  compared Britain's 2,148; the French and Spanish ships were manned by nearly  30,000 men, while Nelson had but 17,000. The men on both sides fought  valiantly, but the British had the advantage of more experienced sailors and  more capable commanders. In the end, French naval power was utterly destroyed  and Napoleon's dreams of the conquest of Britain dissolved.  </P> <P> British casualties at Trafalgar were 1,690, of whom 448 were killed --  including Nelson, of course, and two captains. Spanish and French casualties  were 6,953, of whom 1,038 Spanish sailors and 3,370 French sailors were killed.  Fourteen of the Spanish admirals and captains and seven of the French were  killed or wounded.  </P> <P> Interestingly, Schom does not tell us Nelson's last words, spoken to his flag  captain ("Kiss me, Hardy"), assuming, one supposes, that they are known to all,  even to Americans.  </P> <P> Deftly drawn biographies bring to life the principal actors in the great drama:  the admirals, captains, politicians and generals. Lesser but interesting  characters also enter the stage.  </P> <P> Napoleon was besieged by inventors with new weapons and ingenious devices.  Among them was Robert Fulton. More interested in his invention than in the  outcome of the war, he tried to interest both British and French in his  submarine without success, even though he proved to them that his submersible  craft worked and that it could launch torpedoes. Among the amateur strategists  who sought to advise Napoleon was one enthusiast who proposed attacking England  simultaneously by way of a tunnel, an invasion of ships and an armada of  hot-air balloons.  </P> <P> If any fault can be found, it is in the author's fondness for exclamation marks  and italics, a minor quibble for such a thoroughly researched and splendidly  written book.  </P></p>

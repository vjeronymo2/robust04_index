			<p><P> October 16, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HEARING TODAY ON ROCKWELL CLEANUP  </P> <P> A state Assembly subcommittee is scheduled to hold an informational hearing in  Van Nuys today on contamination and cleanup problems at Rockwell  International's Santa Susana Field Laboratory west of Chatsworth.  </P> <P> The hearing, scheduled from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. in the auditorium of the State  Office Building at 6150 Van Nuys Blvd., will be chaired by Terry B. Friedman  (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the health and welfare subcommittee of the  Assembly Ways and Means Committee.  </P> <P> An Energy Department report released in May disclosed chemical and radioactive  contamination in areas of Santa Susana reserved for Energy Department work,  although officials have said the pollution poses no immediate health threat.  </P> <P> Environmental and neighborhood activists are fighting Rockwell's request to  renew a special nuclear materials license for Santa Susana's "hot lab," a  heavily shielded area where remote-control devices are used to dismantle  nuclear fuel.  </P></p>

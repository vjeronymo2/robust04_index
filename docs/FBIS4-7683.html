			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mikaela Vuzharova: "Dialogue With the Union of </F> Democratic Forces Is Necessary, Especially Under the Present  Circumstances"]    [Text] A noncommunist government capable of implementing  at least part of the reform by the end of 1994 could be formed  under the current parliament. All this is possible. However,  the goodwill and energy of a strong cabinet are required in such  case. The country is suffering because it feels the lack of  change. This is what President Zhelyu Zhelev stated in an  interview for the daily NOVO SLOVO [NEW WORD]. A dialogue with  the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] is necessary, especially  under the present circumstances, he said. I am ready for such  talks if the SDS should manifest an interest in holding them,  the head of state declared a year and a half after his breach  with the political forces, thanks to whose voters he obtained  his present post, a breach that he was personally responsible  for. At the same time, Dr. Zhelev continues to insist that he  did not contribute to the fall of the SDS government in 1992.    A cabinet formed by noncommunist forces -- something that  could not take place without the participation of the SDS -- a  cabinet that will not rule forever, but that could do much in  view of the forthcoming elections, so that they may give a  greater chance to the democratic forces -- this is how President  Zhelev explains his idea, which was repeatedly launched by MP  Georgi Markov [from the SDS]. The head of state is categorical  in stating that a cabinet that is based neither on the Berov  cabinet formula nor the former Dimitur Popov government could be  elected under the present parliament.    Zhelev's evaluation of the team that is ruling Bulgaria  today  is that it is supported by the Socialist Party. This fact ties  the hands of the cabinet in many respects, according to the  president. The program of the Berov government offered many  opportunities, but they were not implemented at all, Zhelev  thinks. He further declared that all parliamentary political  forces, even those of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms [DPS]  under whose mandate the cabinet was formed, had great  reservations about it, and hence, the possibility exists that  the government would be soon overthrown.    Zhelyu Zhelev insisted on his previous statement that  elections should be held in the autumn of 1994.    According to recent analyses made by the presidential team,  the situation in the country is especially alarming, most of all  due to the complete breakdown in people's trust in the state  institutions. DEMOKRATSIYA was told this by a source at 2  Dondukov Street [address of the Presidency]. According to the  team's findings, the parliament is already in the ridiculous  situation of falling below the critical 10-percent confidence  barrier. According to a sounding of opinions among the  political forces, it appears that the DPS intends to revise its  behavior in parliament and support a possible new cabinet, which  should prepare the forthcoming elections on a democratic basis.  Numerous deputies of the new formations at the National  Assembly, with the exception of a few individuals mostly from  the Alternative Liberal-Social Party [ASP], reportedly share the  same views. According to NOVO SLOVO, they are all awaiting the  trend of the SDS's behavior after Prime Minister Berov's  operation, namely in the new stage of the political and economic  crisis. This factor, in particular, is supposed to be decisive  for Prime Minister Berov's own dilemma, in connection with  deciding whether he should remain in his post or resign after  leaving hospital.</p>

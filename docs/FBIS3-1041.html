The gathering was to be a show of support for the  Zulu monarch at his planned meeting with African National  Congress [ANC] President Nelson Mandela.    On Thursday, the ANC cancelled the meeting, following claims  of an assassination attempt on the ANC leader's life in the  Inkatha stronghold of Ulundi. The ANC has requested the meeting  be postponed to a later date.    Meanwhile, the kwaZulu government said on Thursday that  Friday's meeting would go ahead "with or without Mr Mandela".    The Zulu king is expected to address thousands of his  subjects outside the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly building later  Friday.</p>

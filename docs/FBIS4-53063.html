			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Thurs. -- After five years in  Malaysia, about 100 Vietnamese refugees, who were not accepted  by any third country, left for Ho Chi Minh City today under the  voluntary repatriation program.    So far, 3,054 Vietnamese illegal immigrants had voluntarily  returned home since the programme began three years ago, leaving  6,820 boat people at the Sungei Besi camp.    The returnees expressed enthusiasm about heading home as  many  felt the Vietnamese economy was brighter. Pham Phu Cong, 30,  wants to return to his tailoring work. "My wife and I are happy  to return as we are both in the tailoring line and want to start  building a future for ourselves," said this father of one.</p>

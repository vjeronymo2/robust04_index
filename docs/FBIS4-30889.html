			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speakers identified by caption; passages within quotation </F> marks are recorded; relayed by Warsaw TV Polonia Network]    [Excerpts] Journalists from the British television company  Channel 4 claim that 16 containers loaded with arms were  exported to Iraq from the Lucznik plant in Radom in February.  The management of the plant denies that this shipment ever took  place. The Central Engineering Board has given assurances that  it had never granted permission for any shipment to Iraq.    [Reporter] British journalists say they received information  about the Polish shipment of arms to Iraq from very reliable  sources which they cannot disclose.    [Chris Mitchell, Channel 4 journalist, in English with  superimposed Polish translation] "We got the information at the  beginning of the year. We were told that 16 gray, unmarked  containers would leave the Lucznik plant in Radom. We were told  that they depart for the Black Sea coast, to Varna, and we were  told they would be shipped onto Akaba via Cyprus."    [Reporter] Journalists saw only eight containers leaving the  plant but they think some could have been sent earlier. They  have not seen their contents but they think the very fact that  sewing machines are being sent to the Middle East in unmarked  containers confirms their suspicions.    [Mitchell] "But what was very striking was that the  information we had received corresponded to what we saw later  and to what Mr. Szwonder told us."    [Reporter] The former Lucznik manager and presently the  Democratic Left Alliance senator has told GAZETA WYBORCZA daily  that he only spoke to British journalists about legal exports of  arms to Yemen. The current management of the plant also denies  the British journalists' accusations.    [Bronislaw Kilian, Lucznik manager] "This event which is  supposedly described by the British television program has not  taken place. It is some kind of mistake and in my opinion yet  another provocation."    [Reporter] "Provocation by whom?"    [Kilian] "Well, certainly not by our side."    [Reporter] "By whom do you think?"    [Kilian] "Well, it is in someone's interest."    [Reporter] Polish authorities which supervise the arms trade  think the story told by the British journalists is not specific  enough. [passage omitted] The British journalists' program  will most probably be screened on Channel 4 tomorrow.</p>

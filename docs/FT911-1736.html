			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / International Company News: DSM earnings dip to Fl 178m DSM, the Dutch chemicals group, yesterday said net profit fell by 26.4 per cent to Fl 178m (Dollars 93.7m) in the first quarter of 1991 compared with the same period last year. If extraordinary items are excluded from both years, net profit was down 19.1 per cent at Fl 182m, roughly unchanged from the lower final quarter of 1990. In 1990, DSM posted a 22 per cent decline in net profit excluding extraordinary items and a 38 per cent drop including these items. Sales were down 11 per cent at Fl 2.6bn in the 1991 quarter, with most of the decline attributed to DSM's decision in 1990 to deconsolidate the results of Macintosh, its 56 per cent-owned retail group. Selling prices rose an average of 3 per cent, but this was more than offset by a 5 per cent decline in sales volume, particularly in basic chemicals. DSM said first-quarter results were also affected by the start-up costs of new production facilities. Like other Dutch companies, DSM said it was unable to predict 1991 results because of the economic uncertainties prevailing on a number of its key markets.</p>

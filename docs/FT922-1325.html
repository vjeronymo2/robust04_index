			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Dockyard bids for survival THE BATTLE for survival by the UK's two naval dockyards took a new turn yesterday. Babcock Thorn, manager of Rosyth dockyard in Fife, announced plans for a substantially cheaper facility for refitting Trident submarines there than that proposed by the Ministry of Defence. The ministry scheme would cost more than Pounds 500m, but the company said it could do the job for Pounds 267m, largely by omitting a covered dockyard proposed by the MoD. Babcock Thorn, a joint venture between Babcock and Thorn EMI, also proposed that the two yards, Rosyth and Devonport in Devon, which have been managed by private-sector operators since 1987, be brought under a single management structure. It said the yards should specialise, with Rosyth concentrating on submarines and Devonport on surface ships. The MoD is reviewing the Navy's requirements for dockyards in the light of the reduced refitting programme as fleet numbers are cut.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 1 Jun (NA) -- Israeli Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres said tonight that the "hand of a foreign country"  was involved in the attack against his country's embassy in  Buenos Aires on 17 March 1992. Peres made clear, however, that  "the details will be known only when the investigation has been  completed."    Peres condemned the presence of Nazis in Argentina, saying  "assassins must be punished wherever they might be because the  law does not give anyone a license to kill another human being."  Peres said he is "against all assassins in history."    The Israeli foreign minister held a news conference at  Government House after his one-hour meeting with President  Carlos Menem. Peres briefed Menem on the status of the Middle  East peace process since the historic signing of an agreement  with the Palestinian people.    Peres said he started a round of briefings with U.S.  President Bill Clinton "and wanted to end it with President  Menem."    His meeting with the president was possible because the  plane  carrying the foreign minister from Santiago to Madrid made a  technical stopover at Ezeiza Airport, which gave Peres a chance  to request an audience with President Menem.    Peres said the peace process with Yasir 'Arafat's  Palestinians "was achieved and is irreversible." He also said  that his intention was "to move forward and not backward."    Peres recognized that the signing of the agreement's first  chapter with the Palestinians "was not an easy matter. We had  problems, but I think it is a great achievement."    Peres said Israel "is negotiating with Syrians, Jordanians,  Lebanese, and also with Palestinians on the issue of autonomy"  because we want "to create a new way (of life) in the Middle  East where security for the four nations will be guaranteed,  permitting the development of an economic system that will allow  these nations to improve their future prospects within the  boundaries of respect for human rights and freedom."</p>

Japan Technomart Foundation  (Katsushige Mita, chairman) was established in 1985 with the  goal of nurturing in Japan a true ``technology marketplace.''  However, with a corporate membership of 300 companies and  10,000 items of registered information, it has only achieved one  to two-fifths of the goals set for it by MITI, its starter. Why  has its challenge to new business opportunities as a high tech  intermediary languished?  <H5>  Problems with Methods Used </H5>   ``Am I [i.e.Technomart] considered necessary by industry?''  This question has been repeated during Japan Technomart's eight  years of existence. The foundation sells distinctive ``sell''  and ``buy'' information using a database. However, of the  currently registered patents, no more than 3,000 are sells and  no more than 150 are buys. ``Since there are such small absolute  numbers, such as ten patents related to semiconductors and three  related to portable phones, the number of opportunities for  corporate matchmaking just doesn't increase,'' according to  Katsutaka Shibata, managing director.    There's also a problem of quality. Large companies, small  companies, big city companies, and local companies without  distinction bring existing technologies and nurture the buds of  new businesses. There are voices contradicting that kind of  ideal. ``Our company will use money-making patents. If there's  technology that will quickly turn into money we'd like to  acquire it cheaply from another company,'' curse corporate egos.  ``The content of technical information is causing `hollowing',''  says an electrical manufacturer.    ``Exchange of technical information for invigorating  industry  is not lacking. Technomart's business will bear fruit,'' asserts  Patent Office ``old boy'' Shibata. Tadakata Homma, head of  Mitsubishi Electric's intellectual property liaison division,  has a positive assessment: ``There is the significance of  introducing the advanced technology of large corporations to  local corporations.'' ``The problem is that we haven't found a  reliable method of getting results through an intermediary,''  says Shibata.    The fee structure remains the same as when Technomart was  founded: &yen;3 million to join and annual dues of &yen;3  million. Even so, membership has fallen to half of its peak  number amid complaints that members don't get their money's  worth. There's frustration in the executive offices that  Technomart, which got off to such a glorious start as the  ``curtain opener on the technology information age,'' has  achieved the real results promised in only 330 cases.  <H5>  Pluses </H5>   Managing Director Shibata has made up his mind, ``Although  it  seems like a circuitous route, we have no choice other than to  slowly but surely enlighten people.'' A mainstay of this effort  is the ``EasyPat'' rights information service started in August  1993. It offers easy personal computer-based searching of the  1.2 million patent and utility models registered in the Patent  Office.    EasyPat is no match for PATOLIS (offered by the Japan Patent  Information Organization) database which prides itself on more  than ten million items of industrial rights information. But,  ``if you're investigating patents under registration, its size  is convenient. PATOLIS charges &yen;300 per minute of searching,  while EasyPat charges &yen;300 per item. Another advantage is  being able to take time to search thoroughly,'' says EasyPat's  enthusiastic PR.    Even if a technology transaction occurs as the result of an  EasyPat search, Technomart can't charge a fee for serving as an  intermediary. ``The board of directors debated going so far as  to spend labor and time,'' said Shibata. However, the majority  believed that getting corporations to acknowledge Technomart's  existence and role came first.    Since April each branch has one technical information  advisor. Once every two months they gather in Tokyo to hold an  information exchange meeting. They uncover unique technologies  in the provinces and also take information back to introduce to  managers of local industry in their region.  <H5>  Even One Case </H5>   ``We call on our branches to work for success in business  negotiations. Even just one case is fine,'' says Shibata. It  will be a start toward a ``second beginning'' when staff members  recover pride in their work. Although companies are enduring  cost cutting, there are more and more people wondering if the  companies could make more effective use of their intellectual  property. ``At any moment the long recession may blow over,''  murmured Shibata as if trying to get himself to agree.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-010LC-02A>           Set-up of Technology Exchange Market (Technomart) </FIG></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bishkek, 29 Jun (KYRGYZKABAR) -- Military exercises  on combat readiness will begin in the Republic 1 July, according  to the press service of the republic's Defense Ministry. The  aim of the exercises is to hold command and staff training in  the Republic's Army. It should be added that the government's  resolution on the progress of the armed forces reform was  published in the local press today. The resolution notes that  the military units have not sufficiently mastered combat in the  mountains and that different kinds of armed forces do not  interact well. The storage of armaments also has problems. The  government suggested that the Defense Ministry should elaborate  a program of state measures on strengthening defense,  implementation of the reform of the armed forces in the coming  two years and retaining officers in the army, and sumbit this  program for the government's consideration.</p>

			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SONNY LOSES STATUS IN SIMI;  </P> <P> CELEBRITY: ONCE THE HONORED GUEST, BON VIVANT SONNY BONO IS NOW PERSONA NON  GRATA AT A CHARITY EXTRAVAGANZA.  </P> <P> The presidential suite in the city's fanciest hotel was reserved, the limo was  arranged, and the plaque honoring Palm Springs mayor and bon vivant Sonny Bono  was ordered.  </P> <P> But the fifth annual Norka Image Awards, Simi Valley's gala charity dinner and  public relations extravaganza, will have to carry on without Bono, who tendered  last-minute regrets after reportedly learning that air fare from Palm Springs  was not among his perks as an honored guest.  </P> <P> "I will not give the award to him," vowed Mary McCurdy, a businesswoman who  organizes the annual event.  </P> <P> Bono was to be among several entertainment figures to be honored at tonight's  $75-per-plate dinner at the Wood Ranch Golf Club to benefit Care and Share, a  local food bank. Although the honorees are invited to receive awards  recognizing their show business achievements, McCurdy said their presence also  ensures that the dinner will draw its 200 expected guests.  </P> <P> "His table was selling for $5,000," McCurdy said of her now-missing celebrity.  </P> <P> A miffed McCurdy said Friday that she has canceled the order for Bono's plaque.  "It's not going to be made," she said. "Unfortunately, his name is still on the  program. And I'm not going to read his telegram."  </P> <P> McCurdy claims that Bono accepted an invitation in August, then reneged this  week after his secretary phoned to ask whether air fare would be covered for  Bono, his wife Mary, baby son Chesare and nanny.  </P> <P> "I have to draw the line and be sure proceeds are all being given to the  organization we are working for," said McCurdy, whose boutique is also called  Norka Image, an appellation that she took from an exclusive clothes store in  her native Colombia. "Norka means mink in Russian," she said.  </P> <P> Reached at his office at Palm Springs City Hall, Bono apologized profusely  Friday and called the snafu "a communications nightmare."  </P> <P> Time, not air fare, was the issue, he said. For some reason, he said, the event  was not on his calendar, and he didn't hear about it until he returned this  week from a three-week trip to Hawaii. By then, it was too late to commit the  time needed to attend, he said.  </P> <P> Bono, who was criticized earlier this year when he failed to take part in an  AIDS walk in Palm Springs, said: "It's difficult to get there, by air or land.  It's a time-consumer from Palm Springs.  </P> <P> "I can only assure you I'm not concerned with the cost of the flight. In fact,  I offered to send them some money for the event if that would soften it. It's  simply a goof, and I feel terrible, but they're going to hate me anyway."  </P> <P> McCurdy said she turned down Bono's offer of a $200 donation and did not  appreciate the conciliatory telegram that arrived Friday, either.  </P> <P> "I think we have bigger celebrities at our event, and I'm very proud to say  they're all coming," said McCurdy, who ticked off the names of television  actors Joe Conley ("The Waltons"); James B. Sikking ("Hill Street Blues" and  "Doogie Howser, M. D."); Jacklyn Zeman ("General Hospital"), and three-time  Emmy nominee Susan Ruttan ("L. A. Law.").  </P> <P> "Listen, I've had just about enough from this Sonny Bono," McCurdy said. "How  many times has Sonny Bono been nominated for an Emmy?"  </P></p>

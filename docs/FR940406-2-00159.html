Section 1001 of the Act, as amended, authorizes grants ``to assist in the establishment and operation of voluntary family planning projects which shall offer a broad range of acceptable and effective family planning methods and services (including natural family planning methods, infertility services, and services for adolescents).'' Section 1003 of the Act, as amended, authorizes the Secretary to make grants to entities to provide the training for personnel to carry out the family planning services programs. The regulations set out at 42 CFR part 59, subpart C, govern grants for family planning service training. Prospective applicants should refer to the regulations in their entirety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Role and Operation of the Training Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The nurse practitioner is an integral part of the family planning system and performs a critical role in the delivery of high quality family planning and women's health services. Nurse practitioner training programs are focused on the preparation of registered professional nurses to function in an advanced nursing role as obstetric-gynecologic or women's health nurse practitioners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Successful applicants will be required to work closely with Central and Regional Office staffs and a network of agencies, including Title X service delivery providers and nurse practitioner training advisory committees. Title X service grantees from the regions serve on the nurse practitioner training advisory committees. Successful applicants will be required to review and consider policy and program goals of both the Title X family planning training and services programs, solicit advice from the regional training advisory committee, and consult with Title X service delivery providers about training priorities, course content, and curriculum. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The nurse practitioner training curriculum must focus on preparation of obstetric-gynecologic or women's health care nurse practitioners [hereafter referred to as nurse practitioner(s)] for advanced nursing practice. The nurse practitioner training curriculum must include content sufficient to prepare graduates to perform the full range of services required for nurse practitioners in the Title X family planning services program. The nurse practitioner training program graduate should acquire, through the training program, special knowledge and skills in health promotion and maintenance, disease prevention, psychosocial and physical assessment, and management of health-illness needs in the primary care of women, provided predominantly in an ambulatory setting. The nurse practitioner will provide such care in collaboration with the physician as well as with other members of the health-care team. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The design of the nurse practitioner training program, including the curriculum, must be consistent with national and regional Title X goals. The program must be eligible for accreditation as a nurse practitioner program by a national nursing accrediting body and must meet national or State recognition requirements as a provider of continuing education through a national nursing organization or one of its constituents. Graduates of the nurse practitioner training program must be eligible for State and/or national certification and meet State requirements for licensure or recognition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The application should set out how the nurse practitioner training program will address the national health objectives relating to family planning that are discussed in section 5 of the PHS document, Healthy People 2000, discussed below. Specific attention should be given to training which would enable nurse practitioners to work more effectively to: Reduce teen pregnancy; reduce unintended pregnancy among all women; reduce the initiation of sexual activity by teenagers; increase the effectiveness of contraception, including barrier contraception, among all women; implement pre-conception care; and reduce sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Successful applicants will be responsible for the overall management of a nurse practitioner training program within the geographic area for which the grant is made.

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / South Africa braced for mass strike SOUTH AFRICA was braced for potential violence during today's planned mass strike called by the African National Congress to mourn the weekend assassination of guerrilla leader Mr Chris Hani. Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC president, warned last night on national television that South Africa was 'on the brink of disaster'. In an emotional address, he appealed for calm and urged respect for whites. 'We must not let the men who worship war and who lust after blood precipitate actions that will plunge our country into another Angola,' he said. Mr Mandela issued a special appeal to South Arica's ultra-radical youth: 'You have lost a great hero. You have repeatedly shown that your love of freedom is greater than. . . life itself. But you are the leaders of tomorrow. Your country, your people, your organisation need you to act with wisdom.' He said Mr Hani would be buried on Monday, in one of the most important political events in South African history. Constitutional talks would be delayed by one week of mourning. Worried by the risk of violence, the South African Chamber of Business (Sacob), the largest employer organisation, issued an unusally conciliatory statement urging employers to handle the tense situation with sensitivity. A Sacob official urged no disciplinary action be taken against employees failing to attend work. the organisation said, pointing out that the stayaway could mean employees would be unable to attend work for lack of transport. Yesterday, the first day of the ANC's planned campaign of 'rolling mass action' passed off with some incidents of violence, especially in the eastern Cape province where three youths were killed after they stoned a police vehicle. Many parts of the province were declared 'unrest areas,' with curfews and a ban on weapons. A small demonstration was held outside the Boksburg magistrate's court where the alleged assassin, Mr Janusz Walus, appeared. He was remanded in custody until May 12. In another South African court, charges were withdrawn against 27 of 74 men accused of involvement in last year's Boipatong massacre, which led to a nine-month suspension of constitutional talks.</p>

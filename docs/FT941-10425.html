			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: Merger pushes Mattel into loss Mattel, the US toy-maker that took over the Fisher-Price toy company in December, reported consolidated net losses of Dollars 42.7m for the fourth quarter, but said it would have made net profits of Dollars 62.4m without a Dollars 115m pre-tax charge relating to the merger - 26 per cent more than the consolidated figure for the comparable quarter. The merged company reported net income of Dollars 117m for 1993, but said the figure would have been Dollars 226m without the merger costs, compared with a consolidated figure of Dollars 184.8m for the previous year. Mattel said net sales rose by 4 per cent to Dollars 754m in the fourth quarter. Although the company will have to deal with the effects of a strengthening dollar on its overseas earnings this year, it said substantial operating efficiencies should flow from the integration of Mattel and Fisher-Price over the past two months.</p>

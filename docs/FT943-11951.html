			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Fiat executives cleared Lawyers for Fiat have won an important battle to clear the group's senior executives of involvement in a corruption scandal concerning payment of some L100bn (Pounds 41m) in bribes to politicians to secure contracts for the Rome metro. A Rome judge late on Monday dismissed the case against Mr Cesare Romiti, Fiat's chief executive officer, and Mr Francesco Mattioli, the motor group's chief financial officer. The case against Mr Carlo De Benedetti, head of Olivetti, was dismissed earlier. However, the same judge sent for trial a group of prominent ex-politicians and businessmen including: Mr Bettino Craxi, former Socialist leader; Mr Vittorio Sbardella, the Rome Christian Democrat close to former premier Giulio Andreotti; and Mr Franco Nobili, former head of the Iri state holding company. So far L6bn of bribes has been recovered from Swiss bank accounts. This money has been returned to the municipality of Rome, which had launched a civil suit in the proceedings.</p>

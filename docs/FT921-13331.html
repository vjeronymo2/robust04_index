			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: Parretti dismisses 'pyrrhic' victory Mr GIANCARLO Parretti, the controversial Italian financier trying to regain control of MGM-Pathe Communications, the financially-troubled Hollywood studio, yesterday claimed his opponents had won 'only a pyrrhic victory', writes Haig Simonian in Milan. Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland, the Dutch subsidiary of the big French bank which financed his November 1990 takeover of MGM Pathe, last year won control of the company after a lengthy legal battle. The bank's position was reinforced last month by a Delaware court, which removed Mr Parretti and his family from the company's board and gave the bank the right to vote the 98.5 per cent stake owned by a Parretti-controlled concern. Making his first public appearance since being released from a Sicilian jail on January 10, Mr Parretti, (pictured right), criticised journalists at a packed Rome press conference for continuing to call him 'the ex-owner of MGM. All Credit Lyonnais has done is take away my voting rights, but the shares are still mine', he said. Sitting between his wife and three children, he said he was now 'at war' with the bank. Credit Lyonnais only had the right to sell 51 per cent of MGM-Pathe, and he would certainly exercise his option to buy the shares. Ironically, losing the court case had given him 'more time, and finding the necessary finance was 'the least important thing'. Mr Parretti was arrested by Italian police on a string of charges of tax fraud and illegal money transfer as he was boarding a private jet on December 27. He declined to answer questions relating to his arrest and subsequent release, as the affair was still sub-judice. He claimed his source of finance was still available, while the Japanese Toshiba electronics group had also offered 'very much money', he said.</p>

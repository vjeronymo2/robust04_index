			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: 'DAD,' 'IMMEDIATE FAMILY' RESEMBLE TV AT ITS WORST  </P> <P> In an interview recently, director Amy Heckerling used Goethe's phrase, "What  has not burst forth from your own soul will not refresh you," as she described  her impulse to make the current hit film "Look Who's Talking." In that  particular case, the baby's-eye-view-movie emerged after the birth of her first  child.  </P> <P> It's a heartening thing to hear, especially since it runs so entirely contrary  to the way movies are conceived these days. As we get movies built to marketing  department specifications, we're also seeing films that are indistinguishable  from television -- not its high end but its dreary middle-ground. It's a  feeling that's heightened when "Immediate Family" and "Dad" open in the same  week.  </P> <P> Not all television is constricted and prosaic; no one would say that in a  decade that has seen Dennis Potter's imagination run to its fullest; that has  given us such miniseries as "War and Remembrance," or "Lonesome Dove." On a  regular basis, we have (or have had) "Murphy Brown," "Hill Street Blues," "The  Days and Nights of Molly Dodd," "Frank's Place," "thirtysomething" and "The  Wonder Years" to keep us absorbed on a regular basis.  </P> <P> It still leaves too many episodic television shows that are suffocatingly  small-minded -- in their horizons, their superficiality and their notion of  what real life or real people are all about. What's disheartening is when  feature films, which are supposed to have a metaphoric depth of field as well  as a literal one, begin to take on the look and sound of the worst of this kind  of TV.  </P> <P> "Dad," which was originally a novel by "Birdy's" William Wharton, has been  Simonized into screen form by a writer-director, Gary David Goldberg, whose  success came with "Family Ties." Most of the changes he's made have been in  planing away details that might seem peculiar or foreign to mass audiences: a  hero, for example, who was an expatriate painter settled happily in France with  a French wife. He's been transformed into an image that television audiences  recognize on sight: an overstressed executive (Ted Danson) who's lost touch  with his family.  </P> <P> "Dad" does contain a frightening portrayal of the sudden disintegration of  personality that can come with age, and especially in the first section of the  film, Jack Lemmon's Dad is flawless. But as the film builds, it builds TV-cute,  with adorable, sketch-like solutions to Dad's problems and the kind of inane  conclusion that ends half-hour sitcoms: over-hearty laughter by a newly unified  family.  </P> <P> At the wake that ends the film, Olympia Dukakis, Lemmon's prickly, unneighborly  wife, puts on her dead husband's baseball cap and adopts his outgoing  mannerisms -- as though personality traits of more than 70 years could be  erased away.  </P> <P> Most of the things that made "Dad" singular as a novel have been pared away to  make the finished product inoffensive. With another current product, "Immediate  Family," there was nothing in Barbara Benedek's original screenplay to pare;  it's already perfect for the tiny screen.  </P> <P> The theme should be wrenching: the childlessness of a secure mature couple, the  unwanted pregnancy of a young teen-ager who chooses to have her baby adopted.  But even as director Jonathan Kaplan follows both adoptive parents (Glenn Close  and James Woods) through their demoralizing fertility procedures or over even  more infuriating adoption hurdles, the film making seems TV-careful. You get an  awful lot of "acting" for your money here: poses, ruefulness, smiling through  tears. (The exception is the guileless realism of Mary Stuart Masterson's young  mother.)  </P> <P> The predictability of this screenplay is absolutely crushing. Checking out the  adoptive family's house, the young pregnant mother says yearningly that it  would be nice if her baby's crib was put near the window, because down in the  yard is a tree that'll be covered with flowering blossoms in the spring. Guess  the film's last image.  </P> <P> Anything that might make this safe vehicle veer one jot away from expectation  has been avoided. Moviegoing this routine is less than no challenge, it's  enervating. What we really lose, as drama gets this devalued, is ambiguity,  ellipses, poetry.  </P> <P> The worst of television drama works on the principal of telling us what it's  going to say, saying it, then telling us it has said it. The best film never  says what it's going to show; shows it obliquely and assumes that we've been  quick enough to pick up on it. One method is insulting, the other is  flattering. Who wouldn't rather be flattered?  </P> <P> Standard television drama moves in one straight line with nothing going on  under that line to distract or to confuse an audience. It gives you the melody;  it leaves out the left hand. It's constructed to survive with every plot-point  intact in spite of side-trips to the refrigerator or friendly telephone calls.  </P> <P> In the race to get a story told with every possible economy, details of  character, of period, of place are jettisoned. They don't advance the plot,  they seem to be irrelevant; all they do is deepen and enrich the soil. They  make characters you carry around for years afterwards.  </P> <P> Think of Jane Fonda in "Klute," giving that bit of excess cat food a trial  lick. The tennis serve of Monsieur Hulot. The silent scene in "When Harry Met  Sally . . . ," as Meg Ryan attacks a stack of letters, popping them into the  mail slot, one at a time, and peering into the box after each one. Ted Danson,  as an assistant D.A. in "Body Heat," dancing all by himself in the dark on the  end of a pier with an image of Fred Astaire in his head that he can't forget.  Treat Williams, swinging insinuatingly on the door of his convertible as he  tries to lure Laura Dern away from her house in "Smooth Talk." Amy Wright in  "Accidental Tourist," filing her groceries alphabetically and, for that matter,  that entire turtle-like clan of hers with their grand eccentricities.  </P> <P> Films engage us by their unexpected turns; we respond to their poetry, not  their predictability. Look at the films turning up on some of those  decade's-best lists: "Raging Bull," "Wings of Desire," "E.T. the Extra  Terrestrial," "Blue Velvet," "Hannah and Her Sisters," "Fanny and Alexander,"  "Who Framed Roger Rabbit," "Platoon," "Shoah," "Do the Right Thing," "Road  Warrior," "Local Hero." In an era of encroaching timidity, you could call their  overall motto "safety last." More power to it.  </P></p>

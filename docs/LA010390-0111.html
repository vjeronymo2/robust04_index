			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN;  </P> <P> QUAKE-SENSITIVE BUILDINGS LISTED  </P> <P> The City Council on Tuesday received a report identifying eight potentially  hazardous, unreinforced masonry buildings in the Old Town area.  </P> <P> The Community Development Department was required by state law to compile the  report because unreinforced buildings of brick and other masonry materials do  not withstand earthquakes well.  </P> <P> Such buildings were built before seismic safety codes were enforced and do not  have steel bars embedded in the walls.  </P> <P> The buildings are:  </P> <P> * Swinging Door/Surfas Furriers, 355 and 365 El Camino Real, built in 1922.  </P> <P> * Tustin Pythian Building, 397 and 399 El Camino Real and 135, 145 and 155 Main  St., built in 1925.  </P> <P> * Perfit Building, 165, 185, 191, 193 and 195 E. Main St., built in 1920.  </P> <P> * Dance School Building, 401 and 405 El Camino Real and 120, 130, 140 and 150  E. Main St., built in 1925.  </P> <P> * Tustin Hardware, 115 W. Main St., built in 1912.  </P> <P> * Diocese of Orange, 130 W. Main St., built in 1914.  </P> <P> * Rose Marie's Draperies, 138 W. Main St., built in 1914, modified in 1964.  </P> <P> * Rutabegorz, 140, 148, 150 and 158 W. Main St., built in 1914.  </P> <P> The city is submitting the list to the state Seismic Safety Commission and will  notify property owners soon. By July, city officials expect to develop an  ordinance requiring structural repairs to the buildings. Public hearings on the  ordinance will be held soon.  </P> <P> The city may provide incentives to owners for reinforcing their buildings by  making available up to $2,000 in Community Development Block Grant funds for  engineering and design, planning and construction costs.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Stojan Andov, chairman of the Assembly of </F> The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, by Mirce Tomovski;  place and date not given: "Permanent Nature of Democratic  Changes"]    [Text] Stojan Andov, chairman of the Assembly of The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM], discusses with  PULS the Macedonian democratic political climate, elections, the  division of power, interethnic relations, and so forth.    [Tomovski] This summer, the second free multiparty elections  are scheduled for Macedonia. A short but significant period of  time has elapsed since the first elections in developing a  democratic environment in our country. It has been assessed in  various ways: According to some, we are living in a time of  radical democratic developments; according to others, the old  still prevails, and what we have now is nothing but simulated  democracy. What is your reaction to the democratic processes?    [Andov] The development of democratic processes in our  country was determined by their nature. However, because of  particular circumstances, they did not affect several areas. To  begin with, the changes that occurred turned out to be so big  and so significant that the political parties and their  leaderships were unable to project any further programmatic  development. Now, in a period of tremendous change in the  history of the Macedonian people and of Macedonia as a state,  there have been several minor programmatic changes made by the  parties, although the foundations of society have radically  changed. This is an indication that the new processes do not  enjoy firm party and political support within the democratic  infrastructure. Other problems may be found in the governmental  institutions, the parliament, and so forth. Despite all the  pressures and the great results it was able to achieve,  considering the correlation of forces, obviously there was a  certain area the parliament was unable to penetrate: Reform and  reorganization of the administration of the state. The present  administration meets the conditions that existed in a socialist  society, at a time when Macedonia was, as a republic, a  structural part of another state. There has been a substantial  stagnation in the restructuring of the state. It should have  been followed with its conversion to a developed market economy,  privatization, reprivatization, denationalization, and so forth.    [Tomovski] Can you indicate more specifically the areas in  which state reform is difficult to accomplish?    [Andov] To this day we do not have a Ministry of Foreign  Affairs but a Ministry of Relations with Foreign Countries. Our  classifications and legal resolutions still lack legal  foundations for appointing ambassadors, replacing them, and so  on. This is absurd, for the Constitution makes such decisions  possible. We pointed out the reorganization of the Public  Bookkeeping Service. However, the existing atmosphere surprised  us: We did not see any understanding of the urgent need for the  modern financial institutions. We raised this question with the  Ministry of Internal Affairs. It is inconsistent with today's  demands and needs of society. From time to time it works  according to the old system and acts in a way consistent with  the time and the society of the past. Ignoring the Law on  Financial Inspections and others, on a parallel basis, financial  inspections are conducted at the Ministry of Police, which is  totally against the law. We need a reorganization of state  reserves, in accordance with our stance as an independent  country. In my view, there is insufficient dynamism in terms of  introducing changes and promoting democratic processes. This  includes the media, which are failing to promote the basic  features of democratic changes as was done at the start of  pluralism, at the time when we were separating ourselves from  Yugoslavia. They and the journalists display little feeling for  the new, for taking a risk, and for achieving a breakthrough.  This, however, may be naturally the result of the problems I  mentioned. That is why the forthcoming elections will be a  challenge to the political forces, to the forces pledged to a  further democratic breakthrough, and to a stable executive power  with a clear program.    [Tomovski] In a certain way the "103" elections became a  test  of what we may expect in the autumn. Or, at least, that is the  way they are being interpreted. They are subject to the  constant critical look of parties and candidates from the  opposition, who participated in them. The criticism can be  formulated as "the impossibility in Macedonia to win an election  democratically." What are the democratic guarantees that will  ensure fair play and a democratic struggle in the autumn?    [Andov] I would rather not discuss the objections voiced by  the opposition. I know, however, from worldwide practical  experience, that those who do not succeed keep interfering and  criticizing, which is natural. Last summer there were  disagreements about the electoral laws. There was even  hostility toward those who did not think that the laws must be  passed immediately and such individuals were even accused of not  considering the good of the state and being opposed to the  elections. That is why the government was right to revoke the  draft laws and ensure the application of regular procedures.  This offers us greater opportunities in terms of the Council of  Europe, from which we asked for experts to assess our laws. The  same request was made to several U.S. institutions. This is a  guarantee that we shall pass laws providing for fair and free  elections. On the basis of these laws we shall ask  international observers to monitor the full elections.  Otherwise, what happened in relation to the "103" was an attack  on democracy, for methods alien to the democratic struggle were  used. The representative of the VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian  Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian  National Unity] openly threatened violence. Representatives of  the Democratic Party used the method of unsubstantiated and  one-sided statements concerning the various parties and attacked  the integrity of individuals with a view to compromise them. A  democratic electoral atmosphere must be one of struggle but a  struggle for party programs, a struggle among the capabilities  of the candidates and their intellectual and political power.    [Tomovski] However it is being pointed out to you that once  again there are manipulations in the passing of laws, and the  parliamentary session has been extended. All of this is in  order to help the governmental coalition acquire better  electoral conditions for itself.    [Andov] It was the parties that requested the extension. We  have never had any greater cooperation and understanding among  the parties about the laws as we do now. There have been many  proposals and many suggestions. The new laws are now, virtually  for the first time, being formulated in a real pluralistic  atmosphere. I believe that we shall be able to pass real laws  for free elections and a fair electoral struggle.    [Tomovski] Now that we are on the verge of elections it has  been remarked, concerning the suggested model of proportional  majority, that it will not provide a true political picture of  Macedonia in the next parliament.    [Andov] In all countries the political picture remains  within  the framework of its basic purposes and needs at that specific  period. If in the forthcoming period we need a stable authority  in Macedonia, clearly we have no interest in letting a number of  small parties enter parliament, with two or three  representatives, and so on. For in that case it would be  impossible to secure the existence of a legislative body with  the required political weight needed to create a stable and  responsible executive authority. We have about 60 political  parties. Does anyone truly think that there are 60 real options  for Macedonia? Therefore, this is a rustic, folkloric, carnival,  country fair atmosphere rather than a true reflection of the  need for political development of the state.    [Tomovski] The parliament is one of the key factors of  parliamentary democracy. It is a member of the  Interparliamentary Union. At the same time, however, the  parliament is being constantly criticized by the public and by  the political parties. What is its real position in terms of the  two extremes in such assessments?    [Andov] I think that our parliament functions in accordance  with European standards. The problems appeared wherever a  two-thirds majority was required. I believe that the Assembly  established itself as the central legislative and political  institution in the period between the two elections. At the same  time, it took all the steps required for the functioning of an  independent state. The criticism on the part of the public is  undifferentiated: It is more a criticism on the part of circles  that would like the work to be done more rapidly and  efficiently. However, they forget that the dynamics and  efficiency of the work depend above all on the correlation of  political forces. Another criticism comes from the  nonparliamentary parties. They are displeased for being outside  the parliament. In all countries such parties play no role in  society. The fact that in Macedonia the opposite is taking place  is probably the result of our inexperience and the fact that,  according to some, they could not become members of parliament  within the first electoral period was a mistake.    [Tomovski] What are the chances that the new basic laws that  so far have not been passed by the parliament may be passed  before the start of the new elections?    [Andov] I mentioned the administration of the state. This  includes justice. I believe that despite all efforts it would be  impossible in this parliament to rally 80 votes for any given  project. It is impossible to have 80 votes, given the breakdown  of political forces.    [Tomovski] Almost half of the townships in the Republic of  Macedonia are not functioning for a variety of reasons. However,  it is a fact that the people are having problems in their daily  life. Yet the most important law on local self-government was  not passed.    [Andov] Obviously, there are difficulties concerning the  functioning of the townships given the absence of regulations in  that area. The old regulations and statutory laws remain along  with some government resolutions. However, there has been no  definitive solution based on the Constitution. The law on local  self-government was not passed. However, there are townships  without a township assembly. Otherwise, all townships function  one way or another. It would be better to pass a law on local  self-government. It is obvious, however, that we have included  in this law an excessive number of problems to be resolved. This  includes interethnic relations. However, disputes concerning the  law do not pertain to local self-government but to other issues  which this law must resolve. Its passing was delayed by the  government for a variety of disagreements, which point at the  nature of the demands raised with the amendments. The government  determined that the nature of the amendments makes an 80-vote  majority impossible.    [Tomovski] Macedonia is developing its own original model of  interethnic democracy. However, the political parties of the  various nationalities are dissatisfied and are also the result  of their internationalization. What is your view of Macedonian  interethnic conditions?    [Andov] The main directions in resolving problems of  interethnic relations are formulated in the Constitution and we  do not have to exceed such frameworks or such methods in  resolving them. There is no need for redefining interethnic  relations. Those who think that by making statements abroad a  somewhat different picture of the actual situation may be  created are playing the wrong card. I believe that such problems  are of no threat to Macedonia.    [Tomovski] According to the Constitution, the classical  division of powers exists in Macedonia. How do you assess  relations among the parliament, the head of state, and the  government?    [Andov] I believe that a major step was taken with the  constitutional resolutions according to which the executive  power was granted to the government and the president. A more  secure future and a more stable democratic development demand  that some basic state interests be closely tied to the  president's power. That is why we need a stronger presidential  authority. This can be seen in other democratic countries as  well. In my view, the present division of powers between the  president and the government is not the best possible. Some  changes must be made in the exercise of presidential power in  order to achieve a better stability in the executive branch.  This also means reciprocal responsibility. The parliament can  and does have the right to replace the president. However, the  possibility must be contemplated also of disbanding the  parliament by the president. This would strengthen  responsibility and the balance of power. Presently, the power is  not balanced. At one point, the parliament made the president of  the Republic equal to the parliamentarians. In my view there is  no country in which one drags the name and the functions of the  president in current party quarrels, involving ordinary demands.  Respect must be shown for the institutions. The government is  something different. Within this period of time the situation in  Macedonia has somewhat changed, and we believe that this must be  taken into consideration.    [Tomovski] Is this not in line with the criticism precisely  of the fact that Macedonia is slowly abandoning the basic  definition of parliamentary democracy and switching to a  presidential system?    [Andov] A parliamentary democracy exists also wherever there  is a presidential system. We cannot say that there is no  parliamentary democracy in France today. A parliamentary  democracy should not have any features of self-government and  views about some kind of plebeian democracy, a democracy of the  streets. Such a democracy cannot be considered a government. It  cannot govern and administer the state. It may be of some  importance but only in the course of establishment of the state.  Otherwise, once it is established, there must be a variety of  institutions with a variety of duties.    [Tomovski] The involvement of history in European political  life is being condemned. However, of late efforts are being to  patch former Yugoslavia together; an orthodox association is  being created. This includes the intention of involving  Macedonia.    [Andov] Europe and the rest of the world have tried  everything possible in this area. They tried to have different  states and in Croatia and Bosnia people started fighting and do  not know how to stop it. The appearance of a variety of ideas  cannot be blocked. It is quite important for the world to have a  clear view of our position concerning each one of these ideas.  We have proved, among others, that our withdrawal from former  Yugoslavia indicates that this is a way of preventing the war.  This proved that this was a right step to take. Of the current  options available in Europe this proved to be the right one.  That is why we should not be afraid of ideas expressing the  despair of some circles. What matters is that we have a clear  line well-known to the world. For the time being we are  succeeding and I believe that we shall succeed in the future in  making it known to all.</p>

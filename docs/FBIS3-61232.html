			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Krotkov: "On Chubays in the Role of </F> Grandfather Frost and the Unlucky Sociologists who Asked the  Wrong People"]    [Text] Privatization, about which the reformer vice  premiers have talked so long, has come to pass! Such was the  leitmotiv of the speech of the chairman of the Russian  Federation State Committee on the Administration of State  Property at a press conference in the Russian Federation  Ministry of Foreign Affairs press center on Zubovskaya Ploshchad  in Moscow. It has come to pass despite the oppposition of  functionaries of all bureaucratic levels and all political  forces. Anatoliy Chubays appeared as if in the role of a  Grandfather Frost who had given presents to many Russians.    Today, Anatoliy Chubays declared, 67-70 percent of all  former  state enterprises in the sphere of small-scale privatization  (malaya privatizatsiya) (stores, everyday services, hotels) have  become private. As for large-scale privatization (bolshaya  privatizatsiya), about 11,000 of the 14,500 largest state  enterprises had been registered as joint-stock companies by the  end of the year. More than 600 check investment funds, which  help the citizens of Russia to take advantage of their  privatization checks, are operating in the country. On the whole  about 110 million Russians had already taken advantage of their  privatization checks at the end of 1993. More than 55 million of  the country's citizens have become stock holders, i.e., private  owners.    Some 600-800 check auctions, in the possibility of the  large-scale conducting of which not only our home-bred skeptics  but even many foreign experts even recently did not believe, are  held in Russia every month. More than 7,000 enterprises have  gone through check auctions.    On the basis of all this, the chairman of the State  Committee  on the Administration of State Property concluded, we can give a  firm guarantee that the last privatization check of a Russian  citizen will be utilized by 30 June 1994.    Well, what will happen in July when the voucher disappears,  the journalists asked A. Chubays. To this Anatoliy Borisovich  answered merrily that he personally doesn't like the word  "disappear," but rather--"will triumphantly conclude its  functions"... As for further plans, a new stage of so-called  paid privatization (platnaya privatizatsiya) awaits the country,  when state property will be sold off no longer for privatization  checks issued to everyone free of charge, but solely for money.    "But don't the intentions of the government to give up  voucher privatization from the middle of next year contradict  the idea of the social protection of the citizens of Russia  under reform conditions?"--RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA put such a question  to A. Chubays.    "The government doesn't intend to give up voucher  privatization," Anatoliy Borisovich answered without batting an  eyelid. "On the contrary, it intends to implement in full those  obligations which it voluntarily undertook beginning with the  August (1992) presidential edict which the Supreme Soviet  attempted to revoke three times and which your newspaper and  other such publications repeatedly severely criticized. Our plan  is to discharge our obligations despite any criticism whatever  of any political forces."    And such majestic dignity, such passion for social justice  resounded in these words that my first impulse was to go up to  Anatoliy Borisovich, shake his manly hand and... to confess in  the presence of everyone to all that he would just wish.    But then, when the magic of his words dissipated in the air  of the well ventilated conference hall and those present again  were able to soberly evaluate what had been said from the stage,  an inner voice stopped me: we were talking about different  things. I asked about what will happen from the middle of next  year--that is, after the completion of voucher privatization and  not before it!    And Mister Chubays himself had just now talked again about  the triumphal conclusion of the check's functions. Since  nevertheless the idea of the social protection of the  population, the principle of social justice will then be  fulfilled? Or will only the "money bags" be admitted to the  division of the most tasty remains of the state pie (the  leftovers--the sweetmeats), and will the destitute majority of  Russians, who have created this wealth by their own sweat and  blood, have to just smack their lips at someone else's feast? In  point of fact Mister Chubays simply didn't give an answer to  this question. Why? Is it because he did not catch what in fact  they asked him (with whom doesn't this happen...)? Or because he  had nothing to say essentially? Although one may think that he  answered precisely and clearly: the remaining property will be  sold off for cash. Naturally, to those who have it. Including to  the one who has become rich from machinations with vouchers.    That is why the chief Russian privatizer so coldly "kicked"  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA. And was it not in order to divert the  attention of the hall from problems of social protection and to  turn it to anxious thoughts about perfidious "opponents of  reform"?    The chairman of the Russian Federation State Committee on  the  Administration of State Property continually emphasizes that,  according to the data of sociological surveys, more than 60  percent of Russians simultaneously approve his privatization  offspring. There it is, he says, the people's love, the support  of the people of labor. But if everything is in fact so good,  why then did this strange people vote so in unison against the  "Russia's Choice" bloc, one of whose leaders is the respected  Mister Chubays? Why then did Gaydar, Chubays and others start  fussing so after the elections, promising the people  considerably more concern about their social rights than now?    Or were these promises only words?    As for the favorite references to sociological questions,  then here we haven't a leg to stand on. The fact is that these  same sociologists predicted a smashing victory for "Russia's  Choice" in the elections.    Would it appear that the sociologists are asking the wrong  people?</p>

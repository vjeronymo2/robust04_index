The People's Liberation Army  is a great melting pot which has tempered and cultivated groups  upon groups of outstanding cadres who have superior political  standards, strong organizational and leadership ability, higher  educational backgrounds, considerable professional skills and  knowledge, fine workstyle, and selfless dedication. The group  of cadres who are in the process of being transferred to  civilian work this year will bring new vitality to economic  construction and to other endeavors in various localities.    The letter says: The year 1994 is extremely crucial to the  process of China's reform, opening up, and modernization.

Successfully resettling  military cadres in the civilian sectors is a matter of vital  importance to this general task and of great significance for  promoting army building and economic construction, ensuring  military and social stability, and promoting the smooth  development of reform and opening up. Party committees and  governments at all levels should take the resettlement work as  an important political task and earnestly carry it out  accordingly. They should do everything possible to overcome  difficulties and successfully resettle and place every military  cadre transferred to civilian sectors so that each has a role to  play and each can display his talent. Comrades in the military  should show understanding and sympathy for the difficulties of  the localities and actively consult and closely coordinate with  them to successfully carry out the work together.</p>

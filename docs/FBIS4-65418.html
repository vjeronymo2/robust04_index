			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report entitled: "Claims About Bombed Villages on Turkish </F> Parliamentary Agenda"]    [Text] Selim Sadaq, pro-Kurdish Democracy Party (DEP)  deputy from Sirnak, has brought on the parliamentary agenda the  allegations that villages in the province of Sirnak were bombed  by war planes on March 25-26 and that 48 people were killed in  the bombings.    In the interrogatory motion he presented on Friday [13 May]  to the Office of the Parliament Speaker, Sadak asked Interior  Minister Nahit Mentese to respond to those claims.    He said according to the claims of the villagers and local  sources, the villages of Caglayan and Hisar annexed to the town  of Cizre, the villages of Kusagili and Beave annexed to the  Sirnak city center, the village of Kuskonar annexed to the town  of Guclukonak and the village of Sapaca annexed to the town of  Uludere town had been bombed by Turkish warplanes.    In his motion, Sadak claimed that there were allegations  that  48 people had been killed and that the names of all the deceased  could not be determined due to the migration of the villagers.    He listed the names of the people who he claimed were  identified as having been killed in the bombings as follows:    "The village of Kuskonar: Mehmet Benzer (30), Ali Benzer  (25), Omer Benzer (10), Nurettin Benzer (7), Cicek Benzer (2),  Ayse Benzer (35), Ayse Benzer (30), Elmas Yiuldirim (50), Serfie  Yildirim (30), Baharuk Yildirim (13), Melese Yildirim (14),  Saban Yildirim (4), Mirza Yildirim (2), Cicek Yildirim (2),  Irfan Yildirim (4), Krem Yildirim (2), Fecire Altan (40), Haci  Altan (10), Kedin Altan (3), Mahmut Aygur (65), Adil Aygur (18),  Ayse Aygur (18), Ibrahim Burak (50), Anna Burak (50), Omer  Kalkan (40). Those who were wounded in this village are  Suleyman Benzer (4), Rasit Benzer (4), Fatma Benzer (30) and  Asya Benzer (30).    "The village of Kusagili: Serve Kacar (100), Xoxe Kacar  (60),  Masallah Kacar (17), Ahmet Kacar (baby), Hasan Kacar (baby),  Ayse Bengin (60), Nuriye Bengin (14), Fatma Bedir (6), Leyla  Erdinc (baby), Zahide Kilinc (baby) and an unidentified  villager. Those who were wounded are Sehristan Kacar, Behiye  Bengin, Bahar Bengin, Netise Bengin, Halil Aykac, Mehmet Aykac,  Hatice Bayir, Husnu Kirac, Zulfu Bengin, Cafer Kacar and Bedri  Ardin."    Sadak inquired whether or not Mentese had launched an  investigation into the bombing incidents which resulted in the  death of 48 people and the wounding of more than 100. His  motion contained the following questions:    "More than one month has elapsed since the incidents. Has  your office launched any investigation?    "If an investigation has been conducted, have the people who  suffered from the bombing been interviewed?    "Do you agree with the statement that the bombs were dropped  mistakenly? If you do, do you play to compensate for the  damages suffered by those people?    "If a `deliberate' action led to the massacre or  `negligence'  caused the disaster, has anyone been prosecuted or punished?    "Do you play to take serious action and enlighten the public  about this issue? If those who gave instructions to bomb are  not brought to the surface, it will be very difficult for the  people to become motivated to be loyal to the administration."</p>

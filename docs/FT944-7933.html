			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: Australis in US studio deal Australis, the Australian company which has pledged to become the country's first supplier of pay-TV services next year, announced yesterday it had reached agreement with three Hollywood studios for a supply of films to air on its two movie channels. Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment and Universal Pictures/MCA have entered the partnership with TCI, the US cable company which already has an investment in Australis. The link-up, in which all parties have an equal share, will have exclusive Australian rights to the studios' output and libraries for five and a half years. There will be an option to extend this agreement for a further five years after that. The movies will feed two of the channels which Australis proposes to launch next year: one will be for first-run films and the other for films released over the past three decades. The two channels will be run by a TCI affiliate at the outset, and then be transfered to Australis 'after the start-up phase'. The Australian company said it had agreed to allot the studios options to acquire Australis convertible debentures at ADollars 1.40 each. The options, which are exercisable within 27 months, will not exceed 10 per cent of the company's convertible debenture stock. It has also agreed to allot 875,000 shares each to TCI and Mr Gerry Lenfest, head of the company through which TCI's Australis stake is held. The price will be ADollars 1.33. Australis, a new company running only small-scale narrow-cast subscription services at present, holds one of the two commercially-available satellite licences in Australia, and has said it will start offering pay-TV services from the beginning of 1995. However, some of the country's established media players - such as Mr Rupert Murdoch and Mr Kerry Packer - have recently signed alliances with telecommunications companies developing rival cable networks.</p>

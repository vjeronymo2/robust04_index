			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Isotron recovers in second half Profits before tax of Isotron, the Wiltshire-based irradiation service company, amounted to Pounds 2.74m for the year to June 30, a fall of just 2.5 per cent on last time's Pounds 2.81m. The directors said the result reflected a 'significant improvement in performance' during the second half. They pointed out that pre-tax profits, down by 10 per cent at mid-term, expanded 5 per cent in the second six months. Earnings worked through at 14.8p (15.1p) and a final dividend of 2.57p makes a 3.94p (3.59p) total. Mr Colin Clive, chairman, said the group ended the year with a strong balance sheet, nil debt and cash of Pounds 3.8m.</p>

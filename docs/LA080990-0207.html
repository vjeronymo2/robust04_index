			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARRISH HOMER GIVES ANGELS WIN IN 11TH  </P> <P> Dave Winfield's seventh-inning error opened the way for a four-run Boston rally  Wednesday night, but the Red Sox had no closer, and the Angels walked through  the door to grab an 8-6 victory on Lance Parrish's two-run home run with two  out in the 11th inning.  </P> <P> Ending an 0-for-21 slump that included 10 strikeouts, Parrish hit a 1-and-2  pitch from Dennis Lamp -- Boston's fourth pitcher -- into the left-field seats  after Brian Downing had singled to left. The home run, Parrish's 18th, gave him  52 runs batted in this season, two more than he had last season. It gave Willie  Fraser his third victory to balance three losses, and it ended the 4-hour  6-minute game at Anaheim Stadium, which drew 29,362.  </P> <P> The Red Sox, whose bullpen lost Jeff Reardon to back surgery last week, saw  their American League East lead over Toronto cut to one game.  </P> <P> The Angels capitalized on the shakiness of Boston's bullpen to score three  times in the eighth and tie the game in the ninth on Max Venable's two-out,  pinch-hit single.  </P> <P> Winfield led off the eighth with a single to left and scored on Lee Stevens'  double to right-center. Downing scored Stevens for his second RBI of the game  with a single to right. Parrish popped up and Dick Schofield walked, and the  Red Sox went to reliever Rob Murphy. Angel Manager Doug Rader sent Dante  Bichette to hit for Luis Polonia, and Bichette came through with a single to  center that scored Downing.  </P> <P> The Angels tied the game in dramatic fashion. Winfield walked but was thrown  out at second on Stevens' fielder's choice. Downing walked, moving Stevens to  second and inducing Boston to bring in Lamp (3-4). The veteran right-hander  struck out Parrish, but Venable singled, scoring Stevens.  </P> <P> In scoring for the fourth time, Stevens tied a club record for most runs scored  in a game.  </P> <P> This came on a day when right field provided no refuge for Winfield.  </P> <P> After being besieged by reporters to comment on a Sports Illustrated story  alleging that he had bet on sports events, Winfield escaped interrogation when  the game began.  </P> <P> But he couldn't avoid trouble, misplaying Carlos Quintana's seventh-inning fly  ball to help Boston score four unearned runs that gave the Red Sox a 6-2 lead.  </P> <P> Kirk McCaskill had settled down after a rocky start and seemed on solid ground  in the seventh after yielding a one-out single to rookie Tim Naehring.  McCaskill struck out Jody Reed. Then, Quintana hit a fly ball to right that  dropped between Winfield's glove and his hand for an error that allowed  Naehring to score the go-ahead run.  </P> <P> Wade Boggs added a run-scoring double, and Ellis Burks and Dwight Evans each  contributed run-scoring singles.  </P> <P> Naehring had his first four-hit game, and Boggs extended his hitting streak to  11 games.  </P> <P> The Angels scored three times in the eighth off Greg Harris, Jerry Reed and  Murphy.  </P> <P> McCaskill allowed only two earned runs but fell to 1-6 with one no-decision in  his last eight starts.  </P> <P> McCaskill yielded two runs in the first, but slick fielding helped limit the  damage.  </P> <P> Reed led off with a sharp single to center and was forced at second when second  baseman Donnie Hill made a fine diving stop on Quintana's shot to the right  side. Boggs moved within 70 hits of his eighth consecutive 200-hit season when  he singled to right, moving Quintana to second. Burks followed with another  single to right, scoring Quintana and moving Boggs to third.  </P> <P> McCaskill dodged danger by getting Mike Greenwell to hit into a force play and  Evans to fly to Hill in short right field. That was a temporary lull, as Tom  Brunansky opened the second with a single to right. But again, the Angels'  infield came through. Hill turned Tony Pena's grounder into a force on  Brunansky and after Naehring singled and Reed popped up, Kent Anderson turned a  force play on Quintana's grounder to third.  </P> <P> Stevens cut the Angels' deficit to 2-1 with his leadoff homer in the second, a  drive to the right of the 404-foot sign in center field. The home run was his  fourth in the major leagues.  </P> <P> McCaskill helped his own cause in the sixth. After walking Burks, the leadoff  hitter, he made a fine pickoff move that got Burks by a wide margin. Greenwell  singled but Evans popped up and Brunansky struck out.  </P> <P> The Angels repaid him by tying the game in the sixth.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> The Angels delayed activating Chili Davis and returning pitcher Joe Grahe to  triple-A Edmonton in order to ensure their starting staff is at full strength.  Bert Blyleven missed his last turn after four members of his family were in a  car accident and Chuck Finley has been absent since Sunday, when he returned to  Louisiana for the funeral of his 8-month-old nephew. Manager Doug Rader said  the move could come today, once Finley returns and Blyleven is judged ready to  start Friday. "Chili's not going to go on rehab, so we can work him extra hard  another day," Rader said. . . . The return of reliever Bob McClure is also  imminent. McClure, who has yet to pitch this season because of elbow problems,  appeared ready after a good simulated inning Wednesday.  </P></p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): High rollers and basement bargains - A look at two motor manufacturers using a similar approach to sell very different types of car What can you buy for Pounds 87,549.25? When it comes to motor cars, that will pick up the cheapest Bentley from Rolls-Royce, or just about 13 bottom of the range models from Proton, the Malaysian manufacturer. From the highly expensive to the unashamedly bargain-priced, both manufacturers face a tricky marketing problem. How do they identify, target and ultimately persuade their relatively small markets - less than 1 per cent of the UK market in each case - to buy their vehicles during some of the most adverse trading conditions for the motor industry of recent years? The answer is that both Proton and Rolls-Royce have adopted an advertising approach which, while different in style, tries to reassure rather than cajole potential buyers, offering them security in the purchasing decision rather than pushing hard-sell techniques. The two manufacturers are very different. Proton, which only started marketing its cars in the UK in 1989, is a Japanese-Malaysian hybrid aiming itself solidly at the purchaser who wants a family-sized car at a small car price. Since producing its first car in 1904, Rolls-Royce has developed an image as quintessentially the last word in expensive and exclusive British craftsmanship, with more than 60 per cent of all the cars it has ever made still roadworthy. When it comes to marketing, Rolls-Royce has long maintained a brand image of exclusiveness, but latterly that had taken on a feel of aloofness. The company is sensitive to criticism that its product is perhaps out of tune with austere times and that its recent image has become tainted with somewhat vulgar 'new' rather than quality 'old' money. But the impact of collapsed sales in 1991 - down to 1,722 units from 3,333 in 1990 - meant that the company needed to rethink both production and marketing strategies. It has brought costs into line with sales by shedding 35 per cent of its workforce over the last two years. Michael Donovan, commercial managing director, says its break-even point is now 'way south of 1,500 units a year'. Donovan argues that as far as profitability goes, the company has turned the corner. But image is still a vital asset requiring careful nurture. In July Rolls-Royce hired a new advertising agency, Edwards Martin Thornton, to brush up its image through a press advertising campaign between August-November. Bob Edwards, managing director of Edwards Martin Thornton, says: 'There was a perception that their technical prowess was lacking. That had little to do with Rolls-Royce, rather it was competing manufacturers who began stressing technology, whereas Rolls-Royce had never actually made a case for technology.' Donovan says that almost 80 per cent of Rolls-Royce and Bentley owners say they are going to buy another. But despite that loyalty, Rolls-Royce had become vulnerable to a combination of developing technology, consumer mood change and some clever advertising. Edwards says that competitors, particularly in the US, attacked Rolls-Royce at its weak spots: price and image. 'The price gap was perceived to be widening. That was true to some extent but exaggerated,' he says. 'Cars like Lexus (from Toyota) were coming on to the market with an on-the-road price in the US of about Dollars 40,000 (Pounds 26,300), with features which were arguably comparable with Rolls-Royce. And the emotional side of the Lexus campaign - the advertising headline in the US was 'Flaunt your intelligence, not your wealth' - was perfectly capturing a new mood. 'Rolls-Royce does not sit comfortably in the new recessionary atmosphere, particularly at the corporate level when you have to report losses to shareholders.' Edwards, rather rarely for an advertising executive, holds a fairly commonsense view of the limits to advertising. 'We said (to Rolls-Royce): 'An advertising campaign can't change those sorts of values, but what you can do is at least say something and have a point of view. If you remain silent, then you are effectively saying all that is true. This is not a time to be irresolute.' We told them not to apologise for what they are trying to do.' Next week Rolls-Royce will meet Edwards to assess the success of the press campaign, which has cost around Pounds 350,000. Even if Rolls-Royce decides to pause from advertising, other means of marketing will continue. Donovan declines to discuss what his marketing budget is but points out that advertising is not more than 10 per cent of total marketing spending. 'We use sporting events sponsorship and personalised advertising,' he says. 'We jointly run sponsored events at the Hong Kong jockey club, and sponsor yachting and polo events in US and Japan. In September in the US we ran an event at the normally closed Forbes estate, because the Forbes family are owners of our products, at which we shared with them our customer base. 'It was a weekend event which gave people an opportunity to experience a piece of North American success that they, even though they are wealthy and successful themselves, may aspire to.' Far from the Forbes estate end of personalised marketing lies Proton Cars UK, the local agent for the Mitsubishi-engineered, Malaysian-styled range of Protons. In the UK Proton has adopted a classic approach to press advertising - lots of detailed copy which tries to answer every conceivable question a customer might pose - in complete contrast to the cool confidence of the Rolls-Royce campaign. Proton's UK sales were 14,000 in 1991 and will reach about 15,000 this year. David Brown, founder, chairman and chief executive of Proton Cars UK, expects annual sales of 20,000 by 1995. While there are no plans to sell the cars in North America, Brown will start marketing (through a separate company) the Proton range in continental Europe in 1994, with estimated sales of 25,000 in the first full year. In the UK Proton still benefits from full exemption from import duties, an advantage which runs until the end of 1993. At its plant outside Kuala Lumpur Proton aims to be producing 150,000 units by 1995; the company has acknowledged that its export drive is vital to its continued success, one reason behind Proton UK's estimated Pounds 8m advertising spending in the year to June 1992. Although at almost opposite ends of the price range, there are common elements in the marketing strategies of both Rolls-Royce and Proton. Proton's marketing makes great play of offering a package of value-for-money extras such as zero interest on financing, two years' free insurance cover and a six-year mechanical warranty. Brown says that in addition, 'a very aggressive dealer network, with dual franchising arrangements with other dealers such as Ford, Volvo, Rover and Saab giving the customer personal service and back-up' aims at reassuring customers. For both Proton and Rolls-Royce, future successful marketing thus appears to lie not so much in revolutionary new advertising but in achieving harmony between costs and sales, as well as ensuring that their respective messages are correctly targeted. For Donovan, 'it's not an elephant gun, it's a night-sight sniper approach to identifying prospective owners and putting to them our proposition, bringing them together to a point of marriage rather than a point of sale.' Though Brown eschews that romantic metaphor, he also views marketing techniques as being fundamentally about reassurance rather than persuasion, showing 'a well-built, quality vehicle at a great price. A car which is not pretending to be state-of-the-art, up-to-date, leading-edge technology but aimed at the family man.'</p>

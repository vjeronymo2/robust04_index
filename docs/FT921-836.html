			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Management: All change at Barclays, if they can manage IT - The bank's plan to educate a generation of computer-literate managers Joseph De Feo is blunt about what needs to be done at Barclays to forge a successful partnership between its basic banking business and computer technology. 'We are re-defining what it is to be a business manager,' says the bank's American-born director of Information Technology (IT) and Services Businesses. The future of banking, he believes, is tied to the successful management of the computer technology which has come to dominate the financial services industry. So, he argues, Barclays 'must raise a generation of IT literate managers who have the fundamental skills to manage this technology and who are not afraid of it'. But training is just one of a series of changes Barclays has been implementing in an attempt to maximise the benefits of IT, and bridge the chasm between the back-office technicians and the front-line business managers. These problems are not unique to Barclays, or even the financial services sector, although Barclays' IT operations are particularly large. The bank has a worldwide computer staff of 6,000, with 3,200 in the UK alone, and a total annual IT expenditure of Pounds 1bn. But in many large organisations, the introduction of computers over the past 25 years has raised issues which are only now beginning to be tackled. As De Feo himself acknowledges, in the early days IT was regarded as something of a 'black art,' whose practitioners 'worship at the alter of technology'. In many organisations the move to computerisation generated tensions and what De Feo calls 'the tyranny loop'. This began with a gulf between users and practitioners. The users had insufficient understanding of IT and became frustrated with the poor quality of the service, while the experts, who knew little of the business, became frustrated because the users were unable to articulate their requirements. Over time, experts became used to directing the way IT would be used and found it difficult to be more responsive. As a result, the contribution computers could make to the business was diluted, while the costs continued to escalate. Some companies have sought to overcome these problems by adopting a firm, centralised grip over IT activities. But De Feo argues that such an approach is 'extremely difficult' in complex organisations like Barclays where line business managers have a high degree of autonomy. Instead, Barclays has adopted a new approach which includes devolving some computer functions into the main business areas of the bank, and introducing competition into other IT services. To provide a 'unifying management philosophy' for the changes, Barclays selected total quality management (TQM) because, says De Feo, 'people understand what TQM means . . . it does not mean building a Rolls Royce when the customer wants a Ford. It means delivering what the customer wants'. To ensure that IT is kept at the forefront of management thinking, a new IT board has been formed. It is chaired not by an IT executive, but by Andrew Buxton, Barclays group managing director - a move designed not only to underline senior management's commitment to the restructuring of IT operations but also to emphasise its central role in improving Barclays' competitiveness. The IT board is made up of the heads of all the business units and is responsible for IT policies across the group. Beneath the board sits the Group IT Executive (Gite), comprising all Barclays' IT executives, and Group Information Systems Technology (Gist) a core group whose 350 staff are in charge of technical issues such as architecture and standards, tracking important projects, and providing the central benchmarks against which all IT issues are measured. However, the most important change introduced after a review by Nolan Norton, part of KPMG Management Consulting, has been to split up the old Centralised Information Systems Department and 'devolve' the 1,500 systems development and end-user staff. These staff now make up individual IT units attached to each of the group's main business divisions. There were, however, some IT functions which Barclays decided should remain centralised, in order to obtain economies of scale, while at the same time introducing a new element of competition. Two new units, Barclays Computer Operations (BCO), responsible for managing the bank's UK computer systems, and Barclays Network Services (BNS), responsible for its voice and data telecommunications services, have been set up as quasi-commercial business units. 'We have created two business units but put them under direct commercial pressure,' says De Feo. The aim is to make the two units bid on the basis of price, quality and service in competition with outside service suppliers for internal Barclays work. They will also be permitted to act as Facilities Management (FM) companies, offering their services to external customers, although De Feo emphasises Barclays has 'reasonably modest ambitions' in this area. De Feo also plans to develop a measure for the value added by IT to the business. 'It has to be real value in terms of meeting customer requirements,' he says. In some areas, De Feo says, a 'sharper' attitude is already apparent. However, he accepts that it may take years before it is possible to assess whether Barclays' bold attempt to change its IT culture has been a success. In the meantime, the initiative is being closely watched by other companies which have yet to tackle the issue.</p>

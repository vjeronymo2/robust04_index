			<p>BFN     [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis today said  that yesterday, President Glavkos Kliridhis sent personal  letters to U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime  Minister John Major on the latest developments in the Cyprus  issue and the continuing negotiations at the UN Security  Council. Asked why the letters were sent to these two specific  leaders, Kasoulidhis said the United States and Britain are the  two powers that have recently moved toward the alternative of  continuing the confidence-building measures [CBM's].  Kasoulidhis said: Kliridhis' letters aim to promote our side's  positions.    Answering another question, the spokesman said Kliridhis'  letter to Russian President Boris Yeltsin, which was conveyed by  Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis during his visit in Moscow,  had the same goal. The spokesman said meetings have been held  on the same issue with France and China.    President Kliridhis and the foreign minister met the U.S.  and  British ambassadors in Nicosia.</p>

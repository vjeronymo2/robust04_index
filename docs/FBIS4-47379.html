S. Nesterov, RF Hydrometeorological </F> Scientific Research Center; UDC 551.465.632:551.509.33(261.1)]    [Abstract] The long-range prediction of ocean surface  temperature anomalies (OSTA) in individual regions of the North  Atlantic by use of the group analogues (GRAN) method is  described. Such a prediction can be made in either a categorical  or a probabilistic form. The ``Prognoz'' on-line databank of the  Russian Hydrometeorological Center was used as the data source,  especially the ROWS database containing information on the  fields of mean monthly ocean surface temperature, surface  pressure, 500-gPa geopotential surface and other parameters for  a multiyear period. The basic principles for long-range  prediction of OSTA as applicable to the GRAN method are  outlined. A number of prognostic experiments were carried for  testing the scheme. The purpose was an evaluation of the success  of the prediction as a function of the makeup of the predictors.  The various predictors used are discussed. It was found that the  prognostic scheme gives the greatest gain in the case of quite  large anomalies (in comparison with climatic and inertial  predictions). The GRAN method also gives information which can  be used in determining the processes involved in formation of  temperature anomalies in the ocean. Predictions were prepared  for 10 of the largest OSTA observed between 1957 and 1991. The  results are given in a table. As a specific example, the results  for one region for January 1983 also are given. The experiments  clearly indicate that the group analogues scheme can be used  successfully for long-range prediction of ocean water  temperature and in some cases may be preferable to a categorical  prediction. The method can be further improved by adjusting the  predictors to the current process and varying them from  prediction to prediction. Figures 2; references: 12 Russian.</p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Observer: The silver spoon mob Whilst the world's media is focusing on the D-Day ceremonies another group of veterans slipped into London over the weekend. The big cheeses of the banking world are in town for a week of conferring and merry-making and keeping them happy is almost as big a challenge, in terms of logistics and protocol, as organising the Normandy beach parties. Forget Royal Ascot, Wimbledon and Henley. The highlight of the summer season for a banker is the International Monetary Conference where the bosses of the top banks hob-nob with central bankers behind closed doors whilst their spouses hit the tourist sights. Hosting an IMC meeting is the banking equivalent of winning the Olympics. Last year Stockholm did it, and it was Seattle's turn this year. But London jumped the queue because the IMC wanted to honour the tercentenary of the Bank of England with its presence. London's bankers have responded magnificently. The Bank of England has laid on a concert (including a specially commissioned Geoffrey Burgon number) and NatWest chairman Lord Alexander has got the Queen and her husband to throw a cocktail party at Buckingham Palace. Bankers are even being allowed to turn up in lounge suits. However, the British hosts are not allowing standards to slip too far. Not only are they insisting on a proper seating plan for the dinner at Whitehall's Banqueting House but they're also presenting each delegate with a special gift from Garrard &amp; Co, the Crown jewellers - a silver spoon. How very appropriate.</p>

			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Dollar strength helps blue chip shares THE recovery in UK equities gathered pace yesterday as a strong dollar encouraged overseas earners and the political troubles of the UK government revived hopes for a cut in domestic interest rates. Economic data showing a rise in consumer credit but only modest growth in producer prices also buttressed the stock market's hopes for inflation-free expansion in the UK economy. A final flurry of optimism came in London when Wall Street gained 25 Dow points in early trade. The FT-SE 100 Index broke through the 2,800 mark again in fine style, closing 36.1 up at 2,829.8, the best of the day. But trading volume was fairly modest at 587.5m shares, against 614.7m on Friday, and most of the interest was in the Footsie-listed blue chips. ICI was a strong feature as fund managers finalised positions ahead of the pricing tomorrow of the Pounds 1.3bn rights issue of Zeneca shares. A US house was believed to be operating a sizeable programme trade involving investment in both UK and European equities. Firmness in stock index futures followed the underlying stock market rather than leading it; last week's selling of the Footsie June future, said to be by an institution moving from equities into UK gilts, had evidently been completed. The political uproar following last week's voting setback for Mr John Major's government at both local and national electoral levels, culminating in revived calls for the removal of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, rebounded in the stock market's favour. The pressure on the government, it was thought, might force out the cut in UK base rates of which the City of London has felt cheated. But London equity traders sounded unimpressed by the base rate suggestions, and pointed to the dollar's strength as the chief factor behind yesterday's rise in share prices. The pharmaceuticals, oils and tobacco sectors all stood out strongly for this reason. Domestic stocks focused more on the Pounds 232m rise in consumer lending in April, the largest monthly increase for two years. A number of important retail groups are due to report progress over the next fortnight, including Marks and Spencer, Grand Metropolitan and Allied-Lyons, and the stock market is looking, yet again, for evidence that consumers are providing the driving force behind the economic recovery. With attention returning to the Footsie-listed stocks, the performance from the FT-SE Mid 250 Index was less striking. At 3,125.6, the Mid 250 was up by 16.1, or 0.5 per cent, compared with the gain of around 1.3 per cent on the Footsie. Market strategists remained optimistic towards equities. NatWest Securities continued to urge clients to 'buy into weakness'. While holding its Footsie range forecast unchanged at 2,700-3,000 for this year, NatWest has raised its 1994 target from 3,200 to 3,300. Strauss Turnbull, London securities arm of Societe Generale, is raising its GDP forecast for this year to 2 per cent and for 1994 to 3.1 per cent. It is lifting its end-1994 Footsie target to 2,900. Strauss has also become more optimistic on UK interest rates as the Bundesbank continues to signal its intention to cut German rates.</p>

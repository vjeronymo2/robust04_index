			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW: MK'S;  </P> <P> FIRST IMPRESSION;  </P> <P> A HUSBAND-AND-WIFE TEAM OFFERS PROFESSIONAL SERVICE AND TOP-QUALITY FOOD AT NEW  RESTAURANT.  </P> <P> The word on the street: MK's is hot. But on a recent late summer afternoon,  walking into the restaurant's courtyard for the first time, I found MK's to be  an oasis. A warm breeze flowed through the patio as the sun sent shadows  dancing across the restaurant's desert-colored walls.  </P> <P> The restaurant is the creation of two MK's: Michelle Katherine Sandoval and  Martin Kenneth Gay. They're the husband-and-wife team who previously operated  the successful Voila in Ventura. Voila's success may have created a sense of  anticipation for the Sandoval-Gay project.  </P> <P> Now that MK's is open for business, it's frequently packed -- both with locals  and out-of-towners. But reservations are usually easy to get. And the service  is friendly and professional. Sandoval, who is usually seen moving about the  restaurant, seems to have done a first-class job in training her staff to be  responsive to customers.  </P> <P> Her husband runs the kitchen, and some of his dishes are very, very good.  There's seafood Vera Cruz, full of fresh salmon and scallops, prawn-size  shrimp, olives and fresh mushrooms in a salsa wine sauce. And there's an  impressive "grazing platter" of grilled vegetables, grains, soft cheese,  chutney, salsa and an occasional surprise or two. In his penne vodka, Gay takes  a vodka and cream sauce, adds sun-dried tomatoes and reduces the mixture down  so it's not cloyingly heavy, as white sauces often are.  </P> <P> His pork chops are stuffed with a carefully seasoned mixture of apples, raisins  and almonds, then flamed in a Madeira sauce.  </P> <P> Once, when I ordered the grilled chicken breast marinated in tequila, I did get  an overcooked piece of meat. But the waiter very graciously took the chicken  back and replaced it with a juicy breast that did justice to its tequila sauce.  </P> <P> There are a couple of so-so dishes. The chopped salad with sun-dried tomatoes,  for instance, forces one to look carefully for the tomato hidden among the  greens. And MK's fideo, vermicelli cooked in a chicken broth with vegetables,  was surprisingly bland.  </P> <P> But there is great bread here -- perfect, fresh cracked wheat bread that MK's  gets from a small wholesale operation in Ojai called Monica's.  </P> <P> And there's always dessert. You'll go far before finding a better apricot  cobbler. Its pastry is soaked with apricot juices and it's not too sweet. This  is the sort of dish that could take even a non-dessert person right to the  edge.  </P> <P> * WHERE AND WHEN: MK's in Ojai, 139 E. Ojai Ave., Ojai. (805) 640-8001.

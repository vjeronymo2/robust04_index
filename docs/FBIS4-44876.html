			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Miwako Doi, Mika Fukui, and Nobuko Kato] </F>   [Text]  <H5>  1. Foreword </H5>   In the planning and design process for industrial products  and interior space, mock-ups and small models were prepared and  the situation of their use and the problems when used were  examined.    With the advances in computers in recent years, CG has been  introduced and has been used for presentations to clients. In  this field, a graphic image is primary and an image prepared by  CG is recorded frame by frame, and an image for the presentation  is prepared.    On the other hand, virtual reality technology (also called  VR: virtual reality, AR: artificial reality, or VE: virtual  environment) effecting the sense that one is in a  computer-generated world has been gathering  attention.[.sup]1[/] VR has been applied in fields such as  virtual surgery, education, and entertainment, and attempts for  application in the design process are being made.[.sup]2,3[/]  In VR, since interaction is important, the data used is very  simple. Therefore, the problem is that the image quality  attained is not sufficient for actually performing design review  with the customer.    Discussed here is a virtual prototyping system[.sup]5[/]  which performs interactive instrument layout, using a high speed  display algorithm[.sup]4[/] which can maintain high image  quality and also effect interaction. The virtual prototyping  system uses three-dimensional CAD data and can also make various  arrangements; it has also made a prototype for a central  operations room of a power plant. The example introduced here is  of application to the new and old CT scanning (computer layer  imaging equipment) room at the Toshiba Hospital.  <H5>  2. Virtual prototyping system </H5>   The virtual prototyping system has the following  characteristics.    1. High quality display using three-dimensional CAD data    2. High speed display due to simplified layering    3. Interactive viewpoint indication and arrangement    4. Restrictions concerning material arrangement in the  three-dimensional space    These characteristics are explained below.  <H5>  2.1 High quality display </H5>   In order to support interaction, the three-dimensional CG  model used in traditional VR is extremely simplified to several  hundred polygons (Three-dimensional CG model data is often  displayed as a collection of polygons when drawn, the number of  those polygons shows the complexity of the model). The model  used in usual CG (when taken frame by frame, it can be seen as  animation) has several tens of polygons, but models having  several hundred polygons are used in VR in order to increase  drawing speed. Therefore, image quality is poor and the sense of  reality is lost.    In this virtual system, three-dimensional CAD data is used  as  is in order to compensate for the lack of this sense of reality.  The dxf format data which is becoming the industrial standard is  converted to a form which can be handled in the graphic library  (GL) on the SGI graphics workstation (GWS). As a result, the  high image quality display can be attained as VR as shown in the  frontispiece. In order to increase the sense of presence, an  actual output image is on the monitor screen of the console  (texture mapping) and interior shadows are also made.    Figure 1 shows the subject of the new and old CT scanning  rooms in Toshiba Hospital. The console and the CT were prepared  with three-dimensional CAD based on the designs. The desk and  chair used were already input from prior prototypes.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-17A>      Figure 1. Old and new CT scanning rooms in Toshiba Hospital. </FIG>   CT prepared with three-dimensional CAD were arranged  in the new and old scanning rooms in Toshiba Hospital. (a) Old  scanning room, (b) New scanning room&lt;/graphic&gt;     The three-dimensional CAD data run on GWS just indicates the  arrangement on the arrangement editor and has the advantage that  a scanning room as in Figure 1 can be constructed even without  special knowledge of CG since the three-dimensional space as in  Figure 1 can be attained.  <H5>  2.2 High Speed Display </H5>   If a model of ten times the complexity is to be drawn, the  drawing time increases ten times. In order to resolve this  issue, speed is increased by simplified layering.[.sup]4[/]    Simplified layering uses the fact that the discrimination of  fine sections is lessened since the on-screen surface area of  objects far from the point of view becomes small. In effect, the  image quality is retained as the far objects are simplified and  the near objects are displayed with more precision. This  simplification is performed automatically or selectively.  <H5>  2.3 Interactive Viewpoint Indication and Arrangement </H5>   When three-dimensional CAD data is run, one can see from  various points of view (walk through) inside the virtual space  of the scanning room displayed with high image quality by  simplified layering. Concretely, one can interactively indicate  the position from which to see using an input device such as the  VPL Co. DataGlove[.sup]TM[/]. Figure 1 shows a view from  almost directly above. On the other hand, by designating the  point of view seen from when the radiologist is working, it can  be confirmed whether the radiologist can verify the condition of  the patient. Also, not just seeing, but interactively changing  the arrangement of the instruments is possible. The operation of  the arrangement change is easiest when performed from a bird's  eye view (seen from directly above) so that the entire space can  be viewed.    With this virtual system as above, the place can be seen  from  various perspectives and the conditions of use can be examined  at the clients' request during design review. Furthermore, since  the arrangement of the place can be changed if inconvenient and  the results can be verified on the spot, the efficiency of the  design process can be greatly improved.  <H5>  2.4 Restrictions Concerning the Arrangement of Objects in </H5> Three-Dimensional space    With just the simple transfer of objects, they interfere  (sinking in together) and desks and tables float in space since  three-dimensional CG data are without substance and the physical  laws do not operate. Arrangement with care so that this does not  happen in three-dimensional space is rather difficult. However,  when interference checks are correctly performed and physical  laws are calculated in order to resolve this, the calculation  load is high and interaction cannot be supported.    With this virtual prototyping system, the interference check  is just performed for the bottom surface of objects in order to  perform interference checks with a low calculation load. Also,  in order to prevent things floating in midair, discrimination  between interior and exterior is performed when the objects are  arranged. Thus, desks and tables are on the floor and laptop  personal computers are on the desks. Since the restrictions are  satisfied on the spot, the arrangement can easily be changed  while interaction is maintained.  <H5>  3. Test case applied to Toshiba Hospital </H5>   Renewal is necessary following the technical advance of  medical instruments like CT. There are cases of newly making  scanning rooms as well as using the original scanning rooms. In  either case, customers with different perspectives such as  doctors, radiologists, and nurses work in the scanning room. In  order to design a scanning room with good conditions for use, it  is necessary to reflect the voices of these clients, but  presently, they are busy with their daily duties and cannot take  time. Furthermore, the patients are the most important clients,  but since they have health problems, they generally don't want  to contribute to the design.    The virtual prototyping system was applied to the new and  old  CT scanning rooms at Toshiba Hospital as a test case to clarify  such problems. Figure 1 and the frontispiece show the output.  The CG models of the CT and consoles are the same in the new and  old scanning rooms. In the old scanning room, the CT was  arranged at right angles to the console because of the  relationship between the exit and the size of the room.  Therefore, when the radiologist was interviewed, it was  indicated that it is difficult to see the patient when operating  the console. On the other hand, since the room is large, the new  scanning room has the CT placed at an angle so that the entire  body of the patient can be verified (frontispiece).  <H5>  4. Conclusion </H5>   A virtual prototyping system which can be used in design  review was realized with high image quality, high display speed,  interactive viewpoint indication and arrangement, and physical  restrictions to arrangement. With this, the problems can be  evaluated and corrected on the spot while the clients and  technicians directly view the same information. This system was  applied to the scanning rooms at Toshiba Hospital.    In the future, virtual prototyping technology will be  introduced with simulation applied to problems like the  reflected simulation of a ceiling light developed separately and  be applied to various types of examples. At the same time, we  would like to establish it as evaluation technology[.sup]6[/]  including work in real space.  Footnotes    1. M. Hirose, Editor: Virtual Reality Applications Strategy,  Ohm Co.

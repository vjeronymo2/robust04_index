			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Panel freezes bid for Wilkes THE TAKEOVER Panel last night took the unusual step of freezing Petrocon's hostile bid for fellow engineering company James Wilkes while it made inquiries, Petrocon's advisers, Robert Fleming said last night. The ruling means that Petrocon's Pounds 35m bid will not lapse until the result of the inquiry and neither will Petrocon be able to receive anymore acceptances unless it manages to receive an extension to the offer. The Panel's move is a highly unusual finale to a bid marked by unedifying claims from both sides about each other's inability to manage. Petrocon and Robert Fleming, appear to have complained to the Panel that Wilkes and NM Rothschilds, its advisers, had passed additional information to two shareholders who had previously backed Petrocon's bid in an unusual public letter. Rothschilds and Wilkes have denied the charges. One institutional shareholder, Baring Brothers, which had signed the letter of support for Petrocon was understood to have reversed its decision and decided to stick with the Wilkes management. Another of the institutional signatories, Edinburgh Fund Managers, appeared last night to remain supporting Wilkes, a decision which should allow the Midlands-based group to maintain its independ-ence. The Panel's ruling was made more than seven hours after the bid should have lapsed and at least three hours after Robert Fleming should have announced the result of the bid. The institutions appear to have changed their views of Wilkes once Mr Stephen Hinchliffe stepped down as chairman in February. Mr Hinchliffe had presided over a company where head office costs had mushroomed and included a helicopter company for the use of senior executives, even though the company made profits of only Pounds 1.9m last year.</p>

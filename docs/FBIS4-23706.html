			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria June 10 SAPA -- Minister of Defence Joe  Modise on Friday [10 June] backtracked from further action  against the WEEKLY MAIL newspaper, saying he would decide on  future steps about a possible report by the publication after he  had studied all aspects.    The tabloid was served papers on Thursday informing it of Mr  Modise's intention to seek an interdict to restrain it from  publishing further stories on the South African Defence Force's  former Directorate of Covert Collection (DCC). The story,  published for the first time last week, deals with 23 former  members of the directorate who were dismissed by former State  President F W de Klerk in 1992.    Responding to the furore over the legal action, Mr Modise  said he was approached on Thursday by SANDF [South African  National Defense Force] head Gen Georg Meiring for permission to  serve an interdict on the paper. "I granted this permission  because I did not wish to read in newspapers about covert  matters pertaining to my department about which I had not yet  been briefed. The reason for this decision was so I could call  for reports, both from the Defence Force and the respondents.  Only when I have all the relevant information laid before me  will I be in a position to decide what steps I will take," he  said in a statement from Pretoria.    Earlier on Friday, the African National Congress criticised  the minister for launching legal action against the WEEKLY MAIL.  "ANC policy is unequivocally for full disclosure of past covert  action and exposure of dirty tricks against the democratic  movement," the organisation said in a statement on Friday. "We  have conducted our struggle to achieve a democratic and open  society. South Africans voted for a fully transparent process  of government. We are, therefore, concerned that this principle  is being compromised by the minister of defence's attempt to  interdict the WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN," the statement said.    Urging the ministry to withdraw the interdict and drop the  case in the Pretoria Supreme Court "without delay", it said no  further action should be taken using the defence of freedom of  information acts until the acts had been re-evaluated.</p>

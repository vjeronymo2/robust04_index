			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Tarmac in row over stake for US group TARMAC, the UK construction group, was embroiled in a political row yesterday over its plan to give a US group a 50 per cent stake in PSA Projects, the building design division it bought from the government five months ago. The Labour party immediately attacked the proposed joint venture with Black &amp; Veatch, saying it was 'tantamount to handing over a subsidy to an American company for British public-sector assets'. Mr Doug Henderson, shadow local government minister, said he had written to Mr John Redwood, his opposite number at the Environment Department, asking when the government had become aware that Tarmac had 'no intention' of operating PSA Projects and whether it now proposed to act. The sale to Tarmac of PSA Projects - formerly part of the state-run Property Services Agency - proved controversial because of unexpectedly high costs to the taxpayer. It involved a government payment to Tarmac of Pounds 54.9m to cover unpaid bills and to meet the cost of putting the business on a commercial footing, and a further Pounds 40m to cover redundancies. The Environment Department dismissed Labour charges, saying: 'Those monies are not going to Black &amp; Veatch. We were not conned; we knew about the relationship.' Its officials, it said last night, were aware that Black &amp; Veatch had been interested in PSA Projects at the time of its deal with Tarmac last November. However, the department said the proposals for equal control were a recent development. Tarmac said the government subsidies were to develop the maximum number of jobs in PSA Projects and guarantee the terms and conditions of the workforce. 'To suggest otherwise is nonsense,' it said. There will be no consideration payment for the joint venture. Tarmac expects to double its Pounds 50m fee income from PSA's capital projects, at present worth about Pounds 3.5bn. Black &amp; Veatch is expected to be given an immediate role in PSA Projects.</p>

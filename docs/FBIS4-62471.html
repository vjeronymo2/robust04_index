			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Bantin] </F>   [Text] Tokyo May 17 TASS -- Interviewed here by ITAR-TASS,  Uzbek President Islam Karimov, currently visiting Japan, today  called for genuine economic integration of the republics of the  former USSR. He expressed the view that the "Commonwealth of  Independent States was used by some politicians as a screen  behind which they could carry on their affairs".    "I stand for the quickest possible economic integration of  the republics of the former USSR, lack of which brings  sufferings to all of them -- Russia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyzstan and all the rest," Karimov noted. He stressed that  Uzbekistan backed the idea of setting up an economic union  within the frameworks of the CIS. "This is why," the president  said, "Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan concluded an  agreement at the end of April on a single economic space  covering the three. Karimov pointed out that the tripartite  economic union was open for Russia and all the other republics  of the former USSR. Russian President Boris Yeltsin was  informed about this.    "We presume that the single economic space, created by the  three republics, is a prototype of the economic union that must  be set up within the frameworks of the entire Commonwealth of  Independent States," the president said. He denied as  groundless all the press reports claiming that the Central Asian  republics were shutting themselves off from the other republics.    Karimov expressed great doubts about the feasibility of the  idea of setting up a Euro-Asian union on the basis of the CIS  republics. He urged to "fully implement the CIS idea through  economic integration".</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Regular" interview with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus </F> by correspondent Lucie Weissova on 15 February; place not  given--live or recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Weissova] Let us turn the  page and talk a bit about southern Europe. Yesterday you again  described the possible NATO air strikes over Bosnia as unfair in  human terms. However, in fact, it should be an action to help  end fighting by forceful action. Can you clarify what you meant  by this: unfair in human terms?    [Klaus] I said this in an open conversation on Thursday [10  February] and yesterday. I have not repeated it. [passage  omitted] Let us leave behind this hyperbole.    Of course, it poses the question first of all whether it is  possible to reach some sort of stable solution only by military,  or, to be more precise, by air attacks. We hold a certain  opinion on this that is [word indistinct] at variance with the  rest of the world. I think that today and everyday we  repeatedly hear the opinions of politicians on one hand, and the  views of military experts on the other, [the latter] saying that  these air strikes could not be a lasting solution, [and] that  after [air strikes], the army would have to move in. I admit  that I believe in the analyses of military experts; they seem to  me to be quite realistic. [passage omitted]    [Weissova] Prime minister, you called upon the Slovak Prime  Minister Meciar yesterday [14 Feb] asking that the Slovak side  withdraw measures complicating the import of the Czech  foodstuffs. At the same time, you said that it would be foolish  if we answered in a similar way and that the Czech side would  not consider this. What are the Czech Government's intentions if  Slovakia does not withdraw these obstacles?    [Klaus] When playing chess, I do not disclose my intentions  after the first move. I am not going to tell you in advance  what will be my second, third, fourth, and so on moves, as the  other side can take various countermeasures. Please do not ask  me for a ready-made script of our steps. We have to work on it  alone and be prepared to implement it. If we demand a halt to  any protectionism from the West as well as from the East, it is  not wise to treat our neighbors in this way. Therefore, it  seems to me that a one-sided action, same in kind--according to  [words indistinct] tooth for tooth--is neither imaginative nor  very wise. So let us keep the alternatives.    I would be very glad if the Slovak Government assessed our  proposal in order to make it possible for this measure (?to be  discussed) by the first meeting of the customs union, at which  certain concrete rules of these relations are to be established.  Unfortunately, I cannot say anything wiser to better. [passage  omitted]</p>

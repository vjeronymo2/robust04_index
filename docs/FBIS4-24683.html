			<p>BFN     [Text] Through the year-long arrangements and construction,  the Neimenggu economic radio and television broadcasting station  has basically completed preparations for transmitting its  economic television programs that will be presented with an  entirely new look to the broad masses of viewers on 18 May.    While deepening its internal reform and accelerating its  business development, the autonomous regional radio and  television broadcasting department, decided in May 1993 to  establish a new mass medium, the Neimenggu economic radio and  television broadcasting station, responsible for its own income  and expense. This was then approved by the autonomous regional  people's government and the Ministry of Radio, Film, and  Television. Thanks to the year of effort and the enthusiastic  support and assistance given by various social circles, the  preparation and construction work for this station has been  completed. On 18 May, the station will transmit its economic TV  programs on a trial basis on channel 26 and its programs will be  joined by Neimenggu and Hohhot cable television broadcasting  stations as it is fed into the broadcasting network. In addition  to the daily relay of the "news hookup" from the central  broadcasting station, the region's economic television station  will transmit "children cartoons", "television theater", "US  television programs digest", and "well-selected domestic and  foreign films and TV programs". It will also provide its own  columns, such as "economic news", "economic hot line",  "information slot", "ETV evening service", "dream about  factories", "health guidance", "reporter being beside you", and  "regular weekend train".</p>

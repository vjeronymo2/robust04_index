			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Weak dollar takes toll of continental bourses THE WEAK dollar continued to worry bourses yesterday, and Wall Street's overnight drop exacerbated the issue, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT sank to its lowest close since May 15, the DAX index closing 16.33 lower at 1,751.18 after a 2.91 decline to 694.45 in the FAZ at midsession. Turnover rose from DM5bn to DM5.2bn. The slide left 28 of the 30 DAX blue chips with losses. There was good and bad news in that for Mr Robert Willis and Mr Roderick Hinkel of Hoare Govett, who have just reviewed the DAX constituents. Of the big fallers, Metallgesellschaft, down DM10.60 at DM395.20, was one of their principal sell recommendations; but Degussa (down DM11 at DM323.20) was seen as a strong buy. Both companies are under pressure from the weak dollar and the denomination of their sales in dollar terms. Degussa was also hit by news that it was one of nine German companies which were searched on Tuesday on suspicion of making illegal deliveries to Iraq; however, it told Mr Willis later that its deliveries involved vacuum ovens supplied to Iraq Airways, approved by the German government, and even insured by the latter under its export guarantee scheme. The main rise of the day came in Asko, DM27 better at DM691, on hopes that its retailing future will outweigh its wheeler-dealer past; the construction group, Strabag, posted a DM6 rise to DM611 on a good progress report on 1992. PARIS saw companies with dollar-denominated earnings fall further than the index. The CAC 40 lost 31.34 or 1.7 per cent to 1,847.75 in turnover of FFr1.8bn. Alcatel remained the most active stock, rising FFr8 to FFr646 in arbitrage-related buying. Among companies with exposure to the US, Pechiney dropped FFr25 or 7.7 per cent to FFr300 while Lafarge dropped Fr11.50 or 3.6 per cent to FFr312.50. Saint Gobain lost FFr16 to FFr554. Continued worries that the banking sector would have to increase provisions for property-related loans were blamed for the FFr13.40, or 3.9 per cent drop in Paribas to FFr324.50. MILAN continued to fall as rumours about the government's planned interim budget swirled around the market. There was talk of an increase in the property tax, and fears that drastic government measures could bring on a painful recession in the economy. The Comit index fell 5.08 to a new 1992 low of 429.12 in turnover estimated at less than Tuesday's L104.8bn. Generali fell L550 to L26,900, in spite of reports that some domestic mutual funds had mounted a mopping-up operation the previous day. Telecoms remained weak, with Stet slipping L79 or 4.9 per cent to L1,550. Its new warrants are due to be listed today. Sip steadied after falling heavily on Tuesday, losing just L2 to L1,171. Fiat dropped below the important L5,000 mark, closing down L54 at L4,977, but recovered to L5,020 after hours. ZURICH lost just over 1 per cent, the SMI index falling 19.0 to 1,837.6. Chemicals came under pressure because of the weak dollar, Ciba-Geigy bearers falling SFr14 to SFr627 and Sandoz bearers by SFr100 to SFr2,890. Dealers said that Sandoz was slightly overbought recently following US roadshows last month. MADRID saw widespread selling drive down the banking, gas and utilities sectors as the general index closed down 2.68 at 233.61, a new low for the year. Volume was weak at around Pta7bn. AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency index fell 0.9 to 120.7. Nutricia fell another Fl 4.00 to Fl 141.50 after the chairman's comments that earnings would be under pressure this year. STOCKHOLM lost 1.9 per cent, the Affarsvarlden General index ending 16.9 down at another new 1992 low of 877.5 in turnover of SKr552m. Ericsson B led the active stocks, falling SKr3 to SKr127; the pulp producer Modo, sensitive to fluctuations in the dollar, SKr20 to SKr225. OSLO dropped almost 1.5 per cent, the all-share index shedding 5.89 at 391.82. Norsk Hydro ended NKr3.50 lower at NKr150 after the US Commerce Department ruled on Tuesday that Hydro was dumping pure magnesium in the US market from its plant in Canada. HELSINKI hit a second consecutive 1992 low as ex index closed 5.5 down at 737.9. ISTANBUL fell 1.9 per cent on profit-taking brought on by concern about the Treasury auction and the suspension of shares in in the iron and steel giant, Eregli. The 75-share index ended at 4,426.91, down 85.83.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JUL 8  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10.30am  11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1122.66  1123.40  1121.25  1119.18  1119.08  1121.08  1121.08  1121.53  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                Day's High  1123.75    Day's Low  1118.35  ----------------------------------------------------------------------          Jul 7       Jul 6       Jul 3       Jul 2       Jul 1          1129.83     1134.09     1142.19     1134.63     1132.36  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lilian Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 1 (CNA) -- A legislative group left  for Tokyo Wednesday [1 Jun] afternoon to discuss with the  Japanese Government the reimbursement of salaries of Taiwanese  soldiers forced to serve in the Japanese army during World War  II.    The leader of the group, Vice Legislative Speaker Wang  Chin-ping, said consultations would be on already-confirmed  debts, and that the Taiwan delegation would ask, on behalf of an  association formed by the Taiwanese soldiers and their  relatives, for compensation 7,000 times the soldiers' original  salaries.    Wang said the demand is many times what the Japanese  Government has said it would pay -- about 100 times the original  salaries -- and that therefore, no concrete results are expected.    Although not expecting any breakthrough in this trip, he  said  he would try his best to make Japan realize the urgency of the  matter and his hope for an early resolution.    Wang said the group would meet Thursday with Japanese  officials on reparations, and will also call on leaders of the  Japanese Diet during their stay.    Wang and his group will return to Taipei on Sunday.</p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 3,100 mark lost again in nervous selling - Market Report Renewed weakness in domestic bonds, together with a general nervousness towards the US dollar, drove the UK stock market well below the 3,100 mark on the FT-SE 100-share Index yesterday. Fears that the next rise in base rates might come sooner than expected was prompted by a report from members of the Confederation of British Industry of a very sharp rise in retail sales last month. This morning brings the official retail sales statistics for September. Trading volume remained poor and the closing picture was gloomy rather than threatening, with the pharmaceuticals sector depressed both by dollar sentiment and a fall in SmithKline Beecham following the third-quarter trading statement. At the close, the FT-SE 100 showed a drop of 34.9 at 3,085.3, a few points above the day's low. Equities were on the slide from the opening, but the losses in the blue chips were extended sharply when reports from Japan - quickly denied - suggested that US monetary policy would hold steady until the year-end, implying no further increase in key rates by the Federal Reserve. In spite of the denials of the Tokyo reports, global markets remained cautious towards near-term prospects for the US currency. The Dow Average, also reacting to trading results from leading names in the US banking and manufacturing industries, showed a fall of 12 points when London closed. The UK equity market started the day a shade easier and then quickly fell away as both gilt-edged stocks and stock index futures gave ground. The latest Public Sector Borrowing Requirement figures and then the announcement that next week's bond auction would be Pounds 2.5bn of 2000 stock left gilts easier at the close. The trading statement from SmithKline Beecham would have gone down well but for the disclosure that sales of Tagamet, its high selling anti-ulcer drug, had fallen heavily after expiry of the US patent. Patent expiry is a background worry for all pharmaceutical manufacturers and the implications of Tagamet's fortunes were not lost on Glaxo and other drug firms, which were already unhappy because of the worries over the dollar. Falls in these blue chip internationals affect the Footsie index significantly. Activity in the big dollar-earning stocks helped to boost the day's Seaq volume total by nearly 15 per cent to 527.8m shares, but this was still a poor total by this year's daily averages. Traders confessed to an uninspiring session, with the stock market driven from the futures pits. Business in second line or non-Footsie stocks made up about 64 per cent of the day's total, a higher proportion than seen recently. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index finished 15.7 off at 3,532.3. Retail and consumer stocks chose to pay more heed to the market's fears of a base rate increase than to the CBI's indication that September's retail sales had risen at the highest rate for nearly a year. Most of the big retailer stocks were down at the close, albeit following modest turnover. The stock market's mood of uncertainty was highlighted in the latest Economic and Monetary Review from Credit Lyonnais Securities. The review predicted that the cyclical growth peak may have already passed, with consumer spending in particular likely to remain disappointing; Credit Lyonnais sees the UK economy as likely to grow by only 2.5 per cent next year. But the firm remains confident that UK equities 'now offer fair value' and looks for 10 per cent upside by the end of the year, echoing many other forecasts from market analysts that the final quarter will see shares benefit from the increasing pace of economic recovery.</p>

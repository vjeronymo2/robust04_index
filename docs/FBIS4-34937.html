			<p>BFN     [Text] Police intelligence sources yesterday revealed the  existence of a terrorist plot to justify attacks against members  of the cabinet, individuals, and businesses as reprisals for the  death threats politically irrelevant individuals are allegedly  receiving.    They added those anonymously hiding behind the FRS  [Salvadoran Revolutionary Front] are trying to effect an  apparent "emotional outburst" against the individuals who have  been accused in the past of being the possible perpetrators of  violent incidents.    The sources stated it was known since early last week a  communique reportedly from the self-styled FRS would be  released. The FRS "condemns the threats against the human rights  ombudsman, Monsignor Arturo Rivera y Damas, the Society of  Jesus, and the National Judiciary Council" by a so-called  "Domingo Monterrosa Command."    The communique added it declared the members of the Calderon  cabinet, as well as this newspaper's staff and installations, to  be "military objectives" if any attack is executed against those  who have received threats. Intelligence sources have stated  they had no prior knowledge of any group named Domingo  Monterrosa, which only leftist chieftains mention, as they did  with another ghost group they have called the "Maximiliano  Hernandez Martinez Brigade," whose alleged members nobody has  ever seen.    The plot, according to the sources, is clearly similar to  the  one the former FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front]  guerrillas used during the years of terror, when they took  advantage of internal purges or the elimination of "expendable"  or irrelevant figures to justify the selective murders of  businessmen and democratically-minded ideologues.    The pattern, they said, greatly resembles the events  following the bomb blast at the Fenastras [Salvadoran Workers  National Union Federation] building in October 1989, an  explosion which days later led to the offensive of late November  of that year. The sources added the impact that the individuals  hiding behind the FRS hope to obtain is an "emotional outburst"  against those had been previously accused of incidents that led  to violence.    EL DIARIO DE HOY was the target of an incendiary attack on 1  November 1993, following a tirade by FMLN chieftain Joaquin  Villalobos during the funeral of Heleno Castro Guevara, alias  "Commander Carmelo." On that occasion, Villalobos accused the  newspaper's editor of being the spokesman for the murderers of  Castro Guevara, who, it was reported days later, was killed  during an unpremeditated squabble prompted by a traffic accident.    On that occasion, the international community rejected  Villalobos' attacks when the IAPA [Inter-American Press  Association] issued a statement demanding the FMLN "abstain from  attacking EL DIARIO DE HOY with words or deeds, urging this  group to use the channels of the existent Salvadoran democratic  system to peacefully express their own viewpoints."</p>

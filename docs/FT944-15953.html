			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Pink Snow (3): Tell us when it's over - A battle-scarred Arnie Wilson expects no sympathy as he puts his odyssey into perspective Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are attempting to ski every day of 1994 on a round-the-world trip Some days, when bad weather forces us to wait for a chance to scramble for the slopes, I feel like an old airman who forgets why he is fighting. If we finish this mission, we shall probably keep skiing and moving on to the next resort until someone tells us the war is over. It has not really been like the western front, of course, but sometimes it has been quite a battle. My left hand has quite a nasty burn, inflicted by a New Zealand rope tow out of the ark; my thumb is bandaged after cutting it on the rough-hewn metal lock of a door in a primitive mountain hut; my big toe nail has come off after constant rubbing against the inside of my ski boot; my left shoulder still hurts eight months after two bad falls in California and the middle finger of my right hand is still deformed after being broken while skiing in a gale on a volcano in Chile - and I suffered a frost-bitten nose in Colorado. Lucy also has a toe nail coming off as well as bruised ribs, and a shin bruised by a rock. Between us we have fallen 285 times, or about once each every 18 miles skied. We have frequently looked ridiculous by skiing in fields and by the side of the road in places miles from any ski resort. I mention all this not for a moment expecting sympathy (it all adds up to nothing compared to the ordeals of real winter adventurers such as Sir Ranulph Fiennes) but to put this glorious skiing odyssey into some perspective. In between the bumps and bruises, we have skied the vertical equivalent of well over 100 Everests in more than 200 resorts, travelling the equivalent of four times round the world at an average speed of 14mph - every hour, day and night - since January. There have been good days, ecstatic days, wet days, cold days, boring days, dangerous days, windy days, frustrating days, and argumentative days when we swore we would ski separately but ended up on the same lift almost immediately. We have slept in luxurious hotel suites, freezing mountain huts, rickety old trains and more than once in a Russian truck. We have fled from hotels and refuges where Lucy found the accommodation unsuitable. One night in Wisconsin we rejected two hotels in one night, the first because of cleanliness, the second because Lucy discovered we were to sleep on a water-bed which she feared would make her seasick. We have been transported to the slopes by Aerospatiale squirrel helicopters, Pilatus Porter ski-planes, high speed quads and low speed single grip rope tows, an assortment of four-wheel drive vehicles, snow cats of various vintages, and - in half a dozen resorts - on foot. We have skied in powder, crud, breakable crust, moguls, windpack, suncrust, man-made snow, frosted powder (whatever that is), hoarfrost, rime and on quite a lot of ice (sometimes euphemistically referred to as hard-packed powder). We still like skiing (and each other), although there has been little improvement in my technique. Lucy has done rather better: she has learnt to ski quite well off piste. Avis have lent us 14 vehicles so far - two at once for a few days in Chile. The most intriguing (but not the most practical) was a Cadillac which had its keys locked in the boot by Lucy, possibly in a subconscious attempt not to have to ski on a converted garbage dump just outside Chicago in the middle of the night. We have come to know Chicago quite well because it is an important hub for American Airlines, our airline sponsors for the northern hemisphere. We have visited this city more than half a dozen times en route to various mountains and hillocks. The best part of our trip - apart from some breathtaking scenery and skiing  -has been the quite extraordinary kindness shown to us along the way, particularly in Canada, Argentina, the US, Chile, Australia and New Zealand (plus the long-suffering Manfred Ebner who kept putting us up in his hotel and looking after bits of our luggage in Kolsass Weer, Austria, as we criss-crossed Europe). The skiing industry seems to attract delightful people. We have been interviewed by 14 TV stations, 11 radio programmes and 56 newspapers, including one in Japan that we could not read, and everywhere we go, certain questions are asked again and again: 'How long will your skiing every day of the year trip last?' Er, yes. That's the whole point. 'But you don't ski the day you fly though?' Er, yes. That's the whole point too. We ski any time, any place, if necessary. At midnight, at dawn, in a field, off a cliff. If there's snow, we ski it. If there is not, we find it. If we can't find it, we ask someone to make us some, as we did in Cloudmont, Alabama, and shall be doing at the end of this month in Mammoth, California. Our daily priorities are simple: breathe, eat and ski. I do not think there are many major ski areas in the world we have not visited (except perhaps Crans Montana, Switzerland and Marmot Basin at Jasper, British Columbia). But if we have left anyone else out please invite us immediately. We are free throughout 1995. What does all this prove? Well, nothing yet, because we still have another 10 weeks to go, and anything could happen. If we do happen to make it to Jackson Hole, Wyoming - where we started our mission on January 1 - and succeed in skiing every day of the year, it will prove that while it is possible to ski every day of the year it is virtually impossible to do so in ski resorts on lifts that are open. Our trip will also perhaps have proved what we always knew: when the British (and Lucy, although French, is an honorary Brit) started the strange habit of going on winter sports excursions, everyone thought they were mad. Nothing has changed.</p>

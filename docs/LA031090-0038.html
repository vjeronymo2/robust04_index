			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOB GREENE: NIXON'S PLACE: A GATHERING OF NON-VOTERS  </P> <P> The thing I still love about being on the road, other than 24-hour room  service, is that you're always learning something new.  </P> <P> For example: When you were growing up, you probably had a drive-in restaurant  that you and your friends went to. Depending on where you lived, the place  might have been called Frisch's, it might have been called Bob's Big Boy, it  might have been called the Peter Pan. Regardless of what it was called, though,  the routine was the same all over the United States. Kids would pull up in  their cars on a summer evening, find a parking spot, order some cheap eats, and  socialize in the warm night air until closing time.  </P> <P> So what have I discovered on this particular trip? Well . . . in Whittier,  Calif., a town not all that far from Los Angeles, the drive-in restaurant of  choice during the 1950s was a place called . . .  </P> <P> Nixon's.  </P> <P> Yep. Richard Nixon had strong roots in the city of Whittier, and when he was  vice president under Dwight D. Eisenhower his younger brother, Donald Nixon,  apparently aware of the value of the family name, opened up Nixon's Drive-In.  By all accounts, it was like most other American drive-ins, except it was  called Nixon's. And the kids loved it.  </P> <P> "It was right on Whittier Boulevard," said Marian Saxon Bramlett, Whittier High  School class of '58. Bramlett, now 49, works in the personnel department of the  Whittier High School District. "It was quite popular. On the weekends, you'd  have to get there pretty early in the evening to be sure to get a space for  your car."  </P> <P> Paula Abbott, also 49, said, "None of us really thought that it was unusual for  a drive-in to be called Nixon's. The name certainly had no political meaning  for us, even though we knew that Donald Nixon's brother was vice president of  the United States. When someone would say 'Let's go to Nixon's,' our only  thought was of having a good time. Nixon's was a drive-in, not a politician."  </P> <P> According to Marian Bramlett, Donald Nixon had operated a sit-down place called  Nixon's Family Restaurant before he opened Nixon's Drive-In. "He kept Nixon's  Family Restaurant open, but that was mostly for our parents," Bramlett said.  "The drive-in was for high school kids. So there were really two Nixon's  restaurants in town at the same time. I'm told that Donald Nixon used to be  present at the family restaurant, but I never saw him at the drive-in. I  certainly never saw Richard Nixon at the drive-in."  </P> <P> The courting routine at Nixon's Drive-In, she said, never varied. "The boys  would arrive together in their souped-up cars, and they would park and open  their hoods," she said. "The girls would arrive together and walk over to where  the boys were. The girls would look at the boys, and the boys would look at  their engines."  </P> <P> Although precise historical documentation is vague, Bramlett and Abbott believe  that it was 1955 or 1956 when Nixon's Drive-In got competition -- right down  Whittier Boulevard, but on the other side of the street. The competition came  in the form of a Bob's Big Boy.  </P> <P> "The food was about the same at both places," Bramlett said. "But at Nixon's,  you went up and got your French fries and Cokes yourself and took them back to  your car. At Bob's Big Boy, they had carhops on roller skates."  </P> <P> Eventually Nixon's closed. "It wasn't that the food was bad or anything, or  that we liked Bob's Big Boy better," Bramlett said. "I just think that Donald  Nixon may not have been a very good businessman." Donald Nixon died in 1987 at  the age of 73.  </P> <P> Bramlett said that she drives by the spot where Nixon's used to stand virtually  every day. Standing on the location now is -- you couldn't make this up -- a  used car lot.  </P> <P> "I know that the name Nixon has a certain connotation all around the world,"  Bramlett said. "And I also know that some people have good feelings toward the  name, and some people have bad feelings toward the name.  </P> <P> "But for a lot of us the word means a lot more than just the name of a man who  became President. Nixon's was the place where we had the most fun on the nights  when we were young. We were young and happy, and we went to Nixon's."  </P></p>

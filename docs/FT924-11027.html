			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Dollar and bond rallies give lie to forecasts THE flight of capital from Canada, which many economists and bankers predicted would follow a No vote in Monday's referendum, was nowhere to be seen yesterday. Instead, the Canadian dollar rose strongly, bonds staged a spirited rally and banks cut their prime lending rate by half a percentage point to 7.75 per cent. The chief economist at one Toronto securities firm said financial markets had not only discounted the outcome of the referendum through a surge of interest rates during the campaign, but did not view the negative vote as an inevitable boost for Quebec separatists. 'The market doesn't care about the Charlottetown deal; it only cares about Quebec separating,' he said. However, Mr Ravi Bulchandani, senior economist at Goldman Sachs in New York, cautioned that 'a slightly higher risk premium on Canadian financial instruments is now probably a fact of life'. Bond market analysts expect this risk to be factored into the price of long-term bonds. While the spread between short-term US and Canadian interest rates narrowed sharply yesterday, the gap on 30-year bonds was virtually unchanged at 1.5 percentage points. Interest rates are expected to drop further today at the weekly setting of the Bank of Canada's bellwether bank rate. The rate stood at 7.37 per cent last week, and could drop by a full percentage point today. This would erase about half the increase which took place in September and October as the central bank raised interest rates to defend a weakening Canadian dollar. The Canadian dollar soared by almost half a cent yesterday morning and finished the day at close to 81 US cents. While a Yes vote might have led to an even bigger drop in interest rates, economists are confident that bearish political factors will be overshadowed over the next few months by Canada's bullish economic trends. The inflation rate is running at just over 1 per cent, the lowest among industrial countries, and the economy remains mired in recession. One economist said yesterday the authorities were anxious to bring interest rates down as quickly as possible in the hope of boosting consumer demand during the Christmas season.</p>

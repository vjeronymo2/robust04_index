			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / International Company News: Buoyant Bertelsmann reports 6% improvement BERTELSMANN, the German publishing, music and commercial television group expects profits to improve further this financial year after a 6 per cent gain to DM570m (Dollars 407.1m) in net income for 1991-92. Mr Mark Wossner, chief executive, said he expected turnover and profits to rise by about 10 per cent. Bertelsmann had not experienced any of the domestic weakness in publishing or sales difficulties in Europe that some companies had spoken of. Turnover in the financial year to June 30, 1992, rose by 10 per cent to DM16bn. The net profit was after start-up costs on new projects of DM310m, sharply up from the previous year's DM183m. Mr Wossner said the increase partly reflected the need to lift its stake in a Berlin publishing venture to full ownership after the death of Mr Robert Maxwell whose Maxwell Communications was an equal partner. Bertelsmann has been investing in newspapers in east Germany, the Premiere pay-tv channel in Germany, and new music labels in the US, UK. Mr Siegfried Luther, financial director, said most of the turnover increase came from the group's existing businesses and about 2 per cent from new ventures. Cash flow was 8 per cent higher at DM1.3bn,and net indebtedness came down considerably from DM363m to DM43m.</p>

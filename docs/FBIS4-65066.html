			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Theodore Pangalos, Greek European </F> affairs minister and current chairman of the European Union  Foreign Ministers Council, by unidentified correspondent; place  and date not given]    [Text] [FINANCIAL TIMES] How important are the elections?    [Pangalos] They are a fundamental test of the European  public's interest in European unification. They are the first  elections allowing European citizens to participate whatever  their place of residence.    [FINANCIAL TIMES] Should the parliament be given greater  powers?    [Pangalos] The parliament will actively participate in  preparing the 1996 conference to reform EU [European Union]  institutions. We should aim for an increased role for the only  directly elected body for European citizens.    [FINANCIAL TIMES] What should be the EU's priorities in the  next few years?    [Pangalos] Employment and migration flows will be the main  economic and social problems for the next decade. If we don't  answer these two challenges positively, we will have a serious  political and social crisis.    [FINANCIAL TIMES] Should the EU give priority to deepening  integration among the 12, or to widening it towards East Europe?    [Pangalos] The enlargement to 16 has almost entirely  exhausted the limits of the EU's capacity to absorb new members.  Two small countries like Cyprus and Malta could start  negotiations in the immediate future. Further enlargement will  entail radical reform of EU structures.    [FINANCIAL TIMES] Are you worried that German unification  and an eastwards shift in the EU's centre of gravity could harm  Greece's interests?    [Pangalos] "Germanisation" of the Union can be an irrational  anxiety. Strengthening the EU is the best way to avoid such  dangers. Loose co-operation limited to economic or commercial  interests could produce or increase domination.    [FINANCIAL TIMES] Will assistance for poorer EU states  eventually have to be cut?    [Pangalos] What you call "assistance" is structural action  aimed at increasing social and regional cohesion and helping  recovery. Such action is essential if we want more than a  simple free trade zone.    [FINANCIAL TIMES] Is the aim of economic and monetary union  by 1999 still practicable?    [Pangalos] The Maastricht Treaty provides the route to EMU  [European Monetary Union]. Some countries might not satisfy the  criteria in 1999, and Greece might be one of them. Such  countries will have to wait and make further efforts. The world  will not end in 1999.</p>

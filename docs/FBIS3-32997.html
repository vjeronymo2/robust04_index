Gen. Castro, who is also the second secretary of the Cuban  Communist Party, indicated that in 1993 the FAR cut its budget  by 50 percent, supplied themselves with natural medicines by 70  percent, and were able to maintain their high technical  readiness and combat morale.    Today Raul Castro inaugurated a new training year for the  Western Army, which, he noted, signifies the improvement of  defense structures in this region of the country. The western  region comprises the Provinces of Pinar del Rio, Havana, Havana  City, and the special municipality of the Isle of Youth.    Castro pointed out that the transfer of units from the Air  Force and the Navy to the Western Army, which have been already  implemented in the Central and Eastern Armies, increases  significantly the combat potential and the operational autonomy  of the commands.    Castro stressed that in a recent visit to units of the  Central and Eastern Armies, he was able to verify the efforts  made to adjust the FAR to the current economic difficulties  leaving its combat capacity intact.    He added that the FAR's most significant achievements for  the  past three years include maintaining high morale and combat  readiness, preserving the tactics, and contributing to the food  program for the population.    In addition, Raul Castro emphasized the work carried out by  the Youth Labor Army in harvesting sugar, tobacco, tubers, and  vegetables in Havana Province, to which it supplies 49 percent  of its production.    Gen. Castro announced that in 1994, the system to prepare  chiefs, officers, and mid-level officers must be strengthened,  and stressed that the enemy must realize that the fight will be  to the death.    Gen. Castro concluded that there will be no mass desertions  or generalized collapses because a monolithic unity and absolute  loyalty to the revolution and its highest leader, Fidel Castro,  prevail in the FAR.</p>

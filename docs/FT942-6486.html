			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Company News (This Week): Car demand still low in land of rising yen - Nissan Nissan, Japan's second largest car maker, is expected to paint a bleak picture of the state of the country's auto industry when it releases its results on Tuesday. Domestic demand for vehicles fell for the third successive year during the 12 months to March. It was down by 7 per cent, while production fell 12 per cent. Nissan has been one of the hardest hit among Japan's battered carmakers, says Mr Koji Endo, industry analyst at Lehman Brothers. While the company has made good efforts in the domestic market with the launch of new models, overseas business has been hit by the yen's appreciation against major currencies. In the first half of the fiscal year, Nissan posted its worst results since it became a public company - a pre-tax loss of Y28.9bn (Pounds 184m) and net loss of Y38.6bn. The company was forced to revise down its earnings estimate for the year and will sell assets, such as properties and securities, to shore up its results. Mr Endo believes such asset sales will help the parent company to break even before tax, but lead to a wider net loss on a consolidated basis due to the poor performance of overseas subsidiaries. He suggests that the company needs to reduce its models, rationalise aggressively and further reduce overcapacity.</p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Micro Focus shares fall 16% Shares in Micro Focus, the Berkshire-based computer software house, closed 16 per cent down at Pounds 10.58p on a warning that profits were unlikely to match revenue growth in the second half of the current year. In February the shares touched a peak of Pounds 30, but have since been declining. Mr Paul O'Grady, chairman and chief executive, attributed the profits slowdown to three factors. First, customers were confused by the plethora of new technologies available. The increased time being taken on spending decisions was causing a temporary slowdown in the growth of spending on Micro Focus products. Second, the large computer manufacturers, who had been buying the company's software tools in substantial quantities to market with their hardware, had seen their own businesses decline and this had adversely affected Micro Focus sales. Third, a new and advanced software product, PL/1, was still in the later stages of customer acceptance testing and was due for first deliveries in late-December. It would make little difference to turnover in the current year. Mr O'Grady concluded: 'This means that I foresee some revenue growth in the current fiscal half year, but it will be difficult to achieve sequential earnings growth in dollars compared with the first half.' In the first half to July 31, pre-tax profits grew by 20 per cent to Pounds 11.6m on sales of Pounds 40m. In dollar terms, however, pre-tax profits fell from Dollars 17.6m to Dollars 17.4m. Micro Focus develops software tools that make it possible for companies to develop large software systems on personal computers. The company's shares fell sharply in August after a US analyst issued a sell note - some 20 per cent of Micro Focus stock is held as ADRs, so US investment sentiment has a powerful effect on the company's share price. Yesterday analysts said they were confused by the company's explanations for the projected slow-down; US analysts were especially strident. Their UK colleagues have cut their full-year earnings projection from between Pounds 27m and Pounds 30m to between Pounds 22m and Pounds 23m.</p>

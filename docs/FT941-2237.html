			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Bright spark at Lucas Progress is being made restructuring Lucas Industries, but there is still a sense that the company is waiting for Godot. Mr George Simpson is due to take over as Lucas's chief executive at the end of the month. Until he has had a chance to walk around, kick the tyres, and decide how much more time is needed in the body shop, it is difficult to see whether the company will prove an economical little runner. Like several other component manufacturers, however, Lucas is already insisting that it can earn margins of 10 per cent. That sounds fanciful when margins were only 9 per cent even at the height of the boom in 1989. But quantum jumps in productivity from new manufacturing plant, rationalisation benefits, and the disposal of low margin contracts, will all help meet the boast. Mr Simpson may well drag some reluctant sacred cows to the block. Cuts in working capital - principally stocks  - could also reduce borrowings substantially. If the management performs, thoughts will turn to growth prospects. Expanding the braking business is an obvious possibility, though persuading another British manufacturer to sell may be more difficult. Still, double-digit margins, growth and lower interest costs by 1996-97 implies profits of over Pounds 250m. Heady stuff, since even the famously naked dividend would then be covered three times. Unfortunately, the market already seems to know that, and the company is trading at 10 times the most optimistic earnings estimates three years out. Mr Simpson will be hard pressed to make the shares perform from here.</p>

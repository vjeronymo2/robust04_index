			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINLAND BANS MCDONALD'S AD  </P> <P> A Finnish consumer affairs court banned a television advertisement for the  fast-food chain McDonald's, saying it exploits the loneliness of a child, a  court official said.  </P> <P> The advertisement shows a young boy unhappily surveying an empty apartment his  parents apparently plan to move into.  </P> <P> Despair turns to joy when he sees a McDonald's on the other side of the street,  and the happy ending shows the boy eating in the restaurant.  </P> <P> The court said the advertisement could give the impression McDonald's products  could replace friends or lessen loneliness.  </P> <P> It said the company could face a $50,000 fine if it used a child's loneliness  to promote its products in a television advertisement again.  </P> <P> In its response in court, McDonald's said the advertisement was part of its  drive to present a visit to its restaurants as a family event and the role of  McDonald's as a favorite eating spot for children in particular.  </P></p>

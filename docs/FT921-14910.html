			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Projects in the budget firing line The Pentagon's Dollars 104bn budget for research, development and procurement of equipment in 1992 includes a number of programmes which are prime targets for the budget axe: Northrop's B-2 stealth bomber. The administration had planned to order seven more B-2s in fiscal 1993 at a cost of Dollars 660m apiece, building its fleet up to 75 by 1998. It is now expected to halve this goal. But Congress had already in effect killed the B-2 programme in the current year's budget authorisation and is unlikely to relent now, so the air force may have to make do with the 15 under construction. The Seawolf SSN-21 nuclear attack submarine built by Electric Boat. Mr Cheney is reported to have ordered the navy to slash its plans for the Dollars 2bn submarine, which it had already scaled down last year to a target of one a year up to 1997 or 1998. Seawolf only survived last year because of frantic lobbying by the senators for Connecticut, in whose state it is built. This year, Congress is likely to kill it altogether, and tell the navy to wait for the cheaper next generation Centurion submarine. The anti-missile Strategic Defence Initiative. The version embraced by the Bush administration, dubbed Global Protection Against Limited Strikes, or GPALS, would provide more protection against an accidental launch from the former Soviet Union or against a rogue attack from one of the emerging nuclear countries than against the all-out Soviet attack envisioned by the more ambitious Reagan 'Star Wars', but it is still hotly opposed by many in Congress. The Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF). The ATF, under development by two competing teams of Northrop/McDonnell Douglas and Lockheed/General Dynamics/Boeing, is designed to replace the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Falcon fighters, but at an estimated Dollars 73m it will be costly to replace the entire fighter fleet. McDonnell Douglas's C-17 transport aircraft. While improved airlift capability is generally viewed as a priority for the new US force structure, the C-17, now forecast at Dollars 35bn for 120 aircraft, is over budget and behind schedule.</p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of Computers in Finance (1): Management attitudes are more important than technology - While the fiercely competitive financial services industry is increasing its spending on information technology, it frequently fails to achieve the full benefits The world's financial institutions are looking with fresh eyes at electronic technology as they gear up to face ever fiercer competition, not only from within the financial services industry itself, but also from the world outside. The articles in this survey deal with a number of the principal themes in financial technology including payment systems, image processing and database technology. They also cover management issues with a technological slant, including fraud and its prevention, and outsourcing. There is some irony in the fact that these same technologies are facilitating many of the new challenges and lowering the barriers of entry to the finance business. It could have been predicted, for example, that Swift, the banks' global electronic payments message system, would eventually face competition from an organisation outside the banking world with a global network and access to financial expertise. That competition now exists and Swift has been forced to announce price cuts and to lower its joining fee, in response. Ibos (Inter-bank On-line System) is the kind of organisation which observers argue represents the new competition for Swift - in embryonic form, at any rate. It is a joint venture initially between the Royal Bank of Scotland, Banco Santander of Spain - and Electronic Data Systems of the US, a subsidiary of General Motors and the world's largest computing services company. Other members include Credit Commercial de France and Banco de Commercio e Industria of Portugal. The first US customer, First Fidelity Bancorporation joined this year. Thomas Metz, director of global business development for Ibos in the UK, while rejecting the notion that Ibos is a direct competitor for Swift, says the group has built a cross-border cash management system - a digital superhighway for the banking industry. Swift, meanwhile, is extending its business into the area of securities messages, and has applied to become a network supplier to the UK securities industry's yet-to-be-implemented Crest settlement system as part of a campaign to increase message traffic and revenues. The threats to the traditional finance industry come from a multiplicity of directions. Microsoft, the world's largest software house, this year acquired Intuit, developer of the most popular personal finance software, Quicken, used by about 6m personal computer users. The deal, which is subject to scrutiny by the US antitrust authorities, gives Microsoft an important toehold in a market - home banking - where traditional banks have failed to make much of an impact. Microsoft, developer of MS/DOS-Windows, the most popular operating system for personal computers, also aims to take a leading role in the creation of the information superhighway. One measure of the financial institutions' renewed interest in technology, after some years of cutting back expenditure, is growth in the information technology budget. According to the consultancy Ernst &amp; Young, US financial institutions will spend Dollars 16.35bn on technology in 1994, 6 per cent higher than the previous year. Andrew Mayer of Ernst &amp; Young estimates that the total will be Dollars 19.8bn in 1997. Comparable figures do not exist for Europe but the consultancy, Price Waterhouse, says that more than half the financial services companies it reviewed in its annual information technology survey intend to increase their spending on technology, despite the fact, it says, that many IT projects have proved eventually to be failures. This is hardly new, either in the finance industry or outside. What is depressing is that over the years there has been so little progress in ensuring that projects are brought in on time and budget. The consequences can be expensive. Stewart Stevenson, senior manager for systems development at the Bank of Scotland, after listing tried and tested rules for successful project completion concluded with the admonition: 'If you can print money, ignore all the above.' Clearly, many companies do. According to Price Waterhouse, some 25 per cent of companies believed that most of their IT projects were unsuccessful either because they were delivered too late and over budget, or because they had failed to meet user-needs. 'The results paint a depressing picture,' commented PW. 'With such significant difficulties in the delivery of IT projects, it is not surprising that there exists a big issue surrounding the integration of IT with corporate objectives. The result calls into question the extent to which the IT functions understand the business.' The PW result confirms the view of Nick Temple International Business Machines' general manager for the finance industry in Europe who argues that data processing departments in financial services companies have become unresponsive to the needs of the business, (see interview, page two of this survey). There are a number of technological developments which may result in some improvement in this unsatisfactory situation. An important element is the growth of object-oriented software development. Essentially, to take advantage of new business opportunities, software has to be developed rapidly and accurately. Traditional methods of software development are slow and prone to error. The principle behind object oriented software is the creation of libraries of software modules which can be swiftly assembled in different ways to create new applications. In the end, however, management attitudes are more important than technology. The Boston Consulting Group has established a number of rules for successful computer projects (a somewhat similar list to Mr Stevenson's) of which the most important are: Never to commission information technology projects (it is the business imperative that is important). Quantify the benefits at every stage of the project (if you do not measure benefits, you will not achieve them). Make sure the managers understand their jobs are on the line if the project fails (in too many cases, nobody has continuing responsibility for a project). It gives the example of a big European bank which was considering requests from its managers for 300 individual computer projects. There was no agreed way of measuring the benefits, political rather than business needs dictated priorities and most of the projects were under-staffed. Initial analysis revealed that many of the projects were unattractive. The bank refocused its activities so that only the most attractive projects went ahead and these agreed projects were fully resourced. The result was a Dollars 400m increase in the economic value (net present value) of the projects over their life. Concentration on core competences is the watchword for the early 1990s, however, and a number of financial services institutions are beginning to question their involvement in data processing. Some are actively considering, or have implemented, the outsourcing of parts of their information technology operations. IBM, for example, is managing the automated teller machine network of one of the largest building societies. There is a fine balance, however, between operations which can be outsourced and those which must be kept in-house. One High Street bank which outsourced about 20 per cent of its operations told the consultancy Business Intelligence: 'Financial services these days is so competitive that if you have an idea - and we have several in the bank at the moment which are being pursued - there is no way that we are going to let any outside supplier anywhere near it.'

			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / People: Ewan Marwick Ewan Marwick, ceo of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, has died in a car crash in Moscow. He was one of the best known figures in Scottish business. Marwick, who was 41, had run the chamber since 1982. He was a high profile figure, and an energetic lobbyist. He spearheaded a long-running campaign to persuade the government to remove Prestwick airport's status as the sole gateway for transatlantic flights from Scotland. The campaign was finally won in 1990, against considerable opposition from some Conservative ministers, and several new air services immediately began between Glasgow airport and the US. Marwick was also a leading campaigner to have non-domestic rates in Scotland reduced to English levels. The government began harmonising Scottish and English business rates in 1989, but Scotland's disadvantage has not yet been eliminated. In 1990 Marwick stood unsuccessfully as the Conservative party candidate in the Paisley North by-election, and nurtured ambitions to go into national politics. Graduated in economics from Edinburgh university, he began his career advising Shetland Islands Council, before joining the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in Scotland as assistant secretary. He was in Russia on a mission to advise the Rostov-on-Don region on economic development.</p>

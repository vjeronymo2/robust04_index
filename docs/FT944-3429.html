			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / International Company News: Banco Santander looks to sell Ebro stake Banco Santander is believed to have offered a 10 per cent stake in Ebro, the leading Spanish food company, to Tabacalera, the state-controlled tobacco conglomerate. The move could signal renewed foreign assaults on the country's sugar sector. Santander denied it had approached Tabacalera, which owns 4.6 per cent of Ebro, although it said it was seeking to dispose of its stock in the profitable sugar and rice producer. The offer to the government's tobacco group was, however, confirmed by well-placed market sources, who viewed it as a tactical move by Santander before placing the stake with a foreign group. Tabacalera is understood to have told Santander it could not increase its shareholding because it was restructuring the group and concentrating on its core tobacco business. 'Santander talked to Tabacalera, but it was merely being deferential with the government before seeking a buyer abroad for the the Ebro stock,' said Mr Joan Bastos, managing director of Madrid brokers Ibersecurities. The 10 per cent shareholding in the food company, worth Pta7.2bn (Dollars 55m) at current market prices, had been owned by Mr Javier de la Rosa, the Barcelona financier and former chief executive of the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) in Spain, who was imprisoned pending fraud charges in October. Santander took the stake when it executed outstanding loans to Mr de la Rosa following his arrest. The clear signal from Santander, the leading domestic banking group, that it is not interested in being an Ebro shareholder, and Tabacalera's reported rejection of the equity offer will not escape European groups such as Saint-Louis of France and the UK's Tate &amp; Lyle. The two groups were recently blocked by the government when they attempted to increase their minority joint stake in General Azucarera, Spain's second-ranked sugar company, through an agreed bid for a controlling shareholding in the company, owned by Banco Central Hispano, BCH. The government said it did not want see Azucarera in foreign ownership, in the interests of protecting the domestic sugar quota. This argument does not, however, apply to Ebro, which is already partly foreign controlled. Its main shareholder, with 36.5 per cent of the equity, is Grupo Torras, the KIO's Spanish investment arm. The KIO announced plans two weeks ago to write off Grupo Torras debts of Pta184.4bn to bring the investment arm out of receivership. The Kuwaiti group is reviewing its long-term strategy in Spain, and the re-think will focus closely on its plans for Ebro, the crown jewel of its Spanish investments.</p>

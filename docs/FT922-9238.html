			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Dail clears way for referendum AN Irish government white paper on the Maastricht Treaty was approved by parliament yesterday by a narrow majority, clearing the way for a national referendum on June 18 to seek backing for ratification. The opposition supported the bill, but criticised the government's wish to postpone legislation on the controversial abortion issue until after the referendum. A special Maastricht protocol preserves Ireland's ban on abortion. The opposition says legislation is needed to clear up confusion over women's right to travel abroad for abortion.</p>

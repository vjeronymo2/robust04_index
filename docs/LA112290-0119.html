			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RETAILERS SHOPPING FOR IDENTITY;  </P> <P> PASADENA: SOUTH LAKE AVENUE AND OLD PASADENA ARE DIFFERENT IN TYPE AND STYLE.  OFFICIALS ARE TRYING TO UNITE THEM INTO A REGIONAL SHOPPING DESTINATION.  </P> <P> While other retailers start the Christmas shopping season battling a sluggish  economy and fears of war, Pasadena clothing store owners Charlie Bayne and son  Steve are preparing to leave the fray.  </P> <P> After 36 years of business on South Lake Avenue, Bayne-Williams Shop for Men  will close in January. The Baynes say two things forced them out: changes  favoring high-volume, discount outlets in the men's retail clothing industry,  and the changing nature of South Lake Avenue.  </P> <P> Pasadena's premier shopping area since the 1960s, South Lake Avenue now  attracts fewer strollers who once wandered through the street's shops of  traditional clothing, Steve Bayne said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, strollers throng the nighttime streets of Old Pasadena, an  up-and-coming area that has emerged as a hot spot for trendy shoppers looking  for boutique-style bargains.  </P> <P> South Lake Avenue, however, is still by far the stronger shopping street. With  its established stores and built-in customers in high-rise office buildings,  South Lake did five times the retail business of Old Pasadena last year.  </P> <P> The two areas provide a marked contrast for Pasadena's holiday shoppers. They  will also provide the anchors to a fledgling effort to market Pasadena as a  regional shopping destination.  </P> <P> "The older, more traditional Pasadena resident is probably more likely to shop  on South Lake," said Bruce Ackerman, executive vice president of the Pasadena  Chamber of Commerce. "The trendier, newer Pasadena residents and a broader  cross-section of the community have tended to go to Old Pasadena."  </P> <P> After 6 p.m. most Friday nights, strollers throng Old Pasadena's Colorado  Boulevard. They wander in and out of the area's glitzy boutiques under the  colorful glare of trendy neon signs. Over on South Lake, the sidewalks are  nearly empty, the noontime business shoppers long gone.  </P> <P> Jim Plotkin, a vacuum cleaner dealer and head of the Old Pasadena Business  Improvement District, sounds almost cocky as he explains the difference.  </P> <P> South Lake businesses "are living off their old mailing lists; their old  clientele is dying off," Plotkin said. "It happens to every business. It  happened to me. You have to infuse, and South Lake is just beginning to wake up  to this."  </P> <P> Nelson Holdo, president of the South Lake Business Assn., says that his area is  at a mature stage and that some changes may be needed. "We want to inject some  new vitality into South Lake," Holdo said.  </P> <P> But he added that South Lake remains the city's premier shopping district.  "South Lake and Old Pasadena have different roles at this time," he said.  </P> <P> South Lake, filled with traditional men's and women's shops and shoe stores,  began its ascendancy at a time when Old Pasadena, which dated from the 1920s,  was languishing.  </P> <P> South Lake encompasses 458 stores and businesses along South Lake Avenue from  Colorado to California boulevards, including adjacent Shoppers Lane. The avenue  still brings in hefty sales. City statistics put last year's gross sales at  $147.2 million, a $22-million increase over 1988.  </P> <P> Old Pasadena had $28.6 million in gross retail sales last year. In contrast,  Plaza Pasadena, the city's only shopping mall, on Colorado Boulevard just east  of Old Pasadena, had $77 million in 1989 sales.  </P> <P> Over the years, however, a few of the family-owned, traditional men's stores --  like the Bayne-Williams Shop for Men -- have moved out of South Lake. They were  victims, Holdo and Ackerman said, of discount houses and department stores that  offer the same clothing at cheaper prices. In their place, South Lake now has  chain stores, selling the same goods but owned by large corporations.  </P> <P> The area also has a large number of high-rise office buildings with thousands  of business and professional workers, whose existence guarantees that the  downstairs shops will continue to flourish. It is an element that Old Pasadena  lacks, Holdo said.  </P> <P> Yet a handful of the business and professional workers have also brought a  discordant note to South Lake. About 60 of them refused last year to pay the  area's annual business assessment fees. The fees ranged from $150 to $300 per  business and are used for street improvements and advertising promotions.  </P> <P> The protesters claimed that such expenditures may increase ground-level  business but do little to increase visits to the high-rise offices of doctors,  accountants and attorneys. Most of the holdouts paid up when the city took them  to small claims court. Two, however, appealed to Pasadena Superior Court. A  decision is pending.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the association is trying to expand the appeal of the area. Under a  proposed "Streetscape" program, benches, bicycle racks, trash bins and two  concrete identification signs will be installed to encourage more pedestrian  traffic. Such changes would have been implemented even without the impending  competition from the One Colorado shopping center in Old Pasadena now under  construction, Holdo said.  </P> <P> "South Lake is one of the oldest shopping areas in this area," Holdo said. "It  represents the core of high-end retailing."  </P> <P> But Plotkin believes that South Lake may be burdened by its own success. He  contrasts the 300 small, individually owned shops in Old Pasadena and their  ability to unite on sales promotions and street events to the corporate-owned  giants of South Lake.  </P> <P> "Who do you talk to at Barker Bros., Silverwoods, Bullock's or I. Magnin?" he  said. "They're corporations, an institutional type of retail store."  </P> <P> Although Old Pasadena -- bounded by Arroyo Parkway, Pasadena Avenue, and Union  and Green streets -- has only about one-fifth the retail sales of South Lake,  Plotkin thinks that completion of One Colorado, a 260,000-square-foot shopping  center on Colorado Boulevard, will change the picture.  </P> <P> One Colorado will have "the same type of stores as South Lake, very high  fashion, very upscale," Plotkin said. "A lot of specialty stores on South Lake  are going to be dramatically affected."  </P> <P> However, Plotkin admits that his area lacks the office workers that back up  sales in South Lake. Old Pasadena also lacks major stores. Although most of the  small retail space in Old Pasadena is almost completely rented out, larger  spaces of up to 3,000 square feet go unrented.  </P> <P> But the competition between South Lake and Old Pasadena may be more perceived  than real. Both areas have agreed to participate in a proposed market study of  Pasadena to improve the city's visibility as a shopping destination and give it  more clout against malls.  </P> <P> The idea is to determine trends, demographics and attitudes of those who visit  and shop in Pasadena. The information would be used to make Pasadena a regional  destination for the San Gabriel Valley's 3 million residents, an idea proposed  by City Director Rick Cole.  </P> <P> Expected to contribute $12,500 each for the study are the South Lake and Old  Pasadena business associations, the city, the Pasadena Chamber of Commerce, and  the Pasadena Center Operating Company, which runs the city's convention center.  </P> <P> Cole believes that the two areas could complement each other in a marketing  strategy. "Old Pasadena and South Lake could become the stars in a crown," Cole  said. "Right now, we don't have a crown, just the stars."  </P></p>

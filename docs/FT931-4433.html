			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Toshiba licensing liquid crystal display technology to Orion Electric THE Japanese electronics company Toshiba is licensing liquid crystal display technology to Orion Electric, the South Korean company in which it has a stake of just under 1 per cent, writes Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo. Toshiba will license Orion with super-twisted pneumatic (STN) LCD technology used mainly for screens on notebook PCs. SNT LCDs are cheaper to manufacture than thin film transistor (TFT) LCDs, which Toshiba is developing in a joint venture with IBM. The quality of SNT LCDs, however, is inferior to that of TFT LCDs, in which many Japanese companies are investing heavily.</p>

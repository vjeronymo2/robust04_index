			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Maddox in loss and chairman resigns MR HUGO BIERMANN, the entrepreneurial chairman of Maddox Group, resigned yesterday as the troubled computer maintenance company announced an Pounds 18.9m interim loss and a financial restructuring package, including a rights issue. The 7-for-8 rights issue, consisting of 390m 1p shares at par, is underwritten by Williams de Broe and aims to raise Pounds 3.6m net, which will be used to repay creditors. The shares closed 1 1/4 p lower at 1 3/4 p yesterday. Like other aspects of the package, the rights will be subject to shareholders approval at an extraordinary meeting on December 4. Under the restructuring proposals, worked out over the last four months by the new management team, the company will then be renamed Wakebourne  - after its remaining profitable personal computer maintenance and support company. Mr Biermann, who has also resigned as a director, said yesterday that he thought it would be 'good for the group to have a lower profile' without him and said he was 'in a sense relieved' that he was stepping down. However, he said he intended to maintain his 13.6 per cent equity stake in the group, held with his partner, Mr Nicholas Toms, and was still considering whether to take up the rights issue. Mr Biermann, renowned as a shrewd South African deal maker, rose to fame in the UK after building up the Thomson T-Line mini-conglomerate with Mr Toms, before selling it to Ladbroke Group for Pounds 186m in 1989. Early last year the two men created Maddox by reversing two cable distributors, Cables &amp; Flexibles and US-based Seacoast Electric, into the quoted Pathfinders Group which was subsequently renamed. However, the performance of both Cables and Flexibles and Seacoast proved disappointing and they were both sold to a US group called Lantek Electronics earlier this year for Pounds 15.1m in Lantek paper. Yesterday, the Maddox' board said it had decided to provide against the whole Pounds 15.1m book value of the Lantek paper, although it acknowledged that the group might eventually receive some cash proceeds as the result of the recently announced merger of Lantek and VTX Electronics, a US stock exchange quoted company. The Pounds 18.9m pre-tax loss for the six months to June 30 was mainly as a result of the provision, and compared with a Pounds 325,000 profit last time. Turnover rose to Pounds 12m (Pounds 9.55m) and losses per share were 4.3p (0.21p earnings). Despite the group loss, Wakebourne made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.3m.</p>

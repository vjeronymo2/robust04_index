			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Labour mourns its lost leader: Tributes to John Smith span political divide - Shadow cabinet suspends Euro-campaign / Stunned party faces prolonged struggle to choose a successor The sudden death of Mr John Smith yesterday transformed Britain's political landscape, opening up the prospect of a protracted struggle for the Labour leadership and easing the pressure on Mr John Major's premiership. The news of his death, after a heart attack at his London flat, stunned Westminster. It brought grief and confusion as it quickly became clear that the political implications spread far beyond the opposition. The 55-year-old Mr Smith had suffered an earlier serious heart attack in 1988 but recovered fully after by-pass surgery. He was the overwhelming choice of the party when Mr Neil Kinnock stood down as leader after Labour's defeat in the 1992 general election. Mr Major led a chorus of tributes that spanned the political divide. Many of Mr Smith's shadow cabinet colleagues were unable to contain their grief at the loss of one of the most respected politicians of his generation. As the government suspended all parliamentary business in deference to Mr Smith's family, Mr Major described Mr Smith as an 'outstanding parliamentarian'. His death was 'the waste of a remarkable political talent'. Praising his honesty, integrity and his brilliant House of Commons' style, Mr Major added: 'I shall think of him as an opponent, not an enemy, and when I remember him I shall do so with respect and with affection.' The Queen sent a personal message of sympathy to Mrs Elizabeth Smith, his widow, and her three daughters. Mr Kinnock spoke of the 'massive injustice' that Mr Smith had been deprived of the chance to lead his country. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, spoke of Mr Smith's 'sharp wit and deep personal warmth'. Mrs Margaret Beckett, the deputy Labour leader, who took over as acting party leader, was heard in stunned silence by hundreds of MPs as she offered an emotional tribute from the Commons despatch box. Mr Smith was pronounced dead at St Bartholomew's hospital yesterday morning after being rushed by ambulance from his flat in London's Barbican complex. He had suffered at least one and perhaps two heart attacks. Only 12 hours before he appeared buoyant at a party fund-raising dinner. After an emergency meeting of the shadow cabinet, Mrs Beckett announced that the party would halt all campaigning for next month's European elections until after Mr Smith's funeral next week. Labour hopes the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats will do the same. It also deferred until later this month any move to begin the complicated electoral procedures to choose a successor. But at Westminster last night four of the leading figures in the shadow cabinet were potential contenders in a struggle which will decide the party's future direction and be critical to the outcome of the next general election. Mr Tony Blair, the 41-year-old shadow home secretary and one of the most prominent leaders of the so-called 'modernisers', was quickly tipped by MPs on both the right and left of the party as the most likely successor. Several members of the shadow cabinet said Mr Blair, who has a strong appeal among the middle-class voters in the south needed by Labour if it is to win a general election, was the obvious choice. Some backbench MPs were suggesting a 'dream ticket' under which Mr John Prescott, the leftwing shadow employment secretary, would take the deputy leadership. But Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor and a close friend of Mr Blair and a fellow moderniser, is also a strong contender. Friends said they would agree on a single candidacy for advocates of reform rather than fight each other in a contest. On the left of the party, Mr Prescott and Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, could expect powerful support from the constituency and trades union sections of the electoral college which chooses the party leader. Mrs Beckett and Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, might also join the contest. The party made it clear last night that the protracted process of choosing a new leader would not start until after the June 9 European election. Because of Labour's complicated electoral system - involving individual ballots of party activists and supporters in the union movement - the process could take months. Senior party figures suggested the outcome might not be known until the annual party conference at the end of September. As senior Labour figures contemplated the succession, the judgment of Conservative ministers was that Mr Smith's tragic death had greatly reduced the threat to Mr Major's position from the European elections. A protracted struggle for the Labour leadership would shift much of the political focus from internal divisions in the Tory party over Europe to the Labour succession, in turn easing the immediate pressure on Mr Major. Conservative MPs said that Mr Smith's death had also severely dented the chances of Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, capturing the Tory leadership. Mr Heseltine suffered a minor heart attack last year. Leading critics of the prime minister on the Tory back benches acknowledged that they now saw virtually no chance of a move to oust him in the summer if the government suffered a massive defeat in the European poll. The prospect of a challenge in the autumn would also depend to a significant degree on which candidate Labour chose to succeed Mr Smith.

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Low &amp; Bonar advances 21% LOW &amp; Bonar, the international packaging and materials group, yesterday reported a 21 per cent increase in interim profits, reflecting improved operating margins following a restructuring programme. The Dundee-based group, which has also made two significant acquisitions in the UK carton sector in recent months funded by a Pounds 50.2m rights issue in April, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 14.3m for the six months to May 31, up from Pounds 11.8m a year earlier. Turnover improved 13 per cent to Pounds 171.1m (Pounds 151m), boosted by the acquisitions, which added Pounds 4.87m, and by currency translation movements. Sales volumes were flat. An interim dividend of 2.9p (2.7p) is payable from earnings per share ahead 14 per cent to 10.22p (8.94p restated). Mr Jim Leng, who took over as chief executive last year, said the improvement in earnings had been delivered 'in tough market conditions, particularly on the Continent.' Group operating profits increased by 28 per cent to Pounds 16.3m (Pounds 12.8m), including Pounds 857,000 attributed to acquisitions. Currency movements accounted for a further Pounds 1m of the gain, although strong currencies adversely affected a number of the group's Continental businesses. Overall margins increased from 8.6 per cent to 9.9 per cent. European profits rose by 20 per cent to Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 10.9m) with Bonar Cereal Packaging, acquired from Kellogg in April, making 'an encouraging' first contribution. The UK now accounts for nearly two thirds of European profits. European margins improved from 10.6 per cent to 11.2 per cent helped by a continuing cost reduction programme. North American profits rose by 68 per cent from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 3.7m following a restructuring programme begun in the second half of last year which helped lift margins from 4.4 per cent to 7 per cent. The higher operating profits were partly offset by increased interest charges of Pounds 2.02m (Pounds 1.24m) reflecting acquisition payments made in May last year. Following the rights issue at the end of April net borrowings fell to Pounds 18m (Pounds 37m), equivalent to gearing of 11.2 per cent. COMMENT The new management team is beginning to deliver the margin and profit improvements that Low &amp; Bonar needed. Costs, including the headcount, are being cut and the North American operations have been turned around. The acquisition last month of CMB Carton Systems for Pounds 17.35m has introduced leading packaging systems technology into the carton division which is now underpinned by a five-year supply contract with Kellogg. Analysts were raising their profit forecasts yesterday and profits before tax could reach Pounds 31m this year, producing earnings of 20.8p per share and a prospective multiple of 16.6. The share price has been rising, but could still go higher.</p>

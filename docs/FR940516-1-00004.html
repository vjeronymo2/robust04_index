			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4.21 requires the disclosure document for commodity pools to contain various types of information concerning the pool; the pool's CPO and CTA, and their principals; the FCM through which the pool's trades will be executed and cleared; and the pool's IB, if applicable. This information includes, among other things, the pool's and CPO's form of organization (Rule 4.21(a)(1)(i)); the pool's investment objectives (Rule 4.21(a)(1)(viii)); the business backgrounds of the CPO and CTA and their principals (Rule 4.21(a)(2)); material administrative, civil or criminal actions within the five years preceding the date of the disclosure document against the CPO, CTA, FCM and IB and their principals (Rule 4.21(a)(13)(i)); conflicts of interest on the part of the CPO, CTA, FCM, IB and their principals with respect to the pool (Rule 4.21(a)(3)(i)); the performance records of the pool and its CTA (Rules 4.21 (a)(4) and (a)(5), respectively) and, if the pool has traded commodity interests for less than twelve months, the performance of each other pool operated by the CPO and by each of its principals (Rule 4.21(a)(4)(i)(B)); a complete description of each kind of expense that the pool has incurred in its preceding fiscal year or is expected to incur in its current fiscal year (Rule 4.21(a)(7)) and of commissions or other fees that are paid or may be paid by the pool, its CPO, CTA or their principals in connection with solicitations for the pool (Rule 4.21(a)(14)); and risk disclosure and cautionary statements (Rules 4.21(a)(17) and 4.21(a)(18), respectively).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The disclosure document for CTAs must contain, among other matters, the name and business background of the CTA and each principal thereof (Rules 4.21(a)(1) and 4.21(a)(2), respectively); a description of the trading program (Rule 4.31(a)(1)(iii)); the types of commodity interests the CTA intends to trade (Rule 4.31(a)(v)); the performance record of the CTA and its principals (Rule 4.31(a)(3)); a description of any conflict of interest regarding the trading program on the part of the CTA, FCM, IB and their principals (Rule 4.31(a)(5)); material actions against the foregoing persons (Rule 4.31(a)(7)); and risk disclosure and cautionary statements (Rules 4.31(a)(8) and 4.31(a)(9), respectively).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the adoption of Rules 4.21 and 4.31 in 1979, the number of registered CPOs has more than doubled and the number of CTAs has increased nearly threefold. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Assets under the  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> management of CPOs have also grown dramatically <FOOTCITE> <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> </FOOTCITE>  and the range of available futures and option contracts has increased substantially. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In addition, during the past decade, pool operations and investments have reflected increased diversity and complexity. When Rule 4.21 came into effect, most CPOs operated one or two pools, and pools usually had one CPO which generally directed the commodity interest trading for the pool or engaged the services of a CTA who invested pool assets directly in commodity interest contracts. Increasingly, however, CPOs operate multiple pools, and commodity pools' and CTAs' investments are more diverse and complex. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A single commodity pool may engage multiple CTAs to provide advisory services for the pool and also invest in other commodity pools (``investee pools'') or securities funds in order to access the services of particular traders or advisors, to employ multiple trading strategies or programs, or to diversify its portfolio. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ``Investee pools'' may also hold investments in other funds, resulting in multi-tiered structures of commodity pools and other investment vehicles. Because of the proliferation of trading strategies and growing specialization of CTAs, an increasing number of pools also retain ``trading managers'' to recommend or select CTAs for the pool or to select funds for investment of the pool's assets. Many CPOs and trading managers follow dynamic asset allocation strategies whereby the performance of the pool's CTAs is continuously reviewed and the selection of CTAs and allocation of assets among them are subject to frequent modification. Other commodity pools are formed as vehicles for collective access to particular CTAs whose services would not be readily available on a managed account basis and who are expected to provide advisory services to the pool throughout its existence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In April 1979, 619 persons were registered as CPOs and 976 persons as CTAs. As of February 28, 1994 there were 1,265 registered CPOs and 2,511 registered CTAs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Figures compiled by the National Futures Association indicate that the assets of commodity pools (both public and private) have more than doubled from 1988 to 1991, from approximately $8.6 billion to approximately $19 billion.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Managed Accounts Reports  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> (``MAR'') estimates public pool assets at $15 million in 1975, $250 million in 1980 and $435 million in 1983. These data reflect, in part, the increased use of managed futures by collective investment vehicles seeking to diversify their portfolios or manage the risks of securities, fixed income instruments or other assets. Concomitantly, institutional users such as state pension plans have increased their participation in managed futures. See Peltz,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> The road to managed futures_the institutional perspective,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> MAR Issue No. 181 (March 1994). In addition, many primarily securities vehicles invest a small portion of their assets in commodity interests pursuant to Rule 4.12(b), which went into effect on November 2, 1987.

The Pool Survey indicated that, on average, each large CPO operated about four pools and employed about two CTAs per pool. At the upper end of the range, the Pool Survey showed two CPOs accounting for 20 or more pools each and three pools employing the services of as many as 14 CTAs each. The National Futures Association reported that, as of October 1993, for 300 pools the CPO also served as CTA, 376 pools had one CTA and 216 pools had more than one CTA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

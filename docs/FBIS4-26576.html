			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Yin Nai-hsin (1438 0035 7451)] </F>   [Text] The Mainland Affairs Commission [MAC] yesterday  approved the proposal of the Ministry of Education to stop,  beginning 1 July, accepting applications for allowing  non-cultural and educational personnel from the mainland to  visit Taiwan to engage in cultural and educational activities  and to strictly control cross-strait cultural and educational  exchanges to be held in Taiwan by closely screening their  sponsors and the nature of the activities. The visit to Taiwan  by non-cultural and non-educational figures will be allowed only  after responsible government agencies have enacted relevant  regulations governing the approval of their applications.    At the present stage, the action described above will be  interpreted as a measure in disguise to tighten control. In the  past, administrative agencies took a more liberal attitude in  examining reasons for the mainlanders' visits to Taiwan to  engage in cultural and educational activities and in determining  their status. This has enabled mainlanders in official positions  who have worked in economic, trade, industrial, and business  circles to visit Taiwan. However, after 1 July, the Ministry of  Education will only accept the applications of mainland  personnel in cultural and educational circles to engage in  educational, sports, cultural, arts, and science and technology  activities that are sponsored by schools, research institutions,  and academic societies. Personnel in other specialized fields  can apply for visits to Taiwan only after government agencies  have enacted measures for approving their applications.    In our administrative talks with the mainland, the question  of visits by mainland economic and trade personnel to Taiwan has  consistently been used as a bargaining chip, and this has  delayed approval of the measures drafted by the Ministry of  Economic Affairs governing visits by people from the mainland's  economic and trade circles. The MAC meeting's approval of the  Ministry of Education's proposal at this time will block for the  time being the route used by mainland economic and trade  personnel in official positions to visit Taiwan. Whether this  has anything to do with the aftermath of the Chientao Lake  [Qiandaohu] case on cross-strait relations is worth pondering.    After the MAC meeting, MAC Vice Chairman Kao Kung-lien said  that the government has been too relaxed in its control, adding  that the government has never specifically allowed non-cultural  and non- educational personnel to visit Taiwan for cultural and  educational activities. According to statistics, only one third  of the mainlanders who were approved by the Ministry of  Education to visit Taiwan were directly involved in academic  activities in the strict sense of the word; the rest have  nothing to do with cultural and educational activities at all.    We have sponsored many cross-strait symposiums -- including  those on steel production, communications, and tourism -- based  on the measures governing the approval of applications for  people from the mainland to visit Taiwan to engage in cultural  and educational activities. Personnel in charge of the  mainland's state-run enterprises, including those from the  Shoutu [Shoudu] Iron and Steel Corporation, airline companies,  and Youth Tourist Service, have visited Taiwan.    Kao Kung-lien pointed out: Last June, the government  promulgated measures governing the approval of applications for  people on the mainland to visit Taiwan. Since then, with the  exception of those who came to visit their relatives and attend  their funerals, all others have come based on measures governing  approval of applications for cultural and educational exchanges.  It is easy to handle applications for educational, cultural,  sports, and arts exchange, because they are easy to identify.  The Ministry of Education, however, has a hard time examining  non-academic activities involving finance, banking, and  economics. The ministry last year asked other government  agencies to enact measures for the approval of applications for  mainland personnel in different categories to visit Taiwan, but  the agencies have not come up with the measures yet.    It was pointed out that the following measures on visits by  mainlanders in specialized fields have been drafted on the basis  of regulations governing relations between people on two sides  of the Taiwan Strait and are in the process of being examined  and approved: measures on visits by economic and trade personnel  (Ministry of Economic Affairs), by agricultural personnel  (Council of Agriculture), and by communications personnel  (Ministry of Communications). Measures concerning visits by  physicians and by financial, construction, and environmental  protection personnel are also being considered.</p>

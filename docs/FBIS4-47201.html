			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Skachko: "Once Again, a Struggle for an </F> Independent State: Opposition Attempting To Unite"]    [Text] At a news conference in Kiev of the "Ukraine"  Association of Democratic Forces, its newly elected leader,  Dmitriy Pavlychko, the well-known poet and deputy of the former  Ukrainian parliament, affirmed for the umpteenth time the defeat  of the national democratic forces at the parliamentary elections  and called on all nationally aware politicians for unity lest  this situation be repeated at the forthcoming presidential  elections. In Pavlychko's opinion, the reasons for the defeat of  the Ukrainian national democrats were the most profound economic  crisis, the nostalgia that it has caused for the former times,  inadequate political experience, and, of course, the absence of  unity, which enabled the ruling nomenklatura "to heap the blame  for what has happened on the national democrats." Dmitriy  Pavlychko declared: "The very idea of Ukraine's independence is  being called in question today. We are once again in a phase of  struggle for an independent state." In his opinion, the national  democrats should in the current situation renounce the  protracted euphoria from the acquisition of state independence  and attempt to link the idea of statehood with that of social  justice, since antimarket views prevail in the present Supreme  Council, and members of parliament are adopting a policy of a  return to the command-administrative system. Pavlychko agreed  that it is, indeed, today necessary for regulation of the  economy on the part of the state, but that this should be done  in the interests of the poorest strata of society and that "we  cannot return to the socialist capitalism under which we lived  for 70 years."    Dmitriy Pavlychko cited the two principal most important  tasks of the democratic camp: victory at the parliamentary  by-elections for 112 people's deputies of Ukraine on 24 July and  concerted support for the progressive candidate at the upcoming  presidential elections. Pavlychko announced that the "Ukraine"  Association has been able to agree on and put forward 73 united  democratic candidates and that he would be pleased if only half  of these were to win. In the opinion of Vladimir Klimchuk,  leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Ukraine, the  parliamentary by-elections are today the democrats' most  important tasks, since it is they that can, if not alter the  correlation of forces in parliament in favor of the democrats,  then in any event, preserve for them the opportunity to ensure  that the left cannot have in parliament a constitutional  majority and cannot adopt a constitution and laws to their  advantage.    Apropos the presidential elections, Pavlychko said that the  leaders of national democratic parties and movements had  attempted to unite and had created a coordinating council of  chairmen of political parties, which is to define a common  approach to the presidential campaign and determine the  candidate to be supported. At the same time, on the other hand,  the leaders of the democratic association affirmed that they had  been unable thus far to formulate a common strategy and tactics  at the elections and had not settled on a single candidate.  According to Dmitriy Pavlychko, the democrats should proceed,  meanwhile, from the fact that they must under no circumstances  "support regression" and should, consequently, oppose, in his  opinion, the anti-Ukraine and antimarket programs of former  Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma and the present speaker of  parliament, Aleksandr Moroz, leader of the Socialist Party. In  Pavlychko's opinion, democrats should support the "lesser of the  two evils." Dmitriy Pavlychko declared that this candidate today  is Leonid Kravchuk, who alone could worthily confront both  Leonid Kuchma and Aleksandr Moroz, uphold Ukraine's  independence, and be a predictable politician. "We are today at  the Rubicon: Either you are for Ukraine or you are against it,"  Pavlychko summed up, and added that the ideal situation would be  the distribution of the highest offices of state among all the  dominant political forces and their leaders. Specifically,  Pavlychko believes, Kravchuk would be acceptable as president,  and Moroz, as speaker of parliament, and Ivan Plyushch and other  presidential contestants would join a government of reforms and  all-Ukraine accord.    As far as Ukrainian society itself is concerned, it is, as  before, in a state of social apathy. This may be confirmed, for  example, by the data of a sociological survey of 1,200 persons  from eight eastern and southern oblasts of Ukraine and the  Republic of Crimea. The poll was conducted by the Democratic  Initiatives center. Only 41 percent of those polled recalled  that on 1 December 1991 they had supported Ukraine's  independence. Also of interest are the responses to the direct  question: "If you had once again to participate in a referendum  on questions of the state independence of Ukraine, what would  your choice be now?" Forty-seven percent believe that they would  oppose Ukraine's independence, 24 would respond positively, 12  percent would not take part in the referendum at all, and 17  percent did not know. Such lamentable data after two and  one-half years of Ukraine's independence are, according to the  sociological poll, the result of the ill-conceived policy of the  national leadership. Some 37 percent of those polled cited  together with other factors as the main cause of the crisis the  reluctance or incapacity of the leadership of Ukraine for  implementing market economic reforms. Among the other causes,  citing three alternative answers, 34 percent of respondents  consider the main cause of the crisis the collapse of the Union;  28 percent, the absence in Ukraine of strong and authoritative  leaders; 25 percent, the absence of a realistic program of an  escape from the crisis; 26 percent, the incompetence and  irresponsibility of the government bureaucracy; 28 percent, the  activity of the mafia; and 14 percent, the lack of discipline  and order in society.    Only 23 percent of respondents believe that Ukraine could  emerge from the crisis in the coming years; 39 percent are sure  that it can overcome the crisis in the coming years, and 21  percent are sure that Ukraine can never emerge from the crisis;  a further 15 percent did not know.    Those polled were just as pessimistic about the coming  presidential elections. Twenty percent declared that they would  not be voting at all; 42 percent had not decided for whom they  would vote; 21 percent gave as their choice former Prime  Minister Leonid Kuchma; 7 percent, the present president, Leonid  Kravchuk; 4 percent, the socialist Aleksandr Moroz the speaker  of parliament; 3 percent, Volodymyr Lanovyy, former deputy prime  minister for economic reform; and 2 percent, former speaker Ivan  Plyushch. Responding to a question as to what Ukraine needs to  do first and foremost, 41 percent of those polled cited the  assurance of government social safeguards for the working  people; 32 percent, the restoration of the USSR; 26 percent, the  imposition of order in society by any methods, power methods  included; 22 percent, support for enterprise; 21 percent, a  return to the socialist model of development with state  regulation of the economy and the system of distribution; 25  percent, the introduction of Russian as a second official  language; and only 15 percent, a strengthening of the Ukrainian  state.    Evaluating the activity of the political parties, 52 percent  of respondents declared that the parties are engaged exclusively  in a struggle for power; 8 percent, that parties are an  essential component of the democratic development of society; 7  percent, that they express the interests of the mafia; and 6  percent each declared that the parties contribute to the  emergence of conflicts or that they defend people's interests.  The rest of those polled had difficulty answering the question  on the role of the party in society.    Responding to a question concerning the prospects of  Crimea's  existence, 48 percent of those polled replied that they would  like to see it as an inalienable part of Ukraine; 16 percent,  that Crimea should be an independent state and 10 percent, that  it should become a part of Russia; 7 percent proposed other  options, and 18 percent did not know. According to the data of  this survey, the people of Ukraine are, as before, in a state of  political apathy. Only 32 percent of those polled are prepared  to take part personally in strikes with political or economic  demands; 38 percent agree to put up with any material  difficulties provided that calm and civil peace be preserved in  the country; 14 percent of those polled responded that the  political struggle did not concern them; and 16 percent did not  know.</p>

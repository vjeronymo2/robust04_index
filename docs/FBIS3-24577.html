			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by O. A. Gudayev, V. A. Treshchikhin; UDC </F> 621.315.592]    [Abstract]The effects were examined of low temperature  annealing (T&lt;100)of chemically deposited PbS layers in an  oxygen containing medium and in a vacuum, on the spectrum and  value of photosensitivity, dark resistance, noise, etc. It was  demonstrated that there exist a simultaneous close correlation  between dark conduction of samples and their photoconduction.  This correlation is explained by the charge transfer mechanism  in media with strong spacial fluctuations of conduction. In view  of the fact that despite strong changes in the photosensitivity  value no significant changes occurred in the photoconduction  spectrum during the process of low temperature annealing, it may  be concluded that the absorption coefficient is not changing.  Changes occur in the product of the parameters _t_, where    is the conduction and _t_ is the life-time of the  nonequilibrium  carriers. In order to uncover which is the most contributing  factor in the photoconduction changes: changes in the transport  properties of the carriers, which affect the dark conduction, or  changes in the life-time of nonequilibrium carriers, the dark  conduction of samples and their photoconduction, as well as the  photoconduction and the life-time of the nonequilibrium carriers  was examined. These parameters were measured in a lot of samples  with a large distribution of the photoconduction value. Samples  with a higher conduction exhibited a higher photoconduction.

Luis Macas, president of the Confederation of Indian  Nationalities of Ecuador, said the people are currently asking  the government to reconsider the law, which also interests the  Indians. That is why we are going to stage a preventive  demonstration. Macas pointed out that the Indians will stop  their activities, set up blockades, and march during the day to  express their dissatisfaction with the 71-percent fuel increase,  which has been in effect for more than a week.    Macas added that if the government does not heed the  Ecuadoran people's protests, they will obviously have to  consider stronger measures.</p>

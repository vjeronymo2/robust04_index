Not a single worker in Minsk went  out onto Independence Square in support of the demands of the  strike committees. There was a rally on Independence Square.  Among the speakers, there were only representatives of the  strike committees and the BPF [Belarus People's Front]. They  sharply criticized the government and the Supreme Soviet. From  Independence Square, the people in the rally proceeded in a  column to the Supreme Soviet building, where they passed on  their demands to Chairman of Supreme Soviet Mechyslaw Hryb. The  demands include the resignation of the government and elections  to the Supreme Soviet in March. In the opinion of the ralliers,  the speaker should give his reply not later than 22 February,  the day the Supreme Soviet resumes work. The latest rally on  Independence Square is set for precisely that time. The members  of the strike committee are continuing to carry out  organizational work, calling on the workers to strike.</p>

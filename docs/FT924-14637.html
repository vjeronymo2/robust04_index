			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / International Company News: Raytheon ahead 5.1% at Dollars 156m RAYTHEON, the New England-based defence business which makes the Patriot missile, yesterday announced a 5.1 per cent rise in third quarter net income, even though profits in its important electronics division were lower than a year ago. The company reported net income of Dollars 156.1m, or Dollars 1.16 a share, compared with Dollars 148.4m, or Dollars 1.12 a share, in the same period of last year, on sales of Dollars 2.2bn, down from Dollars 2.35m. Electronics, which includes the Patriot missile and the company's largest business, saw lower sales and profits, which the company said reflected the timing of key production orders, including one pending from Saudi Arabia for Patriot fire units and missiles. However, Mr Dennis Picard, chairman and chief executive, said earnings benefited from improved profitability in energy and environmental businesses, aircraft products and major appliances - despite a sluggish economy and a slip in receipt of foreign contracts. In the first nine months Raytheon made Dollars 465.1m, or Dollars 3.46 a share, compared with Dollars 433.9m, or Dollars 3.29 a share, in 1991, while sales were down from Dollars 6.84bn to Dollars 6.66bn.</p>

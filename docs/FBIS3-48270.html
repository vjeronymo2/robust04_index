			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A bilateral fishing agreement between Vanuatu and  Taiwan is to be reviewed. The Taiwan-based (Minda) Association,  which adminsiters Taiwanese vessels fishing in Vanuatu, called  for the review in protest against the Vanuatu's Supreme Court  finding a Taiwanese fisherman guilty of breaching Vanuatu  fishing laws. In its letter to Vanuatu's Fisheries Department,  the (Minda) Association complained that Vanuatu is much stricter  than other South Pacific nations in policing its laws. The  director of National Surveillance Center, John Toleo, says  fishing management in Vanuatu's exclusive economics zone is very  important and Vanuatu will continue to police its laws. But  Capt. Toleo says he will advice (Minda) that Vanuatu will set up  a committee to review and consider amendments of the 1989  Agreement.</p>

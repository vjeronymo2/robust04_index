			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / New UN aid convoy heads for Srebrenica UNITED NATIONS relief lorries carrying food and other aid were yesterday heading once more for Srebrenica, the most vulnerable Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia. But western diplomats feared the stepped-up relief effort would not stem the panic in the town, which has been surrounded and bombarded for almost a year by Serb forces. Relief workers described mounting chaos in Srebrenica whose peace-time population of 10,000 has been swelled enormously by fleeing Moslems. Most people are hungry and poorly clothed, they say. No medicines remain. The UN 16-lorry convoy is hoping to be able to evacuate more sick and wounded women, children and elderly, in addition to the more than 2,000 brought out by road on Monday to Tuzla, the biggest Bosnian government stronghold 70 miles to the north-west. Eight Moslem women and children reportedly died on that journey when, desperate to leave the town, they crowded on to the UN lorries. Bosnian Serb forces appear intent on seizing Srebrenica, set in the middle of the north-south corridor from Belgrade to Pale, the Serb mountain stronghold above Sarajevo. A 48-hour ceasefire yesterday appeared to be mostly holding except for some violations around Bosnia. According to Ms Lyndall Sachs of the Belgrade office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR): 'Social structures (in Srebrenica) have entirely collapsed. But they must be re-established in order to cope with the situation. The population is totally demoralised. We have to instill them with confidence through regular convoys and maintainance of the situation.' UN officials yesterday postponed the resumption of an evacuation by helicopter of wounded Moslems from Srebrenica. Diplomats said the airborne mission would restart when the UN convoy of 16 lorries left the besieged town. The air mission last week was suspended after Serb forces attacked the makeshift air strip at Srebrenica, killing at least three people. Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's deputy foreign minister and special envoy to the peace talks, arrived in Belgrade yesterday to add his voice to pressure on Serb leaders to endorse the UN peace plan.

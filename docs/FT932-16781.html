			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Markets: A lingering spectre haunts investors - London Markets Q: What is the link between the Bank of England's successful gilt auction this week and the sudden suspension of shares in Queens Moat Houses, the hotel chain? A: The legacy of the ERM. Britain's two-year membership of the system, and the sky-high interest rates it required until last autumn, hang over the financial markets still. The effects will continue to shape events for some time to come. Take Queens Moat. A week ago, the company was in what seemed like routine talks with its bankers to renew its borrowing facilities. Apparently, it was doing nothing to dispel the view that profits for the year to mid-January would be around the Pounds 80m predicted by analysts. On Wednesday, Queens Moat announced that its shares were suspended, at its own request, that a Pounds 7m dividend payment was being postponed, and that it was seeking clarification of its financial position. By Friday, with bankers baffled about what was going on, it was unclear whether there would be any profits at all for 1992. There are any number of theories about what went wrong at Queens Moat. One factor, however, is the company's debt burden, not far off Pounds 1bn - a lot of money for a company with revenues of only Pounds 543m in 1991. There were significant off-balance sheet borrowings too, as well as a Pounds 207m slug of convertible cumulative redeemable preference shares, which future accounting standards are likely to classify as non-equity, worsening gearing further. In short, Queens Moat had borrowed up to its eyebrows. The debt was incurred to expand in the late 1990s. Much of that borrowing was in D-Marks: the bulk of the group's expansion, in the years when sterling was shadowing the German currency or linked to it through the ERM, was on the Continent. When Britain was at the trough of its recession - partly because of ERM membership - Germany was still booming. Because it was benefiting from strong business in Germany, Queens Moat's highest share price, 119p, came relatively late: at the end of 1989, six months after Forte's. Interest rates continued to rise thereafter; and though, from the autumn of 1992 onwards, UK rates started to fall sharply, German rates stayed relatively high. What is more, to anyone paying D-Mark interest rates from a sterling base, debt service costs were painfully increased by the devaluation of the last quarter of the year. The company has been paying the delayed price of the bargain-basement interest rates enjoyed during the years of sterling's artificial strength. The stock market had recognised the company's problems: in mid-1992, the shares fell heavily, from the 90p range to 27 1/2 p, a fall triggered by the revelation of a sharp rise in borrowings. Since then they had recovered, as analysts decided that the company was through the worst. The shares were once again on many buy-lists. Until Wednesday. That was also the day on which the markets were basking in the success of the Bank of England's largest-ever auction of government bonds, a success that partly stemmed from the elaborate pre-auction game of double-bluff. For weeks, the UK's domestic investment institutions had been sending unenthusiastic signals about their appetite for gilts to the Bank of England. They rammed the point home by reacting coolly to the size of the auction when it was first announced, pushing long-term interest rates up. That made the bonds look just that fraction more attractive. So in the event, investors bid more strongly for them than their earlier comments might have suggested. Once it was clear that there were more than enough buyers for the issue, gilts rallied strongly, pushing long-term interest rates down again, and neatly rewarding the purchasers with an immediate capital gain. Everybody could feel pleased. Except, perhaps, anyone who pays taxes and believes the government's promises of low inflation. The gilts on offer were 20-year government bonds, paying 8 per cent every year from now until 2013. If inflation is really going to be in the 1-2 per cent range for the long term, as the government promises, then those bonds are yielding between 6 per cent and 7 per cent in real terms. If you believe the government's promises, that is an attractive rate for a buyer: most textbooks say you should assume no more than a 3-3 1/2 per cent long-term real return on risk-free investments. But it is a poor bargain for a taxpayer. That underlying truth is obscured by dealers' enthusiasm for a 'successful' gilt auction. It is another of the ways in which the after-effects of Britain's period of ERM membership - high interest rates, ultimate departure and all - continue to affect the London markets. Long-term interest rates have still to fall to levels consistent with the government's inflation promises. Either the government is right, in which case interest rates have a lot further to fall; or the level of rates is right, in which case inflation will be more of a problem than the government is prepared to admit. Well, that is for the future. For the moment, London's stock market analysts, though divided on the outlook for interest rates, seem mostly agreed that the recession is over but that the current level of prices already reflects this. The market is thus likely to go sideways for a while, they say - the sort of consensus that tempts fate. As the first quarter results captured in the chart show, however, even a sideways-moving market can throw up significant upward or downward moves in individual stocks. If you had bought Pounds 1,000 worth of Glaxo shares on January 1, you would have been exactly Pounds 722 worse off at the end of March than someone who had plunked their Pounds 1,000 into British Steel. At least that cannot be blamed on the ERM.</p>

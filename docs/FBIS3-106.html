			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Abuja, 28 Feb (AFP) -- France should be held  responsible if the current border disputes between Nigeria and  Cemeroon degenerates, Nigerian External Relations Minister  Alhaji Baba Gana Kingibe pointed out today. Mr. Kingibe who was  addressing reporters in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, felt that  problems between Nigeria and Cameroon, which, according to him,  are only "bilateral", should remain as such.    The same day Nigerian Information Minister Jerry Gana had  already told AFP in Lagos "to be aware of the implications of  French participation." He had expressed "reservations" about a  French intervention in the border conflict, but expressed the  hope that French military intervention "was going to bring peace  and not escalate the crisis."</p>

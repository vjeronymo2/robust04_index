			<p>BFN     [Text] A ceremony was held at the Ministry of Agriculture  and Forestry in Vientiane yesterday to sign a protocol on  agricultural development cooperation between the Government of  the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR] and the DPRK  Government in accordance with the primary agreement signed in  Vientiane on 6 June by the high-level leaders of the two  countries.    Phimpha Thepkhamheuang, deputy minister of agriculture and  forestry, and (Kim Chik-suk), respectively representing the LPDR  and DPRK Governments, signed the protocol in the presence of the  representatives of the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the Prime  Minister's Office, and many technical authorities concerned from  the two sides.    The protocol designated some areas to conduct agricultural  development programs and experimental studies to find proper  technical methods in planting crops and raising livestock for  commercial purposes. The experimental work will be jointly  carried out by the two sides on four locations covering an area  of 11 hectares within a period of five years, namely a  five-hectare plot at Latsen in Xieng Khouang Province and three  plots in Vientiane Province -- a one-hectare plot at the Naphok  Seeds Experimental Center, a one-hectare plot at the Hatdokkeo  Agricultural Center, and a four-hectare plot at the Salakham  Agricultural Promotion Unit. New techniques and rice-planting  machines will be used on an experimental basis to raise rice  production efficiency up to the level achieved by the DPRK,  which is capable of producing between eight to 12 metric tons of  paddy per one hectare.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with General Gallois by Dominique Garraud; place </F> and date not given: "General Gallois: `We Must Not Be the  Mercenaries of Europe'" -- first paragraph is LIBERATION  introduction]    [Text] In 1956, General Pierre-Marie Gallois was one of the  founders of France's nuclear deterrence doctrine. Now aged 82,  he is still a leading expert on military strategy. He will run  in the European elections on the voting list headed by [former  Socialist Defense Minister] Jean-Pierre Chevenement. In the  wake of the government's defenese white paper presented last  month, General Gallois is soon to publish his own version:  "Black Paper on Defense" (Footnote) (Payot Essays, 85 French  francs)    [Garraud] France is today the only West European country  actually increasing its military spending. Is this a worthy  priority?    [Gallois] I would have preferred the spending to be devoted  to improving and perfecting military technology for the  essential task of keeping France out of war situations through a  policy of intimidation. The white paper proposed a  "long-distance intervention force" taken from a stock of 130,000  men capable of intervening 7,000 km from France. Even with the  assistance of our allies, that would require considerable  resources. It is an excessive ambition, unless we accept  becoming the mercenary force of the Europe under construction, a  role that I would not like at all.    In the past 12 years, France has mounted or participated in  25 military intervention. During this time, our European  partners have invested in vocational training, scientific  research, economic and industrial development, the environment,  and improving living conditions. The question is whether we  have the resources to continue in this way.    [Garraud] What, in your opinion, should France's military  priorities be?    [Gallois] Today, public opinion will no longer tolerate  military intervention in which involves losses, which would  quickly be considered excessive. That is why the only policy I  can envisage is one of intimidation. France should strive to  develop long-distance weapons, which can be operated without  endangering the lifes of the people who serve them.    With so-called "intelligent" weapons, the combatant becomes  more of a director than an actor. I do not think this change  has been understood.    [Garraud] What implications should such a change have for  the  military programming law?    [Gallois] In absolute terms, all major programs designed for  the Cold War should be downscaled so as to open up new avenues  of research. For example, when you compare the Rafale with the  American F117 bomber, it is clear that the latter is stealthy,  whereas the former is not. The airplane should now be viewed  more as a way of getting weapons airborne than as an actual  combat machine in its own right. It is the intelligent missile  that should do all the long-distance destruction, the plane  having turned tail for home a long time before. To date, we  have not taken this view. We invest money in the plane rather  than the missile. That is a conceptional error. The Leclerc  tank is a traditional land army tank, but it is not suited to  the current circumstances. What good is a maneuver force today?  We have to take new directions.    [Garraud] Your priority remains the nuclear deterrent. How  do you see this evolving?    [Gallois] We have to keep the strategic oceanic force, which  is almost invulnerable. I would add several submarines with  much more accurate, very-low-power ballistic missiles. In this  way, we could intervene at great distances from France without  having to massively deploy conventional forces, as the United  States did for the Gulf war.    Another component, although not absolutely essential, is a  mobile weapons system based in France and consisting of  double-capacity ballistic missiles, such as the Pershing 2's.  These would be accurate and could take nuclear or conventional  warheads. In this way, we could confine the belt of instability  which is taking shape from Japan, across North Africa, to  Argentina and Brazil. Many of the countries in this belt have  ballistic missiles and we must have the means of deterring  anyone from using the slightest element of blackmail against us.  These countries must say to themselves: "If we use these  weapons, we run the risk being replied to in kind."    [Garraud] To modernize the deterrent, do we still need to  carry out nuclear tests?    [Gallois] Nuclear testing should be restarted. If we decide  to stop testing definitively, as the president of the Republic  has said, we will be taking a tremendous risk. The American  experts themselves say that these tests must be continued, if  only to check the quality of weapons as they get older. This  cannot be done by simulation. A limited amount of testing will  always be needed.    [Garraud] You also recommend that we acquire an extremely  expensive antimissile defense system. How can we do this in  the current context of budget constraint?    [Gallois] I would put it in a collective European context.  Certain things that ensure our security and reinforce our  scientific capabilities can be done at the national level, but  there are technologies that we cannot acquire because they are  out of range of our resources. Similarly, if the Europeans  decide on long-distance interventions, clearly the corresponding  fleets of cargo and transport planes can only be put together  collectively.    This should be included as a conditional section in the  military programming law. What I do not like about the White  Paper is that it assumes that other countries will agree with  our scenarios.</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (25): Mix of cussed independence and some mutual self interest - The User Groups, an idiosyncrasy of the industry HEWLETT Packard has an invitation to show off its new Series 700 workstation later this month at its user societies' annual general meeting. However, this arrangement is not quite as cozy as it looks. Mr Steve Chatterton, chairman of ADUS UK (the HP Apollo workstation user group) has asked HP's main rivals IBM, DEC, Silicon Graphics and SUN, to bring their their top workstations, and to compete in a demanding benchmark test devised by ADUS. HP is confident that it will not be embarrassed in its own backyard - on paper the 700's specification is superior - but there is little doubt that the move has ruffled HP's feathers, and it is taking the challenge seriously  -to the extent that its worldwide workstation manager will attend. This little drama illustrates the curious mix of cussed independence and mutual self interest that characterises relations between user groups and their suppliers. The fact that user groups exist at all is testament to this ambivalence. Fiercely protective of their separateness, yet loyal, and often genuinely proud of their particular affiliation, in the same way that some people are bound to their cars, user groups remain one of the idiosyncrasies of the computer business. At once ginger group, talking shop and social club, historically these associations were the users' response to the technical complexities of computing and the too often dictatorial tendencies of predominantly US-based hardware vendors. They have developed over the last 20 years into sizeable organisation in their own right: the IBM CUA has 1,500 members, and the DEC group, DECUS, turns over Pounds 500,000 in the UK annually in spite of administrative costs donated by DEC. These national groups are invariably affiliated to larger pan-European or international organisations or groups such as the National Computer Users Forum (NCUF) the UK user groups' user group. Does this complex network have anything other than a self-sustaining role? In particular, when so many of the old loyalties and dependencies between vendor and customer are threatened by open system environments, is their much point in vendor specific user groups? The short answer seems to be yes. First, one of the primary functions of these groups is educational. 'They act as a forum for sharing best practice. The IBM CUA serves as a peer-to-peer information exchange both informally and through its extensive seminar programmes. It helps us to avoid re-inventing the wheel,' says Mr Michael Moore, CUA chairman. DECUS's formal mission is similar exchange, both within the group, and between the group and DEC, says Mr Steve Dawes, chairman. As long as computing remains technically difficult, and in the short term at least it can only get harder in a multi-vendor, open systems world, then the user groups' basic role seems assured. The same is true of their place as lobbyists. This function is increasingly elevated to a formal consultative status. So, for example, DECUS submits annual System Improvement Requests to the DEC main board, a list of technology developments derived from polling individual members worldwide. At the same time, says Mr Dawes, the UK group is constantly plugging away at local issues - anything from invoicing or licensing practice to an upgrade path for companies using non-standard DEC hardware from the long-defunct Systime. Nonetheless the prospect of open environments is making its mark. The fundamental challenge of open systems has prompted a basic restructuring of the ICL CUA, says Mr David Stewart, its chairman. The 35 erstwhile individual special interest groups under the CUA umbrella, have set up a policy and review forum to consider, for the first time, their common problems, and in particular to clarify a single voice in dealings with ICL over open system and UNIX issues. Mr Stewart argues that the users' voice generally has not been articulate enough to influence open systems standards, and so far suppliers have dominated the debate. He thinks that ICL will be delighted by the CUA's initiative to define its own coherent set of priorities. Similarly, Mr Moore and Mr Dawes report that open systems issues are beginning to preoccupy their respective groups. Yet, paradoxically, they also comment that IBM and DEC have never been more attentive in their dealings with their users. 'IBM is relying more and more on user organisations,' says Mr Moore. Witness the 50 senior IBM technical staff who attended the CUA's Common Europe Conference in Brighton this month, just to listen to users, he comments. So what is going on? Could it be, the argument goes, that far from undermining these user groups, open system, multi-vendor environments, could actually stimulate them? User groups are persuaded that, as customers become more transient, then suppliers will appreciate just how critical they are in marshalling customer opinion, and ultimately, in keeping their loyalty. Does this work out? In part, perhaps. Certainly the days of user coercion are long gone. Mr Richard Owen, HP's workstation marketing manager, who will have to face the ADUS challenge, remarks that HP has long been a customer-led company. 'ADUS is one place we can listen to them,' he says. However, the rub, Mr Owen argues, is that whilst user groups are peopled by technologists - MIS managers and systems administrators - then they will not drive IT strategy, and in the long term, it is that, rather than the practical consequences of open computing, that will marginalise them.</p>

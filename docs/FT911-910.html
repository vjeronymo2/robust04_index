			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Rolls-Royce doubles job cuts ROLLS-ROYCE, the aero-engine group, yesterday doubled the number of jobs it wants to cut from its aerospace division this year to 6,000. It warned that this could involve the first compulsory redundancies at the company since its bankruptcy 20 years ago. The group also announced the progressive closure of its helicopter engine factory at Leavesden, Hertfordshire, which employs 1,750 people, and a freeze on pay for all employees in the aerospace division for six months. The large-scale cuts reflect the deep decline in the defence and commercial aerospace industries as well as recession in the UK manufacturing sector in general. The Labour party said 15,000 jobs in industry and services had been lost in the past 10 days, undermining any hopes the economy was showing signs of recovery. Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, described the Rolls-Royce announcement as 'grim news which will have a devastating impact on many communities up and down the country'. The latest Rolls-Royce job losses come on the heels of widespread cuts at other British aerospace and defence companies. The defence sector alone has shed about 25,000 jobs in the past six months. A Labour party survey showed that more than 200,000 jobs were lost in the UK in the first three months of this year at an average of 16,000 a week. Another large rise in unemployment is expected when official figures for April are announced next week. Rolls-Royce said it wanted to reduce its aerospace workforce by 18 per cent by the end of this year by cutting 6,000 out of the division's 34,000 jobs. The company had already announced 3,000 job cuts in its defence and commercial aero-engine operations this year and yesterday said it would cut a further 3,000. These would include 1,800 jobs at the company's commercial engine business based in Derby and 1,200 in the military engine operations at Bristol. Sir Ralph Robins, chief executive, warned there could be further cuts next year. He said: 'Like all aerospace companies worldwide, we are suffering from the effects of recession, which were worsened by the Gulf war, and by cuts in defence expenditure.' Although the company had a strong order book and balance sheet, he said the immediate situation was 'difficult and we have to reduce capacity and costs over the next two years'. With the slowdown in air travel and airlines' financial difficulties, the company has experienced a sharp fall in income from its engine spare parts business. Airlines have also deferred engine orders. Rolls-Royce said it hoped to achieve as many cuts as possible voluntarily. So far only 1,400 employees had agreed to leave and the company warned it would have to make enforced cuts unless the number rose in the next two months. The continuing decline in helicopter business had made the Leavesden factory unviable, the company said. It planned to vacate the plant by the end of next year, transferring the helicopter business to Bristol and other plants. The pay freeze in the aerospace division will come into effect at the end of the current pay agreement. It will be followed by a bonus scheme related to the performance of the business. This bonus scheme will be introduced in January, when the company is hoping to see a recovery in the commercial airline market.

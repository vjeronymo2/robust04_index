			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Learn to manage / A look at courses for inexperienced bosses Mike Stanley, 31, is works manager for Lynx Offset, a small printing business based near Oxford, which he joined shortly after it was established in 1988. He started as a printer, the trade he took up when he left school, but his reliability and enthusiasm marked him for promotion. He is now works manager of a company which employs 20 people and has a turnover of Pounds 1.2m, mostly printing journals, catalogues and high quality advertising material. He is responsible for hiring, training and supervising six print workers and for liaising with other supervisors to ensure that customers' orders are handled promptly and cost-effectively. He reached his position with no formal training or experience of supervisory work. In 1992, Stanley's boss, Keith Nicholl, who founded Lynx, was contacted by the Heart of England Training and Education Council, based in Abingdon, which suggested that Nicholl might send one of his supervisors on a training programme run in conjunction with Wolsey Hall, Oxford. This offered an NVQ level four certificate in management. The national network of Training and Enterprise Councils was established in 1989 with a particular responsibility to improve training in small firms such as Lynx. The NVQs, or National Vocational Qualifications, are part of the nationwide system of qualifications designed to promote higher standards of training in industry. Level four qualifications are intended for first line managers who, like Stanley, are in their first supervisory jobs. The course, which takes about a year, covers four areas of management: people, finance, information and operations. Stanley started with managing people, first assessing his own capabilities against a checklist of items: minimising personal conflicts, remaining calm in difficult situations and learning from mistakes. At the same time, Nicholl provided his own assessment of Stanley, using the same list. A comparison of what he said about himself and what his boss said about him was used to help draw up a 'development contract' which Stanley agreed with his boss, emphasising those areas in which he needed most help. The analysis had revealed that there were many activities which Stanley was carrying out without appreciating their implications for others. For example, he often interviewed staff without making any record of the outcome of the interview so that the participants could have widely differing views about what would happen as a result of the interview. Stanley then attended a series of eight one-day programmes, on topics such as recruiting and training staff, organising meetings and establishing disciplinary procedures. Guidance was given by the trainers, and the participants compared their experience. At the end of each session Stanley agreed upon a programme to be completed before the next one. At work he assembled evidence that he was using the techniques he had learned at the workshops. An assessor visited him to check his progress and to advise him whether the 'evidence' he was collecting would meet the requirements of the programme. After six months he had completed his 'contract' for managing people. The cost to the company was Pounds 50. The programme is subsidised by the Department of Education. Both Stanley and Nicholl agreed that the main benefit of the programme has been to make both of them think about Stanley's responsibilities and the way he carried them out. Stanley is, with Nicholl's encouragement, completing the other three parts of the programme, covering finance, information and operations which will lead to the NVQ in management. Businesses interested in such programmes can contact their nearest TEC or college through their local Jobcentre.

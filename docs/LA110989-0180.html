			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAGIC GETS $3,000 FINE FOR FIGHT;  </P> <P> LAKERS: NBA DECIDES OPEN-HANDED SLAP BY JOHNSON WARRANTS HEAVIER PENALTY THAN  ACTIONS OF PHOENIX'S KEVIN JOHNSON, WHO IS HIT FOR $1,000.  </P> <P> Although Magic Johnson maintains that he and guard Kevin Johnson of the Phoenix  Suns merely engaged in a relatively harmless shoving match that should not even  have warranted ejections, the Laker star was fined $3,000 by the NBA on  Wednesday for his part in Tuesday night's altercation.  </P> <P> Kevin Johnson, on the receiving end of Magic's repeated pushes 3 minutes 22  seconds into the Lakers' home opener, was fined $1,000 for fighting. Laker  guard Byron Scott, the first player to intervene, was fined $500 for pushing  Kevin Johnson away from Magic.  </P> <P> Magic Johnson got the stiffest penalty because, as a league spokesman worded  it, he hit Kevin Johnson in the face with an open hand. Johnson said after  Tuesday's game and again Wednesday that he had not struck Kevin Johnson, that  he had pushed him, and should not be fined more than his combatant.  </P> <P> He told reporters after the Lakers' practice on Wednesday, before the fines  were announced, that he would probably appeal any fine for "punching" the Suns'  guard, who gives away seven inches and 32 pounds to the Lakers' guard. Magic  could not be reached after the fines were imposed, but he reportedly told Laker  spokesman Josh Rosenfeld that he "didn't have any problem" with the league's  action.  </P> <P> "I don't know what (the fine) is going to be, but I'll pay it," Johnson had  said earlier Wednesday. "But I don't want to pay a punching fine, because I  didn't hit him. If it comes to that, I will (appeal)."  </P> <P> TV replays showed that Magic Johnson did not use a clenched fist, but shoved  Kevin backward with a left-hand push to the chest, followed by a right-hand  push that struck Kevin's left jaw. Bill Oakes, the lead official in Tuesday's  game, called a "punching" foul on Magic Johnson, apparently as a result of the  open-handed blow.  </P> <P> A videotape of the incident was sent to the league office in New York Wednesday  morning.  </P> <P> Had the league agreed with Magic Johnson, the amount of the fine would have  been reduced. Last week, Atlanta Hawk forward Kevin Willis was fined $1,500 and  Indiana center Rik Smits $750 for what the league termed a "fighting incident."  </P> <P> Oakes had told a pool reporter that Magic Johnson's ejection was automatic  because of the punching foul call. Kevin Johnson's ejection was at the  official's discretion, Oakes said.  </P> <P> "I've seen (the videotape), and, no, I didn't punch him," Magic Johnson said.  "I told you guys that Tuesday night, but you still (reported) it as a punch. He  came running in and, when I pushed him back, you saw (Kevin Johnson's) head go  back. Maybe that's what you and the refs thought was a punch. You guys saw it  wrong.  </P> <P> "I mean, he was this close to me (about six inches), and I could have punched  him if I wanted to. But I didn't. I just pushed him out of my way."  </P> <P> Cotton Fitzsimmons, the Suns' coach, questioned the decision to eject Kevin  Johnson.  </P> <P> "The officials are on edge this year," Fitzsimmons said. "They've been told to  crack down on the fighting. If either player had thrown a punch, (that player)  has to go. They did call Magic for that (punching) foul, but Kevin did nothing  but push him. There was pushing and shoving all night."  </P> <P> Tuesday night's incident was the fourth altercation in the NBA since the start  of the exhibition season.  </P> <P> Besides the Willis-Smits fight, Detroit's James Edwards was fined $2,500 for  starting a fight with Philadelphia's Mike Gminski during the exhibition season.  Isiah Thomas of Detroit was fined $1,500 for grabbing Gminski's throat from  behind. Thomas, in another incident, was fined $1,000 for responding to an  elbow from Phoenix's Armon Gilliam with a slap to the face.  </P> <P> But Magic Johnson's fine was the biggest this season.  </P> <P> Pat Riley, asked whether a stiff fine would hurt Johnson's cash flow, laughed  and said: "That's just chump change to Earvin."  </P> <P> After Tuesday night's game, Kevin Johnson said he immediately regretted the  incident. "It is embarrassing to me," Kevin Johnson said. "I'm surprised I got  ejected from the ballgame. I pride myself on my conduct. I try to be a role  model."  </P> <P> Magic Johnson said Wednesday that he wanted to put the incident behind him.  </P> <P> "When you come right down to it, I'm really sorry it happened," he said. "I'm  sorry because I respect and know (Kevin). When you play against one another and  it's a rivalry like we have, you got to make a stand. I guess that's what we  did."  </P> <P> Laker Notes  </P> <P> Jawann Oldham, a 7-foot center recently released by the Sacramento Kings, was  scheduled to have a physical Wednesday, the first step in the club's attempt to  sign him. Oldham, 32, missed all last season after undergoing major  reconstructive surgery on his left knee on March 22, 1988.  </P> <P> If Oldham passes his physical and decides to sign with the Lakers rather than  the Seattle SuperSonics, who also are vying for him, he figures to play only a  supporting role, at least at first.  </P> <P> "We've always said we're looking for a big body," Coach Pat Riley said.  "Someone who can fill a specific role -- block shots, rebound, play tough  defense. We aren't looking for him as a scorer. He won't be part of our  rotation right away. He'll have to prove himself. That's if we sign him. But if  he could help us if he is over his physical problems."  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARTOONIST MYRON NATWICK; CREATED BETTY BOOP  </P> <P> Myron (Grim) Natwick, the creator of the popular cartoon heroine Betty Boop,  has died. He was 100.  </P> <P> Natwick died Sunday at Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center of pneumonia and  heart disease.  </P> <P> "Although she was never vulgar or obscene, Betty was a suggestion you could  spell in three letters: S-E-X," Natwick said of her 60-year popularity in a  Times interview earlier this year. "She was all girl."  </P> <P> Growing up in Wisconsin at the turn of the century, Natwick hoped to become an  illustrator for magazine and sheet music covers. He studied drawing and  painting in Chicago, New York, and in Europe at the Vienna National Academy.  </P> <P> But on returning to the United States in 1928, he jumped into the  then-burgeoning animation industry, which he had flirted with briefly at Hearst  International Film Service during his student years.  </P> <P> Working for Max and Dave Fleischer, who had produced the famous bouncing ball  sing-along "Song Cartunes," Natwick was asked to design a girl character for  the popular song by Helen Kane, "Boop-Boop-A-Doop."  </P> <P> Because the only character in the Fleischers' new sound cartoons was a little  dog called Bimbo, Natwick originally drew Betty as a dog's head on the  curvaceous figure of a woman. He patterned the spit-curl flapper hairdo on  Kane's own hairstyle.  </P> <P> Betty first appeared as a secondary character in 1930, singing her song in a  cartoon starring Bimbo and called "Dizzy Dishes." She was so popular that the  Fleischers quickly demanded more cartoons "with that girl in them."  </P> <P> Natwick refined Betty, reducing her floppy dog's ears to bangle earrings and  shrinking the black nose to a button. His understanding of anatomy made her the  most realistic female cartoon character of the era.  </P> <P> "Eight years of art school and night classes, drawing what must have been  thousands of naked models, had taught me a little bit about the female body,"  he told The Times. "I knew all the sexy angles and shapes, from the turn of the  ankle to the shape of the heel of her shoe to where her waist belonged."  </P> <P> His work with Betty led to job offers from "every cartoon studio in Hollywood."  Over the years, Natwick worked for Walt Disney's former partner, Ub Iwerks,  Disney himself, Walter Lantz, the U.S. Army (for which he made training films)  and his own free-lance animation service. At Disney, he animated Snow White for  "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."  </P> <P> In 1973, Richard Williams persuaded him to work on the feature "Raggedy Ann and  Raggedy Andy," and to teach animation to younger artists working on the film.  </P> <P> In that period, he did his final animation, the mad "holy Indian witch" in  Williams' feature "The Thief."  </P> <P> Natwick was frequently lauded by fans and co-workers for bringing his classical  training as a painter to the modern field of animation.  </P> <P> "I assisted Grim in 1976, when I was 18 and he was 86," Disney animator Tom  Sito recently recalled. "His experience enabled him to distill the most complex  motions into a few simple lines. His drawings moved beautifully, but they  looked almost like shorthand, as if he couldn't stand to use a single  superfluous line."  </P> <P> Betty Boop enjoyed a comeback a few years ago, enriching Fleischer Studios and  King Features Syndicate through the sale of T-shirts, videocassettes and other  items. But Natwick, who had been left out when the Fleischers copyrighted his  most famous character in 1930, did not share in the profits.  </P> <P> Natwick is survived by his daughter, Nancy Matchell of Garden Grove, and two  grandsons.  </P> <P> Services and burial are planned in Wisconsin Rapids, Wis.  </P></p>

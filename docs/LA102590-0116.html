			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: ALHAMBRA;  </P> <P> HOSPITAL STUDY COST SHARED  </P> <P> The City Council agreed Monday to split with Alhambra Community Hospital the  cost of a $28,000 study to determine what can be done to make the hospital  profitable.  </P> <P> City Manager Kevin Murphy said earlier parts of the three-phase study blamed  the hospital's money troubles on three factors: it is not a full-service  hospital, which makes it difficult to obtain contracts with health maintenance  organizations; it has a high proportion of Medicare and indigent patients, and  it is in a low-visibility location.  </P> <P> Julia Norris, city assistant finance director, said the hospital is behind in  its lease payments to the city by more than $1 million.  </P></p>

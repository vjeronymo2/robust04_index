			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Central News Unit report from Paris] </F>   [Text] The Islamic groups in Algeria have set up a  clandestine television transmitter that broadcasts programs on  an Algerian television channel.    According to a Central News Unit report from Paris citing  the  newspaper LIBERATION, in circumstances when the Algerian  Government has deprived Islamists of all resources and is trying  to suppress them, the appearance of an Islamic television  network in the country, even for a short time, has perturbed  Algerian officials.    Numerous residents in the Algiers area saw the television  network's program at 1815 to 1830 last Monday [3 Jan] on channel  21 on the UHF band.    This program presented the latest reports on the condition  of  Algerian combatants followed by a request to all armed Islamic  groups to forge solidarity against the dictatorship in Algeria  and still pictures of incarcerated FIS leaders.    According to LIBERATION, the Algerian Islamists are also  presenting regular weekly programs, referred to as Wafa  [loyalty] radio, by means of radio apparatus. In this program,  they transmit radio messages on frequencies used by the police  and security forces, repeatedly calling on these forces to  refrain from fighting against and killing their own brothers and  asking them to abandon the dictatorial regime.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Yi Tong-min] </F>   [Text] Seoul, Feb. 19 (YONHAP) -- North Korea announced  Wednesday that it would accept International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) inspections, but has taken no steps to back up its  promise. North Korea said it would issue visas to IAEA  inspectors in the near future, and the speculation was that the  team would be able to enter Pyongyang via Beijing this weekend.  But as of Saturday morning, no news on the visas had arrived.  A Foreign Ministry official said nothing will happen this week.    The timing of the IAEA's entry into North Korea is a crucial  point because the agency's Board of Governors meets from Monday.  The international community expected Pyongyang to quickly issue  the visas so the inspection process could begin before the board  meeting, whose main topic is the North Korean nuclear issue.    Only limited flights are available to Pyongyang from  Beijing.  Even if the inspectors received visas early next week, the  flight schedule would allow them to enter North Korea only  toward the weekend, which would come after the IAEA board  meeting closes.    Then why the delay? Analysts here offer various reasons.    First, some say North Korean supreme leader Kim Il-song took  over the nuclear negotiations from his son and heir-apparent,  Kim Chong-il. Confusion arose from this change, as attested by  North Korean officials in New York and at the truce village of  Panmunjom who were apparently left in the dark about Pyongyang's  decision to accept IAEA inspections.    Even Ho Chong, North Korean deputy chief of mission to the  United Nations and representative at working-level contacts with  U.S. officials, was unaware of the decision.    North Korean military officials recently contacted at  Panmunjom didn't even know their government had invited U.S.  representative Ronald Dellums to visit, according to sources in  the Military Armistice Commission (MAC). Dellums, who was to  arrive in North Korea last week, was known to have cancelled his  plans when Pyongyang failed to issue a visa at the last minute,  without giving any reason. North Korean negotiators recently  asked the U.S. side to present its demands on paper, an  uncommon practice.    The analysts say a new situation has developed in North  Korea, requiring that all reports to superiors be made on paper  instead of verbally as had been the case, backing up their  theory of confusion in the hierarchy.    Others say all the delay is due to a much simpler reason --  North Korea was "on vacation" to celebrate Kim Chong-il's  birthday Feb. 16. The entire nation kow-towed for three days for  the junior Kim's birthday last year, and all administrative  affairs were frozen during the period. This year is no  exception, they say, and visas for the IAEA inspectors will be  issued as soon as the regular workweek begins next Monday.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of proposed &sect;773.26 would have provided that the State regulatory authority that issued a State violation notice would have had authority for making decisions with respect to the ownership or control of any person cited in the notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of proposed &sect;773.26 would have provided that the regulatory authority that issued a violation notice, whether State or Federal, would have had authority for making decisions concerning the status of the violation covered by the notice. The ``status'' of the violation meant whether the violation remained outstanding, had been corrected, was in the process of being corrected, or was the subject of a good faith appeal, within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b)(2) of proposed &sect;773.26 would have provided that OSM would have authority for making decisions with respect to the ownership or control of any person cited in a Federal violation notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the allocation principles set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of the proposed rule, a regulatory authority that was deciding whether a permit application should be granted or whether a permit had been improvidently issued would have determined for itself the ownership or control of the applicant or permittee, but it would have deferred to the regulatory authority that issued a violation notice for a determination of the ownership or control of the violator. The application would be blocked or the permit would be found improvidently issued if any owner or controller of the applicant or permittee were also an owner or controller of a violator, as determined by the respective regulatory authorities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b)(3) of proposed &sect;773.26 would have provided that the authority of State regulatory authorities to make decisions with respect to ownership or control links or the status of violations would have been subject to OSM's oversight authority under 30 CFR parts 733, 842, and 843. Under paragraph (b)(3) of proposed &sect;773.26, when OSM disagreed with a decision of a State regulatory authority, it would have taken action, as appropriate, under proposed &sect;843.24, oversight of State permitting decisions with respect to ownership or control of the status of violations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;773.26 would have established evidentiary standards applicable to the formal and informal review of ownership or control links and the status of violations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (c)(1) of proposed &sect;773.26 would have provided that in any formal or informal review of an ownership or control link or of the status of a violation, the agency responsible for making a decision would be required to make first a prima facie determination or showing that the link exists or that the violation remains outstanding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;773.26, a challenger of a link to a violation would have had to prove at least one of three proposed conclusions by a preponderance of the evidence to succeed in his or her challenge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of proposed &sect;773.26, a challenger could have proven that the facts relied upon by the responsible agency to establish ownership or control within the terms of 30 CFR 773.5(a) or to establish a presumption of ownership or control under 30 CFR 773.5(b) do not or did not exist. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of proposed &sect;773.26 provided that a person subject to a presumption of ownership or control under 30 CFR 773.5(b) could have rebutted such presumption by demonstrating that he or she does not or did not in fact have the authority directly or indirectly to determine the manner in which surface coal mining operations are or were conducted. Such demonstration would have been made in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d) of proposed &sect;773.26. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of proposed &sect;773.26 provided that a challenger could have proven that the violation covered by a violation notice did not exist, had been corrected, was in the process of being corrected, or was the subject of a good faith appeal within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (c)(2) of proposed section 773.26 described the type of evidence that a person challenging an ownership or control link or the status of a violation would have had to present to meet the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence. The proposed regulation provided that the evidence presented would have had to have been probative, reliable, and substantial. See 5 U.S.C. 556(d). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

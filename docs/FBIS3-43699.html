			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Some light might soon be shed on the recent  bloody events in Togo. A Togolese woman has made a statement  that might turn out to be a decisive factor. From Lome, Olabire  da Cruz has the details:    [Begin Da Cruz recording] An employee of the West African  Development Bank, Mrs. Kponton nee Ajavon was shown on  television last night and during the interview, she said that  her house was adjacent to the one where the assailants had put  up few days before the attack. One of the perpetrators was her  neighbor, a man named Eugene Kouvaye, a friend of her husband,  Mr. Ernest Kponton. [passage omitted]    After weapons were found in his home yesterday, Mr. Kponton,  who is an architect, is under serious suspicion. According to  his wife, Mr. Kponton had close relations with one of the  perpetrators of the 5 January attack. [end recording]    Here now is the reaction of Mr. Adan Messan Ajavon,  secretary  general of the Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD] who said there  should be no link between individual responsibilities of Mr.  Ernest Kponton and the party's responsibility. He made this  clarification after the news conference given in Lome by UTD  Chairman Edem Kodjo. Let us listen to UTD Secretary General Adan  Messan Ajavon talking on the phone to our correspondent  Jean-Claude Frank Mendome:    [Begin Ajavon recording] Mr. Ernest Kponton is not the  number  two man or the vice president of the UTD. The UTD affirms that  nobody is above the law and that concerning the serious events  that happened in our country, the government must carry out  investigations in conformity with the law in order to find the  culprits. Indeed, under Article 18 of the 1992 Togolese  Constitution, any accused person is deemed innocent until found  guilty following a trial that must provide necessary guarantees  for his defense. The UTD is astonished that at the present  stage of the preliminary investigations, this notion of  innocence has not been applied to Mr. Ernest Kponton. He has  been found guilty even before the conclusion of the  investigations.    However, the UTD makes it a point that all possible light  should be shed on this affair and proposes that the diplomatic  corps and the international monitoring committee should assist  in ensuring that Mr. Kponton is heard by the competent Togolese  authorities under conditions stipulated by law. Also, the UTD  notes that in the presentation of the facts, attempts have been  made to involve not only Mr. Kponton, but his party as well.  The UTD condemns this state of affairs which tends to link  individual responsibilities and collective responsibilities,  contrary to the elementary principles of the law. [end  recording]</p>

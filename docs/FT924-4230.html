			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: GEC cashes in GEC's long-standing reputation as a dull performer has certainly not been reflected in the share price over the past year. The company has made strenuous efforts to offset the slowdown in business areas such as defence with international joint ventures. Perhaps the most notable of these is the collaboration with Alsthom, and power systems profits duly increased by 18 per cent in the first half. Still, the image of GEC as a hoarder may be reinforced by the appointment of a senior merchant banker to the board and the effective cash inflow of Pounds 405m in the past six months. The second half will not see such a torrent, but next year the company is likely to pull in at least another Pounds 200m in cash. What happens to the money seems to fascinate observers rather more than it does GEC. Investors may fret that while a cast-iron balance sheet can be a support in troubled times, once recovery is on the way cash becomes a drag. GEC has hinted that the relaxation of the government's rules about private sector participation in infrastructure projects may offer opportunities. Perhaps the company might provide lease finance to British Rail so that it can afford to buy GEC-manufactured trains. But given sloth in Whitehall and Lord Weinstock's well-known caution, it is hard to see this blossoming quickly. Supporters may argue that the company will benefit from devaluation, but GEC will need to invest into the recovery if it is not to repeat its underperformance of the 1980s. If opportunities are not available, shareholders might prefer to keep some of the cash in their own deposit accounts.</p>

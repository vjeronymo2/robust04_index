			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PRIME-TIME FLICKS  </P> <P> Harold and Maude (KCOP Sunday at 6 p.m.) is that irresistible 1972 cult classic  written by Colin Higgins, directed by Hal Ashby and starring Bud Cort as a  suicidal 20-year-old rescued by Ruth Gordon's 79-year-old swinger.  </P> <P> Without the affecting setting of the last days of the Somoza dictatorship in  Nicaragua, the 1983 Under Fire (KCAL Sunday at 8 p.m.) would simply be a weary  old love triangle involving journalists Nick Nolte, Joanna Cassidy and Gene  Hackman; there's an edge to Nolte's growing loss of objectivity, but the  filmmakers tend to walk away from it.  </P> <P> Network (KTLA Tuesday at 8 p.m.) returns with its all-out assault on the evils  of commercial TV. At the heart of this savage 1976 satire is Peter Finch's  fed-up elder statesman of TV newscasters.  </P> <P> The memorable 1948 Howard Hawks classic Western, Red River (KCOP Wednesday at  6:05 p.m., also TBS at 8:20 p.m.), stars John Wayne as a tyrannical Texas  cattleman and Montgomery Clift, who leads a rebellion against him during a  cattle run.  </P> <P> Bonnie and Clyde (KCOP Wednesday at 8:20 p.m.) is that 1967 American cinematic  landmark in which director Arthur Penn, writers Robert Benton and David Newman  and producer-star Warren Beatty join to re-create a 1930 heartland  landscape-and then blow it all to hell in an astonishing crescendo of violence.  With Faye Dunaway as an unforgettable Bonnie.  </P> <P> Daniel Petrie's thoughtful, autobiographical 1984 film The Bay Boy (KCOP  Thursday at 8 p.m., again on Saturday at 3 p.m.) is an exceptional, complex  coming-of-age drama starring Kiefer Sutherland and Liv Ullmann. Marred-but not  critically-by a melodramatic murder (an actual incident in Petrie's youth).  </P> <P> William Friedkin's 1988 TV movie C.A.T. Squad: Python Wolf (KNBC Friday at 9  p.m.) is an efficient action piece involving a counter-terrorist mission in  South Africa.  </P> <P> Blake Edwards' vitriolic 1981 Valentine to Hollywood, S.O.B. (KCAL Saturday at  8 p.m.) is always audacious, often hilarious but sometimes downright appalling.  Producer Richard Mulligan and his wife Julie Andrews, America's G-rated  sweetheart, sex up their latest film to save it from disaster.  </P> <P> KCET offers a terrific, vintage British double feature Saturday: Joseph Losey's  The Servant (at 9 p.m.) and Lindsay Anderson's This Sporting Life (at 11 p.m.).  </P></p>

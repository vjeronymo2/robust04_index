			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Bantin] </F>   [Text] Hiroshima May 25 TASS -- Russia cannot agree with a  recent U.S. proposal on an international control system which  will be necessary if an international agreement on stopping  nuclear arms tests is concluded, ITAR-TASS learnt on Wednesday  from reliable Russian sources participating now in the UN  disarmament conference in the Japanese city of Hiroshima.    The multilateral talks to conclude an international  agreement  on stopping nuclear tests which started in Geneva last January,  centre on a system of control.    According to the above sources, the American side recently  offered its own model of control which presupposes the  simultaneous application of six verification systems and the  establishment of appropriate global structures.    Russian experts believe that it will take at least ten years  to implement the U.S.-brokered model. Besides, it presupposes  huge financial outlays, which is objected not only by Russia but  also by other nuclear powers.    In contrast to Washington, Moscow believes that the  application of two systems -- seismic and atmospheric control --  is quite sufficient. According to these sources, this viewpoint  is backed by many participants in the nuclear tests talks in  Geneva, including Japan.    The U.S. proposal, the official reply to which Moscow plans  to give in the next few days, puts in jeopardy, as the sources  stressed, the chance of the timely signing of the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty which expires next year.    This is explained by the fact that most treaty participants,  members of the Non-Aligned Movement in the main, insist that the  nuclear powers should conclude an agreement on stopping nuclear  tests. They agree to prolong the treaty for unlimited duration  only under this condition.</p>

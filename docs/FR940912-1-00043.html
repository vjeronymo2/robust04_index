			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA considered three monitoring options for control devices: (1) the use of continuous emission monitors (CEMS) to measure total VOC; (2) the use of CEMS for surrogate compounds such as total hydrocarbons (THC) as surrogate for total VOC; or (3) the continuous monitoring of control device operating parameters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first two options were determined to be unreasonable for this industry as discussed below. Although continuous emission monitors for total VOC are currently available, these devices are not universally applicable within this source category. Current emission monitoring systems that measure VOC emissions operate by flame ionization detection (FID), photoionization detection (PID), non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) absorption, or other detection principles that respond to VOC levels. However, in most cases, VOC monitors provide only a measure of the relative concentration level of a mixture of organics, rather than quantification of the organic species present. This trait necessitates the use of VOC CEMS more as a relative indicator rather than as a conventional emission monitor. Cases where it is possible to consider the VOC monitor as a conventional CEMS are, for the most part, limited to instances where only one organic species is present or where equal incremental amounts of each of the organic species present generate equal instrument responses. These instances are very unlikely to occur at SOCMI process units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, a CEMS system that uses gas chromatography to measure gaseous organic compound emissions may not be suitable for applications where the number of VOC compounds to be monitored exceeds five. (See proposed Performance Specifications 101 and 102, appendix A of 40 CFR part 64, October 22, 1993 at 58 FR 54648.) However, SOCMI wastewaters can be expected routinely to have multiple chemical constituents with variable concentrations. Under these conditions, implementation of a CEMS system would be a costly undertaking. Furthermore, parametric monitoring has been demonstrated to be an effective means of indicating continuous compliance. Therefore, because a CEMS requirement would place an extra burden on the industry without increasing the accuracy of compliance demonstrations, the first two options were determined to be unreasonable. Owners or operators using control devices (e.g., incinerators or condensers) to comply with the proposed standards may use CEMS where applicable to demonstrate continuous compliance. However, parameter monitoring is also allowed if control devices are used. The Agency has selected temperature as the operating parameter that would then be monitored to determine ongoing compliance with the standard. For example, owners or operators of incinerators would have to monitor the combustion temperature (or the temperature before and after the catalyst bed if a catalytic incinerator is used), and owners or operators of condensers would have to monitor the temperature of the vapor exhaust stream.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The use of CEMS on control devices is not proposed to be required for the following reasons:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) CEMS cannot accurately determine compliance for many SOCMI wastewaters;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For each of these control systems a measurable control device parameter (e.g., temperature) is considered to provide a suitable indication of performance for determining compliance; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Temperature monitors are considerably less costly than CEMS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed standards, therefore, would be based on parameter monitoring to demonstrate compliance with the standards for control devices. The Agency is soliciting comments on the selection of temperature as a parameter to monitor for compliance and any available data on the correlation of the control device parameter to the control efficiency. The proposed rule would not preclude owners or operators who are using control devices to comply with the rule from choosing to use CEMS to demonstrate compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The continuous monitoring of control device operating parameters, established during the performance test or specified through design, is used to determine whether continuous compliance is achieved. Failure to maintain the established values for these parameters would be an enforceable violation of the emission limits of the proposed standards. Some of the process parameters are already monitored as part of normal operation. Therefore, continuous compliance is assured without imposing an additional unnecessary burden on the facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the proposed rule, enhanced monitoring is only applicable to control devices used to meet the requirements of the regulation. However, the EPA fully intends to make this rule consistent with other enhanced monitoring requirements. Therefore, the EPA is soliciting comments on the extent the enhanced monitoring requirements in the proposed rule are sufficient to meet the overall requirements of the Agency with regard to enhanced monitoring under section 114(a) of the CAAA or are additional requirements needed within the rule to meet the requirements of the CAAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> J. Performance Test Methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Test methods and procedures are required to ensure compliance with the proposed standards, which include requirements for demonstrating that an emission point or process unit wastewater stream does not require control or that it is in compliance with the control requirements. Requirements to test for no detectable leaks from control devices, enclosure and closed-vent systems, and process wastewater collection and treatment systems are also included. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

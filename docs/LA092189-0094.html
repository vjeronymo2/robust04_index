			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> EASY WIN NO GAUGE FOR FRANKLIN  </P> <P> The Franklin High football team left only one question unanswered last week  after rolling over Roosevelt, 41-7, in its opener.  </P> <P> "I don't know if we're that good or they just didn't play as well as they can,"  Franklin Coach Armando Gonzalez said.  </P> <P> Gonzalez should get a better indication of his team's ability on Friday when  the Panthers take on powerful Granada Hills.  </P> <P> Last season, in the first football game ever played between the two schools,  Franklin upset the Highlanders, 21-14.  </P> <P> With senior quarterback Santiago Alvarez leading the way, the Panthers seem to  have all the necessary ingredients to knock off Granada Hills again.  </P> <P> Alvarez completed 29 of 41 passes for 335 yards and four touchdowns against  Roosevelt. He scrambled from the pocket effectively and, as his statistics  indicate, had little problem finding open receivers.  </P> <P> Split end Lamar Lovett caught six passes for 75 yards and two touchdowns and  running back Benny Gallo had eight catches for 86 yards.  </P> <P> The Franklin defense also was impressive, intercepting four passes and  recovering two fumbles. Roosevelt's only touchdown came on a kickoff return.  </P> <P> Can the Panthers do the same thing to Granada Hills, a 17-14 winner last week  over Westchester?  </P> <P> "It's going to be a good game for us to see if we're really that good,"  Gonzalez said.  </P> <P> The more the merrier: Now that school is in session and the annual influx of  transferring students has begun, there may be some relief in sight for the  Marshall High football team.  </P> <P> In last week's 14-6 season-opening loss to Garfield, Marshall used just 14  players.  </P> <P> "I was pleased with everything we did -- we executed well," Marshall Coach Ken  Gerard said. "We just can't have those kids playing that much. They just ran  out of gas."  </P> <P> About 65 players have filed out to practice since school began, so Gerard is  hopeful that he will have plenty of eligible players for Friday's game at  Grant.  </P> <P> "We've been giving out all kinds of equipment," Gerard said. "We'll see if it  makes a difference."  </P> <P> Zero hour: Occidental's 14-0 loss to Azusa Pacific last Saturday was the  Tigers' first shutout defeat since 1985, when Central College of Iowa  administered a 71-0 beating in the second round of the National Collegiate  Athletic Assn. Division III playoffs.  </P> <P> Saturday's loss was the first regular season shutout defeat since 1980 when the  Tigers lost to Redlands, 48-0.  </P> <P> The last time Azusa Pacific shut out Occidental was in 1974, 3-0.  </P> <P> The last time Occidental (0-2) lost two games in a row was in 1982.  </P> <P> In passing: Occidental has surrendered four touchdowns this season -- each on  passes of 26 yards or more.  </P> <P> The Tigers have been handicapped by injuries to key players such as cornerback  Ben White and safety Craig Hartley, but Tiger Coach Dale Widolff said the  problem has been lapses, not personnel.  </P> <P> "We're playing pretty good pass defense," said Widolff, whose team has three  interceptions. "We're getting good pressure. It's just the inconsistency, We've  broken down at critical times."  </P> <P> Seeing is believing: John Cicuto and his Glendale College staff got an eyeful  last Saturday when they took advantage of their team's bye and journeyed to  Bakersfield to scout the defending national champion Renegades.  </P> <P> Bakersfield whipped Hancock, 29-6, in preparation for Saturday's Western State  Conference opener against Glendale.  </P> <P> "They (Bakersfield) have some very big lineman and good skill-position  players," said Cicuto, whose team lost its opener to Pasadena. "The week off  has been good for us. It's allowed us to simplify some things for our players.  I think it's going to be an excellent game."  </P> <P> Glendale and Bakersfield did not play last season, but Glendale won the last  two meetings between the schools in 1986 and '87.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 21 (XINHUA) -- South Korea and the  United States will conduct this year's "Team Spirit" joint  military exercise in November if Pyongyang continues to reject  additional nuclear inspection and the resumption of inter-Korean  dialogue.    This was announced after a meeting between visiting U.S.  Defense Secretary William Perry and his South Korean counterpart  Yi Pyong-tae here Wednesday [20 April].    Perry, who delayed his visit to Seoul due to last week's  downing of U.S. Army helicopters by friendly fire in Iraq,  arrived here late Tuesday night.    The two defense ministers focused on the nuclear issue in  the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). They decided to  hold the "Team Spirit" exercise if no progress is made on the  issue by the end of October.    They believe that the deployment of Patriot missiles at  American military bases in South Korea will contribute to  deterring war.    They agreed, however, that there are no particular signs of  military confrontation at present.    The "Team Spirit" joint military exercise had been held  annually since 1976, but was cancelled for the first time in  1992 when the DPRK signed the nuclear safeguards accord with the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    The exercise was revived last year after a stalemate in  inter- Korean talks over nuclear inspections.    The first shipment of Patriot missiles and their launchers  arrived in South Korea Monday aboard two U.S. military transport  ships.    South Korea and the U.S. claimed that the Patriots are  purely  defensive missiles designed to counter air strikes and SCUD  missiles.    But the DPRK said that the missiles are designed for  offensive purposes, while describing the "Team Spirit" as a  "rehearsal for invading the DPRK."</p>

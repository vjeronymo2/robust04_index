			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Grim prognosis for E European recovery A SOBER assessment of the timing of economic recovery in eastern Europe has come in a World Bank report on the region. It suggests Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary will not regain the income levels they enjoyed in 1989 until 1996. The prospects for Bulgaria, Romania and Yugoslavia are even worse; according to the bank, these countries will not achieve 1989 levels until the next century. The projections suggest a widening income gap between the region's north - which is further advanced in economic reform - and the south. 'Simply recovering from the contractions of 1989-91 could take five to 10 years. Reaching the per capita income levels now prevailing in industrial countries could take decades,' the report says of the region as a whole. World Bank economists agree that measures of national product fail to take into account the difference in quality between goods produced under the centralised system and those available now, and the ending of supply shortages and queueing. The study also concludes that economic reforms are unlikely to proceed smoothly. 'Setbacks can be expected and should not be prematurely interpreted as failure of the entire reform process.' The study also attempts to estimate the impact of the breakdown of the old Comecon trading system within eastern Europe. Assuming an oil price of Dollars 20.90 a barrel, the average subsidy for Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania was 4.4 per cent of gross domestic product. The worst hit by Comecon's collapse will be Bulgaria, where the implicit subsidy was equivalent to 12.1 per cent of GDP. In Czechoslovakia the figure was 7 per cent, in Hungary 5.9 per cent, in Poland 5.0 per cent and in Romania 0.8 per cent. The report, yet to be formally published, rejects the idea of a linear sequence of reforms, calling instead for 'complementary packages' of reforms.

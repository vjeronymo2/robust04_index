Increasing Joys and Temptations    [Text] Deng Xiaoping's policy of "without reform and  opening to the outside world, China will come to a dead end" is  being implemented by Taiwan firms. In 1992, the China mainland's  imports and exports totaled more than $1.6 trillion. The value  of its exports surpassed that of Taiwan for the first time, 3  percent of it coming from Taiwan firms. The longing of Taiwan  firms for growth fits together nicely with the mainland's battle  to escape from poverty.    Like it or not, the travel to the mainland of Taiwanese to  work is an unstoppable trend. For the next generation, daddy  will not only no longer return home for supper, he will spend  the whole year on the mainland.    Suffering Taiwan cadres are leading young and industrious  mainland workers. They are using their accumulated management  experience and the newest plant equipment to give a new  performance of Taiwan's barehanded rise of 20 years ago on the  opposite shore.    The time is autumn 1993. The place is the China mainland.  The  main performers are a group of Taiwan traders who are building  factories anew on the China mainland. In this vast land that  requires risk taking to overcome difficulties, and that has been  described as the great west, the longing of Taiwan traders for  growth nicely coincides with the mainland battle to shed poverty.    By comparison with the stagnation in Taiwan, several  locations on the coast of mainland China are filled with a  strong will to grow, and foreign visitors arrive in an endless  flow. Every day Shanghai's Hilton Hotel is overbooked by 80 or  90 guests. An Min [1344 3046], the director of the Taiwan, Hong  Kong, and Macao Office of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC] says extremely ambitiously:  "China's economy must mesh with the world's." (On the China  mainland, Taiwan traders may meet many patriotic, strongly  ambitious, and outstanding officials like An Min.) An Min notes  with pleasure that China's imports and exports during 1992  totaled $1.6 trillion for tenth place in the world, suddenly  surpassing Taiwan by more than $10 billion. (During 1992, the  value of exports exceeded that of Taiwan for the first time.)    An Min said that in 1992 Taiwan firms contributed 3 percent  of the China mainland's total imports and exports. A Hong Kong  scholar believes it was more than that.    The succession of performances of Taiwan firms in pursuit of  growth on the mainland have directly or indirectly hastened the  rapid growth of the China mainland economy.    The rapid increase in Taiwan firms' investment in the  mainland has had an impact on Taiwan's industry that has spread  as well from manufacturing to the financial and advertising  businesses...    At 9 o'clock at night, in a brightly lighted factory five  hours away from Shenzhen by car -- the Chongde Shoe Factory  located in the Lianhuashan Industrial Zone of Dongguan in  Guangdong Province (a joint venture of Taiwan's Chunt'ai Shoe  Factory and a Japanese Shoe Factory) -- 800 female workers'  hands and feet are busy machine-sewing shoes. No one speaks. The  only sound is the cicada-like chirping of the sewing machines.  Looking at the factory, which sparkles like crystal, the  factory's new general manager Lin Wu-luan, soliloquizes: "They  laugh saying I am crazy because I want them to increase their  output 20 percent. Work that can be completed in 8 hours, they  want to take 10 hours to do." He and four other cadres from  Taiwan live in the factory area. They make the factory their  home, and they take turns on patrol. (Suffering cadres and  hardworking female employees: Isn't this a portrait of Taiwan 20  years ago?)    Scene 2: The Sorrows and Joys of Pioneers    At Kunshan City, a two-hour automobile trip from Shanghai,  fields of yellow-flowered rape and winding ditches appear  everywhere. This is a fine river and lake region south of the  Chang Jiang. This tract of rape is awaiting the arrival of a  foreign trader to develop it for a factory site. Fuch'ang  Textiles, Liuho Machinery, Nanhsin Electronics, and Amalgamated  Enterprises from Taiwan have all established plants here.    The 42 year-old Cheng Pao-t'ang from Jumbo Industries in  Taiwan is in charge of nine cadres who are in process of  building a factory that will produce 1.5 million bicycles per  year (to reach in a single action a scale that took 21 years in  Taiwan).    Today is Sunday. It is also the national anniversary of the  Republic of China. Very early in the morning, Cheng Pao-t'ang  listens to a radio broadcast from Taiwan, but the signal is  jammed. But work is more important than anything else, so the  holiday-less Cheng went on patrol at the plant site very early  to solve problems as they occurred. At 5:30 every morning, he  climbs to the top of a hill alone. At 7:30, he goes to work, and  at 10:00 or 11:00 o'clock at night, he is on plant patrol.    Because of the press of work, Cheng Pao-t'ang does not think  of his aged parents or his three growing daughters back in  Tachia Town in Taiwan. He says, "We started from scratch here.  It is a mission and a challenge." Nevertheless, looking out into  the twilight outside the office window, he cannot help but  frequently wipe away tears from behind his spectacles because he  is unable to look after his parents and daughters. Returning to  the dormitory, he eats dinner with 10 cadres sent from Taiwan.  In order to welcome the guests, he has specially bought Dazha  crabs from Yangcheng Lake in Kunshan for dinner. One of the  group, a 30-some year old cadre remembers the famous remark of  chairman of the board Liu Chin-piao: "Males have to be ruthless  to succeed." The homesickness of the group is assuaged only by  this sentence of the boss.    The leftover contestants apartments in Beijing's Olympic  Village have now become high quality apartments leased to  foreign firms.    The 10 cadres in Beijing live a collective bachelor life  here. "The general managers of a Chongqing plant and a Chengdu  plant, which are under construction, also live here. They go to  work and come back from work together, and after eating the  evening meal, their sole common topic is the amounts completed.    Around 8 o'clock on this night, general manager Chang  Sheng-chi receives a telephone call from Tianjin for the  purchase of some instant noodles. Since they began to go into  production at the beginning of the year, one after another of  the wholesalers in north China have lined up, cash in hand, to  buy them. They have come from Tianjin, Jinan, and even as far  away as Harbin. "The figures are what keep the five of us  going," says Chang Sheng-chi, who comes from Tainan, but who  already speaks with a Beijing accent after living in Beijing for  a year.    Scene 3. Exploring the North    It takes about two hours to go from Beijing to Tianjin via  the newly opened express highway.    The port of Tanggu in the Tanggu district of Tianjin on  Bohai  Bay is a coal exporting port. The smell of coal is everywhere,  and yellow saline soil is everywhere too, just waiting for  someone to reclaim it.    A Taiwan trader in Tanggu claims to have inside information  that direct flights will begin between Tianjin and Taipei in May  1994. The Tianjin Municipal Government has already drawn up  beautiful long-range plans for the yellow soil that include a  financial zone, an industrial zone, and economic relations and  trade zone.    The Tianjin Huana International Vacation Village Company is  developing a golf course in the planned financial district. All  around is yellow mud. It is difficult to envision this areas as  a bustling financial services area, and it is also very  difficult to envision a golf course in a financial services  area. A Taiwan trader in Tianjin said incredulously, "Tianjin  freezes in winter. How can grass be grown?" Pointing to a barren  tract beside him, The Huana general manager, Lin T'ien-chueh,  who comes from Taiwan, said happily, "We open next year. Pretty  soon, three regiments of people's armed police, 3,000 men in  each regiment, will be working three shifts a day on this  construction site. Within a short time, the dust will be flying  as huge forces battle night and day like tanks in a decisive  battle." The most dangerous places are the safest places and  vice versa. The more chaotic a place, the easier to see  opportunities for discussions.    On the mainland, some Taiwan firms like Huana dare to take  risks to overcome difficulties. They are taking the route of  armed forces and people's armed police. Lin T'ien-chueh has  asked the director of the Chinese Communist Hainan Island  Office, Li Da-xiao to take charge of the work. His units are  also a part of the Chinese Communist military's benefit  protection group. Li Da-xiao says in an aside: "Taiwan is part  of China. When Taiwan compatriots come here to work, they are  returning to the motherland to engage in construction. They are  developing strength for the motherland."  <H5>  Starting Life Over Again </H5>   Lin I-liang, the Tianjin general manager of Unity, which is  located not far distant, who came to Tianjin just half a year  ago, saw his life go from simplicity to complexity. Formerly,  his life centered around Tainan County and Tainan City. His life  was extremely simple. All he had to do was tend to his work, and  all was well.    Now, he has to make sure that mainland staff and workers do  not smoke or spit in the plant, and he has to remove refuse from  the plant area to turn it into a garden with a wayside pavilion.  (Unity in Tianjin is a joint venture with the old flour mill  owned by the Tianjin Sugar Refinery.) Lin I-liang hopes to turn  into magic the mess that exists in the plant area's  refuse-filled out of the way corners.    When he was a manager in Tainan, he often spent his spare  time drinking tea and chewing the rag with several good friends.  Now, on his day off, he plays golf with ranking Tianjin cadres  to talk about matters. "They really treat me very well. We are  on very close terms," says Lin I-liang from whose mouth Taiwan  dialect formerly issued, but from which the tongue-twisting  Beijing dialect now comes.    At dusk, Lin I-liang carries back to his hotel for the  evening meal some cold food that the plant cook made for lunch.  "When I went to work for Unity at age 26, I gave my all for the  job. Now that I have to give my all on the mainland at age 50,  it's really strenuous." He sighed saying, "Since I signed on to  this ship, I have to figure out a way to make it run."    Like it or not, people traveling from Taiwan to the mainland  to work is an irresistible trend. For the next generation, daddy  will no longer just not come home for dinner, but he will spend  the whole year on the mainland. The understanding of the next  generation that is educated in Taiwan will begin to be confused.  The textbooks may call the Chinese Communists communist bandits,  but daddy will have gone to do business with the communist  bandits.    Actually, economics knows no national boundaries. Nor can  firms who seek continuous growth easily put their country ahead  of profits. The amount of Taiwan firms' investment in the  mainland during 1992 was second only to their investment in Hong  Kong and Macao. It was greater than their investment in either  the United States or Japan.    An Min says that as of now, Taiwan firms have formally  invested in a nominal 12,000 different projects on the mainland  totaling nearly $11 billion. If the unofficial projects are  added in (investment by Taiwan firms registered under foreign  firm names), the number is 20,000.    The statement of a Beijing official has the typical Chinese  great nation haughty tone. He said, "Forty years ago Taiwan  carried away a lot of gold from China. It is only right that it  should return to the motherland to make a contribution now." As  he continued to speak, he happily revealed a secret. He recently  signed contacts with two big Taiwan firms.  <H5>  The Ever-Increasing Investment Craze </H5>   The speed and intensity of Taiwan firms investment in the  mainland is like the spread of lotuses on the Kaohsiung River.  Overnight the lotuses choke the river creating a peril.    Zhang Zhiqun, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office in the  Shanghai Municipal People's Government pointed out that since  Deng Xiaoping's travels in south China during 1992, Taiwan  firms' investment in Shanghai has increased enormously. During  1992 alone their investment was greater than the total for the  previous 10 years, and investment during the first half of 1993  has been greater than for all of 1992.    The scale of investment is also becoming greater and  greater.  An Min, who remembers figures very clearly, said that not only  has the level of technology risen, but the average per project  investment has also increased from $900,000 prior to 1991 to $1  million today. When Taiwan firms invest in the mainland, they  bring the quintessence of concentrated experiences to the  mainland. The scale of their plants is absolutely several times  what it is in Taiwan, and the equipment is also new and better.    Take the Yuyuan Shoe Company, a mainland joint venture of  Taiwan's P'ao-cheng Shoe Company and a Hong Kong firm, which set  up the Yuyuan Shoe Factory in Dongguan before the June 4th  incident of 1989. The plant area, which is located on a river,  occupies an entire street and has 20,000 staff members and  workers. It is more imposing than Taiwan's nearly 10,000  employee China Steel Plant. What was "Taiwan's best" a decade  ago, has moved here. Pao-cheng's plant at Zhongshan in Guangdong  is even larger with 50,000 staff members and workers. Its Zhuhai  plant has 5,000 staff members and workers. Yuyuan Shoe  Enterprises is now listed on the Hong Kong stock market.    Within just two years, Unity Enterprises has also set up  seven bases on the mainland. A cadre in a mainland general  merchandise and textiles group explained why investment in the  mainland is becoming greater and greater and deeper and deeper:  "In the beginning, investors were fearful. After the situation  became somewhat clearer, investment became greater and greater,"  she said.    We know when the enemy does not know. The mainland  authorities know all about Taiwan firms' investments. Taiwan's  Straits Exchange Foundation made 100 speeches during the first  half of 1993 in which it called upon firms to augment the  registration of Taiwan firms' investment in the mainland, but no  more than 12,000 projects were registered.    At the end of October, Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs  announced the astounding results of a survey. Citing the results  of a Ministry of Economic Affairs "survey report of the  operating intentions of manufacturing industries," for 5,000  manufacturing firms, it said that during the past three years 64  percent of the domestic concerns that invested had invested in  mainland China.    According to central bank statistics, during the past four  years, more than $10 billion has flowed out of Taiwan to the  mainland, but only slightly more than $6 billion has flowed from  the mainland to Taiwan. This is an adverse balance of more than  $5 billion.    The frequency of Taiwan firms' economic relations and trade  between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits has tightly bound  Taiwan's and the mainland's economic contacts into a destiny  community. Hong Kong Chinese University researcher, Chien  I-yuan, has found that Taiwan showed a $9.48 billion favorable  balance of trade for 1992. Its favorable balance of trade with  Hong Kong amounted to $13.6 billion. Without its favorable  balance of trade with Hong Kong, Taiwan would show an  unfavorable balance of $4.1 billion.    Unless one goes to China, it is difficult to understand why  Taiwan firms want to go so far from home to invest in the  mainland. What one sees on the mainland is everyone focusing on  money. There is a general determination to battle their way out  of poverty. From north to south, everywhere large tracts of land  beckon. Any time of the day one can see crowded, impoverished  masses telling people they need work.    A mainland survey shows 20 million staff members and  workers,  and their families, have a monthly income of only 50 yuan (about  NT$200). They live in poverty.    Many state-owned enterprises cannot continue operation.  Every  unit must think of ways to create income in order to sustain  itself. Some state-owned units have also allowed people to leave  their posts (leave their jobs temporarily) to get a fresh start.  One Shanghai intellectual said that a Shanghai textile mill has  cut half of its staff and workers. Even research units like the  Shanghai Social Sciences Institute have let go one fourth of  their staff members and workers.    Boundless land and unlimited manpower is what Taiwan does  not  have, and these are also powerful attractions for Taiwan traders  to invest in the mainland.    Following the travels of Deng Xiaoping in south China in  1992, the China mainland clearly announced that reform and  opening to the outside world would continue unchanged for 100  years. This more powerfully attracted Taiwan traders to go to  the mainland. At the same time, Taiwan was endlessly quarreling  over political rights issues; no clear-cut and concrete economic  policy was in sight; and no fresh political climate or quality  of life was provided.    Roaming Mainland China north and south in a strong search  for  growth opportunities has taken deep root in the minds of Taiwan  traders. While Taiwan was marking time in place, many Taiwan  traders regarded opening up new territory on the mainland as an  experience and a challenge.  <H5>  Risk Taker's Paradise </H5>   The China mainland is also a risk taker's paradise. People  can come here to try out new brands. Unity, whose "Chef Kang's"  Instant Noodles have the greatest brand name recognition on the  mainland, does not produce instant noodles in Taiwan. On Taiwan,  Unity is a food giant, but on the mainland everyone can begin to  compete from a zero starting point.    On the matter of profits and losses, a conclusion is very  difficult. In some cases, losses have mounted, but others say  they recovered their principle within three years. In most  cases, however, more and more investment and more and more  expansion is required. Some firms have expanded southward. An  example is "Chef Kang," which started out in Tianjin and Jinan,  and which is now looking for a plant site in Guangdong. Some  have expanded from the seacoast inland. An example is Chun-t'ai  Shoe Industries, which expanded from Dongguan and Qingdao to  Chengdu. Unity Enterprises has cast its net everywhere, east and  west, north and south.    Just as enterprises must grow, people must also have a sense  of accomplishment. "Taiwan has a lot more brilliant people than  the mainland, but I can realize my dream here," said Lin  T'ien-chueh, a Taiwan trader in Tianjin from Taiwan's Lien-t'ai  Gongguan. "A person always hopes to leave behind something that  will not be easily forgotten." Lin T'ien-chueh's feelings are  typical of Taiwan traders.    Taiwan traders appeals to Taiwan traders is another reason  for the snowballing increase in the number of Taiwan traders  investing in the mainland. At the present time, Tianjin has  1,200 Taiwan firms. Lin T'ien-chueh has steadily acquainted  Taiwan traders with investment in Tianjin. Lin T'ien-chueh said  that Ch'eng-chou Electronics, T'ien-sheng Ying-chia Radio  Telephone, Jou-Ch'ing Facial Tissue, and T'ai-chung Precision  Machines all have Tianjin investment plans.    Investment also has a mass psychology aspect: "A large group  of Taiwan traders, Japanese, and Koreans are aboard an airplane.  If the Taiwan traders do not come, the mainland will develop  without them," said Ch'en Te-hsing, chairman of the board of  Fuch'ang Textiles, which is well-known for the production of  high quality ready-made clothing, as he sits in Shanghai's old  Mianjiang Hotel eating Dazha crabs while listening to Strauss  piano music. This also explains why Taiwan traders are flocking  to the mainland.    Ch'en Te-hsing, who was introduced by a professional  colleague who invested in Fuzhou early, recently began a  cooperative venture with the Shanghai Jinshan Petrochemical  Plant for the production of ready made clothing. He went into  business with it because his professional colleague's  cooperation with it had been happy.    If a business does not move ahead it moves backward.  Businessmen find marking time in place very difficult to bear.  The deputy manager of Unity Enterprises in Beijing, Lin Fang-i,  said that "Business must continue to go on. They should not come  here because they cannot succeed elsewhere. They must come to  make their business grow." Standing at the Unity Industries  plant, which is beginning to rise on the salt lands, the place  seems familiar to him. it is because the heads of the Tainan  group come from the saline lands of Beimen Village in Tainan  County.  <H5>  The Hope of Setting Up Shop </H5>   The lure of the mainland market of 1.2 billion people is  hard  to resist. Furthermore, although mainland per capita income is  low, 980 million people on the mainland have annual incomes of  $7,000 or more. "I would be happy doing business with just 50  million people," one Taiwan trader said.    "The interesting thing about the mainland is that one cannot  look at it in terms of Taiwan's experience. All the finest  things in the world occur here," said Sung T'ieh-ming, the  chairman of the board of Taiwan Aomei and of China Aomei. What  he means by the Taiwan experience is step-by-step development.  On the mainland, the gap between the poor and the rich is wide,  the land is vast, the population is large, and it is both  extremely poor and extremely rich all at the same time.    The mainland's internal and external sales market holds  boundless charm, but management problems are numerous.    If one went to the mainland in 1989 (before the 4 June  Incident), and then went back four years later, even though the  mainland's basic problems (population, and education) still  remained, the speed with which several locations in coastal  areas are prospering would astound one. The Shanghai subway,  which was started later than Taipei's, had trains running on a  section in less than a year.    One can see everywhere on the China mainland the expression  of Deng Xiaoping's statement that "without reform and opening to  the outside world, China faces a dead end."    This clear-cut policy is being put into effect by Taiwan  traders.    One can see Taiwan products everywhere on the mainland.  Above  Beijing railroad station, Wei-ch'uan Food Products' large yellow  balloons frequently sway in the air. On signs at bus stops along  straight and long eastern Changan Avenue, Unity Instant Noodles  also proclaim their good taste. Beside the airport, a Lien-hua  Electronics Corporation sign, which declares itself to be  China's Largest Integrated Circuit Plant shares its glory with  tourists coming and going. On Shanghai's most crowded street,  Nanjing Road East, Acer Computer's neon sign adds brilliance to  the night scene.    Until relations between both sides of the straight are  clarified, propelled by profit, Taiwan firms will dare to go the  limit. Many people question whether firms interests are the same  as the country's interests. Many worries are cropping up...  <H5>  Do Firms Have No Motherland? </H5>   "If things go on this way, Taiwan will be hollowed out,"  said  Wu T'u, the manager of the Hong Kong branch of South China Bank  with extreme concern. Like other Taiwan banks, South China Bank  went to Hong Kong to handle the letters of hypothedation of  Taiwan firms that went to the mainland. The Hong Kong branch,  which opened for business only in September, brought in 1,300  customers within a month. Wu T'u has grounds for being worried.    He said that in Shenzhen alone there are more than 1,000  Taiwan firms, and nearly 1,000 in Dongguan. "A small area has so  many Taiwan firms, and China is so big..." Hong Kong Chinese  University researcher Chien I-yuan conducted an analysis in  terms of economic theory that shows how Taiwan's economy may be  sucked dry.    Chien I-yuan said that national income is the mark of  economic strength, and that national income is the sum total of  consumption, civilian investment, government expenditures and  exports minus imports. The reduced investment in Taiwan may  produce a domino effect. If employment opportunities decrease  and consumption decreases along with it, and if government  revenues decrease, and if their is an outflow of capital, in  particular, public finance will become increasingly distressed.  "Unless Taiwan reinvigorates its economy, Taiwan will really be  sucked dry, and the economy will be done for." Looking at the  Wanchai sea front in Hong Kong, Chien I-yuan could not help  sighing, "Should Wang Yung-ch'ing [3769 3057 1987] go to the  mainland, Taiwan will be really dry."    Many Taiwan firms are not that pessimistic. They feel that  the money will return to Taiwan. The roots remain in Taiwan.    A Hong Kong financier does not feel this way. His analysis  is  that the China mainland is formidable. So many Taiwan firms go  to the mainland, a small number of them failing. But how will  the steady expansion and the deepening investment of Taiwan  firms in the mainland turn? The mainland began by providing  concessions in coastal areas to attract foreign firms, and now  it is providing concessions inland. Taiwan firms cannot stand  such deadly temptation. "Taiwan firms themselves know very well  what they should do, but they do not do it. If they return to  Taiwan, they cannot survive," this financier pointed out.    Chien I-yuan's analysis is that Taiwan firms entered the  China mainland because they were "attracted from the outside and  pushed from the inside." By attracted from the outside he means  the Chinese mainland's large land area, cheap labor, and policy  of openness. By pushed from the inside he means Taiwan's  insufficient land and manpower, an inefficient administrative  system, and deterioration of the social order. One after  another, Taiwan firms took the course of seeking a second youth  on the mainland. The taking away of capital has already resulted  in a capital shortage in Taiwan, which delays the upgrading of  Taiwan's industry.  <H5>  Domino Effect </H5>   One can already see some evidence of the impact on Taiwan of  the departure of Taiwan firms.    Without manufacturing industries, there can be no service  businesses.    One Taiwan financier pointed out that with the departure of  Taiwan firms, finance and banking shrivels more and more.    Formerly, finance and banking grew at a 2 to 3 percent rate.  With the departure of Taiwan firms today and the increase in new  banks, local banks find it increasingly difficult to operate.  Consequently, they have begun to pressure the government. Banks  want to enter the stock market.    The departure of Taiwan firms has also produced a marked  slump in the advertising business. A person from Associated  Advertising said that in order to invest in the mainland, it is  very easy for Taiwan firms to cut their Taiwan advertising  budgets, because by cutting their advertising budget by NT$30  million, they can invest in a plant on the mainland.    When Taiwan firms invest in the mainland, human talent is  also replaced. One Taiwan trader noted that in the future when  local mainlanders are able to take over in Taiwan firms'  mainland plants, Taiwan cadres will be replaced. This will mean  a substitution of human talent.    More frightening is the clash between businessmen's  interests  and the national interest.    Chang Jung-fang [1728 2837 0023] of the China Economics  Institute pointed out that Taiwan's present mainland economic  relations and trade policy is the public policy about which  there has been the most controversy and the least consensus for  the past more than 40 years.    Both sides of the Straits conceal the benefit from their  frequent economic and trade contacts.    However, because of the Chinese Communist's strong political  goals whereby administration is legalized rule of men, not only  is Taiwan's political sovereignty threatened, but economically  though "Taiwan traders may benefit for a short time, they will  not necessarily benefit over a long period," said one observer.    Chang Jung-Fang noted that under the one-country two-systems  policy goal, the Chinese Communists are actively employing  economic and trade methods, and the intensification of economic  and trade relations between the two sides of the Straits to  attain the goal of unification. Once Taiwan's economic chip and  advantage continues to erode, Taiwan's security coefficient will  inevitably decline.  <H5>  Who Bears Responsibility? </H5>   In a report, Chang Jung-Fang said that a Chinese Communist  internal document said explicitly that "our trade with Taiwan is  for the purpose of promoting economic contacts between the  mainland and Taiwan to unite industrial and commercial circles  in Taiwan to create conditions for the unification of the  motherland." This report pointed out that the Chinese  Communist's present method is to hope to combine with Taiwan  traders, to use the people to pressure officials, and to use  businessmen to encircle the government, and to use Taiwan  businessmen's expectations that the three opens [the opening of  postal, trade, and navigational ties between Taiwan and Mainland  China] will lower costs as a motivation for forcing Taiwan to  accept a one China principle. This is tantamount to businessmen  transferring external costs to the backs of 20 million people in  order to benefit themselves (when costs occur for which they  themselves are not required to bear responsibility).    In reality, Chinese Communist activities inside Taiwan have  not relaxed with advances in relations between the two sides of  the Straits. They have only changed from an effort to take the  island in one big gulp to nibbling away. The China mainland has  never abandoned Taiwan. In Beijing An Min said, today there is  no talk of force against Taiwan, but overall one may say that we  are duty-bound to defend the territory of the country! Some  people believe optimistically that Taiwan traders may spread  Taiwan's experiences on the mainland, or use economic strength  to transform the mainland peacefully.    The fact is that the longer Taiwan traders stay there, the  more uneasy they become. In a society that depends on the rule  of men, commerce has no guarantees. Taiwan traders who have just  arrived on the mainland, particularly in north China, feel that  high ranking characters are very friendly and are on very good  terms with them. However, the longer they stay in the south, the  more disappointed they become. In Guangdong Province, for  example, although they sign agreements to lease plant buildings  for 10 years, they are forced to move in less than four. In  addition, after several years, the price of land for which an  agreement has been signed may be raised and more rent collected.  PLA units may drive vehicles into the plant at any time before  the New Year to ask for goods free of charge. When a Taiwan  trader is killed on the mainland, the Chinese Communists "may  brazenly refuse to provide particulars of the case," one Taiwan  trader complained.    Even though Taiwan traders in various places have tried to  organize Taiwan trader associations, the Chinese Communist's  Taiwan office either wanted to take part, or refused approval.  One Taiwan trader said the Taiwan Office "only approved lateral,  but not vertical ties" among Taiwan traders in all  jurisdictions. People who have had no contacts with the  Communists find it difficult to understand the experiences that  the Chinese Communists have accumulated during the past half  century, or the number of stages in united front work. One high  ranking official in united front work directed against Taiwan  said that the Chinese Communist's united front tactic throughout  has been, first, to make friends to win confidence, and then do  "work."  <H5>  No Distinction Between Politics and Economics </H5>   A Japanese commentator who visited a finance and economics  official in Taiwan said that Taiwan has always maintained the  inseparability of politics and economics, but as the Chinese  Communist economy has begun to become strong in recent years,  its political attitude has begun to harden. It began with the  nuclear testing in Xinjiang... Actually, Chinese Communist  officials plan to dovetail economically with the world, but they  do not want to dovetail ideologically with the world.    In Beijing during October, signs about bringing the Olympic  Games were still up, and the express highway from the airport to  downtown Beijing, which was completed more than a year ago, was  built to obtain the right to sponsor the Olympic Games in 2000.  Finally, when the opportunity was lost because of the human  rights issue, people in Beijing were infuriated. An Min said  angrily, "Today's world is not a fair world. The Olympic Games  standards are the white man's standards." By comparison with the  mainland, Taipei's ideological standards are closer to the world  standards.    Every time they return to Taipei, many Taiwan traders feel  much more relaxed as soon as they step from the airplane,  because they can breathe a free atmosphere. If you stand back a  little to look at Taiwan, you see that it has some valuable  things: its atmosphere is becoming increasingly free; it better  respects human rights; and it has greater freedom of the press.    One problem is that ever since the lifting of martial law,  Taiwan has stagnated for a very long time. This applies to  economic reform, to political clean-up, to National Assembly  efficiency, and to the quality of life.    One Taiwan trader in Hong Kong suggested that the Taiwan  government should wake up to the present state of affairs. It  should talk less and do more. National Assembly efficiency, in  particular, should be improved greatly... Taiwan needs more  self-examination and action.    If it is to retain Taiwan firms, Taiwan has to provide an  environment that permits the rapid growth of enterprises,  particularly for the countless medium and small enterprises. It  must permit the people to live reasonable and tranquil lives.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Quito, 28 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- In an attempt to unravel  the fiscal deficit problem sparked by the fall in the  international price of crude oil, the Ecuadoran Government  tonight announced an increase of up to 70 percent in the price  of fuel as of 29 January.    In a message broadcast via a radio and television network,  Ecuadoran Finance Minister Cesar Robalino has detailed the  decreed increase according to each type of fuel.    The measure will specifically modify gasoline prices, which  remained the same since September 1992.    The minister said premium gasoline, the type which most  Ecuadoreans use, will increase from $.80 per gallon (3.78  liters) to $1.35, while unleaded gasoline will increase by 50  percent. Concurrently, regular gasoline and aviation gasoline  will increase by 40 percent.    Robalino said the measure was necessary, because the  reduction in the price of hydrocarbons on the international  market has caused a financial imbalance of $700 million for  Ecuador in terms of crude exports.    This situation was complicated even further as a result of  Congress' refusal to approve an 18-percent increase in the  value-added tax (VAT), the minister added.    The fuel price system is geared toward deregulating the  domestic market for crude oil byproducts and to ensure an  adequate increase in tax revenues.    The government has also included several decrees  establishing  public spending controls and measures aimed at cutting tax  evasion and modernizing customs systems.    Robalino added that "the fall in fiscal revenues for 1994 is  very important. It is no government fabrication and requires  the implementation of corrective measures."    The minister said the government does not intend to increase  the price of other crude oil byproducts such as diesel and  household gas, and he reiterated that urban transportation fares  will remain the same as a result of a government subsidy.    Nevertheless, union sources have announced they will  coordinate general actions to protest the government's economic  measures, which they believe will only result in the speculation  of basic commodities.</p>

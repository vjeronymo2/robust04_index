			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> PORT HUENEME;  </P> <P> MAN CHARGED WITH ASSAULT, KIDNAPING  </P> <P> A Port Hueneme man was charged Thursday with five felonies in connection with  the kidnaping and sexual assault of his housemate and her 7-year-old daughter,  Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury announced.  </P> <P> Bradbury's office filed a criminal complaint against Justo Dungca, 34, charging  him with kidnaping, child molestation and attempted murder of the child, and  kidnaping and sexual battery of the mother in connection with last week's  alleged abduction.  </P> <P> The district attorney's office was expected to serve a warrant on Dungca on  Thursday in Las Vegas, where he has been held without bail in the Clark County  Detention Center since his arrest July 20, Deputy Dist. Atty. Vincent J.  O'Neill Jr. said.  </P> <P> On July 19, authorities said, Dungca bound and gagged the girl and her mother  and held them captive in his bedroom in Port Hueneme, where authorities said he  sexually assaulted the woman.  </P> <P> Dungca then forced the two into the woman's car and drove to Anaheim, where the  woman managed to escape, authorities said. Dungca was found in Las Vegas the  next morning as he tried to sell the car.  </P> <P> As Las Vegas police closed in, Dungca grabbed the girl in a stranglehold and  banged her head against the floor before officers could rescue her, said Lt.  Greg Jolley, Las Vegas police spokesman.  </P> <P> If convicted of all counts, Dungca faces a maximum sentence of 28 years in  prison, O'Neill said. MACK REED  </P></p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of European Finance and Investments - Portugal (6): Painful changeover - Insurance PORTUGAL is grossly under-insured by the standards of the European Community. According to a study conducted by Arthur Andersen, total premiums in 1989 amounted to Es220bn (USDollars 1.5bn), which works out at about 3 per cent of GDP - less than half the EC average. Premiums per head are around one-eighth of the level of the rest of Europe. The opportunities for such an underdeveloped sector are enormous, especially in view of Portuguese people's high propensity to save. Recognising this, the number of insurance companies operating in Portugal has risen from 50 in 1986 to 65 now and an estimated 75 by the end of the year. Like the banking sector, the insurance industry was owned and controlled by the state until the mid-1980s. The pace of change has been slower, though, than in banking and deregulation has in many cases brought pain rather than prosperity. The market is extremely concentrated - the six biggest companies account for approximately 70 per cent of the industry. In 1986, all were state-owned; by now one is totally private, another is in the throes of privatisation, and three more are to be sold off by the end of next year. Between 1984 and 1989, the state relinquished its control over tariffs in segment after segment of the insurance market. This ushered in an era of fierce price competition, which according to Mr Ruy de Carvalho, president of the Portuguese Insurers' Association, lingers on still. Thus, in sectors such as motor insurance, big-ticket industrial insurance and workmen's compensation, premiums have fallen dramatically recently. 'After decades of control competition is now very lively,' Mr Carvalho acknowledges. It is in the life sector that premiums rose most comfortably last year, by 26 per cent, twice the rate of inflation. It is the life business which offers the biggest opportunity for profitable expansion. This accounts for only 20 per cent of the market against an average of 40 per cent across the EC. In total, the life market grew from Es45.5bn to 69bn over 1989-90 and the non-life from 175.5bn to 221bn. New companies - such as Ocidental Seguros, the insurance subsidiary of the Banco Comercial Portugues - have tended to concentrate on life. Older ones - like Fidelidade, Portugal's second largest insurer now owned by the giant Caixa Geral - are scurrying to form distribution links with the banks. This form of selling is gradually replacing the army of agents who act as intermediaries. Mirroring the success of its parent company in the banking sector, Ocidental has come from nowhere to be the 14th largest insurance company. Seguros predicts its premium income will grow by 80 per cent this year, an indication of the vigour of the life business. The company would occupy a higher position still if motor insurance were stripped out. This accounts for a substantial proportion of the premium income generated by the top six insurers but, according to Mr Joao Talone, president of Ocidental, losses in this segment of the market amounted to Es7bn last year. The total profit across the sector was Es6 - 7bn last year. Talone says that two thirds of this is not trading profit - 'the only thing the big companies can do is cut their rates to keep market share,' he comments. 'They have made most of their money by selling properties in the middle of a bull or by selling shares bought long before the 1974 revolution. 'All the big insurers are engaged in window-dressing to make themselves look good for privatisation,' he says. 'The state sector companies are hampered from doing deals with banks to secure distribution channel for life products,' he continues. 'Nobody knows who's going to end-up owning whom. We are selling well into our own bank because we are part of the same culture. They have been forced to compete very strongly without having the tools to take the necessary strategic decisions.' Mr Jose Antonio Santos Texeira, president of Imperio, the largest insurance company in Portugal and yet to be privatised, rejects any suggestion that the state sector is grossly inefficient. He admits, however, that the company is handicapped by its public-sector status. Mr Texeira would like to have a bank and a large foreign insurance company as shareholders. Rivals comment that the problem with the privatisation programme is that the state will demand a high price for its insurance assets, but will want control to remain in the hands of the Portuguese. The trouble may be that only outsiders will be willing to pay the price. Foreign interest in the sector is high: Andersen calculated that Portuguese companies will have less than 60 per cent of the market by 1995. The main foreign entrants are from France and Spain, and they have considerably greater financial muscle. Ruefully, Mr Texeira says that his company's capital amounts to Pounds 2.5m, compared to the Pounds 1bn of UAP, the French group which has acquired Garantia, Portugal's seventh largest insurance company, and which is poised to take control of Alianca, another state-owned insurer - when its privatisation is finally completed.</p>

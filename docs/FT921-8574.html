			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Appointments: Combating the black mark Laurentian Life, the life assurance group, has promoted Iain Tweeddale to managing director. This is one of the last moves in a wide-scale restructuring of Laurentian's operations into four units; the others are Laurentian Milldon, a firm of tied agents, Laurentian Fund Management, and Laurentian Financial Advisers. Tweeddale, 45, joined the company in 1979, when it was known as Imperial Life, on the investment side. Before this he was a stockbroker, spending nine years with McAnally Montgomery; he was also in banking briefly immediately after graduating from Oxford. Tweeddale considers his main task is to make Laurentian's business more consumer-led: 'We have got to improve our position in the eyes of our clients. Otherwise we are not going to be one of the players at the end of the decade.' He is also aiming to take a much more multidisciplinary approach to management, and criticises the more hierarchical and divisional structures used elsewhere in the industry. He thinks this should help in combating the problem of early lapse rates on long-term pol-icies, which he regards as 'the greatest black mark against the industry at the moment'.</p>

			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Monetary policy obstacles to G7 growth in 1992 'THE forces that have been inhibiting economic activity in many countries are dissipating and the conditions for improved global growth exist,' declared the finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrialised countries at their recent meeting. Yet this cautious optimism is not universally shared. Monetary policy has eased in the US, Japan and the UK over the past year, though not in the rest of Europe. Yet output growth is still decelerating everywhere. Is monetary policy in the G7 laying the foundation for 'non-inflationary' growth this year? No, cry those monetarist economists who judge the tightness of policy by the rate of growth of money and credit. Broad money aggregates decelerated sharply across almost every G7 country throughout 1991, as this week's table shows. Germany is the exception: broad money grew at an annual rate of 9 per cent in past three months, compared with a target of 3.5-5.5 per cent. Yet monetary aggregates have not done a great job of predicting future changes in economic activity in the 1980s. Moreover, it is possible to find at least one reason for most countries why broad money growth rates might be distorted. An alternative measure of the monetary policy stance is the yield curve, a line which plots the market interest rate on deposits or bonds of increasing maturity. The central bank is able to determine interest rates on short-term securities by varying the price at which it is willing to lend to the money market. But interest rates for bonds of longer maturity are also influenced by the risk that a burst of inflation will undermine the bond's nominal face value, as well as other political or default risks. So the market's judgment over whether monetary and fiscal policy is too loose or tight to foster non-inflationary growth can be gauged by the slope of the curve. Loose policy drives up inflationary expectations and steepens the curve; tighter policy to rein in inflation flattens it again; while very tight policy pushes down inflationary expectations, thereby inverting the curve. The more inverted is the curve - the more that short rates exceed long rates - the less encouraging are short-term growth prospects. How easy is monetary policy across the G7? The charts show stylised yield curves for the six largest industrialised countries in June 1990 and January 1992. The US chart confirms how aggressively the Federal Reserve has eased monetary policy since the recession began, though Mr Michael Boskin, the White House chief economic adviser, says it should not stop yet. In fact the US yield curve is steeper than at any time in the past twenty years. According to Mr David Morrison of Goldman Sachs, an upward sloping US yield curve has always been associated with positive year-on-year growth of gross national product within four to eight quarters - which should please Mr Bush's nervous advisers. Similarly, if more modestly, the Japanese central bank has swung Japan's yield curve from being inverted to gently upward-sloping over the past few months. Meanwhile, Germany has been going in the opposite direction: its yield curve has become progressively inverted over the past 18 months as the Bundesbank has raised rates to choke off rising inflationary pressures. The rest of Europe remains stuck with US-style growth and German-style monetary policy. The European exchange rate mechanism has prevented France from cutting short rates, thereby inverting its yield curve; while the Italian curve is upward-sloping, despite higher short rates, because of the increased risk premium on Italian government bonds. Nowhere is this decoupling of the economic cycle and monetary policy more stark than in Britain. The UK had a tighter squeeze than did the US in the months before its recession began, and has since suffered a deeper recession. Yet, in spite of a series of rate cuts over the past year, policy remains chokingly tight: the UK yield curve is still as inverted as that of Germany. What easing there has been, argues the ever-optimistic Goldman Sachs, 'is probably consistent with some economic recovery this year.' Little wonder, though, that the much-heralded recovery is yet to materialise.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------          INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: MONEY AND FINANCE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- This table shows growth rates for the most widely followed measures of narrow and broad money, a representative short- and long-term interest rate series and an average equity market yield.

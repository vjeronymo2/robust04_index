			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Molynx Molynx Holdings, the closed circuit television, security and building energy management systems maker, showed no improvement in the second half of 1992 and finished the year with a loss of Pounds 486,000. It is omitting the final dividend to leave the total at 1.3p (4p). The loss, against a profit last time of Pounds 1.93m, was made from sales of Pounds 24.5m (Pounds 22m). Operating profit in CCTV fell from Pounds 1.16m to Pounds 515,000 reflecting the severity of recession in the UK during which nearly all main customers were reducing capacity. Management systems moved from a profit of Pounds 1.18m to a loss of Pounds 578,000 which was spread across all markets of operation. Savage trading conditions in UK construction hit margins hard. Gearing at the year-end was 82 per cent and steps will be taken to reduce borrowings. Losses per share came to 1.9p (earnings 10.7p).</p>

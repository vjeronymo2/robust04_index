			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Rome, Feb 3 (AFP) -- The number of people threatened  by famine in Bosnia is rising because of blocked food convoys,  with only half available supplies getting through, the World  Food Programme (WFP) warned here Thursday [3 February]. The  population of central Bosnia is most at risk following delivery  of only 28 percent of its food needs in December, added the UN  food relief organisation, which is based here. Airdrops of food  will be more than trebled to 3,600 tonnes a month to prevent a  threatened spring shortage caused by the fact that only 65  percent of needed supplies are in place, the WFP said.    Throughout Bosnia, only half the available food aid reaches  its final destination, the WFP added. Between 20 percent and 30  percent of children in the Moslem enclave of Maglaj, central  Bosnia, are suffering from malnutrition, because of a Serb  blockade of humanitarian relief, it said. Three quarters of the  food aid required was parachuted in during November and  December, but it was unknown how much actually reached the  population, the WFP said.</p>

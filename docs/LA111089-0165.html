			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EVOLVING DEBATE  </P> <P> So Bill Honig and the State Board of Education are going to appease the  fundamentalist Christians by stating in the school textbooks that evolution is  not an exact science! How reminiscent of the encounter between Hitler and  Chamberlain in 1939. The religious "right wing" will not see this as anything  but a victorious foot in the door, as they care nothing for scientific truth.  Their sole purpose is to force their religious beliefs upon everyone else.  </P> <P> If the Rev. Lou Sheldon and his followers were to expend one-half of the  energy, money and dedication to improving the world's environment as they do to  arguing about how the world began, it would be of considerably more value to us  all.  </P> <P> WILLIAM F. ZWICK  </P> <P> Placentia  </P></p>

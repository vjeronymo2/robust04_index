			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Lamont says civil servants suggested costs payment MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, yesterday defended strongly his decision to accept a Treasury contribution towards his personal legal costs as backbench MPs prepared to call this week for tighter rules on all payments to ministers. Mr Lamont said he had not solicited the Pounds 4,700 paid by the Treasury towards legal costs arising from the eviction of a self-styled sex therapist from his London home. He insisted on BBC television that the payment had been suggested by senior civil servants after they judged that the proportion of his legal expenses covering press relations was attributable to his public office. The remainder of the bill for solicitors Peter Carter-Ruck and Partners was met by an anonymous Pounds 18,000 donation channelled through Conservative Central Office. His comments, confirmed last week in a report by National Audit Office, the independent watchdog on government spending, are unlikely to deflect Labour attacks on the payment. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, has signalled a concerted attack on what he regards as a general decline of standards in public office. Later this week the opposition will highlight the business links of former cabinet ministers with privatised industries, arguing that their influence is behind the government's refusal to tackle 'excess' profits. The cross-party Commons committee on members' interests will today add fuel to the controversy over Mr Lamont's legal bill by arguing that anonymous donations should in future be declared in the register of member's interests. The report attaches no direct blame to Mr Lamont for failing to do so, concluding that the existing rules are not clear on the point. Labour MPs are preparing to press the chancellor on whether he declared the gift for income tax purposes. Yesterday Mr Lamont indicated he regarded his tax affairs as a personal matter. Separately, MPs on the Commons public accounts committee will this week question former and present Treasury officials on the Pounds 4,700 contribution. A majority on the committee is expected to back tighter accounting rules which would alert parliament to all such payments.</p>

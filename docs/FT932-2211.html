			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Markets: Chancellor dances on his bed of nails - London THE PICTURE of the week was of Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, walking on a bed of nails at the annual Chancellery children's party. He had rolled up the trousers of his double-breasted suit and removed his shoes and socks. He even looked happy, grinning and spreading his arms wide. No doubt the children were rather impressed too. Of course, walking on nails is a confidence trick. At a similar event in London this week, Britain's new finance minister accomplished another. Kenneth Clarke's performance at the Mansion House dinner on Tuesday was an equal display of bravura. He stood on the metaphorical bed of nails, managing to say nothing while giving the impression of doing something really quite difficult, and drawing the admiration of the crowd. His instincts, he assured the assembled party-goers, are tax cutting instincts - he did not bother to remind anyone that taxes will rise even if no new increases are announced in the November budget. Meanwhile, public spending - if the cabinet can stick to its collective hymn sheet, which seems to be open at All Things Bright and Beautiful - is to be tightly controlled. While Clarke did not unpack a new economic policy when he moved to Number 11 Downing Street, he has brought a new tone. It is one of confidence, and was backed up this week by a bunch of economic statistics which on the whole suggest that the recovery is gathering strength, without reviving inflation. The truth is, as Norman Lamont knows only too well, that Clarke can sit on his hands and still expect to be hailed as the best chancellor of the exchequer for many a year. The economy is reviving, unemployment has fallen for a fourth month in a row, and inflation is low. So long as inflation is held in check - which could be achieved by allowing sterling to appreciate gently - everything in Clarke's garden could indeed be looking lovely; so much so that he will be looking over the wall into Number 10. Economists had already been upgrading forecasts for economic growth this year and next in a quiet way. Higher growth rates make the government's tax and spending numbers look much better. Yesterday BZW, the stockbroker, cut its forecast of the government's borrowing requirement for this financial year and next's. The reduction for 1993-94 is from a forecast of Pounds 48bn to Pounds 45bn, still a formidable total but every Pounds 3bn helps. Nick Knight, of Nomura Research Institute, the Japanese securities house, is as usual more bullish. Next week he heads for Tokyo to tell investors there to pile into the UK markets, impishly suggesting that Nippon Life could fund the whole of this year's PSBR through one bought deal. The confidence trick seems to be working in the foreign exchange markets too, with sterling perking up this week and topping DM 2.50. There was even talk of another base rate cut coming, although perversely the better the news on the recovery the less the chance of interest rates falling. All this is wonderful news for the gilt-edged market which has had a good week. Low inflation - only 1.3 per cent on the RPI measure - makes yields of 8 1/2 per cent or so attractive. Japanese long bonds yield 4 1/2 per cent, and Japan does not even have a prime minister. A happier gilt market gives support to equities too, where yields of around 4 per cent are still high relative to inflation. And revised economic growth forecasts should push up earnings estimates. It is perhaps curious that the Footsie index has only risen 17.6 points this week. But that can be put down to the approaching half year end, with fund managers delaying action until after the valuations have been fixed. It might also reflect concern about amount of new shares coming on offer. The Pounds 5bn-plus BT 3 share sale is looming larger since the discounts and incentives for retail investors were announced on Monday. The Stock Exchange and SG Warburg, the securities firm which is organising the sale, spent much of the week arguing behind the scenes over whether BT shares should be traded mainly on a cash settlement basis in the run up to the sale. Warburg wanted deals to be done that way so it could see just what the big investors were up to in the shares - particularly who was selling shares in the hopes of buying back cheaper in the sale. Warburg, which has been remarkably successful in winning privatisation business could have punished short sellers by allocating fewer shares to them. At first the Stock Exchange seemed to be going along with the idea. By Friday, though, the Stock Exchange had back pedalled somewhat after institutional investors threw a collective wobbly. The Exchange then demanded that from Monday until the sale date of July 16, bargains of over 100,000 shares must be notified to the Stock Exchange. Warburg's other issue, the Pounds 1.3bn Zeneca rights which closes on Monday, was looking distinctly more cheerful by Friday night, with the shares closing at 622p compared the 600p rights price. And MEPC was the last of the big seven property companies to raise new equity this year, with a Pounds 221.9m rights issue taking the total to over Pounds 1bn. If that seems a lot, it is worth noting that a sausage skin manufacturer can be valued at Pounds 224m - as Devro International was earlier this week.</p>

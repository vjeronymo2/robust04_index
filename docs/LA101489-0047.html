			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CASTING QUESTION  </P> <P> Re the Oct. 7 article on the movie "War Party":  </P> <P> Let me see if I understand this. In the entire United States of American were  there no actors other than Kevin Dillon (a white) and Billy Wirth (whose  great-great grandmother was American Indian) qualified to play the leading  American Indian roles in this film?  </P> <P> I realize that name recognition is important to producers, but surely these  fine young actors could have played the leading white roles.  </P> <P> I wonder if it has occurred to the film's producers to contribute some  (probably tax-deductible) portion of the film's proceeds to improve the  possibility that the people they are exploiting will survive into adulthood?  </P> <P> EVA SNIDER, Pasadena  </P></p>

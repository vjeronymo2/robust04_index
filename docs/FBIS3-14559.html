Our legal correspondent  Shlomo Arad reports that one of them, Yo'el Shem-Tov, was tried  and sentenced to 14 days in military prison after refusing to  serve in Hebron. His commanders, however, waived the sentence  and stationed him at a post which does not conflict with his  conscience.    A spokesman for the Yesh Gvul [there is a limit] Movement  said, however, that another reservist, Peter Weiner from Tel  Aviv, was arrested last night at his home in Tel Aviv after he  refused to report for duty with his unit which serves in the  territories.</p>

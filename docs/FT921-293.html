			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Volkswagen's new head to cut 12,500 jobs over five years VOLKSWAGEN, Europe's biggest car producer, is appointing a new chief executive and planning drastic action to cut costs, including the axing of 12,500 jobs over the next five years. Mr Ferdinand Piech, 54, an Austrian with a reputation for toughness who runs VW's successful Audi subsidiary, has been chosen to take over from Mr Carl Hahn next January. Mr Hahn, 65, had been given a two-year extension of his contract, but will step down a year earlier than planned. The company said the cuts of 2,500 a year in its 130,000-strong workforce would occur through natural wastage and would not involve redundancies. It denied a report that cuts of up to 25,000 were planned. The choice by an inner committee of the company's supervisory board of Mr Piech as group head underlines VW's determination to streamline its business. While an engineer at Audi, he was involved in several technological innovations and as its chief executive has presided over a period of rising profits and successful model launches. Until the last few weeks, Mr Daniel Goeudevert, a Frenchman who joined VW from Ford Motors' German subsidiary two years ago, had been regarded as the favoured candidate to succeed Mr Hahn. But with the backing of both trade union and corporate representatives on the supervisory board, it became clear recently that Mr Piech was in the lead. The appointment still requires the approval of the full non-executive supervisory board at its next meeting on April 10, but this is expected to be a formality. Mr Goeudevert, 50, who is responsible for the VW marque within the group, will be appointed deputy chief executive. VW also announced a 2.5 per cent rise in group net profits to DM1.1bn (Pounds 380m) for 1991, with turnover up by 12 per cent to DM76bn. The dividend will be unchanged at DM11 a share. However, it said that profits of the parent company, which reflect domestic performance, fell by a third to DM447m. Mr Stephen Reitman, motors analyst with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the London stockbrokers, said the VW parent could be losing money on car sales before financial and other income was added in. VW has declined to comment on previous reports that this was the case and its figures, like those of other German companies, do not make this clear. 'They've got to get their break-even levels way down,' he added. It was against this background that Mr Piech's appointment should be judged. 'It's not time to be courting popularity,' he said. 'He will be the man who rattles cages. Similar cost problems are being experienced at other motor concerns in Germany, which has Europe's highest labour costs outside Sweden. German car companies have a productivity lead, but other European countries have been catching up. VW's main rival in Germany is Opel, part of General Motors of the US. Opel has been reporting steadily rising profits in recent years and its new Astra family car is in direct competition with the third generation of VW's Golf model. Both companies are building new plants in east Germany. Petrol in the veins, Page 19 New Nissan president, Page 22</p>

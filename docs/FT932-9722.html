			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Three-month COPPER ended firmer, but closed below its highs on the LME after faltering near Dollars 1,800 a tonne. Dealers said the rally represented a much-needed technical correction after recent heavy declines. But whether the market could extend the recovery much further was doubtful, as fundamentals remained poor, and stocks continued to rise. LME warehouse stocks are at a fresh nine-year high of 403,475 tonnes. Precious metals drifted sideways in very narrow trading ranges on the London bullion market as GOLD paused for breath and the others lacked any fresh fundamental news, dealers said. New York failed to inject any life into the market as Comex opened lower, depressed by the firm dollar. 'It's exceptionally quiet,' said one dealer. Others said the gold market was becoming increasingly speculator driven as physical demand had dried up at current price levels. New York analysts said market participants were continuing to look for further news regarding Sir James Goldsmith after Monday's news that he had sold a large amount of stock in leading US gold producer Newmont Mining.

			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Advance credit In its determination to act independently, the Bundesbank is toying with the markets' emotions. The failure to cut official rates on Thursday distanced the German central bank from the G7 meeting, and reflected caution about stubborn domestic inflation. Friday's easing of money market rates indicated justified concern about rapidly falling domestic output, as this week's appalling results from the German chemical giants will confirm. To be fair to the Bundesbank, conflicting economic signals and demands of other EC members mean that it has had to tread a very careful path. It is also keen to squeeze a credible fiscal package from Chancellor Kohl and the Lander. Fortunately, there are signs that inflation is being squeezed. Bank workers have accepted a 3.3 per cent wage settlement, and companies seem finally to understand the need to cut costs. The much-heralded secular decline in interest rates may soon be under way. If short rates are about to fall, one might expect bond yields and equities to follow. However, at 6.5 per cent bond yields are already 2 per cent lower than those on bank deposits, so there is very limited room for further falls. In the past German equities have not rallied until short rates fell below bond yields. This time, however, foreign buyers have stepped in to anticipate the rise. That may be premature given Germany's deep-seated economic problems. Exports might possibly provide higher earnings if overseas growth ignites. But the bias towards late cycle heavy capital goods in the German market tells against it.</p>

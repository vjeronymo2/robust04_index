Cost sharing and fees collected by any eligible new or expanded service program for the CHSP are currently eligible. However, due to the statutory constraints concerning matching funds, funds for existing services which are not expanded are not eligible for match. Matching funds must pay for 50% of the cost of the services under CHSP and therefore, only costs for new or expanded services are eligible for match.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Definitions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter urged the Department to reconsider its definition of activities of daily living (ADL) and the way that its definition is applied in the interim common rule. The commenter stated that the definition of ADL promulgated in the new rule combines what are now commonly known in the worlds of gerontological research and community-based aging programs as ``activities of daily living'' (ADL) and ``instrumentalities of daily living'' (IDL). The commenter stated that the rule definition of ADL was created by combining these terms without regard to what is currently used in the community and other common programs. The commenter argues that this definition is not in the spirit of coordination of housing and services which it believes is intended by the CHSP. The commenter further states that the way in which the definition of activities of daily living is applied is ``antithetical to the concept of aging in place.'' The commenter states that when one looks at the definition and all its caveats, the potential population to be served is not what is commonly known as the frail elderly but rather a fairly narrow niche of somewhat frail older adults. The commenter stated that while it understands HUD might want to be cautious about this definition in order to maintain a housing rather than an institutional character to its developments, it is also important that such appropriateness decisions be reviewed on an individual rather than a categorical basis whenever possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD and FmHA response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Program participants are limited to the frail elderly deficient in at least three activities of daily living by statute. Therefore, HUD and FmHA decided to combine the ADL's and IDL's based upon HUD's past experiences in operating the CHSP of 1978. By combining ADLs and IDLs for the definition of ADLs and stating the minimum deficiency level, the program is able to serve a larger population of frail elderly persons than would be served by the traditional definitions of the ADLs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter states that the definition of activities of daily living (ADL) should be more concise and the minimum requirements of ADL which are listed in &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .225(c)(2) should be initially stated under the definitions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD and FmHA response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .225(c)(2) restates the definition of activities of daily living found in the definition section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter states that instead of including PHAs specifically in the definition of ``Applicant'' PHAs are identified as eligible grantees under the definition of ``Local nonprofit housing sponsor.'' The commenter suggests that the rule specifically identify PHAs and IHAs as eligible grantees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD and FmHA response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The definition of ``Applicant'' has been revised to specifically identify PHAs and IHAs as eligible grantees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter states that the definition of qualifying supportive services found in &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .105 and the eligible activities found in &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .210 do not tie in directly to the minimum requirements for ADL. The commenter states that the minimum requirements of ADL do not include non-medical supervision and personal emergency response systems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD and FmHA response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Qualifying supportive services and eligible activities should not tie directly into the requirements of ADL. The ADLs are used to determine if frail elderly persons are minimally eligible to participate in the program. Program participants (frail elderly persons deficient in at least three ADLs and persons with disabilities) would then be eligible to receive qualifying supportive services such as non-medical supervision and personal emergency response systems, if they need them. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The commenter states that the section number in the reference for the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act contained in &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .105(7) should be changed from (7) to (5). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD and FmHA response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This error has been corrected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The commenter states that in &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .205(e) Eligible housing projects of the interim rule the reference to non-elderly ``disabled'' should be changed to non-elderly people with ``disabilities.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD and FmHA response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All references to non-elderly handicapped or non-elderly disabled have been changed to non-elderly people with disabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

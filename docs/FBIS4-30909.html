			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague May 30 (CTK) -- The difference in the number  of inhabitants per constituency for senatorial elections must  not exceed 15 percent, the government coalition parties'  commission agreed today, Josef Jezek (independent) told CTK.  Jezek is working in the commission as observer. He said the  commission accepted the original proposal from the Interior  Ministry because new division would take long.    The elections to the Senate, the not-yet established upper  chamber of the Czech parliament, will take place probably in the  autumn, along with local elections. The commission will now  have to define a mechanism according to which the order of  individual constituencies will be determined, Jezek said.    The order of constituencies, to be stated in a supplement to  the law on parliamentary elections, will be decisive in  determining in which constituencies the senator will be elected  for two, four or six years in the first senatorial election.  The Senate is to have 81 deputies, one third of which will be  alternated every two years.    Jezek said the final version of the list would be known  tomorrow, the first day of the 19th session of the Chamber of  Deputies of the parliament, which will deal with the bill on  parliamentary elections.    The bill sent to the chamber by Premier Vaclav Klaus (Civic  Democratic Party, ODS) provides for a change in constituencies  if the number of inhabitants of a constituency increases or  decreases by 27 percent above or below the average number per  mandate.    In discussions on the authenticity of the bill some  deputies,  including coalition ones, pointed out that the document approved  originally by the government mentioned a 15 percent difference  which better corresponds to the equal right to vote as embedded  in the Constitution.</p>

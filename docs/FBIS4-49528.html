The majority of this machinery is exported to Europe,  North America, and Asian countries, including China.

At the plant's workshop for assembling export equipment, a  person in charge pointed to two sets of paper winders being  assembled and told Li Ruihuan: These machines have been ordered  by China, and they will be shipped to China's Suzhou shortly.  During his visit, Li Ruihuan asked detailed questions about the  plant's production, output value, and workers' postretirement  security.    The (Weimeide) Corporation has maintained close cooperation  relations with China since the 1950's.

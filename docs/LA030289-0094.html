			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINA ANGER GROWS OVER U.S., DISSIDENT  </P> <P> China on Wednesday escalated its criticism of the United States for inviting  China's leading dissident to a banquet in honor of Chinese leaders during  President Bush's recent visit.  </P> <P> A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman described as irresponsible "U.S. official  remarks" made Tuesday and expressed surprise and "deep regret," the official  New China News Agency reported.  </P> <P> Chinese police officers physically blocked astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, China's  most prominent advocate of democracy, from attending the Sunday night banquet  given by Bush. The next day, Bush expressed regret about the police action, and  Chinese officials said they resented the invitation to Fang.  </P> <P> The controversy, rather than settling down, heated up after White House  spokesman Marlin Fitzwater defended Bush against charges that he had failed to  press human rights issues strongly enough while in Beijing.  </P> <P> Fitzwater said Bush's banquet invitation to Fang and a few other critics of the  government had been intended to make a human rights statement.  </P> <P> "I suppose the proof is in the pudding," Fitzwater said, "in the sense that  China today is saying the United States is to blame for the diplomatic row,  which is true . . . which is to say that the President invited dissidents to  this banquet for a reason."  </P> <P> Bush said Tuesday that the Chinese "may have a point" in contending that the  flap might have been avoided if the United States had cleared the guest list  with Chinese authorities. But he said he does not believe that he should have  sought such approval. "I think they understand that," he said.  </P> <P> The Chinese Foreign Ministry, without specifying which remarks had provoked its  anger, responded sharply Wednesday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sees Disrespect  </P> <P> "Before the banquet, without consulting with the Chinese side, the U.S. side  sent an invitation, bypassing the normal channel, to a certain individual  unacceptable to the Chinese side," a Foreign Ministry spokesman said, according  to the New China News Agency report. "This act of imposing one's own will on  others can only be interpreted as support to this kind of people and disrespect  for the host country. . . . We are surprised at the irresponsible remarks it  (the United States) has made now, and express our deep regret."  </P> <P> In recent weeks, Fang, 52, has led a campaign seeking amnesty for political  prisoners, especially Wei Jingsheng, a pro-democracy activist who has served 10  years of a 15-year sentence for producing wallposters deemed  counterrevolutionary and reactionary.  </P> <P> Wei is China's most famous political prisoner, and Fang had expressed hope that  Bush would raise his case with the Chinese leaders.  </P> <P> Fang launched his amnesty appeal with a January letter to senior leader Deng  Xiaoping. Then, in a rare display of coordinated political activism in a  society where dissent is still dangerous, 33 prominent Chinese writers,  scholars and editors signed an open letter last month supporting Fang's plea.  </P> <P> A few days later, a Ministry of Justice spokesman sharply criticized signers of  the supporting letter. He charged, according to the New China News Agency, that  "it is against China's legal principles . . . to stir up public opinion in an  attempt to overturn independent jurisdiction (of the courts) by soliciting  signatures."  </P> <P> Fang said Wednesday evening that he has not been contacted by U.S. officials or  Chinese authorities since Sunday's incident.  </P> <P> Told that a U.S. official had said that the banquet invitation was intended as  a human rights statement, Fang said: "I think this is a good beginning. It  shows they are beginning to take the same standard toward human rights in China  as in the Soviet Union. It's only a beginning."  </P> <P> Since the Sunday incident, he has received many telephone calls "from friends  afraid I would get in more trouble," Fang said, "but right now I am still  safe."  </P></p>

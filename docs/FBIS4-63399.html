			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Alexandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 21 TASS -- Former Vice-President  Aleksandr Rutskoy who was amnestied by the new Russian  parliament some time after the abortive state coup in Moscow  last October, delivered on Saturday an opening speech at the  second congress of the Free Russia People's Party (FRPP) which  he heads.    He called on the party to take its bearings, spurning down  "time-serving positions and timidity" and to become a core for a  broad popular patriotic movement which will take power.    He blasted the mass media, spreading, according to Rutskoy,  "provocative rumours" about his possible withdrawal from the  party's chairmanship and his differences with party members.    "The party should decide who will be its leader to remove  contradictions and rumours, he continued. Rutskoy also insisted  that the FRPP should determine its clear-cut position which,  according to the former vice-president, should concentrate on  striving for early presidential elections and replacing "the  anti-popular police regime".    "A political party occupying a time-serving position, cannot  lead the popular masses," Rutskoy added.    Acting at future elections as a single whole, patriotic  forces will win the victory, he claimed.    According to the FRPP chairman, the aims of a mass patriotic  movement will include national cultural and spiritual revival of  Russia, "restoration of great Russia within the borders of the  Soviet Union, establishment of law and order in the country and  creation of a socially oriented economic system.    The congress is attended by 149 delegates from 60 regional  organisations. The forum will debate several documents,  including a programme-setting statement and several resolutions.    Besides, as chairman of the FRPP board Vassily Lipitskiy put  it, the party will possibly change its name. It regards itself  a social democratic organisation, and some party members suggest  that these words should be introduced into its name.</p>

So far, the P190 antigen derived from Plasmodium  falciparium is reportedly to be the most prospective candidate,  because of the antigen's capability of inducing antibodies to  provide complete immunity to monkey model of human malaria.  Research results indicate that the repeated three-peptide  sequence of P190 antigen, the repeated eight-peptide sequence of  RESA antigen, and the repeated four-peptide sequence of CS  antigen of Hainan strain (FCCI/HN strain) P. falciparium contain  T cell epitope that is closely related to immune function  against malaria infection. These repeated peptide sequences are  believed to be the functional regions responsible for immunity.  Variation of these sequences could be responsible for failure of  human body's immune response to P. falciparium attack. In other  words, plasmodia may constantly variate their repeated peptide  sequences, the hot spots of gene deletion and gene insertion, to  avoid being neutralized by host's immune response. Therefore,  variations should be put into consideration when using the  repeated peptide sequences to develop malaria vaccine.  Researchers believe that vaccine developers should be able to  correct the problem encountered if they study carefully the  variation's nature and mechanism. Results obtained from this  experiment indicate that Hainan FCCI/HN P. falciparium makes an  ideal strain for developing malaria vaccine because of its P190  antigen's conservativeness and bimorphism property. Chinese  researchers are hoping to develop a complete vaccine that is  capable of protecting human beings from any P. falciparium  attack by putting two kinds of bimorphism sequences in one  single vaccine.</p>

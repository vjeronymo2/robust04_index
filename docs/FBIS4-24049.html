			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town June 21 SAPA -- Secret cabinet and  government decisions came under attack from African National  Congress members of Parliament on Monday [20 June] who demanded  a role for themselves in major decisions.    In an attempt to accommodate their demands and defuse a  potential backbencher revolt, the ANC set up a committee to  re-examine the relationship between the government, the cabinet  and the ANC. The decision was taken at an ANC caucus meeting  ahead of a two-week sitting of Parliament called to introduce  the government of national unity's first budget.    A source close to the caucus said MPs had complained about  being left out of key planning -- the siting of a new  legislative capital for one.    ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa will head the  committee. Other members are Trade and Industry Minister Trevor  Manuel, Posts, Telecommunications and Broadcasting Minister  Pallo Jordan and MP Raymond Suttner. The committee will examine  the relationship between Parliament and the cabinet, especially  the practice of cabinet taking decisions and expecting MPs to  fall in with the decision.    Among the proposals was one that ordinary MPs be allowed to  initiate their own legislation, and that MPs be allowed to vote  how they wanted on issues, rather than having to toe the party  line. There was also a proposal that standing committees  reviewing legislation be open to the general public, not just  the media.    The committee would draw up a discussion document, the  source  said.    An early issue that had some MPs up in arms was the question  of a new legislative capital. MPs complained that a cabinet  committee examining the issue appeared to have made up its mind  without consulting them.    The caucus resolved to demand that the four-person committee  be expanded to take in MP's views. The source said the  committee should start its work from scratch.    On the introduction of constituencies to be represented by  MPs, the caucus decided the issue had to be looked at in  conjunction with the role of provincial legislators representing  specific provinces.    Mr Ramaphosa is expected to outline some of the points  raised  by the caucus at a media conference later this week in which he  is expected to deal with the restructuring of the ANC now that  it is in government.</p>

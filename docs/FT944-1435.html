			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Friends Provident acquires LCH London Capital Holdings, the property company owned by Citibank which withdrew plans for a stock market flotation in May, has been bought by Friends Provident, the mutual life insurance company. Friends Provident will merge its Pounds 100m central London property portfolio with LCH's Pounds 240m assets. The new company will be owned 78 per cent by the life insurer and 22 per cent by Citibank. In addition, loans made to LCH by Citibank will be refinanced by Friends Provident, which is effectively buying the assets at a modest discount to market value. Mr Nigel Kempner and Mr Stephen Musgrave, joint managing directors of LCH, have resigned from the company. LCH was formed from the remnants of Randsworth Trust, which was taken private in 1989 at the peak of the market, but subsequently had to be rescued by Citibank. Its portfolio includes a number of well-known buildings in London's west end, including the St Christopher's Place Estate near Oxford Street. LCH's planned flotation was pulled at the last minute because Citibank was not prepared to accept the price at which advisers said the shares would have to be sold. Mr Jeffrey Heintz, managing director at Citibank, said the bank had achieved more attractive terms from Friends Provident than could have been achieve through a flotation.</p>

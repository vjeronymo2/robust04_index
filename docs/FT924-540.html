			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Mixed views on BA news THE announcement by British Airways that it had pulled out of its plan to take a Dollars 750m stake in USAir was expected and the share price shrugged off the news. Traders attributed a net rise of 5 to 307p to the seasonal market, commenting that, at any other time the shares would have fallen. Smith New Court, which on Monday hardened its cautious stance on BA, believes the shares are overvalued. The house suggested that termination of the US deal should have prompted a 20p slide in the stock. Smith said that in terms of BA's drive to be a global player, the planned link-up with USAir was more important than last week's deal with Qantas. However, County NatWest feels that following the recent agreements with Qantas, TAT and DanAir, the proposed deal with USAir might have imposed a heavy financial burden on BA, perhaps prompting a rights issue. Redland strong Building materials group Redland spearheaded a general burst of outperformance of the market by some of the leading building issues, with the stock closing 34, or 8.7 per cent, higher at 424p. The Footsie rose 1.2 per cent. Turnover in the shares reached a higher than usual 4.4m. Dealers said the stock was up and running from the outset, with a number of leading brokers adopting the view that it had underperformed for far too long, reflecting widespread concern about the apparent downturn in the German economy. Worries about the security of the final dividend, expected next spring, were overdone, they said, adding that the group's German business, trading under the Braas name, had performed better than expected during the past couple of months. Holiday wars The two leading quoted air-tour operators in the UK, Airtours and Owners Abroad, lost ground after news that Thomson Holidays, market leader of the package holiday business, had fired the first shots in the 1993 package holidays war. But many leisure analysts adopted a relaxed view of the move by Thomson, pointing out that the Christmas period is traditionally the starting point for special offers from the holiday companies and that the Christmas period sees the tour companies issue the second editions of their summer holiday brochures. Nevertheless, there was marginal disappointment around the market at the price war news, given the bullishness of leisure analysts over the recent deal between Owners Abroad and the German group LTU. Some analysts remained highly bullish of the sector. 'We still view the holiday sector as undervalued,' said Mr Bruce Jones at Smith New Court. Owners declined to 82 1/2 p before closing a net 2 off at 85p, while Airtours closed the same amount down at 275p, having dipped to 270p. Confusion over current year profits forecasts from some brokers and heavy turnover in the market at the outset of trading caused a sharp early retreat in Ladbroke shares. They later rallied to close a net 5 easier at 184p. Turnover of 23m was swollen by tax-related bed and breakfast trades totalling 18.5m shares. Auctioneer Christies International was bid up 11 to 145p on news that the commission charged to buyers at a number of its branches is to be raised by 5 per cent to 15 per cent from March 1. Conglomerate Hanson saw unusually heavy turnover of 15m shares as a two-way pull on the stock left it only 1 1/2 firmer at 229 1/2 p. British Aerospace turnover was also particularly heavy, at 9.9m shares, and the stock was one of the few casualties in a healthy market as profit-takers moved in. The shares weakened 8 to 169p. Financial Times owner Pearson relinquished 9 to 390p following a recent good performance as Prudential announced that it had reduced its stake. The shift from defensive stocks gathered momentum yesterday as most pharmaceutical shares showed early weakness. Only Wellcome, however, remained down on the day, closing 20 off at 978p. Analysts mentioned speculation in the US of a new drug from a rival company to be used with Wellcome's anti-Aids product. There was also a follow-through from weekend criticism by the American Academy of Pediatrics, which said the drug Zovirax should not be routinely recommended for treatment of chicken pox in healthy children. Glaxo Holdings and SmithKline Beecham were off in early trading but recovered later. Glaxo was held back initially by a profits downgrade from BZW. Analyst Mr Jonathan de Pass cut his 1993 forecast by Pounds 30m to Pounds 1.65bn, saying that the company's cash mountain would be hit by currency shifts and new products were not coming through as fast as expected. The shares were down 11 at one stage but ended 2 up on the day at 781p. SmithKline was marginally easier at first. Then, news that the company had reached agreement for the sale of a portfolio of its men's personal care products in the US, Puerto Rico and Canada helped sentiment and the shares closed 11 stronger on balance at 525p. The heaviest turnover (10m shares) in the banks sector was in HSBC London-registered stock, which edged up 4 to 472p. Barclays (4.6m) rose 10 to 384p in spite of BZW increasing its forecast of losses for the current year to around Pounds 110m. Standard Chartered shares closed 24 stronger at 568p on good turnover of 2.5m after the bank said it had sold almost all of its Hong Kong headquarters for Pounds 74m. The infusion of funds would give a significant boost to the bank's tier one and tier two capital ratios, specialists said. Merchant banks raced ahead, with the recent surge in stock market indices and activity triggering thoughts among the institutions of a new year rush of takeover bids and rights issues, all of which are seen as hugely profitable. Merchant banks with marketmaking arms perceived as having performed exceptionally well during the recent burst of buying in London's equity market were in the forefront. Kleinwort Benson forged ahead 16 to 319p on unusually good turnover of 500,000 shares, while SG Warburg appreciated 20 to 544p in relatively thin trading. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (266).

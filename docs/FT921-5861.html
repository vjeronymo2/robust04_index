			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Ex-chief of Eagle Star to advise on mergers MR Michael Butt, who left his job as chairman and chief executive of Eagle Star under a cloud last September after the UK insurer had announced first-half losses of Pounds 189m, has joined London-based corporate finance boutique Phoenix Securities to advise on mergers in the insurance industry. Mr Butt, who spent five years in charge of Eagle Star, said yesterday he expected rationalisation in the industry to generate of mergers, especially in Europe. 'There are too many players with capital spread too widely, backed up by insufficient underwriting expertise,' he said. 'There are 4,000 companies in Europe. We need about 500.' Phoenix Securities was set up by Mr John Craven, now chief executive of Morgan Grenfell, the Deutsche Bank-owned merchant bank, and advised on many of the mergers which reshaped London's securities industry in the mid-1980s. It was part of Morgan Grenfell until a management buy-out in 1990. Mr Butt was involved in the development of the insurance strategy of BAT Industries, the company's parent. BAT acquired Farmers, the Californian insurance group, and Allied Dunbar, the life insurer, in the 1980s and is now one of Europe's biggest insurance groups. Mr Butt says the resistance of existing management has been one of the main factors holding up insurance takeovers and mergers to date. In addition, many potential predators are waiting until uncertainties in such areas as mortgage indemnity, pollution and asbestosis are resolved before they make approaches.</p>

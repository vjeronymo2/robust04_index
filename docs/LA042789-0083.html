			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COVINA CAT MUTILATIONS NOT SATANIC RITUAL;  </P> <P> 2 YOUTHS ARRESTED; 'JUST GOT CARRIED AWAY,' POLICE SAY  </P> <P> Cat mutilations that police thought may have been linked to satanic rituals  have turned out to be the work of two teen-agers who "just got carried away,"  police said.  </P> <P> The youths, aged 16 and 17, were arrested Tuesday after police confronted them  with information they had received from anonymous sources.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Identified  </P> <P> The teen-agers, who later admitted their involvement in the killings, were not  identified because they are juveniles.  </P> <P> "These kids aren't devil worshipers or into satanism," said Covina Police Sgt.  Kim Raney. "They really had no rationale or message. It's just one of those  thing that pops into a kid's head."  </P> <P> The teen-agers told police that they killed about 14 cats and dumped their  carcasses in five locations around Covina.  </P> <P> Raney said the bodies of two cats were cut open and their blood used to scrawl  satanic symbols on a wall. They cut off the tails of 11 cats and saved them in  a box as "souvenirs," he said.  </P> <P> The teen-agers were released to their parents. Their cases have been refered to  the district attorneys office, which will decide whether they will be tried for  cruelty to animals.  </P> <P> The killings were made public last week when police disclosed that they were  investigating the mutilation of several cats whose carcasses were found at the  closed Cienega Elementary School next to a wall that had "666" and a pentagram  scrawled on it.  </P> <P> Reports of the killings shocked some residents and left some worrying about the  safety of their children.  </P> <P> "It's real scary," said Sylvia Magallanes, who lives across the street from the  school. "Even if it is a bunch of teen-agers, if they're sick enough to cut up  an animal, I'm terrified."  </P> <P> Detective Frank Schmid said the teen-agers began killing cats in early March,  when they ran over a cat in the street for fun.  </P> <P> They had no specific reason but began looking for more cats to kill, Schmid  said.  </P> <P> For the next month and half, the teen-agers trapped stray cats and killed them  by smashing them against a wall or kicking them to death, he said.  </P> <P> Schmid said the two argued with other members of a church youth group during a  discussion on satanism. That led them to cut open the bodies of two cats and  use the blood to scrawl satanic symbols at Cienega Elementary School, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Left Box of Tails  </P> <P> "It was an attempt to emulate Satanists," Schmid said. "They only did it once."  </P> <P> After news reports began appearing about the killings, the two teen-agers took  the box of cat tails and left it at the Covina Post Office, Schmid said. The  tails were discovered Saturday.  </P> <P> "These kids were squared-away students. They dressed neatly, played sports and  did well in school," Schmid said. "They just got caught up in things."  </P></p>

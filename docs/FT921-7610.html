			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / International Company News: Consortium buys Pebble Beach golf resort THE controversial Japanese owner of the Pebble Beach golf resort in California, one of the most famous courses in the US, has been forced by financial difficulties to sell out to a consortium organised by Sumitomo Bank. Mr Minoru Isutani, a self-made Japanese tycoon who bought the course for around Dollars 1bn, has had to dispose of it for about Dollars 500m after failing to complete a scheme to fund the purchase by sales of memberships to wealthy Japanese. Mr Isutani bought Pebble Beach in 1990 through a US subsidiary, which he then quickly sold to US investors after the deal was concluded. Mr Isutani is also well known for his ties with Mr Hisashi Shinto, former chairman of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, who was forced to resign due to his involvement in the Recruit stock scandal. Taiheiyo Club, a golf course developer, has joined Sumitomo Credit Service, the credit card company under Sumitomo Bank, to buy Pebble Beach - which will be the site of the US Open golf tournament this year - from Mr Isutani. Mr Isutani's close ties with Itoman, the Osaka-based trading company facing financial restructuring due to its involvement in real-estate-related speculation, prompted Sumitomo Bank, under which Itoman is now undergoing restructuring, to arrange the deal between Taiheiyo and Mr Isutani. Sumitomo Bank will also finance the joint venture in the acquisition. The move comes as Mr Isutani plans to turn the Pebble Beach resort's four golf courses and two hotels - originally accessible to the public  - into an exclusive club by selling private memberships, were rejected by local authorities. The California Coastal Commission's refusal stalled Mr Isutani's plans to repay his main lender, Mitsubishi Banking and Trust. Japan's faltering golf membership market also discouraged Mr Isutani to pursue original plans. Mr Isutani's original purchase stirred criticism in the US as it was seen as another move by Japan to acquire high profile 'trophies' such as Manhattan's Rockefeller Centre and Columbia Pictures. Taiheiyo, which runs nine golf courses in Japan, said it hoped Pebble Beach's name would help the company's reputation. Taiheiyo said it did not intend to turn Pebble Beach into a private golf club, and said it would retain original management. The company, which also hosts domestic golf tournaments, hopes to finalise the deal before the US Open in June.</p>

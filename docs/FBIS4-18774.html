			<p>BFN     [Text] Rome, April 10 (AFP) -- Three Italian aircraft due  to help in the evacuation of foreign nationals from Rwanda took  off from Pisa airport Sunday afternoon [10 April] en route for  Nairobi.    The three Hercules C-130 transport planes of the Italian  armed forces left the military base in the central Italian town  at around 3:00 p.m (1300 GMT), the Italian defence ministry said.    The planes, carrying 24 paratroopers, will participate in  the  evacuation of European and U.S. citizens from the Rwandan  capital Kigali as soon as conditions at the city's airport  permit, the ministry said.    The ministry earlier said it was in permanent contact with  the Belgian and French general staffs, which it said had set up  a centre in Nairobi to coordinate the evacuation of westerners  from Rwanda.    More than 1,000 people have been killed in the east African  state in a wave of ethnic bloodletting which began Thursday.</p>

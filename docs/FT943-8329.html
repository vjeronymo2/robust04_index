			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Fishing row in southern Spain The dispute between fishermen in northern Spain and their European counterparts over the use of drift nets threatens to turn domestic as fishermen in southern Spain say they cannot compete with North Africans in the Straits of Gibraltar without the long nets. The regional government of Andalucia has called on the ministry of agriculture, fisheries and food to regulate the use of drift nets by Spanish fishermen in the straits and help them reconvert their boats for other types of fishing. But fisheries in the autonomous regions of Galicia and the Basque country want Madrid to back a ban on tuna imports and insist that European Union regulations on net-length limits are enforced. EU rules specify that drift nets must be no longer than 2.5 km. Fishermen from Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco are not subject to these rules.</p>

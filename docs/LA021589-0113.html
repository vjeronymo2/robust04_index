			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY CONTINUES TO LEAD U.S. IN MEDIAN PRICE;  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND HOME COSTS SOAR AGAIN  </P> <P> Orange County's superheated housing market led the nation with a median home  price of $231,200 in the fourth quarter of 1988, and other Southern California  metropolitan areas were close behind, the National Assn. of Realtors reported  Tuesday.  </P> <P> It was the third consecutive quarter in which the median price for a resale  home in Orange County topped the list of 62 metropolitan areas surveyed by the  association.  </P> <P> The county also led the nation in price appreciation during the fourth quarter,  with the median price representing a 32.2% increase from the final three months  of 1987.  </P> <P> San Francisco had the nation's second-highest home price at $228,100 for the  fourth quarter, an increase of 29.6%, while the median price in Honolulu ranked  third at $225,000, up 16.4%.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County posted the fourth-highest median price at $191,200, up 24.6%  from the fourth quarter a year ago. San Diego ranked eighth, with a median  resale price of $157,200, up 18.6%. The Riverside-San Bernardino area placed  11th at $113,200, up 16.5%.  </P> <P> Home prices in Southern California -- and especially in Orange County -- have  climbed well above the national norm because of the area's strong economy and  its desirability as a place to live.  </P> <P> The Southland economy has been diverse enough, and family incomes high enough,  to avoid the regional recessions that have caused the housing market to  stagnate in the industrial Northeast and sent prices plummeting in the Oil  Patch states of Texas, Oklahoma and Colorado.  </P> <P> The national median for the fourth quarter was $87,900, up a scant 3.4% from  the same period a year earlier, the association said.  </P> <P> The survey reflects resales of single-family detached homes and does not  include new homes or attached housing such as condos. The median price  represents the midpoint, with half the homes selling for more and half for  less.  </P> <P> At the other end of the survey, Oklahoma City saw resale prices drop 10.1% to  finish in 62nd place with a median of $53,500 -- less than 25% of the Orange  County median for the quarter.  </P> <P> If reports from home shoppers in much of Southern California are any  indication, housing price shock syndrome might well become an ailment  recognized by the psychiatric community.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Many Not Moving  </P> <P> "Almost every person I've had from one of the lower-priced areas who has  inquired about housing prices around here has been absolutely shocked," said  Joan Wilson, a sales agent with Grubb &amp; Ellis Real Estate in Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> "Those who who didn't have to move here because they were being transfered  mostly decided not to come," she said.  </P> <P> For Jim and Dianne Kaufman, there was no choice. He's Lt. James Kaufman, an air  traffic control officer in the Marine Corps who was transferred from Memphis,  Tenn., to El Toro just a little more than a year ago.  </P> <P> When the couple arrived in Orange County, the median price of a single family  home on the resale market was $175,000. There was no way they were going to pay  that kind of price, Kaufman said.  </P> <P> After all, the Kaufmans had been living in Memphis, where a very nice house  could be had for $50,000 or less, and had grown up in Minnesota, where prices  were only slightly higher than those in Tennessee.  </P> <P> "It was a real culture shock," Kaufman said, "and it has gotten worse."  </P> <P> For the past year, the Kaufmans have rented in the El Toro area. They  originally paid $650 a month for a one-bedroom condominium -- comparable to  their $250-a-month apartment in Memphis -- and later moved up to a two-bedroom  condo for $760 per month.  </P> <P> Now, with a year left on his tour at El Toro, Kaufman and his wife have just  about decided to buy a place and are making the rounds with agents.  </P> <P> "I cannot believe the prices," he said. "We're talking about doubling our  monthly costs to buy a condo in the $125,000-$130,000 range."  </P> <P> Although Kaufman said he is likely to be transferred to an overseas post next  year, he and his wife are considering buying a home in Orange County at this  late date because of the area's "fantastic" real estate appreciation rates. He  said that if they buy, they would either sell for a quick profit when he is  transferred or hang on to the property for long-term appreciation.  </P> <P> Nationally, 3.99 million resale homes were sold in 1988, the highest annual  total since 1979's 4.05 million. That was despite rising interest rates over  the past year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Areas Declined  </P> <P> While prices in Southern California posted the nation's biggest appreciation  rates, costs in several Northeastern cities -- where housing prices remain  among the highest in the nation -- showed little escalation and in some cases  posted declines.  </P> <P> Prices in fifth-ranked Boston, for example, rose only 3% to a median of  $182,800.  </P> <P> And in sixth-place metropolitan New York, an area including Long Island and  northern New Jersey, the median dipped 3.6% to $178,500.  </P> <P> "In the Northeast, prices have basically run away from family income," said  John A. Tuccillo, the association's chief economist. "The market is slowing  down there until incomes can catch up."  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING  </P> <P> Median prices for existing single-family homes based on a survey of 62  metropolitan areas for last quarter of 1988.  </P> <P> HIGHEST MEDIAN PRICES  </P> <P> 1. Orange County, Calif.: $231,200  </P> <P> 2. San Francisco Bay Area: 228,100  </P> <P> 3. Honolulu: 225,000  </P> <P> 4. Los Angeles area: 191,200  </P> <P> 5. Boston: 182,800  </P> <P> 6.

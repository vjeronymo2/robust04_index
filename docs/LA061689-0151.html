			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> PLANE HEADS BACK TO JOHN WAYNE  </P> <P> A United Express commuter plane carrying 33 passengers on a flight to Oakland  was forced to return to John Wayne Airport this morning after the pilot of the  twin-engine turboprop noticed an oil pressure warning light.  </P> <P> The plane, Flight 3382, took off at 7:17 a.m. and landed at 7:28 a.m. without  incident, airport officials said.  </P> <P> Kerry Skeen, a senior vice president for United Express, said the passengers  were placed on alternate flights.  </P> <P> "The pilot simply saw an oil pressure indicator light and, for safety reasons,  he did the prudent thing. That's what they're trained to do," Skeen said.  </P> <P> Mechanics at John Wayne Airport were examining the plane this morning but had  not yet found the problem that caused the warning light to go on, Skeen said.  </P></p>

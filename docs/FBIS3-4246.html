The regulations were issued on December 29, 1993.    According to the regulations, all foreign exchange receipts,  except those held by foreign-funded enterprises, foreign loans  and foreign exchange for debt servicing and exchanges in the  hands of individuals, must be surrendered to the state banks and  if they need foreign exchange for import and export and other  purposes, they have to buy it in the exchange market.    The regulations say that foreign-funded enterprises may  retain their foreign exchange receipts. They may sell or buy  them at the foreign exchange swap market.</p>

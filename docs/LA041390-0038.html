			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTI-ABORTIONIST STIRS STRONG REACTIONS  </P> <P> I am pro-life and have known of Susan's work for many years.  </P> <P> I always understood that she had had an abortion in her youth. That is what  makes her such a great spokesman for life. She knew the horror of killing your  child. Because of her past, her perspective was always more authentic. Far from  hurting her, the truth will give her more credibility.  </P> <P> VENEICE WILLIAMS MARRONE, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis said that Cyprus has  taken the initiative for the first time by promoting Cyprus'  accession to the European Union [EU], the unified Greece-Cyprus  defense doctrine, and the Greek Cypriot side's irreproachable  stand at the proximity talks. On the contrary, he added, Turkey  and Rauf Denktas are struggling to escape from the suffocating  encirclement being created around them.    In an address at the Lions Club in Paralimni, President  Kliridhis noted that the Turkish side now opposes the  suggestions by the UN Secretary General and his representatives  for the implementation of the confidence-building measures  [CBM's] on Famagusta. He further said that in January 1995  Cyprus will open talks with the EU for accession to it whether  or not there is progress in the Cyprus issue because of Turkish  intransigence. He also noted that the accession talks will  concern the whole of the Republic of Cyprus. President  Kliridhis is heading for accession to the EU. He added: The  road to accession has opened because the Greek Cypriot side's  behavior toward the CBM's has been irreproachable; this is  affirmed by the five permanent members of the Security Council.    Mr. Kliridhis said that at the proximity talks the Turkish  side did not accept the UN suggestion that the Famagusta area  between the sea and Dherinia, including the road, be abandoned  by Turkish troops and placed under UN control so that there will  be safe access to and from Famagusta. He added that the Turks  did not accept UN administration of the town and demanded a  trilateral administration with the participation of Greek  Cypriots, Turkish Cypriots, and some presence of the  international organization. Mr. Kliridhis further noted that  the Turks also did not accept the schedule for handing over the  town or a series of other UN suggestions.</p>

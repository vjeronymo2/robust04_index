			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Clinton to cut ship subsidies US MERCHANT shipping lines are expected to start reflagging their ships in countries that offer lower crew and tax costs after a decision by the Clinton administration not to extend operating subsidies to ships working under the US flag. According to the Washington Post, the White House overruled a proposal by Mr Federico Pena, transportation secretary, to continue operating subsidies to US shipping companies when current contracts expire in 1997 because they could not be accommodated in the budget plan. Without subsidies the US merchant fleet is expected to dwindle to about 30 vessels plying cabotage routes to US destinations such as Alaska and Hawaii, where US flag vessels are required by law. US flag shipping costs are substantially higher than the world market; recently the Agriculture Department had to find about Dollars 385m in order to get Russia to accept the Dollars 700m of food aid promised by President Bill Clinton. Russia initially had declined the aid because of the cost of shipping three quarters of it on US flag vessels, as required by American aid law.</p>

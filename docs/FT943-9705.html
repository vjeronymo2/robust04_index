			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Ukraine Stirs: Hope rises amid the nostalgia for Soviet past  -Entrepreneurs beavering away in the Donbass In many respects, Mariupol is the typical, botched result of Soviet central planning. Statues of Lenin in heroic poses still grace its main squares, the local telephone network is so dreadful that calling from Kiev is a day-long task, and the grimy yellow substance that comes out of the city's water taps is unfit to drink. But, nearly three years after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the centrally planned economy of which Mariupol was an integral part, a few elements have emerged in this dismal industrial city-scape which point the way to a new future. Mariupol is in the Donbass, Ukraine's depressed industrial heartland which sent communist MPs to parliament in expression of its nostalgia for the Soviet past, but in recent mayoral elections the city voted for a wealthy young entrepreneur who prefers laissez-faire economics to Marxism-Leninism. The Spartak, Mariupol's main hotel, is as grimy as they come in this part of the world, but its rickety balconies are spiky with the satellite dishes of western businessmen who need reliable contact with their headquarters in London, Frankfurt, Milan and New York. Even Azovstal, one of the biggest steel mills in the former Soviet Union and one of Mariupol's main employers, is jousting for its share in the world market rather than settling for the decline which appears to be the fate of most of the Soviet-era factories in the region. In its efforts to adapt to the market, Azovstal, like most enterprises in Ukraine, has thus far found the central government to be more of a help than a hindrance. Mr Oleksandr Bulianda, the plant's director, is not afraid to let the Kiev bureaucracy know exactly what he thinks about its management of the country. When a deputy minister calls on the special, Soviet-era government telephone which looks out of place next to the high-tech gadgets on Mr Bulianda's desk, he launches into a tirade: 'This country is run more badly than a whore-house. At least in a whore-house there is order, here we have total chaos. 'I have metals traders from all over the world begging me to sign contracts with them, but you idiots refuse to give me export quotas.' Last year, Azovstal, which western metals companies rate as one of the best steel mills in the former Soviet Union, exported 1.5m tonnes of steel to customers outside the former Soviet Union. Mr Bulianda expects to export 1.8m tonnes this year, slightly more than half Azovstal's total production. Mr Bulianda's main foreign partners are Germany's Klockner, Italy's Duferrco and two companies that operate mainly in the former Soviet Union, Metals Asia and AIOC. But Mr Bulianda's room for manoeuvre is restricted by the central government's administrative control over exports and prices. 'Fixed prices are a real stupidity,' Mr Bulianda complains. 'The producer will never work at a loss. This system must have been dreamt up by some idiot, we don't even know who.' The restrictions have hit particularly hard at trade with Russia, traditionally Ukraine's main economic partner: in 1991, Azovstal shipped 700,000 tonnes of steel to Russia, this year 70,000, a drop Mr Bulianda attributes mainly to the difficulty in securing export quotas for Russia. Notwithstanding Mr Bulianda's progressive attitude - he is described by the western metals traders queueing at his door as 'one hundred per cent capitalist' and had the foresight to begin purchasing up-to-date western equipment during the dying days of the Soviet Union - Azovstal is not finding the transition to the market entirely painless. Azovstal is operating at only half capacity, which Mr Bulianda attributes to the difficulty in purchasing fuel from Russia rather than to a lack of customers. Moreover, he says, the factory could comfortably lay off 7,000 of its 21,600 workers. But Mr Bulianda ('I guess I'm still half socialist') refuses to sack any. Within the next few months the factory, currently leased by its employees from the state, is to be privatised. Between 30 and 40 per cent of the shares will be sold through a public offering and Mr Bulianda hopes a western investor, preferably one of the companies he already does business with, will buy a large bloc of these shares. Although Mr Bulianda predicts a struggle with the central government over privatisation, he may find his path clearer now that Ukraine has elected a new president and heads of regional government. President Leonid Kuchma has promised swift privatisation and Mariupol's new mayor, Mr Mykhailo Pozhyvanov, is a member of the Reform bloc in parliament, the most progressive political faction in the country. Once an Azovstal employee, Mr Pozhyvanov left the state mammoth to make his own way as a metals trader, founding a company whose turn-over last year was Dollars 150m. Mr Pozhyvanov cheerfully admits that the election of a radical market reformer 'is political nonsense in the communist Donbass', but he sees his victory as a sign that even in this, one of the most conservative regions of Ukraine, the nascent bourgeoisie is maturing into a political elite. If Mr Kuchma manages to implement the reforms Mr Pozhyvanov supports, things will get worse in Mariupol before they get better. But Mr Pozhyvanov is betting that even in the industrial Donbass there are enough factories like Azovstal, and enough new private businesses, to cushion the shock of the painful economic remedies he is lobbying the new government to administer.

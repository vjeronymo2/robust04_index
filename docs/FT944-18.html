			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Outdoors: Safety and security are selling cars - Motoring / Stuart Marshall picks the cars that stood out in 1994 - a year in which speed became less important For the first time, built-in safety and security has started to sell a lot of cars. In the past year, many people have asked salesmen not how fast the car they were thinking of buying would go, but if it had driver and passenger airbags, ABS brakes, thief-resisting deadlocks on the doors and effective intruder alarms. Convenience has moved higher up the list, too. Power-assisted steering has come to be seen as a near essential. I take just a tiny bit of the credit for this. For years I have been nagging away at manufacturers about the need for small inexpensive cars to be as effortless to park and drive in town as large ones. The trend to diesel cars has continued during 1994. True, the rate of climb in UK sales was less steep than it had been in 1993 because in that year it had started from a lower base. Even so, when the figures are published early next month they will show that more than one in five of all new cars registered in Britain last year were diesels. Despite the government's signal lack of enthusiasm for and understanding of diesel cars, their popularity will continue to grow. As pump prices edge towards the Pounds 3 gallon (66p litre), a car that uses anything between 20 per cent and 40 per cent less fuel is its own best advocate. Sensible people find the latest diesel cars are just as enjoyable as petrol cars to drive. Outstanding among the many diesel engines I have driven behind in the last year were the ultra-economical direct injection VW-Audi 1.9-litre and Peugeot-Citroen's new and silken 2.5-litre, both of them turbocharged. Mazda's smooth 2-litre with a crankshaft-driven supercharger had massive pulling power at low revolutions. And BMW's 2.5-litre in-line six-cylinder diesel, also used in the new Range-Rover and Vauxhall (Opel) Omega, was still the best of all. I have lost count of the number of cars I drove in 1994 and, hand on heart, I can say there was not a dud among them. But a few stand out. Peugeot's pretty 306 cabriolet was a joy to drive open-topped in Sinai. The Saab 900 soft top lived up to its reputation as a car for all seasons in Ireland's sun and showers. And Renault launched its Laguna spectacularly in Tanzania; the predatorially-priced and well-equipped 3-litre version made an even better impression on me in Britain than it had on pot-holed African roads. There were plenty of posh, powerful and pricy new cars in 1994. BMW introduced its superb seven-series. Pearl among the latest Jaguar XJ saloons was a sensational supercharged 4.0-litre. Audi's all-aluminium A8 with four-wheel drive and Tiptronic transmission was unrivalled for advanced technology. And the first new Range Rover in 24 years was more refined and luxurious than ever. Two compact and very high performing hatchbacks with four-wheel drive making them easy to drive well, were the Ford Escort RS Cosworth and Subaru Impreza turbo. Fiat's Punto - winner of the Car of the Year Award - and the latest VW Polo brought big car standards of refinement in much smaller packets. So, too, did the new and sleekly good-looking Mazda 323 and more conventional Honda Civic hatchbacks. The joint Fiat-PSA multi-purpose vehicle was car-like to drive, not at all bulky and offered a huge amount of adaptable interior space. And BMW's Compact was good enough to convince me it might persuade existing BMW 3-Series saloon owners to trade-down a little next time and Ford Escort owners to trade up.</p>

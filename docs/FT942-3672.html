			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Making the Union truly pan-European  -Test must be loyalty to shared ideals In 1923, the Bohemian Count Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi wrote in his book Pan Europa: 'To rationalise the European economy we have to create an internal European market. Only that way can Europe achieve high wages, low prices and great turnover.' Already during those chaotic days after the Great War, economic convergence was seen by many as the only means to ensure lasting peace and prosperity. Today a single market exists for the European Union. Additionally, we have created the European Economic Area, by which the single market is extended to the wealthier European non-EU countries. The EU has negotiated co-operation agreements with central and eastern Europe. However, the real question is whether the European Union will some day become pan-European. I believe that the real Europeanism of the 21st century must embrace and extend the values of liberalism, pluralism, tolerance, and rationality throughout the continent. A multi-track Europe is already more a reality than a threat. EU divergences are apparent. It is difficult to see how all the present member states could satisfy the criteria for the adoption of a single currency by January 1 1999. In the Visegrad countries, or the former Soviet Union, the picture is still more fragmented. The EU should be genuinely open to all European nations that share the common ideals of peace and prosperity. The question of when and how steps to enlarge the EU should be taken has to be solved case-by-case. The Union must function efficiently and in a co-ordinated way. Our aim is to promote forward-looking co-operation. Finland's membership of the European Union is a matter of stability and independence. Stability, because Europe needs the kind of stability that only integrated co-operation can produce. Independence, because by joining the EU we can best influence our own destinies. For Europe, Finland's membership will strengthen the EU's role as a political and economic anchor. On October 16, we will be holding a national referendum on EU membership. Under the Finnish constitution, such a referendum is only advisory, but the Finnish government will consider the outcome politically binding. Sceptics must realise that in an interdependent world no nation can survive in isolation. That was also the lesson of the Austrian referendum result on Sunday, which I warmly welcome. To preserve sovereignty, Finland needs a secure, equitable place in the decision-making process that will decide its future. The author is Finland's foreign trade minister and negotiator on EU affairs.</p>

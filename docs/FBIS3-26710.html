All levels of party committees and governments  should take serious account of rural work, show concern for the  peasants' lives, and protect and bring their initiative into  play.    From 5 to 9 February, Wen Jiabao visited some peasants in  poor mountainous areas in Gutian, Pingnan, Zhouning, and Fuan  counties and also held discussions with cadres and masses there  to obtain information about the peasants' lives.    Wen Jiabao said: This year is a crucial year for economic  structural reform. The basic task in rural work is to seriously  implement the instructions of the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee and the central meeting on rural  work, to stabilize the party's policy on rural areas, deepen  rural reform, bring peasant initiative into better play,  stimulate the rural economy, increase peasant income, maintain  social stability in rural areas, and lay a solid foundation and  create good conditions for the smooth implementation of all  major reform measures and for the sustained, speedy, and healthy  development of the national economy.    Wen Jiabao stressed: Leaders in charge of rural work should  always think of the peasants, show concern for them, rely on  them, and do everything for them. At present, every possible  effort should be made to develop the rural economy, increase  peasants' income, reduce their burden, improve social order in  the rural areas, and provide technological information for the  peasants. There is a need to care for the old revolutionary  base, ethnic, poor areas, and disaster-stricken areas and to  help the people there make good arrangements in production and  life.    Wen Jiabao said: As spring farming is approaching, we should  make good arrangements for spring production, help the peasants  work out and implement production plans, organize the supply of  chemical fertilizers, farm chemicals, agricultural machinery,  diesel oil, and other agricultural production materials, ensure  service before and in the middle of production, and strive to  reap a good harvest this year.</p>

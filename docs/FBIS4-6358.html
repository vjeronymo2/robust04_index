			<p>BFN     [Text] Lieutenant General Anuson Kritsanaserani, director  of the Supreme Command Information Office, has clarified the  assertion by the Cambodian Government about support for the  Khmer Rouge [KR] by the Thai Armed Forces. He said this issue  has already been clarified in detail and urged all sides not to  give credence to rumors because doing so could cause a  misunderstanding between Thailand and Cambodia.    Regarding the report that Thai tanks were dispatched to  support the Khmer Rouge, Anuson said it is false. Such support  is impossible and Thailand certainly would not commit such an  act. This is because the world would know if Thai tanks were  really sent to Cambodia, and Thailand would have been condemned  by the world already. Therefore, he assured that Thailand would  never have committed such an act because it is a fact that  nothing can escape scrutiny.    Regarding the report that the Khmer Rouge recaptured Pailin,  Anuson said it has been verified that the report is false and  that he did not know the motive of the report.</p>

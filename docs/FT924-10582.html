			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Bank replies to Bingham report MR Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, last night denied that it was timid in using its powers to prevent bank fraud. He defended the Bank's overall approach to supervision. He was responding to Lord Justice Bingham's report, published last week, into the Bank's role as supervisor of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, the corrupt bank closed in July 1991. The report criticised the Bank for being unaware of the scope of its powers to intervene in BCCI's affairs and wrong not to have taken responsibility for monitoring BCCI's worldwide activities many years before the bank's closure He said that since 1986 the Bank had used its powers under the Banking Act to close 17 unsound banks and restrict the activities of 28 potentially unsound banks. 'These are not the acts of a timid supervisor', he insisted. In a further 35 cases, the Bank had instigated 'remedial programmes' at banks to force them to restructure their businesses or change their management or seek new owners. At BCCI, the Bank attempted just such a remedial programme in 1990, rather than closing it down. Mr Leigh-Pemberton insisted that that was the correct strategy on the basis of the information then available to the Bank. Legislation on environmental responsibilities should avoid imposing liability retrospectively, Mr David Coleridge, retiring chairman of Lloyd's of London the insurance market, said at Guildhall last night. He called on UK and EC legislators to avoid the 'sheer injustice' of imposing environmental liability from past periods in the way that it does in the USA. Mr Coleridge said the financial difficulties of the insurance market in the recent past provided tremendous opportunities for 'insurers who hold their nerve, and are prepared to change their ways'.</p>

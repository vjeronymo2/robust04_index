			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / International Company News: Demand drives Navistar up 95% at operating level Navistar, the US manufacturer of heavy trucks and diesel engines, reported a 95 per cent increase in operating income in the fourth quarter. However, per-share earnings dipped because of a dilutive stock issuance since last year's fourth quarter. Boosted by strong demand for most of its truck and engine products, Navistar reported net income of Dollars 23m, or 22 cents a share, compared with year-ago results of Dollars 22m, or 28 cents. Sales for the quarter rose to Dollars 1.55bn, from Dollars 1.3bn in 1993. The jump in operating earnings, to Dollars 43m in the quarter from Dollars 22m a year ago, was offset by Dollars 20m in charges taken for environmental liabilities at two defunct factories. For the year, Navistar had net income of Dollars 82m, or 72 cents a share, turning around last year's loss of Dollars 501m, or Dollars 15.19. Revenues for the year were Dollars 5.3bn, up from 1993's Dollars 4.7bn. For the 12-month period, Navistar's operating income improved to Dollars 102m, from last year's loss of Dollars 273m. The company reported that a total of 134,200 medium trucks and school bus chassis, and 205,500 heavy trucks were sold industry-wide in North America during Navistar's fiscal year. 'This was the highest level of heavy truck demand since 1979,' said Mr James Cotting, chairman. Based on order trends and other indicators, Navistar is predicting that North American demand for medium trucks and school bus chassis will rise 12 per cent in 1995, to 151,000 units. Its 1995 forecast for heavy truck demand is 205,000 units, about the same as in 1994.</p>

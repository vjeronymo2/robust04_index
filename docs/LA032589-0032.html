			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TWO-DAY BICYCLE JAUNT FOR MS: INDUCING EXPERIENCED RIDERS  </P> <P> Admit it. Until now, your 10-speed or mountain bicycle rides have been limited  to a jaunt along the ocean, generally within pushing distance of a telephone  booth. After all, what happens if your bike -- or you -- break down in the  great back of beyond?  </P> <P> No problem, if your first two-day ride is the MS-150 Bike Tour, held April 8-9  and sponsored by the California Chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis  Society.  </P> <P> The 120-mile ride through the Inland Empire's farmlands and vineyards is  leisurely, family-style fun -- and the $150 (per rider) you need to collect in  advance from friends and sponsors is a lot nicer than giving at the office.  </P> <P> Where else can you find a ride that, for a $30 registration fee, reserves a  power-packed picnic lunch and dinner on Saturday, overnight camping at Lake  Perris State Recreation Area (site of Indian petroglyphs and live music),  breakfast on Sunday and a midday farewell dinner at the Murrieta Town Hall?  </P> <P> Trucks will carry your duffel, tent and sleeping bag out, and bring everything  back, including you and your bicycle. Sag wagons with mechanics aboard and a  first-aid van will minister to flat tires, broken brake cables and sunburns.  </P> <P> For registration, sponsor forms and a fact sheet, write to MS Society, 229 N.  Central Ave., Glendale 91203; or call (818) 247-1361, or (714) 824-0563.  </P></p>

Russia imposed restrictions on flights over Siberia late  last  year causing hefty delays for many Europe-bound passenger  flights from Japan and South Korea.    Airlines experienced delays of over an hour to their  scheduled departures from Narita Airport.    Russian aviation authorities said the flight restrictions,  sent as a formal "notice to airmen" on December 28, were a  safety measure following a deterioration in the reliability of  radio communications equipment and would last until March 27.    The restrictions limited the number of civilian flights out  of Japan and passing near Khabarovsk to a maximum of six flights  per hour, one-third of the previous frequency.    Between 40 and 50 flights use this route into and out of  Narita each day but each was obliged to await clearance from  Russian authorities even if all passengers were on board.    As a result of the negotiations, the restrictions were eased  from January 7, allowing six flights per hour from Narita alone  and resulting in a 50 percent reduction in the average delay to  between 30 minutes and one hour.</p>

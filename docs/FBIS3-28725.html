			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 9 February Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] Yukio Itagaki, chairman of the Japan Auto Parts  Manufacturers' Association (and president of Zexel Corporation),  gave a speech at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan in  Tokyo on 8 February. Speaking about the U.S. demands at the  Japan-U.S. Government talks on setting numerical targets with  respect to procurement of auto parts, Itagaki noted, "business  volume is bound to change depending on economic conditions." He  cast doubts on the rationale for the U.S. Government's rigid  position, saying "the government should not interfere in purely  private business dealings."    He also said "not-externally-forced, voluntary cooperative  relations should be established between Japan and the United  States."</p>

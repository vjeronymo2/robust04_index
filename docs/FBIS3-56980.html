			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS correspondent Vasiliy Golovnin] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, 24 Jan -- Today a representative of the  Japanese Foreign Affairs Ministry called the reports that  appeared in the press about Tokyo deciding to stop humanitarian  aid to Russia "a lie." On Sunday a number of Japanese  newspapers, citing anonymous sources in the country's Foreign  Affairs Ministry, informed that such a step was seemingly  connected with the fact that the Russian population was having  an increasingly negative attitude to "sops from abroad."    In a talk with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, a representative  of the department on questions of aid to new independent states  of the Japanese Foreign Affairs Ministry stated that such  reports in no way corresponded to the facts. According to him,  no changes had been made in the programs of aid to Russia, and  they were all being consistently carried out at working level.  This is also true in full for humanitarian aid to the former  USSR, for which Tokyo has alloted $100,000,000, mainly to  provide medicines.    The Foreign Affairs Ministry representative called the  recently announced auction for Japanese companies to gain the  right to supply consumer goods to Russia within the framework of  the humanitarian aid program evidence of Japan's consecutive  efforts in this direction.</p>

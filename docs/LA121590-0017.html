			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THERE AREN'T ENOUGH DRAVECKYS ANYMORE  </P> <P> It was such a pleasure to read Bill Plaschke's article on Dave Dravecky.  </P> <P> I attended the Priority Living benefit dinner where Dave spoke. There were over  300 people at the dinner who heard Dave emphasize in his talk the very issues  that Mr. Plaschke communicates in his writing.  </P> <P> Since your readers typically are operating with limited time for worthwhile  stuff to read, I applaud your paper and Bill's talent for great journalism.  </P> <P> SANDRA SISEL  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

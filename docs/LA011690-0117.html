			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> MCMARTIN JURORS RETURN, STILL PUZZLED BY CONSPIRACY CHARGE  </P> <P> Jurors in the marathon McMartin Pre-School molestation trial returned to their  deliberations today after a long weekend and immediately expressed puzzlement  about one conspiracy charge.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge William Pounders, who had received a question from the  panel before it retired Friday, called jurors into the courtroom and explained  they could find either Raymond Buckey or his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey,  guilty of conspiracy and acquit the other.  </P> <P> But he did not expand on the explanation, and minutes after the jurors left the  courtroom they sent word again that they had a further question.  </P> <P> They asked how such a result was possible if conspiracy with one or more people  was required to find that a conspiracy exists.  </P> <P> The judge called lawyers for a conference and said he would answer the question  later today. He has said in the past that a conspiracy in this case could  involve one or more unnamed conspirators.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Pounders prepared for the taking of 65 eventual verdicts in the  case. The judge discussed in detail with lawyers the logistics of the courtroom  scene, which he said he expects to be "highly emotional." Pounders said it  would probably take more than an hour to read the complicated verdicts and  agreed to a defense request that he announce the decisions regarding Mrs.  Buckey before he discloses the verdicts for her son.  </P></p>

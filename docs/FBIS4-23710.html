			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Farouk Chotia, Chris Louw, and Mondli waka Makhanya] </F>   [Excerpt] The Democratic Party [DP], still reeling from its  April election disaster, is facing a fresh wave of ructions and  defections in its ranks that threaten the party's survival.    In the past week:    -- It has had to disband its caucus in the Cape Town city  council, it lost a key member to the ANC and will have to face a  challenge from a new coalition being formed to fight the  upcoming local authority elections.    -- In Natal, five Durban city-councillors resigned from the  DP's regional executive committee in protest against the  nomination of Eastern Cape farmer Errol Moorcroft as senator for  KwaZulu/Natal.    -- And in Johannesburg, DP management committee chairman Ian  Davidson was caught in a bruising fight with Premier Tokyo  Sexwale over the destruction of squatter shacks on a cold winter  day. The incident was enough for party stalwart Helen Suzman to  criticise the DP-controlled city council harshly.    These setbacks in three of the DP's strongest regions follow  a bruising in the April election. The DP had hoped to hold the  balance of power in the 42 member Western Cape provincial  legislature but in the end only managed to get three seats.  This led to the resignation of party leader Zach de Beer and  the election of the controversial Tony Leon as interim leader.    It now risks being obliterated in Cape town and Durban when  municipal elections take place in a year's time. "Its white  support base is eroding and they haven't even started making  inroads into areas where most people live," notes one observer.    In KwaZulu/Natal the unhappiness about the election of  Moorcroft as the single DP senator for the province has led to  rumours that the "old boys club" was in action again. It is  suggested that Moorcroft has suffered financial losses through  investments in the Lloyds insurance company and that he had the  active help of DP federal chairman Ken Andrew -- who lost money  in the same way -- to be elected into his position in order to  bail him out. Andrew and Moorcroft are known to be close  friends.    Andrew denied he took part in any "concerted effort" to get  Moorcroft elected. He insisted Moorcroft was chosen on merit,  but admitted that it was he who had suggested to Moorcroft that  he made himself available as Natal senator. He said though it  was true that both Moorcroft and he had lost money in Lloyds --  and that there may be a "fair" overlap in the agencies handling  their affairs -- neither was in financial trouble.

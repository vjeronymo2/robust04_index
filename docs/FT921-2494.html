			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: UAP expands into US with Kember deal UNION des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the largest French insurance group, has established a foothold in the US by extending its relationship with Kemper, the Illinois-based insurance concern. The two have signed an agreement of co-operation which will involve Kemper servicing UAP's clients in the US. The deal represents the French group's first foray across the Atlantic. UAP said yesterday it did not envisage any equity participation with Kemper. The two groups already have a four-year-old European joint venture to service high-risk clients such as nuclear power centres and chemical companies. The agreement comes at a time when French insurers are taking advantage of the problems of their US and UK competitors to expand internationally. Association Generales des Assurances(AGF), which is, like UAP, a state-controlled group, recently ran into controversy over its plans to expand in Germany.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Berlusconi Meets Media Guarantor; </F> OK's `RAI-Saver'"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 3 -- Premier-designate Silvio  Berlusconi, once the hands-on manager of most of Italy's private  airwaves and still the owner of a sprawling media empire, this  evening had talks with media guarantor Giuseppe Santaniello on  broadcasting reform.    Santaniello reported that Berlusconi had shown the  "political  will" to keep in place the end-of-year fee-hiking and  fund-boosting package for cash-strapped public broadcaster RAI  [Italian Broadcasting Corporation]. The so-called RAI-saver has  been a target of abuse from many of Berlusconi's governing  partners, some of whom have called for the entire RAI management  to stand down -- an eventuality Santaniello said had not entered  this evening's talks.    Santaniello said the two men had tied the reform of Italy's  virtual-duopoly broadcasting law -- increasingly invoked,  especially on the opposition benches, after a right-left  cross-fire of bias accusations, and centrist allegations of  non-coverage, during the election campaign -- to the importance  of developing new technologies like cable and satellite TV.    "Berlusconi takes an overview of all these problems, without  taking sides and with an eye to RAI issues also," said  Santaniello.    He would not be drawn into judging Berlusconi's appointment  of three experts to draw up a solution to conflict of interest  problems. Mirroring prevailing confusion on what these  guarantors have been called on to guarantee, he indicated that  they would be proposing a modification of the broadcasting law  -- especially its anti-trust provisions -- rather than  monitoring executive decisions affecting Berlusconi companies.    Also today, the premier-designate met the chairman of the  anti- trust commission, Francesco Saja, pledging to foster rules  of free competition.    Tomorrow the premier-designate will meet banking, chamber of  commerce and shopkeepers' associations, as well as research and  university bodies and the Italian housewives' federation.    In another break with precedent, he will also meet a  delegation representing Italians abroad.</p>

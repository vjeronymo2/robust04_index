			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters responded to our specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request for comments on whether States, adversely affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the repayment statutory provisions of section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1919(h)(3)(D), should have the right to appeal resulting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disallowances to the Departmental Appeals Board (DAB) in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition to appealing a provider's certification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance under part 498. The commenters said that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States should have this right to appeal but believed that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> few States would find it necessary to exercise this right.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree that States probably would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> often find it worthwhile to challenge a decision that had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withstood the test of an appeal in accordance with part 498.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, because section 1116(d) of the Act provides States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a statutory right to reconsideration whenever HCFA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> takes a disallowance, and regulations at 45 CFR part 16  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide States with a hearing before the DAB when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disallowances are made, we agree that appeal to the DAB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be an option for the States. At any such DAB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing, the decision of the ALJ upholding HCFA's adverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action against the provider would, of course, be part of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A few commenters noted that State hearings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will significantly increase, and stated that the regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact statement fails to consider the amount of time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveyors and other staff, including attorneys, will need to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepare for and participate in hearings. They commented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that overall costs for which HCFA must reimburse the states  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be increased.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We recognize that the revised regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expand the initial determinations for which States are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to grant an appeal. However, we have no program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experience upon which to base a prediction of appeal volume  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or costs. There is not even a precedent to follow from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare program, inasmuch as the expanded initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determinations are also new in the Medicare regulations. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anticipate that, in many cases, providers will be able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet the necessary requirements before remedies are to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposed, thus obviating the need for a hearing. Moreover,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we are finding that the percentage of facilities with no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies continues to increase, thereby causing us to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> predict fewer facilities facing some form of appealable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement action than has been the case previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of these factors which may affect the increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of initial determinations that are appealable, we can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offer no valid prediction as to effect on volume or costs of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeals. However, we expect that the informal dispute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolution process will reduce the number (or scope) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse actions that lead to a hearing. Any increased net  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs to States that are found to occur will be reflected in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the budget process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because we are now providing for an informal dispute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolution, we are revising &sect;431.154 (``Informal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reconsideration'') to delete references to SNFs and NFs and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state that_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;If the State decides to provide an ICF/MR with an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity for an evidentiary hearing required by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;431.153(a) only after the effective date of a denial of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation or termination, the State must offer the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ICF/MR an informal reconsideration, to be completed before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the effective date of the adverse action; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The informal reconsideration must, at a minimum,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Written notice to the facility of the denial of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation or termination, and the findings upon which it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was based;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _A reasonable opportunity for the facility to refute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those findings in writing; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _A written affirmation or reversal of the denial,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination, or non-renewal. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

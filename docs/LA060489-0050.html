			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONE MAN'S ART . . .  </P> <P> It is amazing how an "artist" can sculpt, build, paint, or otherwise create  unadulterated junk and then have it acclaimed as "art" by the cultural savants  among us. Such is the case with Sam Rodia's Watts Towers ("Watts Towers: Latest  Goal Is to Save Creator's Details" by Leon Whiteson, May 26).  </P> <P> When I first saw Watts Towers in the 1950s, my reaction was that it was all a  put-on and I couldn't figure out what all the shouting was about. Rodia's  "masterpiece" is one of the biggest and slickest hoaxes of all time. Leon  Whiteson called it right: Watts Towers is made of broken bottles, pottery  shards, seashells and bits of iron -- held together by chicken wire smeared  with ordinary builder's cement.  </P> <P> In other words, junk.  </P> <P> LANNY R.

			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: SINGING THE PRAISES OF THE GIVERS AMONG US  </P> <P> I had a dream the other night that every volunteer in this country,  disillusioned with the lack of compassion, had set sail for another country.  </P> <P> As I stood smiling on the pier, I shouted, "Goodby, creamed chicken. Goodby,  phone committees. So long, Disease of the Month. No more saving old egg  cartons. No more getting out the vote. Au revoir, playground duty, bake sales  and three-hour meetings."  </P> <P> As the boat got smaller and they could no longer hear my shouts, I reflected,  "Serves them right. A bunch of 'yes' people. All they had to do was to put  their tongue firmly against the roof of their mouth and make an 'O' sound.  Nnnooooooo. Nnnnnnooooo. Nnoo. No! No! It would certainly have spared them a  lot of grief. Oh well, who needs them!"  </P> <P> The hospital was quiet as I passed it. Rooms were void of books, flowers and  voices. The children's wing held no clowns, no laughter. The reception desk was  vacant.  </P> <P> The home for the aged was like a tomb. The blind listened for a voice that  never came. The infirm were imprisoned by wheels on a chair that never moved.  Food grew cold on trays that would never reach the mouths of the hungry.  </P> <P> All the social agencies had closed their doors, unable to implement their  programs for scouting, recreation, drug control, Big Sisters, Big Brothers,  YWCA, YMCA, the retarded, the crippled, the lonely and the abandoned.  </P> <P> The health agencies had a sign in the window: "Cures for cancer, muscular  dystrophy, birth defects, multiple sclerosis, emphysema, sickle cell anemia,  kidney disorders, heart diseases, etc. have been canceled due to lack of  interest."  </P> <P> The schools were strangely quiet, with no field trips, no volunteer aides on  the playground or in the classroom -- as were the colleges, where scholarships  and financial support were no more.  </P> <P> The flowers on church altars withered and died. Children in day nurseries  lifted their arms but there was no one to hold them in love. Alcoholics cried  out in despair, but no one answered, and the poor had no recourse for health  care or legal aid.  </P> <P> But the saddest part of the journey was the symphony hall, which was dark and  would remain that way. So were the museums that had been built and stocked by  volunteers with the art treasures of our times.  </P> <P> I fought in my sleep to regain a glimpse of the ship of volunteers just one  more time. It was to be my last glimpse of civilization . . . as we were meant  to be.  </P></p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Forte At last life is starting to look up for Forte. It has clinched the deal to buy Meridien from Air France and seen new management installed at the Savoy. Room rates are finally rising at its London hotels. Group first-half profits are up more than 62 per cent. Disposals have helped reduce gearing to 44 per cent, giving Forte flexibility in deciding how to finance its Meridien purchase. With such a long list of achievements, it is curious that Forte's dividend is unchanged. Perhaps the company does not want to get too carried away with its own recovery story. Competitive pressure remains strong in the UK provinces where higher occupancy has been bought at the expense of lower room rates. That will be slow to improve given surplus capacity in the market. Even the high returns from the expanding Travelodge chain are unlikely to last for ever as other operators flood the market. But the broader reason for caution is that cash flow is not rising in line with profits. First-half free cash flow of Pounds 31m looks unsatisfactory in the context of an annual dividend cost of Pounds 64m. Part of the reason is that Forte is still weighed down by its debts. Interest cover, though rising, is only 2.4 times even without counting off-balance sheet lease charges. Now the recession is over, Forte is also stepping up its refurbishment spending. It seems hotels eat up cash as soon as it flows in. Sceptics always wondered where Forte's cash would come from after it sold its contract catering businesses. It has yet to prove their concern unfounded.</p>

A single fee payment would allow mailing at all bulk or presort rate categories of the corresponding class of mail.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E213.4.3 is amended to change the publishing requirements for Form 3526, Statement of Ownership, Management, and Circulation, generally to allow publication anytime during October of the filing year rather than in a specific issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> P040 is amended both to relax the conditions under which a company permit imprint may be used and to strengthen concurrently the Postal Service's ability both to identify the place of mailing of company permit imprint mail and to obtain information about such mailings. Generally, mailers will be allowed to use a company style imprint without having to obtain permits at two or more post offices, but mailers will be required to show a return address at which records of the mailing will be made available upon request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> P040 is also amended to relax the design restrictions of permit imprint indicia. Generally, the new standards allow for more creativity while retaining restrictions that ensure that the indicia content is readable and clearly identifiable as postage payment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> P200 is amended to set a sunset date for the use of key rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Miscellaneous other changes are made for consistency.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before June 20, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Written comments should be mailed or delivered to Manager, Mailing Standards, USPS Headquarters, 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW., Washington, DC 20260&hyph;2419.

DMM Issue 46 (July 1993) was the first result of that project, but was not intended to make changes simultaneously in substantive mailing requirements; such amendments were deferred for subsequent action such as this rulemaking. This notice focuses on several matters related to the use of permit imprints (for First-, third-, and fourth-class mail) and to the method of paying postage for second-class mail.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. E110.6.1, E312.2.6, and E411.4.0 are amended to standardize the assessment of bulk or presort mailing fees on First-, third-, and fourth-class mail. Existing standards brought forward from DMM Issue 45 and earlier are inconsistent with one another. A single standard applies to all First-Class (and Priority) Mail_that a fee must be paid once each 12-month period by any person or organization entering mail at other than the single-piece rates. Payment of that fee allows use of any presort or bulk First-Class rate and the mailing of both the payer's mail and that of its clients. By contrast, third-class standards distinguish between postage-affixed (precanceled and meter stamp) and permit imprint mailers. Fourth-class presents its standards yet another way. Understandably this variation confuses both customers and postal employees and may cause fees to be assessed incorrectly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revision below amends the standards cited earlier to state them uniformly for all three classes: The mailing fee applicable to the particular class of mail must be paid once each 12-month period at each office of mailing (except as provided otherwise for plant-verified drop shipments) by any person or organization entering mailings of that class at other than a single-piece or nonpresorted rate, regardless of whose permit imprint, precanceled stamp permit, or meter was used to pay postage on the mail; payment of the one fee allows that person or organization to enter its own mail (and that of its clients) at all the bulk or presort rates available in the corresponding class of mail. By this revision, the Postal Service believes that confusion over this type of fee payment should be effectively eliminated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. E213.4.3 is amended to change the publishing requirements for Form 3526, Statement of Ownership, Management, and Circulation. The current standard requires each publisher of a second-class publication to file Form 3526 by October 1 of each year for each authorized publication. The information on that form (or a facsimile of the form) must be published in the first issue after October 1 of the corresponding general or requester second-class publication. Publishers have asked that this specification be relaxed to offer more latitude on the issue in which the information may appear. Because 39 U.S.C. 3685 allows the Postal Service the authority to administer such details as when the form is filed or published, the Postal Service believes it can change those criteria without adversely affecting the informational value of what is published. The Postal Service sees no benefit from retaining a stringent requirement when a reasonable relaxation is sought and supported by the industry. Therefore, the cited standard is amended as shown below to clarify its applicability and require publication of Form 3526 in any issue published during October.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. P040 is amended to relax the conditions under which a company permit imprint may be used and to strengthen concurrently the Postal Service's ability both to identify the place of mailing of company permit imprint mail and to obtain information about such mailings. Current standards require a permit imprint indicium to contain the mailer's permit number and the name of the post office where the permit is held unless, for a mailer having permit imprint authorizations at two or more post offices, a ``company'' style indicium is used. In a company style indicium, the name of the permit holder is substituted for the permit number and post office name. This style is preferred and used extensively by customers who produce large mailings for entry at multiple sites, who may change printers or mailers regularly, who purchase large quantities of envelope stock, or who simply prefer the appearance of the company style over the basic format. Customers who have no need for multiple permit imprint authorizations have noted that it is a pointless burden on the Postal Service and its customers to generate and maintain a second permit imprint account simply to gain access to the company style indicium. These customers have requested relaxation of the applicable standards to let any permit holder use the company style format.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current standards also require that company permit imprint mailpieces bear a complete domestic return address, but do not specify what that address is to represent. Consequently, the Postal Service has found it difficult to trace such mailpieces back to the point of mailing in situations where classification or postage matters have been questioned. Moreover, no remedies exist for instances in which the permit holder deliberately frustrates the Postal Service's efforts to identify the point of mailing, what was mailed, and whether the correct postage was paid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, P040 is amended as shown below to allow use of a company style permit imprint indicium by any permit mailer regardless of the number of permits held. The Postal Service is also requiring more information to document company permit imprint mailings (and mailings including company permit imprint pieces), is specifying the required return address, and is enhancing its administrative remedies when the permit holder fails to supply mailing or permit use information on the request of the Postal Service. No additional record-keeping responsibilities are being added for either the mailer or the local post office. Rather, it is proposed that mailers use the location (the permit holder's or its agent's) at which records for the mailing will be available to the Postal Service on request as the required return address. The revised standards allow suspension or revocation of permits if such records are not provided in a timely manner. The Postal Service believes the higher standards are a prudent administrative control and do not represent an unreasonable condition: each permit holder should be able to detail what was mailed, where, and how much postage was paid, and should have no legitimate reason to withhold such details from the Postal Service. Postal Service actions against fraudulent uses of permits should be enhanced by these proposed measures. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

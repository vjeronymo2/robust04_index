			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Checchi Gets Request for Data: The Department of Transportation asked Los  Angeles investor Alfred A. Checchi for more details about his proposed  $4.05-billion acquisition of the parent of Northwest Airlines. DOT said it  wanted financial forecasts, aircraft acquisition plans and details about debt  financing. A spokesman for Checchi called the request "routine." Checchi plans  to meet with Northwest pilots today to sell them on the transaction, which  involves $3.35 billion in debt. The pilots, the only labor group at Northwest  without a contract, are dismayed with the debt that would be imposed on the  company, which is subject to shareholder and government approval.  </P></p>

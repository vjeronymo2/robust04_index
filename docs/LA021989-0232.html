			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINGING IT TO ANNECY  </P> <P> To know Annecy is to know France's prettiest village -- but getting here, well  ... this was the adventure.  </P> <P> Although barely 60 miles from Grenoble, the trip involved two hours, start to  finish, which doubtless appears odd because the journey was by air.  </P> <P> To explain, the entire episode had to do with a single-engine airplane piloted  by Henri Giraud, who distinguished himself in 1960 as the first flier ever to  land on Mont Blanc. That, one must agree, took an inordinate amount of bravery,  courage, grit, skill and plain ordinary guts, particularly since there was no  airstrip.  </P> <P> This particular day Giraud had decided that we should skim over his beloved  Alps en route to Annecy. To say that he succeeded in tempting fate on this  occasion is a gross understatement. As a matter of fact, Giraud landed once  again on one of the Alpine peaks. Not Mont Blanc this time, and not on a runway  either.  </P> <P> Giraud just flat-out set the little plane down on a stretch of soggy sod  several hundred feet above the timberline, all of which brings to mind that  expression familiar to fliers the world over: There are old pilots and there  are bold pilots, but there are no old bold pilots.  </P> <P> In his case, Giraud puts this notion to rest. Sixty-eight years old, he has  been tempting fate in a flying machine for more than half a century. Not  ordinary flying, I should point out, but daring encounters among mountain  ranges with death dancing at his wing tips. Innocently, I got involved when I  sought a ride to Annecy from Grenoble.  </P> <P> Considering that I happen to be a devout member of the Cowards' Club, it is  doubtful I would have joined Giraud had I known that he intended to demonstrate  his derring-do en route from Grenoble to Annecy. Particularly as well over 100  light planes and more than 50 helicopters have crashed in the French Alps since  Giraud landed on Mont Blanc.  </P> <P> As Giraud puts it: "It is very dangerous to play with the ground."  </P> <P> This occurred to me as he flew hellbent toward an Alpine peak. I assumed  wrongly that Giraud intended to pull back on the yoke and nose over the  fast-approaching mountain. Instead, with Gallic savoir-faire, Giraud set the  plane down on the mountainside in what could only be described as a soggy,  vertical cow pasture.  </P> <P> "That," said the smiling pilot with the shaved head, "takes not only skill but  a love of the mountains."  </P> <P> With a white scarf knotted around his neck, the bald, bold and personable  Giraud brings to mind a French Kojak with the courage of a World War II  Spitfire ace.  </P> <P> At one point Giraud flew within 10 feet of a mountain ledge. One violent  updraft or downdraft and we could very well have become familiar figures on the  other side of eternity. Peaks slipped by under the wings. The plane pitched.  </P> <P> While scanning a slope, Giraud banked sharply. He'd spotted a herd of chamoix  kicking up sheets of snow as they raced for cover on a mountainside that is  eternally covered with powder. Giraud overflew the ski resorts of Val d'Isere,  Tignes, Courchevel and Meribel.  </P> <P> During winter Giraud delivers skiers to peaks otherwise inaccessible. In summer  he flies tourists alongside waterfalls and Alpine meadows carpeted with  wildflowers.  </P> <P> This particular day Giraud flew low over the villages of Le Sappey and St.  Pierre de Chartreuse, and afterward buzzed Albertville, which is to be  headquarters for the 1992 Winter Olympics.  </P> <P> The sky was flawless. The little plane pitched, rose and fell. Other villages  appeared in the folds of the French Alps. At one point Giraud circled the  monastery where monks concoct Chartreuse, the popular liqueur that's sold the  world over. A monk waved. Giraud dipped his wings in a salute. Villages far  below appeared as peaceful as the snow-covered peaks surrounding them.  </P> <P> Gracefully, the plane circled La Meije, a mountain Giraud described as the most  beautiful in all of France. Spotting another herd of chamoix, he cried out:  "Regardez!"  </P> <P> The animals stampeded, setting off a minor avalanche as they fled toward a  forest.  </P> <P> The old pilot smiled. "We fly now to Annecy."  </P> <P> The adventure was over, another was beginning.  </P> <P> Exploring the Old Town of Annecy is one of the joys of a visit to the Rhone  Alps. France's prettiest village, with its narrow canals and cobbled streets  and ancient houses, appears like a Renoir canvas come to life. Swans glide  through the water alongside sidewalk cafes, and small bridges span the  waterways.  </P> <P> Should there be a chill, diners retire inside to cafes and the welcome warmth  of fires and steaming cups of espresso. Otherwise, they remain at tables  alongside the canals, photographing the swans or tossing scraps of bread onto  the water.  </P> <P> The Old Town of Annecy is particularly appealing to artists who set up their  easels along the Quai du Semnoz, Quai Perriere, Quai des Vielles Prisons, Quai  de l'Eveche and Quai du l'Isle.  </P> <P> With brush in hand they capture passers-by crossing bridges that arch over the  canals, and they paint the castle that looks down on the village, appearing as  if it had been created by the Brothers Grimm.  </P> <P> Window boxes profuse with geraniums face other blooms lining the canals. Hand  in hand, couples stroll Annecy's twisting, cobbled streets. (Why, one asks, do  lovers always hold hands?)  </P> <P> It is indeed a town that attracts lovers. For generations, poets have sung its  praises. Rising from the waters of the Thiou Canal, the Palais de l'Isle faces  paths lined with ancient homes. Red-tile roofs and old walls are reflected by  the canals.  </P> <P> Were I young and in love, I would take a room at the little Hotel de Savoie  next door to the 17th-Century Church of St. Francois de Sales. Its entrance is  bright with roses and geraniums, and inside the parlor this particular day a  cat snoozed beside the proprietor who sipped wine and read.  </P> <P> The Savoie is not elegant. The fact of the matter is, it's a trifle shopworn.  But throw open the shutter of one's room on one of the upper levels and, alors,  the scene seems lifted from a Mastroianni movie. One particular corner room  looks down on the Thiou Canal and above to Annecy's splendid old castle on the  hillside.  </P> <P> So it is not pretentious. But it is romantic, what with the view and the  setting next door to the Church of Saint Francois de Sales. This is what plays  on the heartstrings. Besides, at 200 francs per couple, the Savoie is possibly  the best buy in Annecy. (Ask for a corner room facing the canal with its lineup  of amber lamps.)  </P> <P> Pure amour.  </P> <P> The same pair of lovers would do well to take a meal at Restaurant Le Vieux  Necy (3 Rue Filaterie) where timbered ceilings, red tablecloths and candles set  the mood. The candles glow in the shadows of the 10th-Century structure, while  an ancient clock plays melodies at a window facing the Canal St. Dominique.  </P> <P> Next door, Hotel du Coin Fleuri provides more Old World atmosphere.  </P> <P> Others dine at L'Auberge du Lyonnais on River Le Thiou, a setting that inspires  thoughts of romance. Although the meals are moderately good, the proprietor is  a pill. Yes, ill-tempered, if not downright rude. Still, well ... the setting  makes up for his insolence. In addition to the restaurant, this grouchy fellow  presides over an eight-room hotel above the dining room. Try for a room on the  canal. The others face an uninspiring street.  </P> <P> In Annecy, October marks the return of the livestock from the mountains, a time  for celebration when cows, goats and sheep parade directly through the center  of town, all of which calls for a command performance by tourists covering the  spectacle with their Instamatics.  </P> <P> Other action takes place on Fridays and Sundays with open markets at La Place  Santa Claire, with its fountains and brick-lined plaza.  </P> <P> Beyond the fortified gates of the Old Town, with its pastel-colored buildings,  handsome villas and resorts surround the nine-mile-long Lake Annecy. Alpine  peaks look down on lake steamers that carry passengers on dinner sailings.  </P> <P> Other visitors book reservations at L'Hotel de l'Abbaye, which, although it is  outside the Old Town, gets top rating for its service. Four stars at the very  least: ****. Guest rooms are spacious. The menu does justice to the most  persnickety diner.  </P> <P> On this lovers' journey, couples visiting France's prettiest town promenade  along Quai Napoleon III and the splendid gardens of the Champ de Mars. And  should stars get in one's eyes, well, the moment is magic -- so spend it  wisely.  </P> <P> Readers wishing to contact pilot Henri Giraud about excursions can do so by  writing to the flier c/o Aero Club de L'Oisans, Aerodrome Du Versoud, 38420  Grenoble, France.  </P></p>

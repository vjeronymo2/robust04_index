			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Privatisation programme reaches Athens exchange - The market debut of Hellenic Sugar Greece's privatisation programme reached the Athens stock exchange last week with the listing of Hellenic Sugar Industry, the state-owned sugar beet processor. In spite of its small size the flotation has attracted considerable interest, as the first new issue in well over a year. The Dr7.1bn (Dollars 32m) offering, which covers a 37 per cent capital increase and includes a small international tranche, came as the Athens general index was making steady gains after months of wavering. 'It has turned out to be quite a good moment to launch,' said Mr Nikos Tsiros of Alpha Finance, adviser on the issue, last week, and he was right; the issue was 4.3 times oversubscribed. The market returned to wavering for a few days but it got back on the upgrade yesterday, the index rising by 9.65 to 761.59 on selective buying, up 13 per cent since the beginning of this year but still well short of its February peak of 882. Yesterday's June figure for Greek inflation, a fraction better than expected at 15.8 per cent, against 16.4 per cent in May, came too late to affect the equity market, says Mr Stuart Harley of Schroders. The government has privatised more than 70 concerns in the past two years, including a handful of companies already listed on the bourse. But plans to broaden share ownership in Greece by making disposals through the exchange collapsed as the weak financial position of most nationalised companies became clear. Hellenic Sugar, a monopoly producer controlled by the state-owned Agricultural Bank, was an exception. The company's earnings soared in the past two years with the lifting of price controls on sugar. It remains to be seen whether other new issues will follow over the summer. Although the list of Greek companies waiting to go public is lengthening, the market's weak performance over the past two years has acted as a deterrent. While brokers seem confident that the current recovery will continue, there are fears that the flotation of 14 per cent of OTE, the state telecoms company, planned for November, will soak up all available liquidity. Even with 5 per cent set aside for an international tranche, together with another 4 per cent for company employees, the remaining 5 per cent, valued at around Dr32bn, would still amount to much the largest public offering ever made in Greece. In the meantime, Commercial Bank, the second-largest state bank, has postponed the first stage of a Dr50bn rights issue, set for May, without deciding on a fresh date. Mr Nikos Pantelakis of Midland Pantelakis Securities says: 'The OTE offering dwarfs everything that has ever happened on the Athens stock exchange so, naturally, there is some apprehension. But it will give a lot more depth to the market.' In the meantime, the government's announcement of sharper cuts in interest rates on treasury bills, already declining by a quarter-point with each new issue, is likely to send funds back into the stock market. With the savings deposit rate down to 17 per cent, less than one percentage point above the current inflation rate, small investors are starting to return to equities. While company results for 1992 were mixed, construction groups, expected to benefit from increased inflows of EC funds for infrastructure projects, have greatly outperformed the market. Mechaniki, a leading contractor, is up 56 per cent. Alcatel Greece, which recently started producing fibre optic cables for submarine use, is up by 63 per cent. Banks have also outperformed the market, by an average of 18 per cent this year. They are led by Ergobank and Credit Bank, the two largest private banks, which had a good first quarter. However, the average price/earnings ratio is still only 11, and on that basis Greece looks cheaper than other emerging markets. Foreign investors have been returning to Athens as a result. Mr Alexander Moraitakis of Nuntius Securities says: 'What we are seeing is international fund managers buying into Greece again. Funds are coming out of Istanbul, for example, which is now a very expensive market, and moving here.'</p>

			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Swiss negotiators confident IMF board seat within reach SWISS finance ministry officials remain optimistic about completing the formation of a group within the next few days that would be large enough to claim a seat on the board of the International Monetary Fund. The ministry had hoped to complete negotiations with potential partners by the end of last month, but was unsuccessful. The group must be formed before the next meeting of the IMF rules committee, expected to take place during the last week in August, if it is to have a chance of claiming a seat this year. Switzerland applied to join the IMF and World Bank last May after a national referendum approved the move. The country's eagerness to gain a seat on the board has irked some other members who fear being displaced. Also, the US has strongly opposed increasing the number of seats to accommodate the Swiss. The Swiss finance ministry this week denied claims in the Swiss media that it had offered to pay the SFr54.8m (Pounds 21.7m) IMF subscription fee of Tajikistan in return for the former Soviet republic joining its group. It said no secret payments would be offered. The ministry confirmed that Switzerland was among a number of western countries that had been asked to give or lend money to help former Soviet republics pay their dues to the World Bank. Switzerland was currently considering lending between SFr800,000 and SFr1.5m to those countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States which wished to be members of the Swiss group. Turkey and Poland are among other countries Switzerland is said to be courting.</p>

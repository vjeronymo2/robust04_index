			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DUARTE STUDIES FOAM CONTAINER BAN;  </P> <P> FAST-FOOD PACKAGING MADE WITH OZONE-DEPLETING CHEMICALS TARGETED  </P> <P> Concerns about the environment and the shortage of landfill space have prompted  the city to consider banning plastic foam containers, primarily in fast-food  packaging.  </P> <P> Containers made from polystyrene are a familiar sight at fast-food restaurants  and in grocery stores. But the substance is non-biodegradable and cannot be  recycled as easily as paper.  </P> <P> A more urgent problem, according to Terry Fitzgerald, Duarte's environmental  consultant, is that the most commonly used form of polystyrene is made with  chemicals -- chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs -- that deteriorate ozone in the  atmosphere.  </P> <P> The ozone layer protects the Earth from the sun's ultraviolet rays. A weakened  ozone shield would allow more of the radiation to penetrate the atmosphere,  creating a potential health hazard and threatening the environment with what is  called the "greenhouse effect."  </P> <P> Within the last year, Berkeley, San Franciso and Los Angeles have banned the  use of polystyrene made with CFC, targeting restaurants and take-out  restaurants in particular, Fitzgerald wrote in a report to the council. The Los  Angeles ban will take effect July 1.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $500 Fines  </P> <P> The Duarte Council last week asked staff to prepare an ordinance similar to the  Berkeley law, which went into effect on Sept. 1. That ban could result in  $500-a-day fines for violations.  </P> <P> A second Berkeley ordinance, which will take effect in 1990, bans all  restaurant use of polystyrene containers, regardless of how they were  manufactured.  </P> <P> That law encourages merchants to ensure that at least 50% of their take-out or  prepared fast-food packaging be recyclable, and requires that fast-food  restaurants provide separate containers for recyclable packages.  </P> <P> "We wanted to see how their ordinance worked, whether merchants were able to  get hold of alternatives," Fitzgerald said.  </P> <P> In the last few years, manufacturers of polystyrene have voluntarily been  trying to eliminate the use of CFCs, Fitzgerald said. A new form of polystyrene  that recently became available reduces the threat to the ozone layer by 95% and  is competitively priced, Fitzgerald said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Paper Alternative  </P> <P> Turning to paper as another alternative would be more expensive and could raise  consumer prices by 5%, Fitzgerald said.  </P> <P> But "in terms of landfill costs, it would be a savings to society," said  Councilman John Fasana, who favors banning all use of polystyrene. A  comprehensive ban would also make enforcement easier because it is difficult to  determine which form of polystyrene was made with CFC, he said.  </P> <P> Mayor Pro Tem Tery Michaelis, who wants to ban only polystyrene made with CFC,  said the Berkeley law "seems a bit restrictive to the fast-food places. I'm a  little sensitive about legislating everything."  </P> <P> Fitzgerald said she is researching the alternatives that might become  available.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHERIFF GAVE DRUG MONEY TO PUBLIC AGENCIES  </P> <P> Sheriff John Duffy provided more than $60,000 in seized drug proceeds -- which  he had deposited in a secret checking account -- to government agencies,  according to a summary of the account released Wednesday under court order.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Harrison Hollywood, who had ordered Duffy on Tuesday to  turn over the more than $1 million left in the account, ordered the sheriff  Wednesday to explain during a hearing how he had spent the money.  </P> <P> Almost all of the $61,802 went to the district attorney's office for its  participation in drug busts and to various city governments that contract with  the Sheriff's Department for service and are entitled to share in the proceeds  from drug raids.  </P> <P> Duffy also spent $5,400 for an attorney to defend himself in a civil lawsuit,  according to the summary. County auditors warned Duffy in June that spending  drug money for attorneys was improper when they discovered that he paid nearly  $70,000 earlier this year to the same law firm for work on the suit.  </P> <P> The county's sheriff for 20 years, Duffy did not seek reelection. His last term  has been marked by continual controversy. He has feuded with the Board of  Supervisors for months over who controls money and property seized in drug  raids.  </P> <P> Duffy had control of the money until July, when supervisors voted to usurp his  spending authority. Duffy had wanted to spend $450,000 on laptop computers for  his department. The supervisors wanted the money spent on security measures at  the jail in Chula Vista.  </P> <P> Duffy lost the battle, but decided he would not let county supervisors  determine how the money was spent. In September, he opened the secret account  with the San Diego office of Security Pacific National Bank.  </P> <P> Duffy wrote 15 checks, mostly to the district attorney's office and to the  cities of Vista, Encinitas, Poway, Lemon Grove and San Marcos, governments that  contract with the Sheriff's Department and share in proceeds from drug busts.  </P> <P> Duffy wrote a check Tuesday for $1,044,429, the entire amount left in the  account, which Harrison had ordered him to deposit in a court-controlled trust  fund.  </P> <P> Harrison has asked retired Superior Court Judge William Yale to mediate the  dispute involving Duffy, the supervisors, the county counsel and the  sheriff-elect.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu </F> by Ryszard Malik; place and date not given: "A Need for a True  Picture"]    [Text] [Malik] Mr. Minister, you are one of the first  representatives of the Romanian Government to have come to  Poland since the time of the historic changes which took place  in our country five years ago. Does this represent any change  in Polish- Romanian relations?    [Melescanu] I would not say that it is a change; it is  rather the continuation of the traditional links of friendship  and solidarity which have existed between our countries for  centuries. We share the same fate in the center of Europe; we  have faced similar problems; we have fought -- often together --  for survival, to maintain our national identities, and we have  ensured peace and security in Europe. Our solidarity remained  -- even during the fight against the invader; let me, for  example, recall commendable measures taken by Romania at the  beginning of World War II, after Poland was invaded. The need  for cooperation between our two countries today is more than  obvious. We have the same goals: reform, democracy, integration  with European and Euro-Atlantic structures. Our cooperation,  even coordination of efforts, can only be beneficial to us and  it can only bring us success. At the same time, we can be  significant forces of stabilization in the center of the  continent.    [Malik] Romania -- this is at least the impression that we  (here in Poland) received -- lagged a little behind on the road  of transformations and reforms which were taking place in the  postcommunist countries. The same can be said about  international relations. What is the situation now?    [Melescanu] First of all I would like to briefly explain the  reasons why I believe that the delay that you have mentioned has  an objective aspect; however, it is also a matter of perception.    As is known, Romania was governed in the 1980's by one of  the  strictest totalitarian regimes. The deeply repressive character  of the communist regime did not allow progressive movements,  similar to the Polish "Solidarity," to develop. Therefore, it  was only possible to overthrow the dictatorship in a mass  outbreak of social unrest, not through a gradual linear  transformation.    The transformations, which in Romania were taking place at  an  accelerated pace, without any division into stages through which  other post-communist countries had gone, were radical. Their  incredibly broad range inevitably resulted in social  dissatisfaction, which was very visible in the first phase of  the transition period. These social movements were received  abroad as an expression of social opposition to the ongoing  transformation process, whereas in reality, they were the result  of reform -- reform that was bold and indeed difficult.    I would also like to add that as a result of the complexity  of the problems caused directly by our great involvement in the  reforms, in 1990 and 1991 we forgot that our situation must and  should be explained so that people abroad would know about our  achievements and the steps that we were making toward democracy  and the market economy; I even mean those steps of which the  effects are only now beginning to be felt.    As opposed to many other areas, industrial production for  instance, in politics facts do not speak for themselves. In  other words, the image of Romania abroad was incomplete and  therefore distorted. I will not condemn all those people who  have contributed to the creation of this not-very-praiseworthy  picture of Romania in that period, because we ourselves  relegated the policy of reporting about the purposes of our  efforts as well as about the positive results achieved on the  road of transformations.    Your question also implies in a subtle way that there has  been a change in perception. There existed a need to define the  true picture of Romania, to correct subjective interpretations,  and this is exactly what is happening. It is apparent not only  to the Romanian minister of foreign affairs, but also -- I am  convinced -- to the public at large.    The evaluations of certain international establishments  today, such as that of the World Bank for instance, confirm the  considerable progress that has been achieved in Romania on the  road toward reform. I do not want to quote any statistical  data. It is undeniable, however, that in 1994, considered to be  the year of mass privatization, Romania already registered a  drop in inflation along with perceptible trends in stimulating  the national economy.    It is important to stress that the geostrategic position of  Romania, its prospects, natural resources, and potential have  all given it an important and responsible place in the world's  political life. I am thinking, of course, about our striving  toward Europe, which we are sharing with Poland and which has  been confirmed by many documents of the European Union [EU];  however, I am also thinking about the vicinity of the  conflict-stricken territory of former Yugoslavia. The  priorities of foreign policy place Romania in the European zone,  but they certainly do not in any way confine its activities to  only this.    [Malik] The Romanians boast of their heritage, which can  be traced back to Latin civilization. Some Poles associate  Romania with the sight of Romanian Gypsies begging on the  streets of Polish towns and cities. How do you, as head of the  diplomatic service, see the place of your country in Europe and  the world?    [Melescanu] Yes, that is true, the entire nation is proud of  its origin and of its history. Let me repeat well-known facts:  the Romanians are proud to stress their Latin origin, the fact  that, despite various developments, they have retained their  identity on the land of their fathers. Our nation has survived  as a real island of Latin culture right in the middle of a  Slavic sea. You have mentioned Poles, who associate the image  of Romania with Romanian Gypsies. I am certain, however, that  even more Poles know our country better -- I am now thinking  about those of them who have had some contacts with our culture,  about hundreds of thousands of your countrymen who have visited  our country. Their picture of Romania should not be that much  deformed.    Current economic difficulties are bound to be overcome and  Romania will be able to quickly regain the prestige and the  place that it deserves, thanks to its European vocation.    [Malik] Bucharest has been very active on the political  scene lately. Can you specify when Romania will become an equal  member of the EU or West European Union [WEU]?    [Melescanu] I am convinced that my words will be interpreted  correctly if I say that the Romanian diplomatic service is  evaluated as active, constructive, and realistic. Bucharest is  increasingly mentioned as a center that organizes international  meetings; increasingly more is also being said about the  presence of the Romanian diplomatic service in the regional  arena -- both in Europe and around the world. These aspects are  not at all new; they have simply become more visible recently  because they have ceased to be obscured by prejudices and by the  not-really-true picture of Romania. Again, what should be done  is to recognize the existing state of affairs rather than  organizing a diplomatic offensive.    Aside from that, as you know, integration with the European  and Euro-Atlantic structures is one of the priorities of  Romania's foreign and security policy. The recently observed  development of the situation in this area has confirmed that  this integration is not merely a theoretical striving or a  remote goal.    If, on the one hand, one takes into account recent  initiatives aimed at preparing our states to become an  inalienable, stronger, and more stable part of the extended  Europe -- the "Partnership for Peace," association with WEU, the  Hurd-Andreatta initiative, the Pact on Stability, and on the  other hand, the progress that Romania has made on the road of  reforms, then I believe that this provides foundations to give  an optimistic answer.    We can believe, therefore, that integration with the EU  might  be put into effect toward the end of this century and that this  will be accompanied -- quite logically -- by simultaneous  integration with the WEU. These predictions, justified by our  research, should not be interpreted as an attempt to  underestimate the various problems that still exist.    I am convinced that the title of full EU member will be the  confirmation of the state of affairs. This statement is  entirely justified by the fact that the EU is going through a  process of creating, along with us -- the associate-member  states -- their foreign policy and a policy of joint security,  which will go considerably beyond the borders of the EU, before  our de facto integration takes place. In my opinion, this is  what is going to determine the continuation of European  integration. This will also make it easier for our countries to  come closer together. This is one more argument that supports  my evaluation.    [Malik] Not far from Romania, the tragedy of the former  Yugoslavia is going on. What is the position of Bucharest on  the conflict between Serbia and Croatia, not to mention Bosnia?    [Melescanu] First of all, I do not think that this is a  conflict between Serbia and Croatia or Bosnia. Of course, the  problem of Kraiina remains unresolved; however, the present  situation does not pose the risk of direct armed conflict. As  far as Bosnia is concerned, ethnic communities are fighting  there in direct confrontation of civil war.    Romania has all along been in favor of resolving this  conflict by political means, of providing a resolution that  would be acceptable to all parties; the first step should be to  stop the bloodshed. This is the only way to ensure lasting peace  in the region. For this very reason we are happy about the  recent, albeit temporary cease-fire. It is very important for  the United Nations, EU, United States, and Russia to arrive at a  joint position on the Bosnian issue. Thus, I am an optimist and  I believe that thanks to joint efforts by international  communities, we will soon be able restore peace there.</p>

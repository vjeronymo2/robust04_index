			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Slovak premier calls for early poll Mr Vladimir Meciar, Slovakia's prime minister, has called for early elections and the resignation of two senior government members in a weekend offensive against his opponents. Fighting off opposition calls for his own resignation and the appointment of a transitional government, Mr Meciar said a general election before the summer would be 'the most honest solution' to the crisis dividing his government. The last general election was in June 1992 and the next one is not due until 1996. Legislation, including an important new bill on privatisation, is blocked by parliament, where the ruling coalition between the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), led by Mr Meciar, and the right-wing Slovak National party (SNS), is in a minority following defections. Speaking after a special meeting of the HZDS national board on Saturday, Mr Meciar called for the resignation of Mr Roman Kovac and Mr Jozef Moravcik, respectively deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister, following their support for moves to replace the government by a broad coalition including non-partisan experts. Both ministers are HZDS members. Mr Moravcik said he would not resign. The meeting was prompted by the creation last week of an Alternative of Political Realism faction by 10 HZDS deputies opposed to Mr Meciar. The prospect of an early general election was welcome by the left-wing Party of the Democratic Left (SDL), successor to the former Communist party, which is level with the HZDS in opinion polls.</p>

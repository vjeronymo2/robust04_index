Churyumova and S.G. Dovbysh, All-Russian </F> Scientific Research Institute of Railroad Transportation; UDC  621.7.044:625.143.4]    [Abstract] A technology of local hardening has been  developed for the purpose of increasing the fatigue strength of  railroad tracks in the vulnerable zone of bolt holes, namely by  treating the quenched high-carbon M76 steel (0.71-0.82%  C) rail  steel with a detonation wave. In the experimental stage shock  waves were generated by detonation of friable explosives  (cyclonite, ammonite) and plastic explosives (seismoplast), the  fuse cord passing axisymmetrically through the center of the  bolt for either unilateral or bilateral hardening. Hardening  tests were performed on 600 mm long rail segments with one  drilled bolt hole 65 mm in diameter. Subsequent fatigue tests  were performed in a TsDM-200/400 hydraulic vibrator under a  cyclic flexural load alternating at a frequency of 5 Hz with a  700 kN amplitude and a 0.1 asymmetry index. The test base for  the endurance limit was 2x10[.sup]6[/] cycles, cracking  around the bolt hole in unhardened control specimens having  begun already after 2x[.sup]5[/] cycles. Metallographic  examination was performed under an MIM-8 optical microscope and  in a ``Camebax'' microanalyzer. An analysis of the results  indicates that there does not exist a one-to-one dependence of  the rail life on the thickness h and/or the microhardness H of  the thus hardened layer, but that the fatigue strength depends  inversely on the hardenining gradient G= dH/dh: more uniform  hardening (smaller gradient) results in a higher endurance limit  and thus a longer life of bolted rails. A set of metal in excess  of 0.3% evidently causes both microcracking and  macrocracking.  Optimum hardening with minimum roughness of the hole edges was  attained by simultaneous bilateral detonation of seismoplast  with a fuse cord. Figures 5; tables 1; references 8.</p>

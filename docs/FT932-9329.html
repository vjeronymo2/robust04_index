			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Backing for terror insurance measure MPS LAST night signalled that terrorist attacks would not be allowed to wreck the operations of commerce and industry as the Reinsurance (Acts of Terrorism) bill cleared all its Commons stages in just over three hours, Ivor Owen writes. Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said that even with the latest increases, insurance premiums still represented a very small proportion of total business costs and were good value overall. He said the typical extra terrorism premium on a city-centre office block insured for Pounds 10m would be Pounds 8,000 a year  - and the maximum would be Pounds 12,000 a year. Mr Hamilton confirmed that the bill, an enabling measure, would give effect to the draft agreement establishing the Pool Reinsurance company.</p>

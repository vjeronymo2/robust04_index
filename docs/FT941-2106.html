			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Jersey (9): Special relationship negotiated - Jersey remains enthusiastic and confident about the arrangement, seeing far more advantages than disadvantages / Links with Europe When the UK entered the European Community it negotiated a special relationship with the community for Jersey and its other two Crown dependencies, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. The islands are not full members but under the arrangement their traditional right of free trade in manufactured and agricultural goods with the UK is extended to all EU countries. But they retain their fiscal autonomy and their long-established right to self government. They are outside the EU with regard to free movement of people, free trade in services and fiscal harmonisation. EU directives on taxation do not apply to Jersey which has no valued added tax, and is treated as a third country in this respect. Jersey remains enthusiastic and confident about the arrangement, seeing far more advantages than disadvantages. Mr. Colin Powell, chief adviser to the States, says: 'There are inevitably pluses and minuses with any arrangement of this nature, but it is considered that the pluses continue to heavily outweigh the minuses. As far as Jersey is concerned there is no pressure for any change in the relationship - the arrangement continues to be seen as the best option for the island.' But the island keeps a close watch on movements within the EU and retains a law firm in Brussels as its adviser. Senior Jersey politicians and executives make annual visits to Brussels and twice-yearly visits to the UK Home Office for discussions about Europe. Senator Reg Jeune of the Policy and Resources Committee, a Jersey politician for more than 30 years, says: 'Nobody feels we should change from the decisions made years ago; our position has been a fortunate one. 'It will be a long time before Europe really gets its act together and it will be a looser monster than first thought. It helps us that it is not so tight. But there will be problems for the island and we have to constantly keep our finger on the pulse.' Senator Jeune explained that islanders felt more offshore Europe than offshore UK. While he acknowledges that Jersey fund managers would like easier access to Europe, he does not see any real hindrance to the island's finance industry in general by not being a full member state. 'Providing we keep our nose clean and put in place all the laws for a respectable finance industry,' he added. Mr. Clive Barton, senior partner in the Jersey office of accountancy firm Moore Stephens, said: 'Jersey's finance industry sees Europe as a large market for the island, and an area of work that will grow. The island's authorities have been travelling to introduce themselves to the European market. 'However, we might miss out because we have no tax treaties with Europe and a lot of European advisers are heavily into treaty shopping.' Mr. Barton said his firm had dealt with substantial trusts and their accompanying bank balances for a number of Europeans who view Switzerland as less attractive. 'There is a lot of high net worth private trust business to be done there. It appeals more than a Swiss bank account, where difficulties may be encountered in claiming money after the account holder's death.' He said the island's lack of VAT caused a problem for European companies trading with another European country and wishing to dog-leg the transaction through an offshore company. He usually recommends the Isle of Man, which does have VAT, for these purposes. 'But this is not a reason for Jersey to institute VAT,' he added. The island's agricultural industry remains the area most affected by the EU. Mr. Powell said: 'While the industry had ensured access to its traditional UK market, with the accession of the UK to the EC that market was opened up to competition from producers in the member states. That competition was increased further with the subsequent accession of Spain and Portugal to the community. 'The island is obliged to comply with European rules on hygiene and production regarding produce it sells to the UK or other European countries. However it is not obligatory for the island to implement directives if no trade is to be undertaken.' But Jersey's small fishing industry - with a total annual catch valued at Pounds 4.5m - has run into problems. Jersey boats traditionally land catches in both the UK and France. But French fishermen have interrupted market access to their country by blockading ports. The last such incident was only a few weeks ago. Jersey has only a three-mile territorial water limit, but it is attempting to get this extended to a six-mile exclusive fishing limit around its coast. It is also negotiating with France to replace the old agreements on access. Senator Jeune says: 'We are trying to have much more contact with France, as our nearest neighbour. It is sad about this latest fisheries incident because it could strain the relationship.'</p>

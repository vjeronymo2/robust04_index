			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy, by Aleksander </F> Geryn, identified via screen caption, in Warsaw, from the  "Sejmograph" program; date not given--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Geryn] Mr. Speaker, almost six months have  passed since the second-term Sejm started work. Many people  have begun to refer to this Sejm as a kind of a legislative  voting machine--there are not enough fireworks, there is not  enough friction. To cut a long story short, they say that this  is a boring Sejm. Do you agree with that opinion?    [Oleksy] I certainly do not agree with it. It depends on  the particular idea of the Sejm that each of us has. One can  say that the previous Sejms were a greater source of joy to the  viewers and various observers because there really were many  clashes. Even when they were about insignificant issues or  so-called substitute subjects, they provided certain dynamics,  the dynamics of disputes, quarrels, arguments. Well, this is  definitely much more pleasurable to watch than the monotony of  solid legislative work. [passage omitted]    The Sejm is always some kind of theater; however, what  should  be taken care of is that this role of the Sejm is not its  leading role, just as it used to be in the past. It so happens  that the Sejm primarily works as the supreme organ of the  legislative authorities; it defines the law, fulfills the  controlling function; it watches the government, discusses  reports prepared by the Supreme Chamber of Control, statements  by the Constitutional Tribunal, and, finally, it passes laws in  the complex legislative procedure. I believe that people who  observe the work of this Sejm for a longer period will admit  that there is less theatrical behavior, so it is perhaps not so  interesting.... [Oleksy pauses] Well, but I must say that,  actually, as far as some issues are concerned, this Sejm has  already witnessed several heated discussions. [passage omitted]    [Geryn] Let me now return to the issue of theatrical  behavior. Indeed, the deputies themselves are more quiet, as it  were, and the debates are held relatively quietly as well.  However, there is some friction, which seems quite  considerable, between the Belweder and the parliament. Right  now this conflict seems to be dying down a bit. However, this  is characterized by some fluctuation: At one point there is a  conflict, then it dies down. Nonetheless, people who observe  the political scene in Poland believe that a conflict does exist  there. Can you confirm this?    [Oleksy] No, I cannot. I think that this opinion is based  on one or two incidents. There is no antipresidential or  anti-Walesa atmosphere. Because this is true, which I know for  sure, there is no reason for great friction. However, it  sometimes happens that the president in enthusiasm uses phrases  that concern the entire Sejm and are not really complimentary to  it; of course, I do not want praise from the president. What I  mean is a certain extremity in the president's interpretations  of situations that are usual in the Sejm. Let us take the  example of rejecting the presidential bills; this may happen  more than once, and it happens not only to presidential bills.  The parliament's task is to evaluate and discuss a bill and  then make a decision in a ballot. Now, if the president makes a  rapid, public evaluation and generalizes a given issue and thus  issues an overall evaluation of the Sejm, it certainly may  resemble a conflict, but there is no such conflict. I only fear  that, as we draw closer to the presidential campaign, we may  more and more often hear such sharp, firm, tactical statements;  however, I would not like to see this occur.    [Geryn] Immediately after being elected speaker of the Sejm,  you said: I am open to contacts with the extraparliamentary  opposition, with the parties that lost in the elections last  September. What does this look like in practice?    [Oleksy] In practice it looks quite miserable because my  genuine political offer was treated by most extraparliamentary  groupings as some kind of a game, tactics, as the parliament's  attempt to legitimize itself, which, really, the parliament does  not need. I would like to say that this is a bad approach. I  think that this is detrimental to a dialogue in the state--a  dialogue about essential issues, which is really needed. I  think that the ideas that came up as a result of a lack of  readiness to cooperate in the creation of the Constitution...  [Oleksy pauses] I think they are not likely to be successful.  They will only obscure the picture of some kind of joint  thinking about the Constitution. I will say once again that the  political offer of opening the Sejm to cooperation with  extraparliamentary groupings is still a valid offer; however,  the response to it is next to none.</p>

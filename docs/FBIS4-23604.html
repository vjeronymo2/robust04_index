			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Following the incidents in (Musaga) and Bwiza,  the mayor of Bujumbura township, Mr. Leonce Sinzikayo, assessed  the security situation in the municipality:    [Begin Sinzikayo recording] Regarding these incidents, one  can also say that the people of Mutangano, [word indistinct]  Gakikungu, yesterday afternoon between 1600-1700 hours, there  were heavy exchanges of gunfire and even explosions which  frightened the population. I told them that these occurred in  the mountains where security forces from Nyambuye, while  patrolling the mountains, had met an element of the armed groups  from Muyira. So there were exchanges of fire, explosions; this  is what was heard in the afternoon. [passage omitted]    I would like to say that what is happening in the mountains  may cause fear among the population of the municipality of  Bujumbura. So I would like to ask the population to be  vigilant, the town is sufficiently protected for the time being.  Even regarding what is happening in the mountains, I believe  that the Armed Forces will be able to dislodge or dismantle the  armed groups. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

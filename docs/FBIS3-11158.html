In a press release dated 14 March, the mayor's office,  which had just paid three months' back wages to the directors  and teachers of the communal schools, the employees of the  communal home, and some employees of the Port-au-Prince City  Hall, deplores the fact that Deputy Mayor Joseph Gerald Salomon  has set himself to prevent the refuse collection workers and the  majority of City Hall employees from receiving their paychecks,  which have been available for over one month.    This press release says the office of Mayor Paul is now  working to set up the "Port-au-Prince is struggling" program,  the purpose of which is to help improve the living conditions of  the population. As a sign of its efforts to restore the proper  functioning of the city administration and to allow the  employees to receive their wages, the office of the mayor takes  this opportunity to publish a letter which Mayor Evans Paul sent  to Deputy Mayor Joseph Gerald Salomon and which still has not  been answered.    The dramatic situation of the city, which the population  gave  us the responsibility of managing, compels me to write you this  letter so as to reach the compromise essential to the rescue of  the municipal institution of our capital, writes Evans Paul to  Joseph Gerald Salmon. I invite you to regain your self-control  and to comply with the norms and principles that you swore to  respect on 17 January 1991 when we were installed at the Court  House, Paul adds. Beyond our differences and divergences are the  fundamental interests of Port-au-Prince society. We have nothing  to win, collectively or individually, in this anarchical  situation of an administration that does not offer any services  to the community. Within the framework of the "Port-au-Prince is  struggling" program, I am ready to meet with you -- as a member  of the cartel over which I have an electoral mandate to preside  -- in order to discuss solutions relating to the problem, writes  Evans Paul.    I hope you will understand the logic of my steps aimed at  normalizing and reinforcing the institutional capability of the  city administration to improve the awful conditions of the  Port-au-Prince populace.    This press release is signed by Evans Paul, president of the  Port-au-Prince Municipal Council.</p>

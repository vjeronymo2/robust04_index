			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President of the republic of Kosova Dr. Ibrahim  Rugova held a new conference in Prishtina today. Let us follow  the telephone report by our correspondent Sherif Konjuca:    [Konjuca] We hope that this year will be the year of  agreements and peace in the Balkans, president of the republic  of Kosova Dr. Ibrahim Rugova said, acquainting reporters with  the results of his visit to several Western European countries.  Mr. Rugova said that all these meetings displayed a great  concern over the situation in Kosova and, in all the high-level  talks, the question of Kosova was put forward as an  international question. We were promised that the international  community will commit itself to solve the Kosova issue fairly.    To avoid the present conflict in Kosova, posing grave  consequences for the whole region, we asked that Kosova be  placed under an international protectorate so that life returns  to normal, democratic institutions be established, and talks  about Kosova's future be more eased. The visit of the U.S.  President Bill Clinton to Europe and Russia is a good occasion  to bring the attitudes for the solution of the problems in  former Yugoslavia and the Balkans closer.    Mr. Rugova said that, unfortunately, the Serbian regime is  continuing its hard repression against the Albanians in Kosova.  Also during last week, many homes of Albanians were raided and  many citizens and political activists were maltreated. The  attack of the police against the Kosovar sportsmen was  particularly very primitive. Severe tortures are being used  against prisoners, while their apprehension is illegally  prolonged. Lately, groups of Serbian civilians, too, have  started to attack people in the streets, something that is  worsening relations between neighbors.    Answering a question on the present importance of the Bujan  conference, Rugova considered this historic meeting as a  permanent inspiration and a strong support for peacefully  satisfying the will of the Kosovar people for freedom and  independence.    Answering a question by a correspondent as to how long this  situation in Kosova will last and how long the people will  support his peaceful option, Mr. Rugova answered that the people  understand that the other road [the non-peaceful option] will be  very tragic for Kosova, because we are completely unprotected  here. He said that our movement is developing on the basis of  the people's consciousness and the situation we are undergoing.  However, we consider the criticisms about our road to be normal.    Mr. Rugova denounced articles in the Serbian mass media on  the alleged commitment of hundreds of Albanian fighters in the  ranks of Muslims in the world, which aim to compromise our  peaceful movement. The truth is that in Bosnia-Herzegovina  [words indistinct] 200,000 Albanians live, whereas only in  Trajeve, about 100 unprotected Albanians were killed and  massacred. A total of 200 others are still detained in the  university, and, despite our persistence, they are not allowed  to go out as the others have.</p>

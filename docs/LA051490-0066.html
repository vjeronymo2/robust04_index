			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHOOTING MAY BE FIRST BY ASIAN GANGS IN POMONA;  </P> <P> VIOLENCE: A 16-YEAR-OLD IS KILLED IN A DRIVE-BY ATTACK. THE CITY HAS LONG BEEN  PLAGUED BY BLACK AND LATINO GANGS.  </P> <P> A 16-year-old Vietnamese youth was shot to death in Pomona on Sunday, the  victim of what police believe was the first gang violence initiated by Asians  in a city that has long suffered from battles waged by black and Latino gangs.  </P> <P> Luc Huynh was standing outside a party shortly after midnight when unknown  assailants in three vehicles sped past him, firing a spray of bullets, said  Pomona Police Lt. Larry Todd. Friends rushed the wounded teen-ager to Pomona  Valley Community Hospital, where he died of a gunshot wound to the upper chest,  police said.  </P> <P> The drive-by shooting apparently was initiated by Asian gang members, "and to  the best of my knowledge that's the first incident of this type that we've  had," said Todd. He added that investigators had not determined whether Huynh  was a gang member.  </P> <P> The murder may have been an isolated incident, Todd said. But in a city where  territorial wars between Latino gangs have raged for years -- a 7-month-old  baby wounded while nestled in its father's arms was among the most recent  victims -- no incidents of gang violence are being taken lightly, the  lieutenant said.  </P> <P> "Right now, most of our gang people are assigned to the black and Hispanic  gangs which are predominant here," said Todd. He added, however, that  investigators from Pomona "will be contacting Orange County and other places  where there are large Asian populations and finding out if what we have here  may be the start of something new."  </P> <P> One city official lamented the gang violence that has shaken many Pomona  residents. Councilwoman Nell Soto said that police are still uncertain whether  Huynh's shooting was gang-related, but she said it really doesn't matter.  </P> <P> "We have a problem with our youth, whatever the ethnicity," said Soto, whose  family has lived in Pomona for eight generations. "It isn't just Pomona. It's  all over. And we have to come up with programs to abate this problem.  </P> <P> "I know what Pomona can be," she added. "If we lose our children, society is  lost."  </P> <P> Pomona, a city of 121,000 35 miles east of Los Angeles, is only one of many  areas reflecting the growing tide of gang violence throughout Los Angeles  County, officials said. This year, 1,302 felonies were attributed to gangs  through March. And Huynh was only one of several to fall victim to possibly  gang-related violence over the weekend.  </P> <P> Less than three hours after Huynh was shot down, five men in Lynwood were  wounded in a shooting that may have been gang-related, said Los Angeles County  Sheriff's Department Sgt. Jack Ewell.  </P> <P> The men were sitting in a vehicle on California Street near Imperial Highway  about 2:30 a.m. Sunday when shots rang out, wounding two in the chest, two in  the leg and one in the head, said Ewell. They were taken to St. Francis Medical  Center, where two were in critical condition and three were listed in stable  condition with less serious wounds. None of the victims were identified.  </P></p>

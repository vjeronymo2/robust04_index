			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Reduced borrowings aid Quality Street recovery Quality Street, the Glasgow-based company which describes itself as a private sector landlord organisation, returned to the black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 2m in the year to March 31 after two years of losses which totalled Pounds 28m by 1993. Nationwide Building Society became the majority shareholder in January, controlling 75 per cent of the company after converting Pounds 50m of lending into non-voting preference shares. The rest of the company is owned by Mr Paul Mugnaioni, chairman and founder, and the management. As a result of the reduction in borrowing, interest payments fell from Pounds 17.5m to Pounds 7.6m. The company also benefited from the conversion of a deficit on asset revaluation of Pounds 17.9m in 1993 into a surplus of Pounds 1.6m because of the rise in the value of its properties. Turnover, consisting largely of rental income, was Pounds 13.6m (Pounds 12.3m) and gross profit was Pounds 10.2m (Pounds 9.2m). As part of the deal with Nationwide, Quality Street took over about 2,000 houses which Nationwide had repossessed. It is now refurbishing these properties, scattered all over Britain, for rent. This will increase rental income to about Pounds 22.5m by the end of 1995.</p>

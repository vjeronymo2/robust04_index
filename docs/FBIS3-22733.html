This was stated  today by Viktor Fetisov, director of the leading enterprise of  the national atomic industry -- the Mayak chemical combine. He  was commenting on a media report that the enterprise had  accepted for reprocessing the whole batch of enriched uranium  from the research reactor in Iraq as planned.    We succeeded in winning the competition for effecting the  project for rendering services to the IAEA, the Mayak chief  said. It was a question of transporting from Iraq and  reprocessing the nuclear fuel from the research reactor in  fulfillment of the decisions of the UN Security Council  resolution. In this connection, relevant instructions were  taken from the Russian Government. This work is to our  advantage since it makes it possible to take up unused  production capacity and provide work for highly qualified staff.</p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Motor design breakthrough hailed BRITISH scientists and component manufacturers yesterday welcomed a breakthrough in the design of electrical motors which, they claim, could revolutionise power systems in domestic appliances and cars by making them smaller and lighter. Launching a three-year programme to develop the new motors, scientists from the universities of Warwick and Cardiff said the innovation could lead to a 60 per cent reduction in the size of motors needed to power products ranging from food mixers and power tools to car-steering systems. The development programme is backed by a consortium of 22 companies including Black and Decker, Lucas Industries, Kenwood and Vent-Axia, and will be part-funded by the Department of Trade and Industry. Unlike traditional motors which rely on electrical connectors to drive them, the new motors have no electrical contact between the power source and the drum - the part of the motor that revolves. The motors are driven by coils of wire energised by pulses of electricity 400 times a second. The process, called switched reluctance drive, creates an energy field which rotates the drum and generates the power to move components. The principle of switched reluctance drive is not new, and other research companies and manufacturers are testing it. However, this is thought to be the first time such a system has achieved standards acceptable to industry. The system has been pioneered by Dr Charles Pollock, a lecturer in power electronics at the University of Warwick, and Professor Hugh Bolton of the University of Wales College of Cardiff. Dr Pollock said: 'By breaking away from conventional technology we can radically change the design of products. For the automotive industry, this could be the equivalent of fly-by-wire - it could lead to electrical steering and doing away with traditional mechanical systems.' Mr David Shaw, a senior electronics engineer at Black and Decker, said: 'The potential is enormous. There's no blow-out or stalling with these motors; we may even be able to fit them into the handle of a power drill.' Vent-Axia said that such motors could be fitted in its 400,000-product range. 'It will give us cost savings and increased efficiency,' said Mr David Vincent, technical director.</p>

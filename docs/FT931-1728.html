			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Kenya's crisis IN DECIDING this week to reverse economic reforms introduced in February, President Daniel arap Moi has taken a step as impractical as it is dangerous. His move stems from his frustration over conditions attached to aid, rather than a considered appraisal of the country's options. The reforms that donors are urging on Kenya are far from easy, but the consequences of Mr Moi's retreat into an economic laager will prove more painful. The retreat is motivated in part by the impact of adjustment on the system of patronage and corruption that permeates the government. Transparency and accountability, the key donor principles, make the life of top government officials more difficult. What is now at stake, however, is not only the stability of Kenya. Mr Moi's action poses an uncomfortable challenge for those western governments and institutions that endorsed the president's controversial election victory last December. If Mr Moi had been fairly elected and presided over a sound administration, he would deserve a sympathetic hearing when he complains of having to implement 'dictatorial' IMF policies. But there is every reason to fear that this is not the case. If the IMF's post-election assessments of Kenya's performance reveal serious economic mismanagement which allowed state funds to reach party coffers and helped to buy electoral success, Mr Moi's plea would lose its credibility. The president now faces a volatile period: a plunging exchange rate and no recourse to foreign aid; a rapidly rising rate of inflation; high unemployment; and growing resentment over corruption. As ex-president Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia belatedly discovered, there is no alternative to reforms backed by the IMF. It is possible to understand Mr Moi's frustration without endorsing his action. In November 1991, the donor community suspended most aid disbursements to Kenya, pending political and economic reform. On the political front at least, Mr Moi can argue that he has done what the donors wanted, but has received no tangible benefit. The ban on multi-party politics was lifted by the end of 1991. A year later Kenya conducted its first multi-party poll for 26 years. In the view of some observers, the election process was seriously flawed. The majority of donor governments, including Britain and the US (as well as the Commonwealth observer mission) came to a different conclusion: the elections, while not entirely free and fair, were acceptable. Had the west refused to endorse last December's poll, it could today advise Mr Moi that the only way out of his crisis would be to put his party to the test of a rigorously supervised general election. Since that option is not available, donors can now do no more than hope that Mr Moi soon comes to terms with economic realities. They may find themselves having to conclude that he is the problem, and not, as they hoped last December, part of its solution.</p>

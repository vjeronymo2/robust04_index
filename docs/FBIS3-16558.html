			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The ink on the agreements initialled by the  Latvian and Russian delegations had not dried yet in Moscow,  when the relevant departments here in Latvia had cause to be  alarmed. Another provocation was averted near Skrunda.    The executive of the Latvian National Independence Movement  [LNNK] expressed its opinion on this today in a statement for  the press. Mirdza Vitola reports on the statement.    [Vitola] The package of interstate agreements initialled at  the talks between the Latvian and Russian delegations -- which  provides guarantees for the military personnel of the Russian  occupation army, who were discharged before 28 January 1992, to  stay in Latvia and which offers the possibility of aspiring for  citizenship, as well as provides for the keeping of the Skrunda  radar station in Latvia for five and one half years -- means  securing the legal status of the Latvian occupation and of its  consequences.    The government delegation has acted against the interests of  Latvian citizens and of their unequivocally expressed will. The  treaty has been drafted in secrecy, without familiarizing the  public with its conditions. The LNNK categorically demands the  immediate publication of the full texts of all the agreements in  the press and considers that the action by the government and  its delegation should be qualified as an act of betrayal of the  state interests of the Republic of Latvia.    First, the LNNK calls on the president of the Republic of  Latvia not to sign agreements with Russia. Second, it calls on  all Saeima deputies who are able to realize the tragic and fatal  meaning of these agreements for the future of the Latvian state  and people, not to ratify it. Third, it calls on all Latvian  citizens and political forces who feel responsible for Latvia's  future and independence to become involved in protest actions  with the aim of stopping the ratification of these agreements.  [passage omitted]    [Studio announcer] And now some details about the incident  itself. Yesterday evening, the Kuldiga district police defused  an explosive device which had been placed by the concrete base  of a pylon carrying a high-tension power supply line  approximately 1 kilometer from the check point of the Skrunda  radar station. This information has been supplied to the BALTIC  NEWS SERVICE by Ilgonis Heinackis, head of the Kuldiga district  police department.    The Latvian Interior Ministry Press Center reports that the  device was made up of approximately 12 kilograms of TNT -- in  200- gram briquettes and divided into two batches -- an  electrical detonator, wires, a timing device, and a battery.    The district police was informed about the explosive device  by a resident of Ranki rural district. The command of the  Russian army unit stationed at Skrunda refused to take part in  defusing the device.</p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / 'Nuclear dustbin' charge levelled at Thorp operator NEARLY 90 per cent of foreign radioactive waste sent for reprocessing at the controversial Thorp plant in Sellafield, Cumbria, could remain in the UK permanently, Greenpeace claimed yesterday. The pressure group, which does not want the Pounds 2.8bn plant to be given a licence to start operation, argues that Sellafield will become a 'nuclear dustbin' for foreign radioactive waste if Thorp is given the go-ahead. The claims are contained in a 40-page report commissioned by Greenpeace from Large &amp; Associates, London-based consultants, and published today. The report says that British Nuclear Fuels, the plant's owner, gave evidence to the government's Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee suggesting it has agreed to send back only 11 per cent of foreign waste. The report further claims that BNF wants to send back no more 1 per cent of foreign waste, measured by volume. Under a policy known as 'substitution', BNF plans to send customers more highly radioactive waste in exchange for keeping bulky low and intermediate level waste - saving the customer transport costs. BNF said last night that contracts signed since 1976 allowed it to return all waste produced. Cumbria County Council is expected to back the start-up of Thorp when all 83 councillors meet next Monday, the last day for public consultation on the project. However the working party to the council, whose views are based on independent research commissioned by the council, recommends that start-up should go ahead only if the plant can be shown to meet all safety criteria.</p>

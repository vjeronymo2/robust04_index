Those calling for a dissolution or Mr Chuan's resignation cited  the Government's poor performance and erosion of public faith.    "I have always said this Government was elected and comes  from the people," said Mr Chuan. "This Government is lawful  because it is elected by the people. This Government has a  majority elected by the people. This Government works according  to its policy declared to Parliament. It has never done  anything that is not in line with its policy. Therefore, this  Government has righteousness to continue its work."    Mr Chuan was brushing aside strong criticisms of him by  political academic and critic M.R. [Royal title] Sukhumphan  Boriphat and Social Action Party [SAP] leader Montri Phongphanit  who claimed the Government had failed in its administration and  the people had grown tired of it due to its lack of achievements.    The Prime Minister said any party or individual had the  right  to criticise a government under democratic rule but the  government also has the right to clarify those points which are  not true. "They should not get angry when we make our points in  response. It should not be like that," he said.    Mr Chuan said democratic rule gave the people many  alternatives to protest the national administration. First, they  can revile it without fear of any danger. Second, the people  have the chance to make up for mistakes by not voting for a bad  government again.    Mr Chuan appeared to pay no heed to Mr Montri's claims that  the public had grown tired of his administration as reflected in  the low voter turnout for the Bangkok city and district council  elections on Sunday. He said there was nothing new in Mr  Montri's comments. "No matter whether there is an election or  not, he always says the same thing. He said this both before  and after the elections."    The Phalang Tham Party, which controlled a majority of 49 of  the 57 seats in the City Council after the last election in  1990, saw the number of its city councillors shrink to 23 of the  new 55-seat City Council. Mr Chuan's Democrat Party captured  seven seats, six more than previously. The Opposition, however,  can boast the results of the elections were a big victory for it  since the Prachakhon Thai Party managed to win 19 seats, 13 more  than in 1990, while the SAP took five seats, which Mr Montri  said was beyond his expectations.    The SAP leader, delighted by the increase in popularity for  his party, challenged the Prime Minister to resign. But Mr Chuan  chose to ignore Mr Montri's comments about public  dissatisfaction with his government. "I have heard that comment  but would rather not say anything in return." he said.    The Prime Minister was also attacked recently by M.R.  Sukhumphan who said he was disappointed with Mr Chuan and had  lost all hope for his government.  M.R. Sukhumphan claimed Mr Chuan who always played an  outstanding role in keeping alive democratic thoughts before  becoming prime minister, had already changed and "kept his  ideologies in the drawer". The academic said the Premier did  nothing except make sure the government could "survive" day by  day. He also charged Mr Chuan with lacking the courage to solve  national problems and of possessing pessimistic attitudes and  fears about obstacles in everything he has to do. M.R.  Sukhumphan said the best exit for the current political  situation was for Mr Chuan to dissolve Parliament and call a  general election.    Meanwhile, Phalang Tham Party spokesman Sutham Saengprathum  also hit out at Mr Chuan yesterday, charging him with allowing  himself to be come a tool of the bureaucrats and foregoing the  chance to take the lead in amending the Constitution. "The  present Government is no different from the Chatchai Chunhawan  Government because it just plays around with principles and  figures to create false hopes for the people," claimed the  Nakhon Si Thammarat MP.    He said public confidence in the present administration was  eroding quickly even though it had many prominent politicians  who were seen as capable of solving the people's problems. It is  a pity that these politicians, after assuming office, have  worked on bureaucrats' directives and become their tool, he  said. Mr Sutham said the people were losing hope in the  Government even though they wanted very much to give it more  time.</p>

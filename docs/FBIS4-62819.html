			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yuriy Kovalenko report: "Europeans Expecting Leonid </F> Kravchuk on Island of Corfu. Boris Yeltsin Has Not Yet Received  an Invitation"]    [Text] Paris -- At the present time there is a lack of  unity among EU member states regarding partnership agreements  with Russia and Ukraine, plans for which were examined at a  foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels.    The majority, led by Willy Claes, head of the Belgian  foreign  policy department, want Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk to  sign a partnership agreement at the EU summit meeting scheduled  for 12-13 June on the Greek island of Corfu. French Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe has stated that Paris will oppose the pact  unless Moscow agrees to restrict its export of nuclear materials.    France, Alain Juppe stressed, considers the draft  partnership  agreement drawn up last week in Moscow by experts of the EU and  Russia to be unacceptable.    France is worried that cheaper Russian exports will hit its  supplies of nuclear materials to the EU. In 1993, according to  Western data, CIS countries sold the EU a total of 3,000 cubic  tonnes of uranium worth $1 billion -- approximately 25 percent  of Western Europe's requirements.    Signing a simultaneous partnership agreement with Russia and  Ukraine, the EU believes, will on the one hand help these two  countries' economies, and on the other hand will lead to a  reduction in the tension in relations between Moscow and Kiev.    Among other things, the partnership agreement envisages the  elimination of restrictions on Russian exports of steel,  textiles, automobiles, television sets, radio sets, and vodka,  and at the same time strengthens guarantees for Western  investments.    In 1992 Russian supplies to the EU (mainly energy sources  and  certain metals) totaled $17 billion, or almost one-half of all  Russia's exports. This is 20 times more than Russia supplies to  the United States, and almost 10 times what it supplies to Japan.    Special attention at the ministers' meeting was devoted to  the situation in Ukraine.    The ministers agreed to help Ukraine resolve the problems  connected with closing down Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power  Station. However, Kiev will not receive the $6-8 billion it has  demanded as compensation for closing down Chernobyl.</p>

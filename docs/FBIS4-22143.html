Ignatyev] </F>   [Text] In the early 1980's, the Pentagon began implementing  a program of more extensive use of outer space for military  purposes. The motives for these activities are reflected in the  words of J. Abrahamson, director of the SDI (Strategic Defense  Initiative) Program: "Space is the first line of defense."    The question of gaining superiority in space became  particularly critical in connection with the launching of a  program for creating an antiballistic missile [ABM] defense  system with space-based elements. It was during this period in  the United States that a jump in appropriations for military  space was observed (from $6.7 billion in 1982 to $10.6 billion  in 1984), AFM 1-6 Military Space Doctrine (15 October 1982) and  AFM 1-1 Basic Aerospace Doctrine (16 March 1984) were issued,  and the first steps were taken to organize the American space  forces.    Creation of space commands -- first in the branches of the  U.S. Armed Forces and then a unified command -- entirely  corresponds to the principles of organizational development of  the American Army and Navy. Maintenance of military equipment  and upkeep of personnel are entrusted to the so-called main  (administrative) commands, and their operational use and combat  employment are entrusted to the unified (operational) commands.  The main commands are subordinate to the departments of the  branches of the armed forces, and the unified commands are  directly subordinate to the Joint Chiefs of Staff [JCS].    Before creation of the space commands, functions for the  operation and control of satellites in orbit were performed  primarily by the U.S. Air Force Systems Command (no longer in  existence), which was called upon to oversee the development,  production, and testing of space equipment. On the whole, the  Air Force's activities in this area, according to American  experts, were functionally isolated, organizationally not  thought through, and technologically limited.    A similar picture was observed in the departments of the  U.S.  Navy and Army, where the space systems being used also were not  included in the force composition of the armed forces; that is,  they were not part of operational formations and large units  subordinate to the JCS through headquarters, command posts, and  control centers. In addition, bodies of operational management  did not exist in the branches of the armed forces for such  systems, and functions of development, operation, and control  were entrusted to the same commands. As space activities  intensified and the role of space systems increased, these  factors increasingly made their presence felt. According to one  Pentagon representative, "any event in space immediately  required the intervention of the JCS and Department of Defense."    It should be noted that the U.S. Department of Defense  encountered serious difficulties from the very start in forming  the space commands. First, a considerable part of the space  systems is used in the interests of several branches of the  armed forces and agencies of central subordination. Second, the  functioning of ground-based deep-space surveillance and nuclear  missile attack warning systems is closely linked to military  space activities. Third, attempts to share space systems caused  rivalry between branches of the armed forces. Finally, the  proposed activities of space commands inevitably would affect  the sphere of responsibility of the unified American-Canadian  North American Aerospace Defense Command [NORAD], which financed  the deep-space surveillance and warning systems.    As a result of repeated reorganizations and resubordinations  accomplished since 1979, today a definite structure of space  commands has taken shape in the U.S. Armed Forces. The central  role was allotted to the Air Force, which participated most in  the creation and practical use of space systems. (The Air Force  accounts for 90 percent of the specialists in the field of space  and 80 percent of the U.S. military space budget). Surveillance  and warning systems were removed from control of the NORAD  Command (for all intents and purposes, Canada did not  participate in accomplishing the corresponding tasks and  operating the facilities) and transferred to the space commands  of the branches of the armed forces. The affiliation of the  space systems was preserved and determined by what branch  operated the ground-based control and data collection and  processing centers and was the primary consumer of the  information received.    The U.S. Space Command [USSPACECOM] was created on  23 September 1985 (headquarters at Peterson AFB, Colorado) as a  necessary link of operational management between the JCS and the  space commands of the branches of the armed forces. Initially,  the space commands of the Air Force and Navy, and later of the  Army, were operationally subordinate to the Headquarters of the  USSPACECOM. Today, this is one of nine unified commands of the  U.S. Armed Forces. The following were defined as its basic  missions: Development and constant adjustment of the space  doctrine and methods of conducting combat operations with the  use of space assets; estimating troop needs for equipment and  compiling purchase orders for it; developing the tactical and  technical requirements for advanced systems; operational control  of forces and assets of subordinate space commands when  conducting space operations.    According to U.S. Air Force regulations, space operations  mean possible operations calling for the use of outer space for  military purposes. They are divided into four groups: Active  operations, control of outer space, support of ground forces,  and support of space systems.    Antiballistic missile defense and also strikes from space  against ground targets are considered active operations in the  United States.    Control of outer space includes, on the one hand, operations  to protect the orbital grouping of spacecraft and, on the other,  countermeasures against enemy spacecraft and ground services  (ranges).    Various types of satellites are to provide support to ground  forces: Communications, navigation, reconnaissance,  meteorological, and other satellites. Today, the United States  has at its disposal only such assets which are not strictly  weapons and are not capable of hitting targets in space or from  space.    As far as support of space systems is concerned, this  includes surveillance of outer space, launching satellites and  controlling them in orbit, identifying and cataloging space  objects, and also actions associated with maintaining space  systems in working order.    The USSPACECOM commander is simultaneously the commander of  NORAD and the Air Force Space Command, and a Navy admiral is  appointed as his deputy. Attempts to divide these positions  proved unsuccessful, which indicates the difficulties of  creating balanced structures in the space forces.    Actually, the USSPACECOM is a relative concept, since it  does  not possess its own forces and assets. Its only real component  is the headquarters as a body directly subordinate to the JCS.  In connection with the impossibility of a clear-cut division of  the functions of NORAD and the USSPACECOM, the headquarters is  the same for these commands (there are a number of common  directorates). The recently formed operations center, which has  24-hour shifts, and a joint intelligence center, whose tasks  include continuous global assessment of the current space  situation, operate under the USSPACECOM.    Today, the personnel strength of the command headquarters  exceeds 650 people; 50 percent Air Force, 30 percent Navy, and  20 percent Army. When creating and accepting into service new  elements of the ABM defense system and anti-satellite weapons,  it is planned to make them operationally subordinate to the  USSPACECOM.    The U.S. Air Force Space Command, created on 1  September 1982 (headquarters at Peterson AFB), became the first  formation of this sort in the armed forces. In the period that  has passed, it has repeatedly undergone substantial  organizational and structural changes which, apparently, are not  final.    Today, the following belong to the command: All American  nuclear missile attack warning and deep-space surveillance  systems; the U.S. Air Force space command, control, and  telemetry complex; the Western (headquarters at Vandenberg AFB,  California) and Eastern (Patrick AFB, Florida) missile ranges;  command, control, and data reception centers of a number of  space systems; a unified NORAD/USSPACECOM command post at  Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado. On 1 July 1993, the 20th Air Force,  consisting of six Minuteman and MX ICBM wings, was transferred  to the command. As experts believe, this will make it possible  to more effectively use common logistic and technical support  facilities to service missile equipment (ICBM's and missile  platforms) and range services, and to simplify training of  personnel for common military occupational specialties.    The sphere of activities of the Air Force Space Command  includes operating and servicing corresponding equipment,  personnel acquisition and training, technical equipping of units  and subunits, and organizing their daily activities and combat  training. The space commands of the other branches of the armed  forces performs similar missions.    In addition to the 20th Air Force, the main components of  this command are four space wings and one space group (Figure  1). The 21st Space Wing includes all American nuclear missile  attack warning systems and also the NORAD/USSPACECOM command  post; the 30th and 45th space wings include the Western and  Eastern missile ranges, respectively; the 50th Space Wing  includes the unified military space systems command and control  center and the Air Force space command, control, and telemetry  complex; and the 73rd Space Group includes the Spacetrack  deep-space surveillance system.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UFM-003L-03A>      Figure 1. Structure of U.S. Air Force Space Command </FIG>     The IMEWS[.sup]1[/] space-based ballistic missile launch  detection system provides U.S. military-political leadership  warning about a nuclear missile attack. It includes four-five  satellites constantly operating in a stationary orbit, ground  information reception centers at Buckley AFB, (Colorado),  Narranger (Australia), Kapaun (FRG), six mobile reception  complexes at Holloman AFB (New Mexico), and also BMEWS, Pave  Paws (Figure 2 [not reproduced]), and Parks ground-based systems  (a total of eight radar sites in the continental United States,  Alaska, Greenland, and Great Britain). With the exception of  Alaska (the site at Clear), all nuclear missile attack warning  system sites are equipped with modern powerful radars with  phased-array antennas capable of detecting ballistic targets at  ranges up to 5000 km.    The deep-space surveillance system (organic assets --  Spacetrack system sites, committed assets -- sites of scientific  research centers and agencies and also U.S. test ranges)  includes a total of 15 ground-based radar and optical  (optico-electronic, Figure 3 [not reproduced]) surveillance  sites. The bulk of them are located in middle latitudes on the  territory of the United States, Turkey, Italy, South Korea, and  islands of the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans.    Deep-space surveillance systems (Air Force and Navy), if  necessary, are able to support conduct of active operations to  protect American satellites and to counter space activities of  other countries. They conduct surveillance of space objects  (perform 60,000 coordinate measurements daily). The NORAD and  USSPACECOM command posts have a catalog of approximately 7,000  space objects, where data of these observations are registered.  During the latest reorganizations, ground centers of U.S.  reconnaissance space systems and satellite communications  intercept sites of other countries located at Misawa Air Base  (Japan), Griffiss AFB (New York), and Lackland AFB (Texas), and  also in the areas of Edzell and Feltwell (Great Britain) were  included as part of the 73rd Space Group.    The 50th Space Wing is a large subunit of the Air Force  Space  Command. As the command structure developed, the Air Force space  command, control, and telemetry complex (SCCTC), ground-based  infrastructures of the main communications (DSCS, NATO-3),  navigation (NAVSTAR), weather reconnaissance (DMSP), and other  systems were consolidated into it. It is planned to transfer the  LANDSAT natural resource reconnaissance satellites and  corresponding ground equipment to the wing.    Through the SCCTC, the Air Force control the majority of  U.S.  reconnaissance satellites, experimental spacecraft, and also  equipment used for working out space components of antiballistic  missile defense under the SDI Program. Every day 9 sites (on the  territory of the United States, Great Britain, and Greenland)  conduct about 600 communications sessions with satellites and  accomplish continuous control of more than 70 spacecraft in  orbit.    In compressed time periods, literally in several years,  Falcon AFB was turned into the largest facility, which comprised  a single whole with the adjacent NORAD and USSPACECOM command  post, the Air Force Space Command Headquarters, and the Air  Force Academy in the "space" state of Colorado. This air base  houses the main center for control of U.S. military space  systems (total area of 27,000 square km), which is combined with  the control center of the experimental test complex where the  SDI Program is accomplished. Here the major satellite  communications center, the central Air Force SCCTC post, the  main control station, and leading control station of the NAVSTAR  navigation system are deployed.    Presently, personnel of the 30th and 45th space wings,  respectively, accomplish operation of all structures of the  Western and Eastern missile test ranges, servicing of launch  complexes, and preparation of spacecraft for launch. Operational  services of the Eastern Range are additionally charged with  providing security for Space Shuttle launches, and launches of  ballistic missiles from U.S. and British submarines from  adjacent water areas of the Atlantic Ocean. Minuteman and MX  ICBM's as well as target missiles (under the SDI Program) are  launched from the Western Missile Range to the vicinity of the  Kwajalein ABM Range (Marshall Islands).    The United States mainly uses various models of Atlas,  Delta,  Scout, and Titan booster rockets at this stage. According to  American estimates, up to 40 percent of the military space  budget is spent on their procurement, launch preparation, and  launch. However, in connection with the high degree of  automation at launch complexes of both ranges, no more than  16,000 military and civilian specialist are permanently employed.    The total personnel strength of the Air Force Space Command  is presently (not counting the 20th Air Force) more than 30,000,  with up to 14,000 of them civilian specialists.    Organization of the U.S. Navy Space Command began  on 1 September 1983 based on the Navy's existing deep-space  surveillance system, several space systems, and their ground  components. Presently, the command, which includes the Navy's  SPASUR space surveillance system, operates the satellite  navigation (Transit), communications (FLTSATCOM, LISAT), and SSU  maritime and ocean theater reconnaissance systems. Its main  structural components are an aerospace group, a space operations  support center, and a space reconnaissance and surveillance  directorate (Figure 4).   <FIG ID=JPRS-UFM-003L-04A>      Figure 4. Organizational Structure of U.S. Navy Space Command </FIG>     The SPASUR system consists of nine radar sites (three  transmitting and six receiving) located in the southern U.S.  states which create along the 33-degree north latitude parallel  a solid barrier beam for detecting spacecraft using scattered  reception of reflected signals (interferometric method).  Together with Air Force Spacetrack sites, they form the  integrated SPADATS deep-space surveillance system, which  accomplishes missions in the interests of the Defense  Department. The SPASUR system supplies up to 75 percent of the  information for the already mentioned general catalog at the  NORAD/USSPACECOM command post.    The leadership of the American Navy most actively opposed  creation of a unified space command, fearing infringement of its  interests on the part of the Air Force, which repeatedly has  raised the issue of transferring all space activities under its  control. As a compromise, a procedure was adopted under which a  U.S. Navy admiral was appointed NORAD/USSPACECOM deputy  commander.    Today, the personnel strength of the Navy Space Command  varies between 2,000 and 3,000 people, and its headquarters (100  people) is at Dahlgren, Virginia.    The Army Strategic Defense and Space Command  (ASDSC) was created in 1992 as a result of a merger of the  Space Command (formed 7 April 1988) and the Strategic Defense  Command (1 July 1985), responsible for implementing Army  projects within the framework of the SDI Program. There were two  main causes for the difficulties of its formation: The U.S.  Army's lack of its own space systems and the need to tie various  tasks into a single complex justifying the creation of such a  command.    Today, the ASDSC performs two basic functions --  participation in space activities of the Department of Defense  and supervising research projects in the field of antiballistic  missile defense. A number of ground-based control centers and  sites of the DSCS strategic satellite communications system and  NAVSTAR satellite radio-navigation communications system, as  well as the Kwajalein ABM test range (Pacific Ocean) and  agencies directing scientific research and development in the  field of ABM defense (Figure 5) belonging to the Army have been  transferred to the command.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UFM-003L-05A>      Figure 5. Organizational Structure of U.S. Army Strategic Defense and Space Command </FIG>     The Army has traditionally participated most actively in  creating the American ABM defense system. All the major ABM  program were developed under its leadership: Nike-Zeus,  Sentinel, Safeguard, and others. Today, within the framework of  the SDI Program, the Army command authorities organize and  oversee development of such ground components as radar,  anti-missile missiles, powerful ground-based lasers, and also  research and development for creating tactical systems such as  THAAD, Corps SAM, ERINT anti-missile missiles, and command,  control, and communications equipment.    Prior to the formation of the ASDSC, the personnel strength  of the Army Space Command was about 450 and that of the  Strategic Defense Command over 1200. The ASDSC Headquarters  (about 100 people) was located at Peterson AFB, and the main  research and development administration bodies in the ABM field  are located in Arlington, Virginia, and Huntsville, Alabama.    On the whole, the U.S. Army Strategic Defense and Space  Command serves as an example of a sufficiently artificial,  compromise organizational structure, the appearance of which was  the result of rivalry between the branches of the armed forces  and a reluctance to lag behind others.    Such are the basic functions, structure, and composition of  the space commands of the U.S. Armed Forces. The diversity of  missions associated with space activities, the difficulties of  classifying equipment and distributing functions, and the  different degree of participation of the branches of the armed  forces in space programs in the end prevented the American  military leadership from creating balanced and equal tables of  organization and establishment.    A statement made in May 1993 by the chairman of a U.S. House  of Representatives subcommittee for armed forces appropriations,  D. Murtha, is typical: "It is a strange thing that we annually  spend $15 billion (U.S. military space budget--I.I.) and no one  is responsible for this." Another example is observance of a  schedule of rocket booster launches from U.S. ranges. As  American experts calculated, from 1990 through 1992, when the  missile test ranges were already under the jurisdiction of the  Air Force Space Command, only four percent of the booster rocket  launches were accomplished on schedule, and some waited several  months to be launched. To demonstrate the point, we will point  out that a 24-delay in the launch of a heavy Titan-4 booster  rocket costs the Defense Department $6.8 million.    National security is considered the primary goal of American  space policy; therefore, the space commands will continue to  keep their status. "Despite the end of the Cold War," stated  former Chairman of the JCS C. Powell, "our national security  will, as before, depend on the effectiveness of space systems."  For several years, the United States voted against adoption of  any resolutions in the UN on demilitarization of outer space,  striving to convince other countries that space was already  militarized long ago, and in the interests of mankind itself.    At one time, creation of space commands meant transferring  space systems from the sphere of scientific research activities  to the area of combat employment and including them directly in  the combat structure of the armed forces. By the year 2000 the  Clinton Administration plans to reduce the Pentagon's military  space budget 15 percent. Time will tell how much these good  intentions are fulfilled.  Footnote    1.

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Lamb's bleating disrupts HSBC meeting The annual shareholders' meeting of HSBC Holdings, the parent company of Midland Bank, was yesterday halted amid chaos as a student protestor handcuffed herself to the chair occupied by Mr Keith Whitson, the bank's chief executive. The meeting was disrupted as Ms Catherine Muller, a Leeds University student protesting at Midland policies on the environment and lending to less developed countries, was carried out of the Barbican hall in London. Guards had to cut another student, Mr Chris Dunham, free from a microphone cable next to Sir William Purves, HSBC's chairman, and pull him from the stage along with others. The meeting resumed after being halted for 10 minutes. The protest was staged by a group called Lloyds and Midland Boycott (Lamb), which has organised one of the most vociferous bank boycotts since protests against Barclays' presence in South Africa during the 1970s and early 1980s. The disruption came after Sir William, who was questioned fiercely by Lamb members who had bought HSBC shares, insisted that he had personally refused some loans because he believed that the projects could damage the environment. Sir William said his four children 'leave me in no doubt about the importance of the environment . . . the world's environment has been severely damaged and continues to be, and we take a keen interest in such affairs'. One protestor said Midland was implicated in deaths in less developed countries because of its failure to 'forgive' all debt there. Sir William said he hoped HSBC 'played no part at all in deaths in any country'. Lamb activists said afterwards they intended to focus their boycott on Midland because they had been given verbal assurances by Lloyds executives who they met after disrupting that bank's annual meeting last month. Mr Simon Lewis, a protestor who was carried out, said afterwards that a poll undertaken by Lamb had found that students in Manchester were switching accounts from Midland. Midland said that the number of new student accounts opened with the bank last year had risen by 40 per cent. It said the bank had raised its market share of new student accounts from just under 20 per cent to 23 per cent in 1993. Sir William said pre-tax profits improved in the first quarter 'despite difficult trading conditions in the bond markets'.</p>

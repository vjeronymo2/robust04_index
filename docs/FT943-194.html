			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / The generation game The Labour conference in Blackpool next week will be dominated by the party's new leader. The Conservative conference in Bournemouth, which follows a week later, will show us how in thrall the Tory leader is to his party. By noting to what degree those expectations are met we will have a truer measure of the state of British politics than any opinion poll can offer, however 'adjusted' the figures. Labour's conclave will be an occasion for revering the memory of the late Mr John Smith, and an opportunity for advertising two propositions. The first is that the people's party has cast aside the characteristics that have lost it four successive elections since 1979; the second that Labour is possessed of a coherent idea of the different brand of management it proposes to apply to the market economy. The Tory assembly, which looks to be a dolorous midterm affair, will serve the government best if it passes us quietly by. The party will damage itself if it offers any new nostrums, like, say, 'back to basics'. When we recall, briefly for it is painful, the recent meeting of the Liberal Democrats in Brighton, we can see how well-placed the people's party is. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Lib Dem leader, expressed a longing to serve Labour in any capacity with which it might graciously choose to honour him. Mr Tony Blair, Labour's leader, can only have concluded that when the time comes he will have Paddy for breakfast. Meanwhile, Mr Blair need not show his teeth other than in smiles. The Lib Dem disarray has simplified his task for next week, which is to project himself as the undisputed leader of all non-Conservative voters. Nothing could be easier. The picnic lies before him. Who is there to upset it? Aneurin Bevan is long dead, his ghost banished. Labour nearly fell apart at Blackpool in 1959, when Mr Hugh Gaitskell, then leader, sought to persuade a special conference to embrace the mixed economy. Mr Bevan, then deputy leader, loyally demurred. 'The problem is one of education, not of surrender]' he said, in what turned out to be his last speech, the text of which is to be found in Mr Michael Foot's biography. 'This so-called affluent society is an ugly society,' the great socialist orator went on. 'It is a vulgar society. It is a meretricious society. It is a society in which priorities have gone all wrong . . .' Later, in an article for the leftwing paper, Tribune, he talked of the division between 'fundamentalists' and 'pragmatists'. Today the latter are termed 'modernisers'; as to the former, they took the view, Mr Bevan wrote, that if the Labour party was to abandon its main thesis of public ownership, the only conflict with the Tories would be 'about nuances, about semitones and half-tints . . .' He could not be faulted for that. The triumph of socialism, which he regarded as inevitable, did not come to pass. The triumph of capitalism will be celebrated under the Labour banner, in that same Blackpool in which Mr Bevan thundered 35 years ago. Mr Blair may use contemporary language, referring to renewal, community, the connection between strong social support and the strength of individuals and the like. He will doubtless remain true to the ethical foundations of his beliefs. The meretricious elements of free-for-all capitalism will rightly be rejected. But set against the exchange of ideological passions during most of this century, what Labour has to offer next week can only be better nuances, more attractive semitones, more appealing half-tints. Thus constrained, it could be difficult for Mr Blair, who was six years old when Bevan delivered that speech, to arouse the sense of idealism that motivated young Labour activists during the glory days. Social and economic changes have made it doubly difficult. In No Turning Back, a report* by Ms Helen Wilkinson, 29, it is suggested that people aged between 18 and 34 are driven by values starkly different from those that move the older generation. The young are not 'sustenance-driven', which I think means they are at ease in the welfare state, are content when hopping from job to training to job, and comfortable with part-time employment. They take equality between men and women for granted. They seek excitement. This is a picture of optimistic youth, partly based on market research abstractions that Mr Ashdown was wont to quote some years ago. Some of it, such as the remarkable finding that the young are interested in sex, will bring a nostalgic smile to the faces of those of us who will never see 34 again except on a door. The central perception, which is that today's young women are better educated, less obsessed than were their grandmothers with marriage and childbearing, determined to work, self-motivated, and assertive is if not exactly brand new, helpfully expressed. With the changing roles of the genders on their minds, it is not surprising that many of them are cool about traditional party politics. Mr John Major, 51, is unlikely to enthuse them. When the prime minister addresses the Conservative conference a fortnight from today, he will presumably boast of his government's performance. He can hardly trumpet the record on crime, with the home secretary tied in knots. He should give honourable mention to his new education secretary, an excellent choice, and his chancellor. The Tories are presiding over a period of growth and low inflation. The part played in achieving that miracle by the ejection of sterling from the exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary system will not be stressed. Mr Major always promises lower taxes, but may not dwell on who increased taxation in the first place. He should seek to allay the anxieties of an electorate that has endured a long recession and lost confidence in the durability of any job. He could, with justification, point proudly to his role in establishing peace in Northern Ireland. He usually wraps himself in the Union Jack, and may be expected to sound a trifle more anti-European than the last time he ratcheted towards the sceptics. He will have done well if a speech like that crowns a conference in which gaffes are kept to a minimum, ministers refrain from making coded attacks on their colleagues, and delegates are sent home whistling Dixie. *From Demos, 9 Bridewell Place, London EC4V 6AP, Pounds 7.95</p>

			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Official statistics on services to be improved TRAVEL AGENTS, taxi operators and fish-and-chip shops are among the enterprises likely to come under scrutiny as part of a government effort to monitor the service economy more accurately. Services account for some 60 per cent of total UK output, up from about half in 1970. Measuring the output of services by volume is often difficult. In recent years that has hampered efforts to follow changes in the economy, which may have been one of the reasons the government was slow to spot the start of the recession last year. One of the difficulties is that services often produce intangibles such as assistance and advice. By contrast, in manufacturing, output can be measured by counting products. Under a new venture being planned by the Central Statistical Office, next year about 10,000 companies in a range of service sectors will receive questionnaires on a regular basis asking them details about their sales patterns. The sectors include catering, travel, entertainment and some personal services such as dry cleaning. Altogether they add up to about 10 per cent of the service economy. The data obtained from the questionnaires will supplement other financial information the CSO obtains from tax returns and employment figures, some of which may be inaccurate and out of date. However, for public-sector services where output is very difficult to quantify, employment figures will continue to be the main source of information. The scheme is part of a government effort announced last year to improve the official statistics of services output and the balance of payments. As part of that effort, 100 new staff have joined the CSO, a 10 per cent expansion. The CSO has already begun collecting sales information on a quarterly basis from about 20,000 service companies in areas such as advertising, law, business consultancy, hairdressing, private teaching and rubbish collection.</p>

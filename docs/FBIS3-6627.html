			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Akira Washio, political commentator: "Picture of </F> Chaos"]    [Text] It is said that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has  begun to keep a diary.    Being an ex-newspaper reporter, Mr. Hosokawa is said to have  polished the words of apology for "the past" on the airplane  while he was on the way to the Japan-South Korea heads of state  conference. Writing is probably his forte.    His grandfather, Fumimaro Konoe, also left the "Konoe  diary."    "Since the battle off the Mariana Islands centering on  Saipan, the government and the people have been overcome with  sorrow by the adverse tide of the war. In particular, the pain  and anxiety regarding countermeasures for this has not been an  easy matter for senior statesmen, not to mention the Imperial  Palace. I intend to leave an account summarizing the actions  related to this for future reference."    With the opening lines of "At Ogi villa on 5 July 1944," the  diary thus kept spelled out the politics Konoe observed from 21  June to 24 July 1944. It is a record about one year before the  unconditional surrender of Japan.    Saying that "All my ancestors have kept diaries and  therefore, I must at least do it verbally," Konoe seems to have  stated verbally the exchanges with visitors that were written in  the House of Peers memos. However, at that time, Konoe was  promoting a scheme to overthrow the Tojo regime to contrive an  early peace and secretly kept a diary while under surveillance  by the military police. According to his close associates, the  "Hosokawa diary" is preparation for writing memoirs.    That is why it is inviting speculation that Hosokawa has  made  up his mind to resign when he has done all he can.    Hosokawa himself spoke of these aspirations directly after  his appointment as prime minister.    "I intend to embrace political reform under my right arm,  economic reform under my left arm, and jump down from the castle  tower."    The enthusiasm is strongly felt that if he can cut a way for  political reform and economic reform which no one has been able  to accomplish, his value as a statesman will remain even if his  term is short.    South Korean President Kim Yong-sam told Hosokawa at the  heads of state conference in the old capital of Kyongju that  "the mass media of South Korea are calling my reforms a  revolution."    Hosokawa, who had stated at a meeting with Mayor Chirac of  Paris that "I feel that expectations for me are not the  expectations for a politician; they are the expectations for a  revolutionary," gave a big nod as if he heartily agreed.    It is said that since Kim Yong-sam has changed the meals at  government and ruling party leaders conferences to the frugal  fare of three dishes of kimchi, some of the ruling party leaders  eat lunch in their car on the way there or back. Hosokawa also  dislikes using Japanese restaurants and scolded the deputy chief  cabinet secretary for having made arrangements at a Japanese  restaurant for the noon meeting of members of the political  secretaries group. His temperament probably is already that of  a "revolutionary."  <H5>  Kajiyama Astounded by Ozawa </H5>   "In the future, I want to be active as a politician."    On 15 November [1993], the "100th day" since the fateful day  (6 August) when Hosokawa was chosen prime minister, Seiroku  Kajiyama, former secretary general of the Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP], who had crushed political reform, was branded a  class-A war criminal who caused the LDP to lose political power,  and had been confined in seclusion, gathered with friendly Diet  members like Kanezo Muraoka and Koichi Kato and proclaimed "the  end of mourning."    For the LDP, which has lost its hold on political power and  is under the complete control of Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general  of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], who is taking advantage of  the LDP's despondency, Kajiyama's comeback must be like the  return of its strong arm. It is probably like the return to the  battleline of a leading soccer player who had been red-carded  and ejected from the game.    Kajiyama seems to have analyzed Ozawa's methods intently. He  is amazed by Ozawa's quick attack, saying, "At any rate, he is  extremely fast. He anticipates necessary measures a step ahead  of time."    Kajiyama's return to the battleline also means that the  Obuchi faction that seemed to have been emasculated and was  degraded to a small faction has jumped out to the front of the  political situation. That will no doubt complicate the rumors of  political reorganization that have been swirling around  Nagata-cho.    Political reform has sucked the life's blood of many, such  as  Toshiki Kaifu and Kiichi Miyazawa.    A political reform-related bill that answered the prayers of  Hosokawa has passed the House of Representatives, but still is  awaiting "the wolf at the back door," the House of Councillors.    The Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] has the power in  the House of Councillors. Even if the House of Representatives  has removed the LDP "1955 rule," the House of Councillors can be  still under the LDP "1955 rule." If 10 people from the SDPJ in  the House of Councillors turn to opposition, the bill will be  killed.    There is another big hurdle.    It is "district division."    If the political reform-related bill is approved and an  advisory council to demarcate district division is established,  there is a view that "district division" will be carried out  smoothly because this council is a third party organ; however,  since there is an obligation under the Constitution that  "district division," upon which the life or death of Diet  members depend, be determined by law, they must once more be put  before the Diet.    Thus, there is a great possibility that political  reorganization will occur surrounding "district division."  Whether political reform is realized or collapsed, there will be  price whichever way it turns.    If Morihiro Hosokawa risks his own political life, it will  be  the crucial moment for the LDP of whether or not the party  itself can survive. The SDPJ also is right in the middle of a  battle risking its existence.    There probably no longer is a way for the LDP to get back  political power independently as before. Thus, there are not  many ways for the LDP to survive.    Unless it would be satisfiedtobe the strongest opposition  party forever, reorganization will probably be the only way. It  needs to create a "new LDP" with the LDP as an axis and come  back to the seat of political power to recapture the power.  This road is further divided into two paths. It is the choice of  creating a regime that has booted out the detested Ichiro Ozawa  and Komeito, or uniting with Ozawa.    The bloodshot eyes of the LDP are being directed toward  political reorganization, but there have been actions in the  coalition ruling party that are in sympathy with this as well.  <H5>  Takemura Acts Fiercely </H5>   Among them, the actions of Sakigake [Harbinger] Party  representative, Masayoshi Takemura (chief cabinet secretary)  have been intense.    Takemura has met secretly with former Deputy Prime Minister  Masaharu Gotoda whom he reveres as a mentor.    When Takemura joined the Ministry of Home Affairs, Gotoda,  who was the director of the Local Tax Bureau, was the examiner.  His friendship is implied in the words "I probably am an  unworthy disciple."    Incidentally, the one who interviewed him was Yosoji  Kobayashi, administrative vice minister of the Home Affairs  Ministry. Takemura recollects that Kobayashi teased Takemura,  who was already married, asking him, "Did you study for the test  in bed with your wife?"    There is no doubt about such a mentor-disciple relationship,  but the talks between Takemura and Gotoda really smell fishy.    "What does Ichiro Ozawa think? Where will he take Japan  after  he has completed political reform?"    The concerns of the two are concentrated on an analysis of  the intentions and aims of Ozawa who now is the linchpin of the  coalition regime.    After the July [1993] general election when the LDP lost its  majority, Takemura was intent on having "Gotoda" as the standard  bearer. Now it seems that he is endeavoring to enlist the help  of Gotoda to complete political reform.    When this Masayoshi Takemura proposed a compromise of "275"  in the authorized number of single-seat constituencies between  the "250" of the government's bill and the "300" proposed by the  LDP, no one doubted that the Hosokawa cabinet was resolved to  settle political reform by any means.    However, the concealed aim of what should be called the risk  of political reorganization is hidden in Takemura's "275."    "If it is 275, 150 will follow along from the LDP."    It is said that Takemura frequently met with boss Hiroshi  Mitsuzuka and Masajuro Shiokawa of the former faction to which  he was affiliated, and in addition, Toshiki Kaifu and others.    He has also been meeting secretly with Yoshiaki Kibe, who is  a close associate of Yasuhiro Nakasone and is serving as  chairman of the General Council, and with Yoshitaka Yotsumoto,  president of Sanko Construction Industries, who has become a  supporter of Hosokawa and Takemura.  <H5>  Break With Ozawa and Ichikawa </H5>   Takemura's concept of reorganization is said to be as  follows:    "Break off relations with Ichiro Ozawa and Yuichi Ichikawa,  secretary general of Komeito, add the Constitution safeguard  group of the LDP and the liberal group of the SDPJ, and take up  political power again."    In numbers, it will exceed a majority if a total of 150 from  the LDP follow along, the liberals of the SDPJ, the Democratic  Socialist Party [DSP], and then if Japan New Party and Sakigake  are added.    A force that would still support Hosokawa, or Kaifu, or  Gotoda, defend the Constitution, and create a rather stable  Japan would take political power.    The aim is to distance themselves from Shinseito and Komeito  and exhaust themselves in reorganizing political power.    If they kick out Hosokawa, it will be a coup d'etat, but  since the Japan New Party becomes an indispensable element in  this concept, a correct interpretation probably would be a  "rearrangement" of the coalition regime.    It was indeed during that time SANKEI SHIMBUN wrote in its  article titled, "A Matter of LDP Leaders," that Ichiro Ozawa,  Shinseito representative secretary general, sounded out Noda  (Takeshi Noda, LDP chief director of House of Representatives Ad  Hoc Committee on Political Reform) about "275."    Ozawa was angry.    Saying that "It is incorrect to use facts that are different  from my own opinion to dilute it," Ozawa shut out the SANKEI  SHIMBUN from the press conference along with NIHON KEIZAI  SHIMBUN which had written on the rice problem that Ozawa was  aware of the government bill which would conditionally permit  tariffication without exception.    The expression, "dilute," has been a part that cannot be  explained from the context.    However, Ozawa's feelings become clear if one reads it as  "to  dilute the fact that it is an (LDP) scheme."    Gotoda himself paid no heed, saying, "I too am a politician.  If I were younger, I might do it (be prime minister), but the  future will be the age for the generation born since 1935." He  probably means that he is no longer interested in participating  in the scheme.    However, it was just a half year ago, that Ichiro Ozawa, who  was still in the LDP, encouraged "Gotoda."    It was during the long weekend at the end of April that  Sadao  Hirano, a House of Councillors Diet member who is Ozawa's  right-hand man, had a talk with Sadao Yamahana, chairman of the  SDPJ.    [Hirano] We are thinking of going with Gotoda. We would like  your kind regards.    [Yamahana] Really?    Hirano immediately met Ichiro Ozawa and reported, "I  conveyed  to him that we are going with Gotoda." Opening wide his narrow  eyes, Ozawa muttered, "You said something really drastic."    There cannot be any conflict of interest between Ozawa and  Hirano.    Ozawa met secretly with Gotoda without delay. There is no  way  to know what they discussed, but from the circumstances at the  time, the following conversation was probably exchanged.    [Ichiro Ozawa] We must realize political reform. I am not  one  who fears disorder, but neigher am I one who particularly  desires disorder. If you accept, we will act together.    [Masaharu Gotoda] I appreciate your feelings, Ozawa.  However,  I have a health problem. Let me think about it.    Gotoda later sounded out Secretary General Seiroku Kajiyama  and others.    Kajiyama read that Gotoda had a secret understanding with  Ozawa and others and bared his hostility, saying, "Gotoda is  ambitious. I will knock him down."    Ultimately, Gotoda's heart ailment worsened and he gave it  up.    Ozawa and others revealed the impression that "After all  Gotoda is also a bureaucrat." In the end, he became firm in his  resolve to fight, even if it meant spliting the LDP.    When the Takeshita cabinet fell and it appeared that  Masayoshi Ito would be entrusted as the successor, Ito, although  he was interested, bowed to the entreaties of his wife who was  worried about his health and sacrificed the premiership. He was  criticized as a very stubborn man of Aizu, "the fellow who gave  the boot to the premiership," but there was also strong  criticism that if he were a politician, he should have accepted  it, even if he risked his life for it.    There probably was the thought that like Ito, Gotoda was  fleeing from the most momentous hour.  <H5>  Nervous Hosokawa </H5>   It is natural that Ozawa would try to confine the actions of  Takemura, but it is said that Hosokawa also was nervous about  those actions.    Political reform is approaching the crucial moment and  problems have been surging up like "tsunami" with the opening of  the rice market, recovery of the economy, and raise in the  consumption tax rate, but those are issues which must be  surmounted whoever takes political power. The collapse of the  LDP is welcomed, but the coalition regime must not collapse  along with it.    Hosokawa and Ozawa are keeping in perfect time with each  other. It is said that the two talk with each other on the  telephone twice a day.    Ozawa's close associate says, "Hosokawa listens to whatever  Ozawa says." Meanwhile, reports of a falling out between  Hosokawa and Takemura are running around political circles.  Takemura does not deny the rumor either; he says, "The Prime  Minister does not tell me everything he discusses with Ozawa."    Because the chief cabinet secretary has the role of a wife  to  the prime minister, one is apt to think that they are on good  terms, but in reality that is not always true. But Hosokawa and  Takemura are very friendly. They have lunch together and come  face to face with each other several times a day.    There probably is no breach between them, but since Hosokawa  "has the habit of changing the people upon whom he depends"  (those around the prime minister), the rumor seems to be uttered  with some credibility.    The fact that Hosokawa has doggedly excluded the Takemura  route of groping for a compromise with the LDP is being  mentioned as proof of the switch to Ozawa.  <H5>  Watanabe Draws Close to Ozawa </H5>   It was a shocking event that Michio Watanabe, former deputy  prime minister, tried to participate as a nonpartisan in the  "General Economic Policy Research Committee" (Takeo Nishioka,  chairman) planned by Tetsuo Yamaguchi, who is close to  Shinseito.    Ultimately, Watanabe decided not to participate due to  opposition in the faction, but a picture linking Ozawa and  Watanabe by an underground channel has been brought into relief.    When Watanabe fought with Kiichi Miyazawa and Hiroshi  Mitsuzuka for the post-Kaifu spot, he felt a debt of gratitude  to him, saying, "Ozawa was the only one who recommended me."    Nakasone, who hates Ozawa, is enraged by the sudden  closeness  of the two and has warned him: "If you want to become prime  minister, break it off with Ozawa." Nakasone once approved  recommending him in the LDP presidential election on the  condition that Watanabe dissociate himself from Ozawa.    Such being the case, Watanabe is suspected of having "an  alliance" with Ozawa one of these days, and there is a view that  if Watanabe should be routed out of the LDP, the spark of life  in the LDP will go out. Some say that is exactly the Ozawa  strategy.    However, it is also said that the unprecedented strategy of  former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone was behind Watanabe's  decision to participate in the research committee.    The story has been whispered with plausibility that Nakasone  revealed, "I joined the Sato cabinet as minister of transport,  leaping to a spot within sword's distance. Now, I think that I  will try leaping to the bosom of Ozawa."    It is not certain whether Nakasone was "serious," or that  Nakasone, whom Ozawa regards as a "bitter enemy," will be  accepted, but there is former Prime Minister Takeshita who never  criticizes Ozawa, saying,"We never know when we may join hands  again."    The LDP, which is being beaten about in the throes of death,  continues to spew every possible measure for survival.    How will this "picture of chaos" be depicted in the  "Hosokawa  diary"?</p>

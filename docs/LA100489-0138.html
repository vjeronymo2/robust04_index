			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POLICE 'STING' FIGURE FOUND IN MISSING CAR  </P> <P> A former Hawthorne police sergeant who drew nationwide attention with a  televised "sting" operation conducted to expose alleged police racism was found  unconscious in a car that former football star Jim Brown had reported stolen,  Los Angeles police said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Don Jackson was discovered late Monday in a 1985 Pontiac Fiero parked next to a  Los Angeles International Airport terminal, said Police Cmdr. William Booth.  </P> <P> Jackson was not arrested, but police were trying to determine whether a crime  had been committed. Booth said the stolen-car report "appears to be the fruits  of a family dispute."  </P> <P> Jackson said he had "nothing to do" with the car being stolen.  </P> <P> Jackson said that on Tuesday he went to the airport to pick up Brown's  daughter, Brandy Love, whom he said was a friend.  </P> <P> "I became extremely ill and nauseated and passed out as I got out of the car,"  Jackson said.  </P> <P> He was treated at Daniel Freeman Marina Mercy Hospital for an inflammation of  the stomach and released, a hospital spokesman said.  </P> <P> Brown could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Jackson gained national attention last January when an NBC television news crew  surreptitiously photographed a white Long Beach policeman as he appeared to  slam Jackson's head through a shop window.  </P></p>

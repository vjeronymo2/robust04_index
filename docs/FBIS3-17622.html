The president stressed he does not want confrontation with  the Crimean leadership, but there is a limit he will never  overstep -- the integrity of the state. Kravchuk said he  understands the Crimea's inclination for Russia and Russian  never-to-be-abandoned interests in the Crimea.    At the same time, President Kravchuk reminded of the  Ukrainian strategy: "There will be no negotiations on borders,  territorial integrity and sovereignty. The whole world is for  us and the reaction of the United Nations Security Council to  the Russian decision on Sevastopol is a vivid example of this  support. The more so, we have signed a corresponding agreement  with Boris Yeltsin.    "Europeans cannot understand what is happening; don't we  understand we cannot break borders today, they are holy of  holies and pillars of European security. That is why we say we  cannot!"    Leonid Kravchuk thinks that an idea of possible co-existence  of two currency zones in one state is "incompetent." He means  the idea of the ruble zone declared by the Crimean president.    Kravchuk called for the creation of a well-considered  program  of the Crimean economic revival with due account of its  peculiarities and said he and Yevgeniy Saburov are ready to  achieve assistance of international fiscal organizations.    The Ukrainian president praised the Russian economist and  politician nominated Crimean vice-premier by Yuriy Meshkov and  said Ukrainian citizenship of Saburov is "not a problem."    Asked where Ukraine may unite with Russia in some form,  Kravchuk said "I think that Ukraine must be together with Russia  but not subordinated to Russia -- that is all. I have a  realistic view on facts, there is no other way for Ukraine but  be together with Russia. We have been together for 300 years  and it is in our genes. We have had quarrels, weddings and  unifications amongst our peoples and these relations cannot be  broken".</p>

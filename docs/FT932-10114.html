			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Channel tunnel may face delay TRANSMANCHE LINK, the consortium building the Channel tunnel, said yesterday that the opening of the tunnel could be delayed until 1995. Mr Philippe Montagner, TML vice-president, told shareholders that construction of the tunnel was not nearly finished, in spite of what Eurotunnel, the tunnel operator said. He said that more than a year was needed to make software and to carry out tests. 'The installations as such are on the verge of being finished but that is not the case for software or tests, and in the best of cases over another year of work is still needed today,' Mr Montagner said. He said talks between Eurotunnel and TML were blocked and there was no agreement on costs, the opening date or financing. TML was ready to negotiate if Eurotunnel made an offer that could serve as a basis of negotiation, he said, adding that a 1995 opening would only be possible if 'perfect co-operation' between all parties in the project was reached. TML favoured a phased opening even if this was not planned in the initial contract, he said. Eurotunnel said it was sticking by a recent statement that, if it ccould count on the co-operation of its contractors, the tunnel should be ready to open in 1994.</p>

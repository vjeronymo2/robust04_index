			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 'HAWK' VISITS HIS THERAPISTS;  </P> <P> WHEN HE FEELS DOWN, DAWSON SEEKS OUT THE PADRES  </P> <P> Inevitably, the talk in the Padre clubhouse Thursday turned to the awesome  hitting of Chicago's Andre Dawson.  </P> <P> The man called "The Hawk" had just pummeled Padre pitching for the second time  in less than 24 hours, adding two triples and two singles to the home run and  triple he hit Wednesday night. He had scored all but one of the Cubs' runs in a  4-0 victory that gave them a sweep of the two-game series.  </P> <P> Tony Gwynn, the Padres' three-time batting champion, said, "He has just worn us  out the last two years."  </P> <P> Jack Clark, Dawson's slugging counterpart with the Padres, said, "When their  big stick starts doing the job like that, it inspires everybody else."  </P> <P> Both Gwynn and Clark made significant points. Dawson habitually mistreats the  Padres, and as he goes, so go the Cubs.  </P> <P> Consider these numbers:  </P> <P> In 1987, Dawson's first season with the Cubs, he batted .350 against the  Padres, with eight home runs. Last year, he batted .340 with five home runs.  Now he is off to a .524 start in five games against San Diego, with only one  home run but three triples.  </P> <P> Aside from his 11 hits in 21 at-bats against the Padres, Dawson is hitting just  .211 -- 16 for 76. His season average is .278.  </P> <P> When the Cubs arrived, Dawson was in the throes of a slump in which he had only  six hits in 35 at-bats. Take away his five for 13 against the Padres, and he  was one for 22.  </P> <P> As for his point about how much Dawson means to his team, Clark could well have  had his own situation in mind. He was fresh from a disastrous day that included  two double plays and a game-ending strikeout.  </P> <P> When Dawson wasn't hitting, the Cubs were averaging two runs and usually  losing. Now they have won four of five games from the Padres and, with their  pitching suddenly getting hot, six of eight overall.  </P> <P> Amazingly, Dawson has hit 14 of his 28 career home runs against the Padres  since joining the Cubs. That's as many in two seasons and a month with the Cubs  as in 10 seasons and a month with Montreal.  </P> <P> Dawson has taken a particular liking to San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, batting  .310 with 16 home runs here.  </P> <P> "I don't have a definite answer for it," he said. "But I see the ball well  here. It's a good park to play in, and it has a good atmosphere."  </P> <P> For two weeks, Dawson had rarely hit a ball hard. Against the Padres, he  crushed just about everything he swung at.  </P> <P> "I've been struggling to get my rhythm," he said. "The trouble was, I was  laying back and hitting the ball where it was pitched instead of being  aggressive. I was just feeling for the ball, and I have to attack it to be  effective."  </P> <P> Asked if he felt the pressure of having to carry the Cubs, Dawson said, "Not  really. It's a 24-man team, not one individual. If somebody isn't hitting, the  others have to pick each other up."  </P> <P> Dawson was the National League's most valuable player in 1987, hitting 49 home  runs and driving in 137 runs.  </P> <P> "In spite of what I did, we finished in last place," he said. "That tells you  what I mean. No one man can carry a ballclub."  </P> <P> That drew less than total agreement from Mark Grace, the Cubs' first baseman  from San Diego State who follows Dawson in the batting order and twice drove  him in with groundouts Thursday.  </P> <P> Said Grace: "From what happened the last two days, you can see how our offense  clicks when Andre Dawson is hitting. When he's in a groove, there's always  somebody on base. It's funny how the Padres bring out the best in him."  </P> <P> Grace is hitting .313 -- also fielding exceptionally well -- and the value of  his presence behind Dawson has brought great satisfaction to Cub Manager Don  Zimmer.  </P> <P> "All I heard all winter was who was going to hit behind the Hawk," Zimmer said.  "That was the main topic for 100 days. Well, everybody can't have Ted Williams  hitting behind him.  </P> <P> "Now I don't hear that stuff anymore. They can't pitch around Dawson with Grace  in the on-deck circle."  </P></p>

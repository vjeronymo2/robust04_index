			<p>BFN     [Text] Aggressive air raids of the Zionist fighter planes  on suburbs of Ba'lbak and one of the Hezbollah centres in the  eastern region of Lebanon have left about 100 casualties so far.  Political analysts believe that the Zionist regime's impudence  in the attack on Lebanon, which is contrary to all the  international conventions, is the natural outcome of the UN  Security Council's double-dealing in the face of this regime's  repeated acts of aggression. Thanks to U.S. support for  Tel-Aviv, the Security Council, which is supposed to maintain  international security, either ignores criminal acts of the  Zionist regime or releases a vague and ineffective resolution.    Several days ago the Zionist regime, within the framework of  its hostile behavior against the regional countries, abducted a  leader of the Believers Resistance Group from his residence and  took him to the occupied territories. Continuation of these  acts of aggression proves the point that, contrary to its  peace-seeking slogans, the Zionist regime's criminal behavior  remains. Neither is the Zionist regime's claim that it  launched an attack on the Hezbollah center in retaliation for  jihad operations by the Islamic resistance combatants acceptable  under any logic: The Zionist regime has occupied some part of  the Lebanese territory, and the Lebanese people enjoy the  legitimate right, in accordance with international regulations,  to fight for the liberation of their occupied territories,  whereas the Zionist regime is forbidden from retaliation even if  it is attacked in Lebanon.    It is obvious that the renewed silence of the Security  Council vis-a-vis today's aggression of the Zionist regime,  which brought death and destruction to another group of  Lebanon's innocent people, once again proves the fact to the  people of the world that the existing international system,  comprising the UN as a major part of the system, is incapable of  defending nations, thanks to the bullying structure of the  system. The system is incapable of bringing real peace and  security to every corner of the world.</p>

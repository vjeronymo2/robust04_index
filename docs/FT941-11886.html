			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Nissan ousts Rover as top car exporter Rover Group, about to pass into the ownership of BMW of Germany, was displaced by Nissan last year as the UK's biggest car exporter. Nissan shipped 182,207 cars worth nearly Pounds 1bn to 36 countries. Rover exported 161,932. Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders statistics show that Vauxhall came in a distant third with 72,090, even including production from its IBC commercial and utility vehicles ventures. Nissan's Japanese rivals in the UK, Toyota and Honda, began production only at the beginning of last year and consequently trailed far behind Nissan. Toyota exported 27,735 cars and Honda 27,121. Nissan's exports accounted for some 75 per cent of last year's 246,000 total output at its plant near Sunderland. However, Mr Ian Gibson, Nissan's managing director in the UK, warned yesterday that the company's output this year is unlikely to match 1993 levels because of the continuing deep recession in continental European car markets. Mr Gibson said Nissan was viewing the current year with caution and projecting production of between 200,000 and 240,000 units. The steepness of the decline in continental markets last year was such that Nissan was obliged to introduce single-shift working in the final quarter as well as an 'agreed severance' scheme which saw the Sunderland work force fall from 4,600 to 4,250. Nevertheless, the plant is to return to two-shift production at the beginning of next month and Mr Gibson said employment had now stabilised. That is thanks partly to the strong recovery now being experienced in the UK new car market. Figures to be released later this week are expected to show that demand in January was 17 per cent higher than in the corresponding month a year before. Nissan, which has won two Queen's Awards for Export Achievement since 1988, has invested Pounds 900m in its UK manufacturing operations and claims 'local' (European) content of more than 80 per cent in the two models it produces, the small Micra and upper-medium Primera.</p>

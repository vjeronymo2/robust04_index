In statements issued here, the al-Jihad (holy war) group  said  it would exact revenge for the death sentences passed on nine  members of its military wing Tala'i' al-Fath [Vanguards of  Conquest] Thursday by a military court in Cairo for a failed  assassination bid on Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi last November in  which a schoolgirl died.    The al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah (Islamic Group) vowed to  overthrow the government of President Husni Mubarak following  the execution of two fundamentalist soldiers in Alexandria  Thursday for plotting to kill the Egyptian leader.    Second lieutenant in the reserves Midhat al-Tahawi and  conscript Muhammad Ahmad Sa'id Salih, both members of the  al-Jama'ah, were sentenced to death by the Sidi Barrani military  court on February 16.    They were accused of having planned an assassination attempt  against Mubarak, who was due to visit the Sidi Barrani military  base near the Libyan border.    A third soldier condemned to death, Hamadah Muhammad Lutfi,  was still on the run. He was also a member of the al-Jama'ah.    The group's statement said Mubarak's murder was "a duty laid  down by Shariah (Islamic law)."    It quoted al-Tahawi's "last wish," for Egyptians to become  holy warriors and set up an Islamic state.

			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOVE-HATE RELATIONSHIP A HURDLE AT BASES TALKS;  </P> <P> PHILIPPINES: ARGUMENTS OVER HISTORY, PRIDE AND MONEY STRAIN MILITARY ALLIANCE  WITH THE U.S. OUTSIDE NEGOTIATIONS, PROTESTERS BATTLE POLICE.  </P> <P> Even for Manila, it was an incongruous scene Monday afternoon.  </P> <P> Down the street from the U.S. Embassy, about 2,000 angry demonstrators shouted  "Yankee go home!" and faced hundreds of helmeted police armed with truncheons,  tear gas and water cannons.  </P> <P> Nearby, scores of visa applicants watched and waited patiently under a shady  tree outside the U.S. consular office for their chance to join the 40,000  Filipinos a year who visit the United States.  </P> <P> It was another example of the sometimes surreal love-hate relationship between  the United States and its former Asian colony. But the increasingly troubled  alliance will be vital as the two nations square off to decide the fate of six  American military facilities, and ultimately the future of economic and  political relations between Washington and Manila.  </P> <P> Negotiators will meet today behind closed doors in a wood-paneled conference  room at the Central Bank for the first round of substantive talks on the bases.  But remarks made Monday in opening ceremonies suggested that arguments over  history, pride and money may outweigh those of strategic military needs in the  1990s.  </P> <P> Philippine chief negotiator and Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus, for example,  ridiculed "elected American officials" who utter "the caustic taunt: How much  must America pay the Filipinos to protect the Philippines?"  </P> <P> Instead, he argued, the United States has used the Philippines for its own  military purposes ever since seizing the colony from Spain in 1898. Poor U.S.  planning, he said, meant that "defeat and devastation were inevitable" when  Japan invaded the Philippines in 1941.  </P> <P> "Tens of thousands of us were called to the American colors, not to save the  Philippines . . . but to keep the war from reaching Australia and eventually  the American mainland," he said. "Even before the Filipino soldier had finished  fighting and dying for America, he was judged by the American Congress to be  worth only one-half the pay of the American soldier."  </P> <P> Most galling, Manglapus said, the U.S. Congress has reneged on a 1988 executive  agreement to pay $481 million a year in military and economic aid to use the  facilities. The current shortfall, he claimed, is $222.58 million.  </P> <P> "Dollars are important, but it is the solemn word that is here at issue," he  said. "The bilateral relations of any two nations can look forward to no  significant future if one cannot count on the other's word."  </P> <P> U.S. officials insist that the 1989 shortfall is $96 million, and that military  credits or other arrangements may yet make up the difference. In any case, they  argue, the bases provide jobs to 68,000 Filipinos, second only to the  Philippine government, and pump $1 billion into the nation's economy.  </P> <P> When it was his turn, U.S. special negotiator Richard L. Armitage mixed kind  words with veiled threats. "It troubles me," he said, "when I hear some  Filipinos assert that American use of Philippine military bases can only be a  vestige of the colonial relationship, that the Philippines can never be truly  free, truly independent and truly democratic until the Americans are gone, once  and for all.  </P> <P> "It troubles me because it understates, for reasons I cannot fathom, the  contribution the Philippines has made and still makes to peace and stability in  Asia," Armitage added. "It troubles me because it suggests a belief that our  mutual sacrifices have been essentially meaningless."  </P> <P> Still, he said, the United States is prepared to leave if asked. If no mutual  interests are found, he said, "then we have precious little to discuss other  than the terms of an amicable separation."  </P> <P> "Indeed, if separation is your desire, let us move to that end with speed,  confidence and goodwill," he added. "If our mutual interests cannot sustain us  as partners, let us part as friends."  </P> <P> Current leases for the bases, which include giant Clark Air Base and Subic Bay  Naval Base, expire in September, 1991. The "exploratory" talks will determine  whether to start formal negotiations to extend or modify the leases.  </P> <P> The start of the talks was overshadowed by the shooting deaths of two Air Force  enlisted men Sunday night by suspected Communist guerrillas outside Clark. The  dead airmen were identified as John H. Raven, 19, of Delta Junction, Alaska,  and James C. Green, 20, of Craig, Colo.  </P> <P> Secretary of Defense Fidel V. Ramos said he had ordered an "extensive manhunt"  for the killers.  </P> <P> The Communist New People's Army, in a statement, stopped short of claiming  responsibility for the killings, the British news agency Reuters said, but  warned "national traitors" such as President Corazon Aquino that they will be  tried and punished for having "sold your nation to U.S. imperialism."  </P> <P> Reuters also reported that at least 25 police officers and 30 anti-base  protesters were hurt in several violent clashes. At least 80 people were  arrested near the site of the talks.  </P> <P> In Washington, United Press International reported, a coalition of church  groups and a retired naval officer urged the United States to give up the bases  and arrange a two- to three-year transition to ease the shock to the nation's  economy.  </P> <P> The Church Coalition for Human Rights in the Philippines and retired Adm. Gene  La Rocque, head of the Center for Defense Information, said at a news  conference that Clark and Subic Bay do not serve the defense interests of  either the United States or the Philippines.  </P></p>

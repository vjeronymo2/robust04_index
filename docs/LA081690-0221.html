			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TALES FROM THE TRUMP;  </P> <P> PART TWO OF THE DONALD'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY REVEALS SOME OF HIS TRIBULATIONS BUT  PROVES HE STILL REVELS IN HIS 'TOUGH GUY' IMAGE  </P> <P> Maybe you thought the time had come for Donald the midlife philosopher, the  contemplative loner struggling heroically to bring a simple perspective to his  highly chronicled life.  </P> <P> Well, as they say in New York, fawgetaboutit.  </P> <P> Just as his marriage, his business and that most cherished of his possessions,  his name, appear to be in various stages of spectacular destruction, Donald  Trump has provided a breathless nation with the second volume of his  autobiography, "Trump: Surviving at the Top," written with Newsweek senior  writer Charles Leerhsen.  </P> <P> The book, published by Random House, which was rushing 500,000 copies to stores  on Wednesday, delivers the same sophisticated evaluation of life's trials,  temptations and rewards as the wildly best-selling first volume, "The Art of  the Deal." And in a chapter heartwarmingly titled "Trump vs. Trump, Undoing the  Deal," it also delivers Ivana ("My marriage, it seemed, was the only area of my  life in which I was willing to accept something less than perfection") and  Marla ("The beautiful young actress who bore the brunt of the hysterical  publicity, is a terrific person, but my relationship with her was not the cause  of the trouble between Ivana and me").  </P> <P> The Donald writes that he is in pain over the end of his marriage. He racked  his formidable brains trying to find a way to salvage this particular deal.  "This was by no means a snap judgment. I've discussed the situation with many  people. I even thought, briefly, about approaching Ivana with the idea of an  'open marriage.' But I realized there was something hypocritical and tawdry  about such an arrangement that neither of us could live with -- especially  Ivana. She's too much of a lady."  </P> <P> For a book that could properly be devoted to Chapter 11, the real one, which  would be titled "The Art of Filing for Bankruptcy," The Donald sure does have a  rosy way of looking at what others view as his economic troubles.  </P> <P> "The last three years have been a time of extraordinary challenges -- success  and setbacks," Trump writes at the outset, describing what he calls the  foundation of "Phase Two," of his life. "I bought and restored to greatness the  Plaza Hotel, a New York landmark. I acquired the run-down Eastern Shuttle and  made it, as the Trump Shuttle, the best airline of its kind. I erected the  magnificent Taj Mahal, one of the largest casino-hotels in the world -- and a  project that many experts predicted could never be completed."  </P> <P> All true. Yet there are other truths left unexplored in these pages. Most hotel  experts and financiers were astonished at how much Trump paid for the Plaza,  which has been hemorrhaging money so fast that advisers have urged Trump to  unload the debt-laden property. He has been desperately beating the bushes for  somebody to take the money-losing shuttle off his hands. And then there is the  Taj.  </P> <P> Trump's most remarkable monument to himself, with its 3,000 slot machines and  167 gaming tables, implanted in a gaudily splendid Eurocash setting, has  boosted the casino capacity of Atlantic City by 20% since it opened, stealing  clients from his other casinos and teetering mightily in the Northeast's  failing economic climate.  </P> <P> Just Tuesday, The Donald agreed to take on Stephen F. Bollenbach, a nationally  known expert in bailing out troubled companies, as chief financial officer of  the Trump Organization. Not the move of a man clutching the scepter of power  with both hands.  </P> <P> But Trump is still tough. He is appalled by America's decline, and he has bad  words for the Japanese (he describes with relish an incident in which he threw  a rude Japanese businessman out of his office). In a prescient bit of analysis  written long before the current crisis, he calls it "brilliant" that Saudi  Arabia and Kuwait, "countries in which many people live in mansions," stand by  and allow us to police the Persian Gulf for them.  </P> <P> Germans have treated us worse than anyone else, according to Trump. "For two  generations American troops have provided security for West Germany against the  Soviets, but if an American tried to sell a pencil on the street in Germany,  the authorities would practically throw him in jail."  </P> <P> Trump also has a lot to say about celebrities he has encountered. Frank Sinatra  horrified Ivana and Donald at a dinner one night in Monte Carlo by being  boorishly rude to his wife and then treating his fans as if they were scum.  </P> <P> Since you can't libel a dead man, Trump really goes to town on Malcolm Forbes.  He says they never had a good relationship, in part he thinks because his "more  luxurious 282-foot yacht," the Trump Princess, came along and stole the  spotlight from Forbes's formerly legendary 150-foot mini-vessel. But it is  Forbes's way of life that eventually got under Trump's skin.  </P> <P> "I gradually came to see him as a hypocrite who favored those who advertised in  his magazine and tried, with surprising viciousness, to punish those who  didn't. I also saw a double standard in the way he lived openly as a homosexual  -- which he had every right to do -- but expected the media and his famous  friends to cover for him."  </P> <P> Imagine that, a double standard.  </P> <P> But The Donald that emerges from this memoir is a man caught in pursuit of an  unreachable goal. Pleasure eludes him, relaxation is inconceivable. He says  people mistakenly call him greedy because of the way he has amassed real  estate, companies, helicopters, planes and yachts during the past few years.  </P> <P> "But what those critics don't know is that the same assets that excite me in  the chase often, once they are acquired, leave me bored. I probably visited  Mar-a-Lago, my 118-room house in Palm Beach, no more than two dozen times in  the years I've owned it. As for my yacht, the Trump Princess, it is a dazzling  trophy and a terrific business tool, but it never really became part of my  personal life."  </P> <P> We may be seeing a whole new Trump for Volume 3. He says celebrity takes its  toll on a man, and points to Howard Hughes, a wealthy man who led a slightly  less public life than Trump has so far.  </P> <P> "The Howard Hughes story is fascinating to me because it shows that it's  possible to fall very far very fast. As time goes on, I find myself thinking  more and more about (Hughes) and even, to some degree, identifying with him."  </P> <P> So one of these days maybe The Donald will decide to slip into a suite at the  Plaza and just stay there, another celebrity running from the crowd that adores  him.  </P></p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Foreign orders lift German gloom The gloom enveloping German industry lifted further yesterday with reports of rising foreign demand in the key mechanical engineering and electrical and electronics sectors. New orders for plant and machinery rose in October for the first time since March 1992, according to the VDMA industry association. While there was little sign of recovery in the domestic market, where November engineering orders were 3 per cent lower than a year earlier, the association said foreign demand surged a real 17 per cent. A comparison of the three months to the end of October, a measure which reduces the distorting effects of single large orders, showed total new orders down 5 per cent on a year earlier. A 6 per cent increase in export demand was more than cancelled out by a 12 per cent drop in German orders. Meanwhile, Mr Franz-Josef Wissing, chief executive of the ZVEI association, representing electrical and electronics companies with annual sales of DM200bn (Dollars 118bn) said yesterday the low point of the recession had been reached. Improving trends in electrical exports, first detected in the spring, had consolidated in the third quarter, Mr Wissing said. Foreign orders had climbed almost 7 per cent in the three months to the end of September compared with an aggregate rise of less than 2 per cent for the first three quarters. Foreign demand for electronic components, an important early indicator, had risen 18.5 per cent in the third quarter, while power generation and distribution orders were up 11 per cent. A 25 per cent slump in domestic demand for measuring and automation technology in the year to the end of September, highlighted the severe difficulties still being experienced by some parts of the electrical industry. However, a sustained improvement in the mechanical engineering sector, an important area for automation technology manufacturers, could help improve the situation. Mr Wissing said capacity utilisation had fallen further to 78 per cent. Together with continuing pressure on prices this was eating into the industry's profits.</p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / UK offers Pounds 15m development aid to Vietnam BRITAIN yesterday agreed to give Vietnam Pounds 15m to help in the development of management expertise and infrastructure following President Clinton's decision to end a US block on loans from international financial institutions. Mr Vo Van Kiet, Vietnam's prime minister, yesterday met Mr John Major, his British counterpart, as part of a four-day visit to Britain which took place in a new atmosphere of optimism about business prospects following Mr Clinton's announcement last Friday. Mr Kiet held talks with Lady Chalker, minister for overseas development, Lord Wakeham, Lord Privy Seal, Mr John MacGregor, secretary of state for transport, and Mr Eddie George, Bank of England governor. He has also met executives of British Petroleum, British Aerospace, British Gas and John Laing, the construction group, as well as many other British businessmen. Britain, one of the leading investors in Vietnam, mostly in the oil and gas sector, hopes to win an important role in carrying out urgently needed improvements to Vietnam's infrastructure which will be funded by loans from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank once the ban on multilateral lending is lifted as a result of the latest Washington move. The UK is granting Pounds 5m for a programme to train managers in industry and finance, and will make Pounds 10m available to fund consultants who will help Vietnam to establish priorities in infrastructure projects. Non-US companies may have a temporary advantage in winning Vietnamese business since Mr Clinton has given the go-ahead for international financing but has not yet lifted a US trade embargo. However, this may be short-lived. The International Monetary Fund's executive board is expected next week to approve a plan for repayment of Vietnam's arrears to the fund, but an IMF programme - a pre-requisite for other multilateral lending - is unlikely to be in place until the autumn. Some European officials expect Mr Clinton not to extend the embargo when it comes up for renewal in September. He will come under strong pressure from US business to lift the ban.</p>

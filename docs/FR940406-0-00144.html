For the engine families that are included in the Production AMA Durability Program, the exhaust emission deterioration factors used to determine compliance shall be those that the Administrator has approved under &sect;86.094&hyph;13. The evaporative emission deterioration factor for each evaporative /refueling emission family shall be determined and applied according to paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(B) of this section. The refueling emission deterioration factor for each evaporative/refueling emission family shall be determined and applied according to paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(C) of this section. The procedures to determine the minimum exhaust emission deterioration factors required under &sect;86.094&hyph;13(d) are as described in paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section and &sect;86.094&hyph;28 (a)(7)(ii).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Separate deterioration factors shall be determined from the exhaust emission results of the durability data vehicles for each emission standard applicable under &sect;86.098&hyph;8, for each engine family group.

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Russia softens its stance on role of CSCE Russia yesterday appeared prepared to back down on its proposal to transform the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe into the continent's most powerful security structure. Speaking at the opening of a two-month CSCE review conference in Budapest, Mr Yuri Ouchakov, the head of the Russian delegation, said the CSCE should be the 'major moving force in European security' but that there was no need to set up a 'hierarchical system'. Since May, Russian officials have proposed that the CSCE become Europe's top security organisation, subsuming Nato and the Commonwealth of Independent States. The strengthened organisation would be headed by a United Nations-style 10-nation steering committee and would mandate Nato or CIS forces to intervene in regional conflicts. The idea to strengthen the CSCE followed Russian concerns that its influence in Europe was being undermined by Nato. Unlike other former communist states in eastern Europe, Russia has been given little hope by the west that it will eventually join Nato or the European Union. However, the proposal to strengthen the 53-nation CSCE, which includes European and CIS countries, the US and Canada, has been rejected out of hand by western nations, including the UK and the US. Mr Sam Brown, the US delegate, said Mr Ouchakov's statement showed flexibility on the part of the Russians and recognition that its proposals were not possible in the present situation. He said the US would welcome strengthening the CSCE, but it should remain one of a number of security structures. It was important the organisation continued to make decisions by consensus among all members rather than through a leading body. The future role of the CSCE, which was set up under Russian proposals following the 1975 Helsinki conference, is expected to dominate the two-month conference which will end with a summit in December. The organisation, which has few permanent staff and a small budget, is credited with a significant role in ending the cold war but has since struggled to define itself or play a useful role in preventing conflicts. Mr Brown said CSCE members were still far from reaching agreement over 'peace-keeping' activities by member states. Russia is asking for a CSCE mandate to act as mediator and peacekeeper in disputes in former Soviet states. Mr Brown said that if Russia wanted international approval for such activities it would have to be genuinely and independently invited to intervene in conflicts and its intervention would have to be for a limited duration and with clear goals. These conditions had not yet been accepted by the Russians, he said. The US also welcomed statements by EU representatives that CSCE goals could be underpinned by greater economic co-operation between western Europe and former communist states in transition to a market economy. He said the US had long recognised this principle as of 'fundamental importance' for the future security of Europe. Germany, speaking for the EU, also proposed strengthening the CSCE by suggesting members use its conflict-resolution mechanisms.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Northumberland Tec opens Pounds 10m business training centre THE BIGGEST capital project undertaken by a Training and Enterprise Council, a Pounds 10m business training centre described as Britain's first commercial campus, will be inaugurated today. Northumberland Tec has bought Longhirst, a listed mansion in 45 acres of parkland near Morpeth, for management training and business education. Tecs deliver government-funded training schemes in England and Wales, Longhirst Hall, built in 1824, is to be refurbished and run from September next year by the Tec as a management training and conference centre. The Northumberland Tec will also build a business college for the expanding University of Northumbria at Newcastle, formerly Newcastle Polytechnic. The college, opening in stages from September, will offer degree, diploma and certificate courses in business studies, management, marketing and accountancy for 600 full-time and part-time students, with a target of 1,000 by 2000. Proposed developments include a block of 75 bedrooms for the management training centre, housing for 200 university students and a business innovation centre with start-up units. The Tec's budget this year is Pounds 17.5m, of which Pounds 15.5m is from government sources. It is putting around Pounds 2m of its operating surplus into the project and has also arranged bank loans. Longhirst was bought for just under Pounds 1m. To meet its Pounds 10m target, it is looking for private finance and European funding and is negotiating for venture capital.</p>

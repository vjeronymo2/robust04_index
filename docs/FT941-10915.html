			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (11): Volumes skyrocket - Malaysia In terms of market capitalisation, Kuala Lumpur is now the largest market by far in south-east Asia. As the index of the KL market raced upwards in 1993, finishing the year nearly 100 per cent up on January, total market capitalisation increased more than 150 per cent to nearly MDollars 600bn (Dollars 225bn). The top 10 companies on the KL exchange account for about 45 per cent of total market capitalisation: the top two, Tenaga Nasional, the partially privatised electricity utility, and Telekom, the telecommunications company, account for 17 per cent of the market. Kuala Lumpur has become known as one of the world's more exciting - and volatile - markets. In common with many Asian markets, large amounts of foreign funds - mainly from the US - flooded into Malaysia in early 1993. Retail investors within the country followed the foreign lead and now account for about 70 per cent of trading volumes. As a result of the increased liquidity in the market trading volumes have skyrocketed: in January 1993 Kuala Lumpur's average daily turnover was MDollars 200m. In the first week of 1994 average daily turnover was around the MDollars 4bn mark. Such growth in market activity has created regulatory and logistical problems. KL is moving towards a scripless trading system. At times the present mixed system has been unable to cope. There have been several cases of share scrip going missing. There have been allegations of syndicates rigging share prices, particularly on the second board, the focus of much of the retail trading. As in many Asian countries, politics and business in Malaysia are closely related. Stock assessments often focus on a particular company's political connections rather than on its balance sheet. In March 1993, a Securities Commission was appointed to take action against market abuses. 'The Securities Commission wants people to make money,' said Mr Mohamad Munir, its chairman. 'However, they should not make mischief.' Some market abusers have been brought to court. The authorities have also insisted on more transparency in share transactions and better disclosure - often a problem within tightly run, mostly Chinese, family companies. Meanwhile, brokers have been told to improve their back-office operations to deal with sudden surges in volume. Foreign ownership: Foreigners have to check on the shareholding limitations of particular companies. A limit of 30 per cent on foreign ownership applies to many of the older listings. But on newer listings deemed to be strategic companies by the government - such as Tenaga and Telekom - the limit for foreign ownership is 25 per cent. However, on some companies, particularly those listed on the second board, there is no ceiling on foreign ownership. Share acquisitions of more than MDollars 5m or of 15 per cent of a company have to be first approved by the government's foreign investment committee. Foreign exchange/repatriation: While Malaysia operates foreign exchange controls these are fairly liberal. Profits, dividends, capital, royalties, fees and commissions can be freely transferred abroad in any currency. The Central Bank requires forms to be filled in for payments above MDollars 10,000: this is principally designed to monitor monetary flows in and out of the country. Foreign investors do not need special permission to invest in Malaysian shares. There is a 34 per cent tax on income from dividends. A 20 per cent withholding tax is imposed on foreigners whose countries do not have double taxation agreements with Malaysia. Settlement procedures and other regulations: Settlement has to be completed within seven days of the transaction on normal or 'ready' deals. The regular trading lot is 1,000 shares.</p>

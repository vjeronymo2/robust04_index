			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Stock Purchase Agreement and escrow Agreement will also provide that in the event that required third party consents with respect to at least three QF projects (including at least one of Project No. 1 or Project No. 2) are obtained, the Closing would occur, provided the other Closing conditions are satisfied. In such event, the Purchase Price would be reduced, based upon an agreed upon valuation of the QF projects which would be retained by Sellers (``Unsold Projects'') and either retained in the existing entities or transferred to a separate entity (``Unsold Project Corps.'') EII would retain until December 31, 1994 the exclusive right to continue to seek such remaining third party consents and purchase the related Unsold Projects or the Unsold Project Corps. stock at the initially agreed upon price. After that date, the Escrow Agreement would be terminated with respect to the Unsold Projects, the balance of the Escrow Cash (representing the unpaid Purchase Price relating to the Unsold Projects) would be refunded to GPU and the stock of the Unsold Project Corps. returned to Sellers. EII would then have a non-exclusive right until December 31, 1995 to purchase the Unsold Project Corps. stock or, alternatively, its interests in any of the Unsold Projects at the initially agreed upon price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, as noted below, in order to comply with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (``FERC's'') 50% limitation on electric utility ownership under PURPA, it will be necessary for EII to provide for the sale, at the Closing, or at least a 50% ownership interest in Project No. 1 since 100% of that project is currently indirectly owned by Cogen Corp. In the event such sale cannot be so accomplished, EII's purchase of Project No. 1 at the Closing would be effectively limited to 50% thereof and the balance of the Project No. 1 ownership would be retained by Sellers and together with a portion ($7 million) of the $10 million Purchase Price related thereto would continue to be held by the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement or pursuant to another arrangement agreed by the parties. EII would retain an irrevocable option or similar right to effect the sale of such remaining 50% interest within 12 months of the signing of the Stock Purchase Agreement. If EII is unable to do so, the Project No. 1 interest would be returned to Sellers and the related escrowed Purchase Price amount refunded to GPU.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accrued interest on the Escrow Cash would be payable to GPU except to the extent the Closing is delayed due solely to the failure to satisfy a specified closing condition, in which case such accrued interest for the period of the delay attributable to the condition failure and until the Closing would be payable to Sellers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following the execution of the Stock Purchase and escrow Agreements and pending the Closing, EII and Sellers would jointly manage Cogen Corp's. business and operations subject to certain restrictions and limitations set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement. EII and Sellers would share equally in Cogen Corp's. expenses incurred from March 1, 1994 until the earlier of the Closing or the date the Escrow Agreement is otherwise terminated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

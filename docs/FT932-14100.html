			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / International Company News: German toolmakers announce merger MAHO and Friedrich Deckel, two of Germany's leading machine-tool manufacturers, are to merge. Both companies are making losses, and the merger is an attempt to survive the current downturn in what used to be one of Germany's strongest manufacturing sectors. The merger follows several months of talks between the two companies and is subject to the approval of Germany's cartel authorities. The combined companies will have a market share of 35 to 40 per cent in Germany in certain sectors, for example, milling and boring machines. Maho had originally planned to build a strategic alliance with Traub, another large machine-tools company, but this plan was abandoned last month and Traub announced a co-operation agreement with Berthold Hermle, producer of milling and boring tools. The merger is part of a trend in the industry which has forced several companies together during the past year as economic conditions have worsened. The companies said the merger would allow them to secure their competitive position in international markets. Maho, based in Pfronten in south Germany, lost DM157m (Dollars 97.5m) in the year to the end of June 1992 on sales down 31 per cent to DM442m; the company is expecting to make losses of at least DM45m during the current year despite extensive rationalisation measures. Munich-based Deckel lost DM75m last year on sales down from DM406m to DM290m. The German machine-tool sector is suffering from a sharp fall in demand, reflecting the cutback in investment which has characterised industry's reaction to recession worldwide. Production fell 13 per cent in 1991 and 17 per cent last year, and is expected to fall further this year to less than half the record level of 1989.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department further believes that permitting a three year phase-in period for existing accounts is appropriate. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  It is a fair way to apply aggregate accounting requirements to existing escrow accounts. During the three year phase-in period, a considerable number of existing escrow accounts will likely be terminated as residential property is sold or mortgages are refinanced and new escrow accounts established. The three-year requirement sets an appropriate balance between sensitivity to servicer expectations regarding the price of servicing and concern that the desired policy is implemented for consumers as quickly as reasonable. The three year phase-in period provides a specific date when all escrow accounts are subject to aggregate accounting requirements. HUD acknowledges that servicers may have purchased servicing rights at premiums based, among other things, on the expectation of doing single-item accounting. However, because HUD has provided notice nearly four years in advance of the conversion date, the pricing of servicing will adjust accordingly (if it has not already).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Until the conversion date for pre-rule accounts, both single-item (individual-item) analysis and aggregate analysis methods are acceptable accounting methods, as are accounting methods that combine characteristics of both the foregoing methods (sometimes termed ``hybrid accounting methods''), as long as use of any such method does not result in payments or cushions in excess of those that result from escrow account analysis using the single-item analysis method. For post-rule accounts, aggregate analysis is the only acceptable accounting method to conduct escrow account analysis to ensure compliance with the limits imposed by this regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Interest on Escrow Accounts and Single-Item Escrow Accounts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters asked whether the final rule would address interest on escrow accounts. Seven commenters suggested that the rule specifically exempt servicers that either pay interest on escrow accounts or service only one escrow item. These commenters believed that a required interest payment on escrow account balances would create a disincentive to servicers to over-escrow.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After considering the comments, the Department determines that it will not create the requested exemptions. The Department does not interpret Section 10 of RESPA as providing the Department with legal authority to require payment of interest on escrow accounts. Where interest is required, it is a matter of State law, with fourteen States requiring that some amount of interest be paid on escrow account funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Where there is only one escrow account item in the escrow account, there is no difference in the outcome between these two accounting methods. Nonetheless, HUD believes it appropriate for escrow accounts with only one escrow item to conform to the rule requirements. To enhance industry standardization, HUD applies the final rule to all escrow accounts involving a federally related mortgage loan, regardless of the number of escrow account items within the escrow account.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Termination of Escrow Accounts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters asked HUD to address whether a borrower could terminate his/her escrow account when the loan was paid down to a certain amount (similar to provisions included in a proposed escrow account reform bill introduced in Congress). The Department believes it has no authority under Section 10 to regulate when a borrower may terminate an escrow account based on a loan-to-value ratio or otherwise. HUD encourages borrowers to turn to the mortgage documents for guidance. Additionally, major secondary market purchasers have established standards for termination of escrow accounts. Also, a borrower may simply ask the servicer to exercise discretion in terminating an escrow account.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Annual Escrow Account Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters requested that HUD clarify its terms or definitions to be consistent with industry terminology, the National Affordable Housing Act (Pub. L. 101&hyph;625, approved November 28, 1990) (NAHA), or terms used by other Federal agencies. Thirteen commenters requested clarification of the term ``annual escrow account statement''. Many commenters thought that the Department had commingled the requirements for the annual escrow account statement, as set forth in NAHA, with the requirements for an annual escrow analysis. The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) recommended that ``HUD retain the definition of annual escrow account statement as defined in the proposed rule for escrow account statements published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 9, 1991.'' (56 FR 64445.) The MBA argued that the previous definition would alleviate any confusion about the timing of the annual escrow account statements and annual escrow analysis. In addition, the MBA stated that the previous definition of ``annual escrow account statement'' took into account the industry practice of generally performing escrow analyses after the largest escrow account item was paid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD defines an annual escrow account statement as a statement containing the information required in &sect;3500.17(i) that a servicer must submit to the borrower within 30 days of the end of the escrow account computation year. This definition comports with the MBA recommendation. The comments correctly observed that the annual statements and the escrow account analysis are ``commingled.'' HUD considers an escrow account analysis necessary to make the annual escrow account statement meaningful. Thus, the rule clearly requires the servicer to conduct an escrow account analysis at the end of the escrow account computation year. However, the final rule provides servicers with flexibility in setting the escrow account computation year. HUD's rule therefore allows the industry to continue the practice of conducting the escrow analysis after paying the largest escrow account item.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Cushion and Pre-Accrual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nine commenters requested clarification of the definitions of cushion and pre-accrual. The proposed rule defined the cushion to mean funds that a servicer could require a borrower to pay into an escrow account to cover unanticipated disbursements or to cover disbursements made before the borrower's payments are available in the account. The proposed rule defined ``pre-accrual'' to be a practice that some servicers employed under which funds needed for disbursement from an escrow account are required to be on deposit in the account at a date prior to the disbursement date. Both terms were subject to the limitations of paragraph (c) of the section. Paragraph (c)(6) of the proposed rule prohibited the use of pre-accrual on post-rule accounts and limited its use on pre-rule accounts to within the limits set in paragraph (c)(4). Commenters stated that the pre-accrual disallowance language in the proposed &sect;3500.17(c)(6) effectively modified previously allowable cushions. This was HUD's intent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD received 30 comments questioning HUD's prohibition of pre-accrual practices for post-rule accounts. Many commented that HUD had long accepted pre-accrual as a legal methodology for analyzing escrow balances. Seventeen commented that servicers may be discouraged from establishing escrow accounts because of the increased costs and prohibitions against pre-accrual practices. They stated that if servicers ceased handling escrow accounts, some borrowers would be delinquent in their tax payments and the taxing authorities would experience greater administrative expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department believes that pre-accrual practices allow servicers to acquire the equivalent of up to another month of cushion in the escrow account. Coupled with a cushion of greater than one month, a pre-accrual practice could result in escrow account balances that exceed RESPA's limits. HUD believes that the cushion provides sufficient extra funds to cover unanticipated disbursements or disbursements made before the borrower's payments are available in the account. Therefore, pre-accrual is unnecessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rule eliminates the use of pre-accrual on all new accounts. Generally, for existing escrow accounts, a servicer may not require any pre-accrual that exceeds one month or that results in an account balance larger than the limits set forth in &sect;3500.17(c). In addition, the Department considered the arguments of servicers who claimed they would discontinue handling escrow accounts under the proposed rule. The Department concludes that servicers are unlikely to abandon the practice of handling escrow accounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Disbursement Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Forty-two commenters (25 mortgage companies, 11 banks, 2 associations, 3 attorneys, and Fannie Mae) requested clarification of the definition of disbursement date. Fannie Mae's response noted that the proposed disbursement date definition permits the payment to occur ``*&blank;*&blank;* without regard to the lender's normal lending practice or local custom or prudent lending practice.'' Further, several commenters suggested that the proposed definition does not reflect that the disbursement date may be in a month or in a period prior to the month it is due, in order to take advantage of discounts. GE Capital Mortgage Services, Inc. stated that ``although HUD may not have intended to require a disbursement date to always be in the same calendar month as the due date, the language could be read to require this.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

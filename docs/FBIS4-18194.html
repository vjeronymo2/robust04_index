			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ruediger Moniac: "Europe Will Get Eyes in </F> Space--If Germany Pays; Its Own Reconnaissance Satellites Are  Supposed To Create Independence From the United States"]    [Text] The endeavor to make Europe into an independently  acting entity is making progress, especially in the use of space  for gaining information, an area in which France has  traditionally coveted independence. The utility of space ranges  from the commitment of armed forces to the achievement of  general political objectives (such as observation of the  environment, exploration of natural resources, surveillance of  borders, and inaccessible regions).    On 13 May, the agenda of the Council of Ministers of the  Western European Union [WEU] includes consideration of the  decision to pursue the development of an independent European  system of observation satellites. A report on implementation  possibilities has already been completed; everybody is waiting  for Bonn. The Federal Republic has to decide before the May  session whether it wants to commit considerable capital to such  an "Eyes in Space" system.    One argument frequently heard in Germany is: Why spend so  much money on European satellite-supported reconnaissance, when  we can rely on our American partners. The United States own the  most efficient systems and German government offices have  received information from U.S. sources on specific occasions.    However, the whole truth includes the fact that this is  based  on reciprocity. The United States expect something in return.  However, such a policy is not permanently compatible with the  interests of European countries since the United States is  currently redefining its foreign and defense policy priorities  while Europe wants to play a partnership role in the  Euro-Atlantic structure on the basis of independence.    Europe needs an independent capability to receive unfiltered  information and to assess developments outside its borders.  Meanwhile Defense Minister Ruehe in a white book released this  week by the Cabinet has also accepted this view. This document  contains the following clause: "For the early recognition of  regional crises,...and to defend its interests in developing  joint plans within alliances and the United Nations, the Federal  Government requires an accurate, up-to-date view of the  situation." This calls for various types of information,  including information gained from satellites: Reconnaissance to  assist in the formulation of policy, not in lieu of policy  decisions.    Here is an example from 1986: For several days uncertainty  prevailed whether a second nuclear power plant in Chernobyl was  threatened with meltdown. If European countries had possessed  satellites with multispectral sensors, there would have been no  uncertainty and the European countries could have taken  precautionary measures based on information thus gained.    However, the Federal Republic is still undecided which  department should become "responsible" for such an observation  system since there is, so to speak, no "natural and primary  user" for this type of information. Independent experts,  therefore, have suggested appointing an intergovernmental  commission, which reports to the office of the chancellor, to  prepare for the decision in May and to develop guidelines for  reorganization within the government. Time is passing rapidly.  The two specific issues are 20-percent participation in the  Helios 2 Project (daylight observations) developed by France  and, second, majority participation (50 percent or more) for a  high-resolution radar reconnaissance satellite. Because of its  technological capabilities as well as its political status in  Europe's center, no other power is as suited as Germany for an  SAR system (active microwave radar). The cost? It has not been  accurately determined. Experts say: In the initial phase  "several hundred million a year."</p>

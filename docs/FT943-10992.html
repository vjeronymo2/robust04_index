			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Major's position concentrates state power Sir, I listened carefully to the prime minister's speech to the European Policy Forum on the limits of the state ('Major vows to limit role of state', July 28). Despite your editorial's lukewarm comments ('Major's soliloquy'), it may go down as an historic moment. For Mr Major claimed that there should be no change to Britain's constitution: no new constitutional settlement whether with respect to Europe, to Scotland and Wales, in making quangos accountable or even a Bill of Rights. Across the board he opposed positions recently reaffirmed as Labour policy by Tony Blair, in his Cardiff speech. It is strange that such fundamental differences are so poorly reported. If, for example, the leading American presidential candidate were to demand changing the US constitution with respect to the Bill of Rights and state powers, the clash would gain more coverage in UK media than the identical, but real, dispute does in our own country. Mr Major described how the role of the state always grows unless checked - and that he wished to check it. But there is a striking irony in his approach, for he will not allow people themselves to check the power of the state. A Bill of Rights could give the public the possibility of redress against the overweening authority of an increasingly arbitrary executive. Regional autonomy could limit the powers of the executive as well as encourage economic initiative. A third example helps make the point most clearly. Mr Major celebrated the publication of information on different branches of education and the health service as helping to ensure better service and more efficiency. And I agree, the starting point for accountability must be clear comparative information on what public services deliver. But who decides what to publish? Surely not the state itself. We need a Freedom of Information Act - something Mr Major's government has set its face against. Such an act would give the public the right to try to limit wrongful use of authority, for example by asking who is being appointed to quangos, and why. The prime minister presents himself as a constitutional conservative. But he is concentrating, not limiting, the powers exercised by government. In doing so he is undermining its legitimacy. The next election, therefore, may well be fought between two constitutional revolutionaries. Those who wish to draw upon and preserve traditions of fairness and local initiative as well as good government will do best to heed the open radicalism of the opposition parties, and should not allow themselves to be bemused by the low-key rhetoric of Mr Major into thinking he represents the viable status quo.

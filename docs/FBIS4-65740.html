			<p>BFN     [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis has said explicitly that  he will not agree to discuss any changes to the 21 March UN  document on the confidence-building measures. He said: I have  accepted this document. Either Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf  Denktas accepts it too, or we don't play anymore. Kliridhis  clarified that he has not been informed that the United Nations  has accepted any changes to the UN document, as reported by the  Turkish Cypriot press.    The president was speaking this afternoon after meeting AKEL  [Restorative Party of the Working People] Secretary General  Dhimitrios Khristofias, in his series of meetings to brief the  political leaders before the National Council convenes.  Kliridhis said if measures are taken to make the Turkish side  show willingness for a solution, then the substance of the  Cyprus issue will be discussed.    Khristofias said he and Kliridhis agreed that after the  failure of the talks on the confidence-building measures the  process must return to the substance of the Cyprus issue, but on  the condition that Denktas and Ankara are forced to abandon  their intransigent stance. He added that the UN Security  Council must make decisions about drastic measures to bend  Turkish intransigence, but expressed reservations about this  possibility.</p>

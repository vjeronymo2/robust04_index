			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hopes of government support lift Nikkei SHARE PRICES jumped on reports that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) had announced measures to support the stock market, and the Nikkei average recouped the 22,000 level for the first time since January 10, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average closed up 465.38 to 22,023.05, gaining 4.5 per cent on the week. The index opened at the day's low of 21,620.40 and hit the day's high of 22,343.22 in the afternoon session. Volume rose to 330m shares from 250m, exceeding 300m for the first time since December 13. Trading was dominated by dealers and arbitrage activity.

The index firmed at the opening on arbitrage buying, but then surged on news that Mr Tamisuke Watanuki, secretary general of the LDP, had expressed concern over the adverse effects the faltering stock market was having on the economy. He proposed that the party should prepare its own measures to revitalise the market, including urging companies to increase dividend payments and reducing tax on securities trading. Some traders said that the proposals did not offer immediate support. 'The market needed an excuse to buy,' said Miss Caroline Stone at Barclays de Zoete Wedd.

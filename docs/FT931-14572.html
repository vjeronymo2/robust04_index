			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / SFO chief sees bigger role for City tribunals FINANCIAL CRIMES are likely to be prosecuted more often by City tribunals rather than through the criminal courts, according to the Serious Fraud Office, which is responsible for investigating and prosecuting complex and serious fraud. The City's self-regulatory organisations each have tribunals with the power to prosecute firms and individuals for breaches of their rules. Mr George Staple, the SFO's director, said: 'In the past we have not given sufficient weight to the City's separate regulatory regime.' He refused to comment on specific cases, but there has been widespread criticism of the SFO's decisions to prosecute all defendants in the Blue Arrow and Guinness cases through the criminal courts. Some lawyers believe aspects of those cases might have been more effectively prosecuted through City tribunals. The Securities and Futures Authority, the regulator of the securities industry, has a tribunal with powers to disqualify firms and individuals from practising in the City and to levy unlimited fines, although there is a Pounds 50,000 limit on the amount it can force a defendant to pay in restitution to anyone suffering as a result of a breach. An executive with the authority said its tribunal had been used 'seven or eight times' in the past couple of years, but not in any of the recent high-profile fraud cases. A City tribunal could only have been used in the Guinness and Blue Arrow cases - or in any case of serious financial malpractice - with the SFO's permission. According to Mr Staple a tribunal cannot operate if the SFO decides to mount a criminal prosecution, because it might prejudice the criminal hearing. The advantage of a tribunal, Mr Staple said, was that the judge was an expert and the level of proof required for a successful prosecution was less than in a criminal court. He wanted a tribunal to have 'full powers' to award compensation to a victim. He stressed that courts would be used for cases of serious fraud involving City firms or individuals. The powers of City tribunals to prosecute and punish are being examined by Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, as part of the government-sponsored review of UK financial regulation. Mr Staple said there was an argument for giving SIB civil powers to prosecute alleged insider dealers. He was opposed to decriminalising the offence, even though there had been calls from City practitioners for this and widespread criticisms of the government's proposed new insider-dealing legislation. Reformed City tribunals might play a role if plea bargaining is introduced as an option in fraud cases, as Mr Staple has recommended. Mr Staple said that in an appropriate case a plea of guilty from an individual in a criminal case could bring him or her a lesser prison sentence than might otherwise be expected, or a conditional discharge. The conditions of the discharge might include payment of a substantial fine, full co-operation with any continuing investigation, regulatory penalties imposed by an SRO such as ceasing to do business in a market, or restitution to the victim. Mr Staple also called for a simplification of the financial regulatory system. 'If the law (including its institutions) is unclear, people will find ways round it'.</p>

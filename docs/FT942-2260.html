			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Spain - Banking, Finance and Investment (8): Closure costly / Causes celebres, Gillette After 27 years making razor-blades in Spain, Gillette of the US decided to close its factory. Three months later, the Spanish authorities have yet to accept the logic of it. Gillette's announcement sparked a controversy out of proportion to the size of the plant, just outside Seville, where the workforce had already shrunk to less than 250. There were three factors behind this. One was that Gillette was sacrificing Seville in order to concentrate production for the European market in the UK and Germany - much like Hoover's fiercely-contested decision last year to move vacuum-cleaner production from Dijon in eastern France to Scotland. Secondly, the closure announcement coincided with pre-election tensions in the ruling Socialist party's stronghold of Andalucia, a region with a fragile and under-developed industrial sector and high unemployment. The Gillette workers' cause was immediately linked with that of the 'Santaneros' at Suzuki's threatened Santana subsidiary. Both cases involve facilities which flourished at a time of high import barriers but which have not been adapted to meet the competitive demands of an open European market. The difference between them - and the third factor fuelling the row - is that Gillette has up to now been profitable. Alberto Morales, general manager of the Seville subsidiary, says Gillette simply does not need the factory. The technology there is obsolete, and its production can easily be taken over by the other plants without expanding their capacity. 'The machines we have here won't go to England or Germany because they have enough,' he says. Both the Madrid government and the regional authorities say that even under the more flexible conditions of Spain's newly-revised labour legislation Gillette lacks legal grounds for seeking redundancies through the normal procedures. Gillette's only option for achieving its plan is a negotiated deal for paying off its workers. The labour reforms, aimed at removing disincentives to investment and job creation, will make it somewhat easier for companies to adjust their workforces, giving them more leeway to make reductions when necessary and speeding up the red tape involved. But redundancy compensation costs remain well above those in most other European countries. Companies tend to offer the upper level of 45 days pay per year of service in order to avoid costly court cases. To achieve previous reductions, Gillette has paid this amount, plus a bonus of Pta1m for every five years of service. But even so, it has had difficulty finding takers because of the scarcity of alternative jobs in southern Spain. Its closure plan is likely to be costlier still.</p>

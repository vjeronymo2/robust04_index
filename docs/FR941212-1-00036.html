Section 1.28 is proposed to be amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1.28 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Effect on fees of failure to establish status, or change status, as a small entity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The failure to establish status as a small entity (&sect;&sect;1.9(f) and 1.27 of this part) in any application or patent prior to paying, or at the time of paying, any fee precludes payment of the fee in the amount established for small entities. A refund pursuant to &sect;1.26 of this part, based on establishment of small entity status, of a portion of fees timely paid in full prior to establishing status as a small entity may only be obtained if a verified statement under &sect;1.27 and a request for a refund of the excess amount are filed within two months of the date of the timely payment of the full fee. The two-month time period is not extendable under &sect;1.136. Status as a small entity is waived for any fee by the failure to establish the status prior to paying, at the time of paying, or within two months of the date of payment of, the fee. Status as a small entity must be specifically established [by a verified statement filed] in each application or patent in which the status is available and desired[, except those applications filed under &sect;1.60 or &sect;1.62 of this part where the status as a small entity has been established in a parent application and is still proper]. >Status as a small entity in one application or patent does not affect any other application or patent, including applications or patents which are directly or indirectly dependent upon the application or patent in which the status has been established. Applications filed as continuations, divisions or continuations-in-part of a parent application must include a reference to a verified statement in the parent application or include a copy of the verified statement filed in the parent application if status as a small entity is still proper and desired.&lt; Once status as a small entity has been established in an application or patent, the status remains in that application or patent without the filing of a further verified statement pursuant to &sect;1.27 of this part unless the Office is notified of a change in status. [Status as a small entity in one application or patent does not affect any other application or patent, including applications or patents which are directly or indirectly dependent upon the application or patent in which the status has been established, except those filed under &sect;1.60 or &sect;1.62 of this part. Applications filed under &sect;1.60 or &sect;1.62 of this part must include a reference to a verified statement in a parent application if status as a small entity is still proper and desired.] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 10.

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Survey of Toulouse and the Midi-Pyrenees (5): Test of economic strength - The region is suffering the 'unemployment of growth' The recession which has blighted the French economy since the end of 1992 has not spared the Midi-Pyrenees. In Toulouse, as elsewhere in the region, unemployment has risen to the national average of just over 12 per cent as contraction in the international aerospace industry has compounded the pressures facing traditional textiles, mining and agricultural industries. But just as the region surrounding Toulouse retains a sense of cultural and political autonomy - stemming from its historical role as a powerful and distant provincial city - so its economy possesses its own peculiarities. Its strength in high technology, for example, suggests that the economy's foundations may not be as badly shaken as cities elsewhere and that Toulouse and the Midi-Pyrenees may be better placed to resume expansion once the economic environment improves. The particular nature of the local economy is reflected in its employment trends. Mr Robert Marconis, an expert in regional development at the University of Toulouse-Mirail, describes the rise of joblessness in the city and its environs as 'the unemployment of growth'. Unlike northern France, he argues, where jobs have been lost through large-scale redundancies, Toulouse has continued to create employment and has drawn economic migrants to the regional capital. Between 1982 and 1990, for example, the population of the city and its environs swelled by about 100,000 - partly as a result of people from outside seeking job opportunities in the area. A second, equally important characteristic of the regional economy is the importance of cyclical rather than structural problems in its industries. A case in point is the aerospace industry which, with Aerospatiale, Airbus and a host of sub-contractors is one of the most important manufacturing sectors in the region. When the international aerospace industry sneezes, Toulouse and its environs  -with more than 30,000 employees in the sector - catch cold. The deep chill which has afflicted aircraft orders over the past few years has had a significant effect. Aerospatiale, for example, plans to reduce staff in the region by between 700 and 800 this year in response to declining orders and losses of FFr3.8bn in 1992 and 1993. But the problems facing the aerospace sector are likely to prove temporary. 'We have seen the worst of the downturn and we can expect recovery sometime between 1996 and 1997,' says Mr Bernard Keller, director of communications at Aerospatiale and a member of the regional development committee. The resistance of the Toulouse economy has also been helped by a nascent, if growing, diversification. The electronics and software industries have established themselves in the region, while the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals sectors are currently expanding in Toulouse and nearby. For the region's older industries, however, the situation is more difficult. Textiles have been hit hard by the impact of cheap imports, notably from Asia, although Mr Jean-Pierre Gilly, a research director at LEREP, the economics research centre, argues that many companies have been able to fight back through the introduction of higher value added products and relatively high productivity. In mining and metallurgy, the downturn has been less equivocal. Over the past 20 years, the mines in the Albi-Carmaux area have seen employment fall from almost 7,000 to about 300 today. The depressed aluminium market and the removal of the price advantage of hydro-electricity following the establishment of nationwide energy prices by Electricite de France, have raised a serious question mark over the regional operations of Pechiney, the state-owned aluminium group. In areas with declining traditional industries, the response has been to diversify and to implement policies of reconversion. In Albi, for example, Adirac, a development organisation which groups local government and industry bodies, has created 2,000 jobs over the past nine years. It has done so partly through Sofirem, a venture capital organisation, which has provided funding to local companies. Albi, unlike much of the the Midi-Pyrenees, has the benefit of an industrial tradition. Elsewhere, the lack of an entrepreneurial or industrial background represents an obstacle to the creation of new enterprises. 'We never had an industrial bourgeoisie here compared with some other cities such as Lyon,' says Mr Marconis. He says the region remained on the margins of the industrial revolution in the 19th century, partly because of the tendency of the dominant landed classes to invest in property and real estate. The result has been that much of the region's industry has been imposed from outside, often as the result of the transfer of research and infrastructure by the state. Again, the aerospace and aeronautics industry provide a case in point. President de Gaulle's decision to move the top engineering and pilot training schools to Toulouse and the establishment of the CNES aeronautics centre there in the 1960s provided a hub for the sector's expansion. There are increasing signs, however, of spontaneous local business development. The strength of scientific and research institutes has prompted the creation of a number of small companies working either as sub-contractors or niche players in the aerospace, electronics and biotechnology sectors. Mr Gilly describes the development of a 'tissue of small and medium-sized companies' in the electronics and aerospace field, citing the example of Verilog, which specialises in computer systems for satellites. The pace of this development has been slowed by recession. In several cases, such as Verilog, the lack of capital has resulted in acquisition by larger groups. But most industrialists in the region believe the process will regain momentum once the economy shows evidence of recovery. Here too, there are encouraging signs. Insee, the national statistics office in Paris, argues that France is now emerging, if gradually, from its malaise. As it does so, Toulouse appears well placed to benefit.</p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Alumasc restricted to Pounds 3.8m by reliance on organic growth GROWTH AT Alumasc, the Kettering-based beer kegs, building products and precision components group, slowed in the first half as pre-tax profits rose by just 3.2 per cent from Pounds 3.65m to Pounds 3.77m. In the last full year profits advanced 23 per cent. Without contributions from the new acquisitions that characterised 1991-92, Alumasc was dependent during the six months to December 31 on organic growth and hence was more susceptible to the weakness of the economy. Turnover improved to Pounds 24.3m against Pounds 23.6m. Earnings per share rose to 16.5p (15.8p) and the interim dividend is increased from 3.55p to 3.7p. Demand for building products, the largest of the group's three operating divisions, slipped as general building activity continued to decline. However, demand for beer kegs stabilised after a fall during the previous year. Volume fell slightly in the precision components business, although customers have been placing dies with the company, a prelude to future orders. The group's financial position remains stable and Mr John McCall, chairman, said it continued to seek acquisitions. Net cash balances rose by Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 4.9m, producing interest of Pounds 148,000.</p>

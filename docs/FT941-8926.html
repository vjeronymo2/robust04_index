			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Arts: Malfitano's debut as 'Fidelio' - From Geneva Andrew Clark reports on a singer who refuses to be categorised It is disconcerting to find Catherine Malfitano dressed as a man. The American soprano looks so natural playing strong feminine roles, from Poppea to Lulu, that a major adjustment is required when she walks on stage as Leonore in Fidelio - in which she has just made her debut at Geneva. This is the latest risk in the career of a singer who refuses to be categorised, and she pulls it off by the narrowest of margins. She was wise in her choice of setting. The Grand Theatre allows her sweet-sounding voice to blossom, and there can be few more powerful modern productions of Fidelio than Johannes Schaaf's, first staged in 1989. Malfitano cuts an unrecognisable figure in black beret and loose-fitting jacket, her neatly-parted hair adding to the boyish look. However magnetic her stage personality, she cannot hide the fact that masculine frowns are not her strong suit. It is only in the final scene, when her true identity is revealed, that the character achieves some depth. What really distinguishes her portrayal is her singing. This Leonore may lack the heroic, large-scale dimension, but she never utters a harsh or ugly note. She treats Beethoven's coloratura to a spring-clean, articulating the notes with an eloquence a true dramatic soprano would find hard to match. The other newcomer to the cast is Falk Struckmann, who has suddenly emerged as Germany's leading Heldenbariton. His Pizarro oozes ruthless authority, thanks to a strong, masculine stage presence, teutonic good looks and a commanding voice. His diction is outstanding. Hans Tschammer remains a sympathetic Rocco, Thomas Moser a noble Florestan. Friedemann Layer's conducting is precise and tightly controlled - not everyone's taste in Beethoven, and certainly not mine. Schaaf's production, designed by Peter Pabst, sets the first act in a concentration camp and the finale on a bed of roses. The result is serious, contemporary and moving. It underlines the gap between aspirations, hopes and utopias and the brutal things we do to each other - no different now from Beethoven's time.</p>

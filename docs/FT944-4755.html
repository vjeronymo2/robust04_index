			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Glaxo sued for Pounds 80m by patients Glaxo, the pharmaceuticals manufacturer, is being sued for more than Pounds 80m by about 400 former hospital patients in the first of a series of cases concerning the medical dye Myodil. Patients say Myodil, which was widely used in spinal X-rays between 1944 and 1987, when it was discontinued, damaged nerves, causing acute pain and even partial paralysis. They say Glaxo failed to issue adequate warnings about side-effects. Glaxo denies negligence and says Myodil's risks were well documented. Solicitors say the group action, to be heard at the High Court in London in April, represents a test case for other Myodil claims. Lawyers are thought to be preparing cases in Scotland and Ireland. The dye was also used in Australia, Canada and South Africa. Doctors injected the dye as part of a technique called myelography. Patients say the dye stayed in the spine for several years, causing inflammation of the spinal column membrane. Glaxo says that the risks were highlighted in leaflets which accompanied the product. The company said: 'We supplied this product to meet the needs of a very knowledgeable medical profession. It was known for many years that myelography could be followed by arachnoiditis.' The Myodil case would be the first group action for personal injury against a drug company to come to trial.</p>

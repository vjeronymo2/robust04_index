			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Family companies put in receivership THE BUSINESSES of the Kumar brothers, which include an 84 per cent holding in Birmingham City Football Club, a chain of high-street womens' clothing shops and a Manchester-based wholesale clothing operation, have been put into receivership by the liquidators of Bank of Credit and Commerce International. BRS Kumar Brothers - owned by Mr Bimal Kumar, Mr Ramesh Kumar and Mr Samesh Kumar - owes Pounds 6m to BCCI, secured on the company's assets. The money was loaned by BCCI to help finance the group's expansion during the 1980s. After BCCI was shut down last year the brothers split their businesses, setting up a company called Kumar Bros International. This now has a Pounds 30m turnover from womens' casual fashions and owns the chain of shops, which stretches from Leeds to Sunbury, Surrey. Leonard Curtis and Partners, a firm of accountants appointed joint receivers of BRS Kumar Brothers earlier this week, has now also been appointed receivers of Kumar Bros International. A High Court hearing will resume next week over ownership of former BRS Kumar assets to determine whether the receivers can pursue BCCI's claims against the new company. Mr Charles McMillan, Manchester partner of Leonard Curtis, said yesterday: 'It is claimed that in July 1991 BRS Kumar Brothers transferred all its trading assets and some of its liabilities into Kumar Bros International, leaving behind only the deeds to the properties and the shares in the football club. 'We have been appointed to realise the assets of BRS Kumar, but this will not satisfy the creditors in full. We will continue to trade the businesses in order to best preserve the assets for all concerned.' Staff at the companies' Manchester headquarters yesterday claimed the businesses were not in receivership. Warehouse staff said they were unaware of what was happening, but feared for their jobs. The Kumars took control of Birmingham City in 1989, with Mr Samesh Kumar becoming chairman.</p>

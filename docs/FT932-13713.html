			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / People: Rothschild family promotion Amschel Rothschild, a cousin of N M Rothschild chairman Sir Evelyn de Rothschild and half brother of Jacob Rothschild, has been promoted to executive chairman of Rothschild Asset Management, the fund management arm of the still family-run merchant bank. He had been chief executive for the past three years. While the succession to Sir Evelyn, 62, remains unclear, 38-year-old Amschel's elevation confirms him as one of the most prominent family members under 60, along with 50-year-old David de Rothschild, a cousin on the French side, who is deputy chairman. Sir Evelyn (right) has two sons, but both are still at school. He is reckoned to have done a good job in helping restore the fortunes of RAM, where performance had dropped off in the mid to late-1980s. The operation now manages assets of around Dollars 25bn, and performance has improved across the board, particularly in the New Court unit trusts, and unit trust-linked personal pensions. The previous executive chairman of RAM, Carel Mosselmans, is now chairman of Lloyds underwriting agency Janson Green, though he remains on the board. The title of chief executive will fall away. Amschel, a son of the late Lord Victor Rothschild, has done a fairly extensive tour of the bank. Before moving to RAM he worked on group policy in Sir Evelyn's office; he has also spent a spell in the treasury division, including working on bullion.</p>

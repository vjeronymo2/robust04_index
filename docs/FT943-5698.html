			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Ladbroke to pay Pounds 50m for three casinos: Hotels and Texas DIY pull interim profits down by 11 per cent Ladbroke Group yesterday placed a Pounds 50m bet on the future of London casinos, returning to the tables after a 15-year absence. The purchase of Maxim's, Golden Horseshoe and Charlie Chester's marks the first step in Ladbroke's strategy to play for bigger stakes in the growing global gaming business. Mr Trevor Hemmings, owner of the three casinos, will become one of Ladbroke's largest single shareholders. A leisure tycoon who made his fortune by selling Pontin's holiday camps to Scottish &amp; Newcastle, Mr Hemmings will hold almost 2 per cent of Ladbroke after the deal. The deal is subject to approval from the Gaming Board, a process which could take up to a year. Ladbrokes has retained the casinos' management, however, in a move which is expected to enhance its chances of approval. Ladbroke was forced to give up four West End casinos in 1979, after allegations of malpractice over its unorthodox attempts to win business from rivals, including sending attractive women to the hotel rooms of high rollers. Before yesterday's deal, it owned 13 casinos around the world. The gaming, hotels, retail and property group also announced an 11 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 57.8m to Pounds 51.3m, before an exceptional gain of Pounds 6m, for the six months to June 30. Turnover was Pounds 2.29bn (Pounds 2.21bn). Ladbroke also said it would carry out a root-and-branch review of its businesses expected to result in a 'cohesive strategic plan' for the group by next year. Analysts were disappointed by the results and strategic review. The shares fell by 1p to 167p. The biggest disappointment came from Ladbroke's hotels division, which was hit by poor trading in Japan. Mr George said the four Japanese hotels - which had returned profits of Pounds 20m at their peak in 1991, would make little or no profit this year. This offset an improved performance from UK hotels. Divisional profits were 6 per cent down at Pounds 44.6m. Ladbroke was also hit by a sharp downturn from the Texas DIY chain, where profits fell from Pounds 16.6m to Pounds 2m. The core betting business returned better than expected results. Mr Peter George, group chief executive, said the interest generated by the World Cup had proved there were still substantial opportunities to expand the betting market. A widely feared downturn in credit betting had not materialised and the division returned profits 15 per cent ahead to Pounds 49.2m. Property sales were also better than expected, with a net profit of Pounds 1.7m achieved on disposals totalling Pounds 140m. The disposals left rental income 28 per cent lower at Pounds 16.6m. Earnings per share before exceptionals were 18 per cent lower at 2.96p (3.60p). The interim dividend was cut to 2.4p (4.92p) in line with the reduction in last year's final. Mr Hemmings will receive 21.2m new Ladbroke shares and Pounds 14.25m in cash for the businesses and freeholds of the three casinos. Lex, Page 16</p>

			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Risk from radioactive discharges meaningless without a time scale Sir, The director of science, Greenpeace UK, writes in criticism of science in environmental policy (Letters, September 8). She says that the government assumes that a one in 10,000 risk of dying as a result of radioactive discharges is acceptable. This is meaningless with no time scale. She should ask Brian Wynne for the Royal Society publication, Risk-Analysis, Perception, Management 1992, to which he contributed. This defines risk as the probability that a particular adverse event occurs during a stated period of time, or results from a particular hazard. Risk of death is one of the events on which statistics going back many years are unarguable. A risk of one in 10,000 a year is roughly that in road accidents. It is accepted by anyone who ventures on the road. The official estimates of one in a million a year from radioactive discharges (HMSO 1984) are made from the experience of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They could be more accurate as a result of work at present planned. Your editorial of the same date ('Green agenda') underlines the need for social scientists and economists to work alongside natural scientists. The Royal Society report showed the difficulties. There is a need for better knowledge of costs and benefits to use resources sensibly. The precautionary principle is flawed without the concept of proportionality. The Health and Safety Executive conference, October 1992, has produced two large volumes of required reading. It has a page from the US Office of Management and Budget showing the cost of preventing one premature death as Dollars 100,000 for seat-belt regulations, up to Dollars 110.7m for the ban on asbestos. It underpins the priority given by the president to cutting down regulations. Frederick Warner, University of Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ</p>

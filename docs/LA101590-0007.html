			<p><P> October 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA LOTTERY  </P> <P> Your article on the California Lottery was quite informative, but omitted to  state who gets the money.  </P> <P> I don't mean the pittance to the schools, or the costs of advertising,  salaries, etc. I mean the money -- the millions that are reserved for prize  winners.  </P> <P> The way I look at it, a winner of $1 million gets $50,000 per year for 20  years, so after the first payment, there is $950,000 in the pot. At the end of  the initial year (at a mere 6% interest) this has grown to $1,007,000. After  making 20 payments of $50,000 each, there still remains $1,236,320 in the bank.  </P> <P> My question is -- who gets the money?  </P> <P> SANDY KAHN, Calabasas  </P></p>

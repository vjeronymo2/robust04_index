			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / International Company News: Bouygues falls 27% in first half BOUYGUES, the French company which is the world's largest construction group, yesterday warned of a fall in net profits for 1993. This came as it announced a 27 per cent reduction in net profits to FFr79m (Dollars 14.1m) in the first half of the year from FFr108m in the same period last year. The group, whose founder, Mr Francis Bouygues, died earlier this year, said it hoped to be able to maintain the same overall level of activity in 1993 as in 1992, but was concerned that the downturn in its property division would depress profits. Bouygues, which like other construction companies has been badly affected by the decline in European building activity, suffered a slight fall in turnover to FFr29.3bn in the first half of this year from FFr30bn at the same stage last year. Its core public works division saw sales stabilise at FFr11.8bn. Property was one of the worst affected areas of activity during the first half as the group was hit by the problems of the residential and commercial markets in France and other countries. The group expects these difficulties to continue in the second half with property turnover falling to FFr3.8bn in 1993 against FFr5.5bn in 1992. Road construction was another problematic area in the first half. Sales in this division rose slightly to FFr9.8bn from FFr9.4bn. However, Colas, the group's road construction subsidiary, recently reported an unexpectedly heavy interim loss. Bouygues anticipates a slight improvement from this division in the second half with full-year sales rising to FFr22bn from FFr21.3bn. Bouygues was bruised by a fall in interim profits at TF1, the flagship French television station in which it is a 25 per cent shareholder. This was due to the general pressures on the French media and a reduction in exceptional profits from property sales. The group said that, at the end of September, its orders for public works were stable against the same period of the previous year, with off-shore orders showing a slight improvement. Bouygues forecast an overall reduction in sales of 5 per cent to FFr59.3bn from FFr62.7bn for the full financial year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, June 10 (XINHUA) -- No relatives of the  Taiwan tourists who died in the March 31 Qiandao Lake tragedy  were present when the public trial of three men accused of  murder opened here today.    Relatives of the 24 Taiwanese victims had been told that  they  could attend the hearings if they wished, official sources here  said.    The Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits  (ARATS) invited relatives of the boat fire tragedy to attend the  public trial, via the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation  (SEF), on the 2nd, 5th and 8th of this month, the sources said.    ARATS said that representatives of SEF, too, are allowed to  attend the trial in their own names. Seats are actually  reserved for them.    In the afternoon of June 8, ARATS received a formal notice  from the SEF saying that five relatives of the Taiwan victims  would attend the trial. But none of them have been present at  the trial so far.    Officials here said that the court will make proper  arrangements for them if relatives of the victims and  representatives of SEF want to attend the trial before the court  reaches its decision.</p>

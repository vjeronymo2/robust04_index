			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Russian opposition to Latvian stance Sir, The article 'Held up on the Western line' (June 23) rightly said that the law on citizenship passed by the Latvian parliament on June 21 does not accord with internationally accepted norms since it imposed draconian quotas on non-Latvian permanent residents. Moreover, according to the assessments by western legislators, this discriminatory law contradicts the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, the International Pact on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on Reduction of Statelessness. By trying to legitimise the deprivation of civil, political, socio-economic and cultural rights of hundreds of thousands of people, Latvian parliamentarians openly ignored the authoritative views of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and the Council of Europe experts who strongly recommended that the law be amended so as to expedite the smooth integration of a large Russian-speaking minority in Latvian society. Even the government of Latvia itself appealed to President Ulmanis not to approve this citizenship law. No wonder the Latvian president ordered parliament to reconsider a controversial piece of legislation and said in a TV interview that the law undermined Latvian prestige in democratic Europe, deprived permanent residents of citizenship and complicated relations with Latvia's neighbours. Or maybe it was just probing by the parliament to test the vigilance of the international community? And later, the same law, with decorative amendments, will be passed again? Let us hope that this time the Latvian legislators will take into account the concerns expressed from all quarters. I think that world public opinion would welcome a decision to delete notorious quotas and change the discriminatory essence of the law. This is all the more lamentable since Russia is prepared to develop good, neighbourly relations with Latvia. On June 19 the Russian government decided to submit a package of agreements, signed recently with Latvia including that on a troop withdrawal by August 31 this year, to President Yeltsin for approval and subsequent ratification by parliament.

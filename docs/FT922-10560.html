			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Britain increases food aid to southern Africa BRITAIN is increasing its drought aid for southern Africa by Pounds 20m, only a month after it had pledged an initial Pounds 10m tranche, writes our Foreign Staff. Baroness Chalker, the overseas development minister, said: 'This drought has devastated harvests throughout the region. By acting now we can help avert the threat of widespread starvation seen elsewhere in Africa.' She called for more EC support. On a visit to Brussels at the weekend she would seek 'to ensure the European Community package of 800,000 tonnes of extra food aid, including 680,000 tonnes for Africa, is approved at the Development Council on May 4 and then implemented very swiftly.' Of the latest Pounds 20m disbursement, Zambia and Zimbabwe will receive Pounds 7.5m and Pounds 5m for food imports. Direct shipments of food, mainly for Mozambique, will cost a further Pounds 5m. The rest will go to countries including Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and Namibia.</p>

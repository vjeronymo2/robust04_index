			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: GAN chief warns on sell-off THE CHAIRMAN of GAN, one of France's largest insurers, yesterday said that the group had to address the problems of its lossmaking damage division if it was to be ready for privatisation. Mr Francois Heilbronner told a shareholders' meeting in Paris that there were already 'signs of improvement' among GAN's general insurance interests and at CIC, its banking subsidiary. But he warned that damage insurance was still in a precarious state. The damage division made a loss of FFr1.27bn (Dollars 222m) in 1992, contributing to the dramatic decline in GAN's overall net profits to FFr402m from FFr2.32bn in the previous year. Mr Heilbronner hoped for 'a significant improvement' from the damage division in 1993 with a 'return to break-even' next year. He said GAN was already raising premiums for motor and industrial insurance and turning down high-risk business. The French insurance industry had a tough time in 1992, particularly in the damage sector. There was intense pressure on premiums and claims rose sharply. The property crisis also made it difficult for insurers to counter the pressure on operating profits by selling assets. GAN was more vulnerable to these problems than the other two state-controlled insurers, Union des Assurances de Paris and Assurances Generales de France. All three companies are scheduled for privatisation by the new centre-right government, with AGF and UAP seen as the likeliest candidates for an early sale. However, Mr Heilbronner yesterday reaffirmed GAN's commitment to privatisation, saying its aim was to be 'ready for the moment' when the state decided to begin the sale. Mr Gerard Worms, chairman of Victoire, the private-sector French insurer, warned its annual meeting in Paris that although the company was recovering, net profits for 1993 would be 'well below' the FFr1.8bn made in 1991. Profits plunged to FFr214m in 1992.</p>

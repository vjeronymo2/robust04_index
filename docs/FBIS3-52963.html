			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 6 Jan (INA)--Staff Field Marshal President  Saddam Husayn, commander in chief of the Armed Forces, has said:  We are sincere in our stand on Palestine. We are faithful and  sincere in our stand on every Arab issue.    These remarks were made when his excellency received the  fighter members of the General Command of the Armed Forces and  senior military commanders here today. They came to extend  congratulations to him on the 73d anniversary of the  establishment of the Iraqi Army. His excellency added: You  must not commit historic mistakes. Everything can be amended,  except history.    On this occasion, President Saddam Husayn addressed  fighters:  the Americans are always deluded. They were deluded during  their 30-state aggression, they were deluded in Somalia, and  will be deluded again. This is because not only will the  evil-minded suffer the consequences of his evil deeds, but also  the conceited one. If such an individual is both evil-minded  and conceited, he will inevitably suffer the consequences.    His excellency said: Our plans were to be in the southern  region of Iraq and to lure the enemy troops into urban Iraqi  areas and cities so that we could put them through the worst.  However, what happened was that the enemy did not enter our  territory. Besides, some people did not give themselves and  their people the chance to play this role. It is true that the  enemy did not enter Iraq as we had planned for it, but a clash  was possible. In such a case, it would have been possible to  drag the enemy into the death traps that we had planned for it.  At that time, the Iranians did their known misdeed, and the  evil ones rallied around the treacherous Iranian act.  Consequently, fires broke out in most areas in Iraq.    His excellency said: The United States announced a  unilateral cease-fire. I am saying the United States because it  is actually the party that assembled the evil gathering along  with its evil supporters, who bear Arab nationalities. It is  the party that created that momentous evil gathering with its  known intentions to commit its misdeed.    President Saddam Husayn said: At that time, I recall, they  said that we should confirm the cease-fire, which they announced  unconditionally and unilaterally, except for self-defense if  they were attacked by the Iraqis. We said: Okay, let us do  that. They said: Send your envoys to a U.S. ship, the name of  which I cannot remember. It was anchored in the Arabian Gulf.    His excellency went on: These contacts were between  diplomats. The idea was to spare military personnel the hassle  of dealing with these details, in order to free them for their  goals. The Foreign Ministry sent me a memorandum to the effect  that the Americans asked the then Soviets, or rather ordered the  then Soviets, to tell us through their foreign minister that the  Americans want Iraqi military personnel who represented the  Iraqi side against 28 armies to report to such-and-such a vessel  in the Gulf. They used such language as to show that they were  not making a suggestion to an equal but sending us a summons. I  believe they specified the position of the ship. The Americans  said they would arrange for our military personnel's transport  to the ship. Here I want to remind them of a historic error,  which they ought to have not made.    His excellency added: At that time, through which all of you  lived, and, therefore, remember, the state of our domestic front  was the most difficult. As for our external front, the  situation was not that difficult. They were foreigners with  whom we were engaged in battle. We were not too concerned about  whether they had more weapons than we did. What really  disturbed us was to see an overlap of ditches and confusion  between people who call themselves Iraqis but take orders from  foreigners and [words indistinct] in the pain we felt in our  hearts. We were confronted with such a memorandum, I mean the  American asking us to report to them, and the Americans always  submit to illusions.    At that time, the Americans thought that an opportunity  presented itself for them to make us commit a historic error.  Just imagine Staff Lieutenant General Sultan Hashim Ahmad,  operations assistant for the Army chief of staff, and Staff Lt.  Gen. Salah 'Abbud, commander of the 3d Corps, who had the rank  of major general then, and other military comrades and staff  officers, appearing on American television screens... Imagine  military footage showing your military comrades on their way to  the American ship to conduct negotiations with the Americans.    For our part, we said the negotiations will not take place  on  an American ship. I said: You have to choose between two sites  where the negotiations may be held -- either in the Safwan  region at the (?al-Julaydah) Airport or at any other point along  the Iraqi-Saudi border. In the end, they settled for one of the  two places.    His excellency added: When they chose the place, it met with  our approval. Staff Lt. Gen. Sultan Hashim Ahmad, along with  Lt. Gen. Salah 'Abbud and other staff officers, went there.  When they were about to go into the tent where the negotiations  were to be held, they were surprised...    His excellency added: Let us pause here. Before Staff Lt.  Gen. Sultan Hashim Ahmad went to meet with the enemies, we  contacted him and told him: You are the victors. I told the  messenger who carried the message: Give my greetings to Staff  Lt. Gen. Sultan Hashim Ahmad and to all the comrades in the  General Command. I think that Staff Gen. Husayn Rashid was the  Army chief of staff and that 'Ali Hasan al-Majid was at the time  engaged on the battlefield. Since there was no means to get in  touch with you, I told the carrier of the message to tell our  comrades that they are the victors.    President Saddam Husayn went on: I have laid emphasis on  this aspect for psychological reasons. I know how they think,  but I chose to emphasize this point in case they might think  that victory was not theirs or that victory was not as it should  have been. Of course, victory as one plans and wishes it to be  is one thing, and victory in the historical sense, which I mean  here, is another. It was a third world war. Iraq was on one  side and the world, save what God wished, was on the other.  When I say the world, I mean the political leaders and  administrations. I do not mean the peoples, even those who were  made to believe that they were fighting for a good cause. I  told him to stress that Iraq was the victor, that the Army of  Iraq achieved victory, and that our comrade leaders who will go  now to negotiate with the enemy have achieved victory. They  will see how the enemy will bow their heads down, if they have  any shame left as military commanders. When the representatives  of 28 armies, three of which are superpowers, do not feel their  defeat when the representatives of one army sit with them at the  same table, then those who still cherish some of the meanings of  the military code -- which basically stress manliness and  knighthood -- will be ashamed of themselves, even if they have  no humanitarian traits left. Those people will feel that they  are drowning in shame as they sit on those chairs to represent  28 armies in the face of a single army. All these well-known  countries, and others who were not probably revealed properly,  stood in the face of one country, which is known in terms of its  size, population, economy, industry, and agriculture.    He added: Staff Lieutenant General Sultan Hashim Ahmad, who  is known, along with his comrades, for sound military conduct,  went to meet them. It should have been very clear to the enemy  that Staff Lt. Gen. Sultan and his comrades were the victors.  When he and his comrades arrived at the door of the tent, he  was surprised when they asked him to take off his weapon before  entering the negotiating tent. He replied: I will not take off  my weapon before the other party removes its weapon. Who will  speak on behalf of the 28 armies? Schwarzkopf answered him in  apparent confusion, as Staff Lt. Gen. Sultan told me: I  represent them. He said: Then take off your weapon. And he  did. The came the turn of Staff Lt. Gen. Salah 'Abbud, who  asked who the second man was. He was told that the man was  Sultan. But how great a difference is there between Sultan and  Sultan. They meant Prince Khalid Bin-Sultan, since the West  calls a person by the name of his father or his title. So this  Sultan was the second person who represents the state of his  majesty. He told them: Tell Khalid Bin-Sultan to throw his  weapon away before the second man in the Iraqi delegation throws  his weapon away. Schwarzkopf called Prince Khalid Bin-Sultan and  asked his men to send quickly for him. Then Khalid Bin-Sultan  came hurriedly, and Schwarzkopf asked him to take his weapon  off, even though he is a prince. So he did. Afterward, Staff  Lt. Gen. Salah 'Abbud entered without his weapon.    His excellency said: At that time, with its well-known  atmosphere, I told them that the minutes of the meeting should  be written down and officially signed, in addition to recording  it on an audio tape. We are saying this in order that you pay  attention to the details that may seem very trivial and may have  no historical significance. We, however, did not forget to  mention these details despite those circumstances. The comrades  requested that the minutes of the meeting be recorded, and they  received a copy of the recording. Speaking of this issue, I  would like you to make 200 more copies, so there will not be a  single copy. I do not know whether they wrote down official  minutes or whether they were content with this recording. Of  course, this is apart from the cease-fire minutes, which were  also written down and signed.    President Saddam Husayn added: Suppose that we now show two  pictures of our comrades while heading for the U.S. ship,  assuming that the historic mistake was actually made. Some may  say that there is no harm in heading for this ship. They may  also wonder: Why do you want to complicate the issue of holding  that meeting aboard a ship or elsewhere? We, however, say:  Such an issue is greatly significant and may have an impact for  hundreds of years, if not for thousands of years. If we now  show your children two pictures on the television screen, one  having our own description, and the other having the description  the enemy wanted at the very beginning, what impact would each  of the two pictures have on the people's psychological makeup?  I believe that this is understood.    His excellency continued: Regrettably, among the painful  matters in Arab politics is the fact that when an Arab ruler  wants to resolve an issue, he asks the whole world to join him  in signing a humiliating document. All right, you are in a weak  position on a certain issue, and you decided to take a weak  position. But you should let others be in a strong position as  a guarantee for you if you later plan to retreat from this weak  position and take a strong position, at which time you will find  someone who will protect you, shelter you, back you, and  understand you. Why does such a ruler want everyone to take the  same position as his own position whenever he adopts a weak  position?    President Saddam Husayn pointed out that [former Egyptian  President] al-Sadat used to say: Normalize relations with  Israel. However, would it not have been better for al-Sadat, in  the first place, to await what would be really achieved before  urging others to adopt his position? Wait, brother, and see  what will happen, what results your conduct achieves, and see  whether there is any Arab who has been convinced of normalizing  relations. Wait, at least to see where this path will take you,  and what result this conduct achieves. It is not important if  others have a different opinion; what is really important is  whether you actually want to burn your bridges. They used to  say loudly: Normalize relations with Israel, adopt this  specific position.    His excellency said: Some people just want an excuse to do  what they want to do. They say that some people, whom they do  not want to name, are moving very fast, running. But why do you  run? Wait for some time to pass, wait for six months or a year.  Are you so impatient that a period of a few months is too long  for you? Responsible people should withstand pressure for  several years for the sake of their cause. A responsible man  should remain steadfast even if a dagger is lodged in his flesh.  He must stand this pressure for five years while carrying out  his duties, and must behave normally. Only after this can he  remove the dagger. Why the hurry? They look as if they are  awaiting the opportunity or are feeding on a single grain of  wheat, as the saying goes. [sentence as received]    His excellency said: They talk too much when they discuss  Arab nationalism. They talk so much that they make us sleepy.  They talk too much about history but when it comes to action,  they shrink to the point of nothingness, why? They can become  great. If someone wants to become great in their principles we  will all support and follow him even if the Iraqis blame us.  All we want is for him to raise his standards a little.    Addressing the commanders, the president said: O comrades,  make mistakes but may God lead you away from mistakes. Only God  is free of errors. You cam make mistakes in anything but you  must not make mistakes in history because anything can be  corrected except history. If the ship's story materialized,  would such a mistake be corrected? To correct this mistake  would have required us to wage a second war with America so that  we could bring them to negotiate with us on our own ship,  otherwise the mistake of the first ship would not be forgotten  but would remain so that each one of your children, when he goes  to school with his pen and papers, would see this ship popping  up between the lines.    His excellency said: If they made Sultan Hashim Ahmad lay  down his gun without him making them lay down theirs too, his  gun would remain on the face of all the Iraqis and the Americans  would show it on every occasion in their films. The Americans  have not produced any such films so far, why? Aren't they the  movie makers? They have not produced any film for some time  because they have nothing to show. Wherever they look they face  basic problems. Would they show their guided bombs hitting a  building to bring it down it or a factory to destroy?    President Saddam Husayn added: Thus, they could not show a  single U.S. soldier facing an Iraqi soldier. They will not show  this, nor will they show how the U.S. tanks faced the Iraqi  tanks. Let them show the fighting against the Republican Guard  in the south or the fighting that took place against the  isolated heroes who fought them at Kuwait airport. A British  commander appeared on the British television. He was fair when  he said: If I were the commander of these fighters, I would be  proud of them.    During the meeting, his excellency reviewed the  international  positions, the circumstances that Iraq experienced during the  glorious Saddam's al-Qadisiyah battle and the Mother of Battles,  and Iraq's rejection of dishonest bargaining. He also reviewed  Iraq's adherence to the friendship with the rulers of the former  Soviet Union, who betrayed this friendship in the Mother of  Battles and harmed it greatly in the al-Qadisiyah battle.    His excellency recalled Iraq's rejection of the continued  U.S. attempts to acquire the Soviet T-72 tank in return for  supplying us with a package of shells and cannons, which we  would pay for. The aim was to dismantle and examine the Soviet  tank, so they could see it from the inside and become acquainted  with it.    President Saddam Husayn said: If we now go and sit with the  Russians, who are the origin and base of the great [former]  Soviet Union, we will not be ashamed because our positions can  only raise the head of mankind high, knowing that those who are  ruling Russia now are not the same as those who ruled the Soviet  Union and who betrayed the friendship in the Mother of Battles.    Concluding his speech, President Saddam Husayn said: In  order not to make mistakes in historical issues when we face  them, we should pause and think several times. Everyone of us  should be ready to offer sacrifices, and we all should cooperate  in order not to commit a historic mistake.    Participating in the reception ceremony and in extending the  congratulations were fighter Staff General 'Izzat Ibrahim,  deputy commander in chief of the Armed Forces; fighter Staff  General 'Ali Hasan al-Majid, defense minister; Hatim Hamdan  al-'Azzawi, head of the Presidential Office; fighter Staff  Lieutenant General Husayn Kamil Hasan, industry and minerals  minister; and fighter Staff General 'Abd-al-Jabbar Shanshal,  minister of state for military affairs.</p>

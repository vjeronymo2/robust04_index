"Because the construction of facilities to store liquid  nuclear waste will be completed by the end of April with Japan's  assistance, there will be no need for the moment to resume  dumping," Panov said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE.    Russia's Pacific Fleet had indicated it could be forced to  resume dumping nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan in May because  its tanker TNT-5, loaded with some 500 tons of radioactive  waste, is decaying and the risk of leakage of the waste is  increasing.    The construction cost of the storage facilities will be  covered by 100 million dollars Japan has pledged to provide to  Russia to help it dispose radioactive waste, Panov said.    Panov expressed thanks for Japan's assistance. He made the  remarks before Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata visits  Moscow from Saturday to Monday.    Last October, Russia dumped 800 tons of liquid radioactive  waste into the Sea of Japan from a vessel of its Pacific Fleet  at a point some 550 kilometers west of Hakodate in Hokkaido,  Japan's northernmost main island.    Russia suspended its planned second phase of dumping in the  Sea of Japan following protests from Japan and South Korea.  Moscow later urged the Japanese Government to shoulder the cost  of construction of the land-based waste disposal facility.    Russia and Japan since then have continued working-level  contacts on the disposal of Russia's radioactive waste.</p>

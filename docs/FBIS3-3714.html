By 1993, urban-suburban joint economic entities of various  types have reached 3,746 from a mere 520 manufacturing  businesses a decade ago.    The set-up also expanded to other areas such as scientific  and technological cooperation and business with overseas  ventures.    In the industrial sector, there are 200 subsidiary member  factories in the outskirts now. The suburban establishments are  able to provide more space and labor as well as capital the  urban factories need in order to expand.    A survey shows that close to 20,000 specialists from  Beijing's institutions of higher learning and research  institutes are working for the suburban enterprises. The  technology input has helped invigorating the rural industries by  diversifying the product mix and lifting the quality to a high  level.    Last year, the value of industrial output in urban and  suburban joint ventures amounted to the tune of 15.5 billion  yuan, up 48.2 percent over 1992. They also turned over 1.32  billion yuan in profits and taxes to the state.</p>

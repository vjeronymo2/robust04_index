			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Dilemma of Military Expenditure"] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has said Pakistan  will not reduce its defence budget given the security  environment in the region. In specific terms, it means no  slashing of the traditional arms and size of the armed forces  themselves. She told the cabinet's defence committee Thursday  that the government could not afford to disregard new threats to  the security of the country. She was clearly referring to the  recent 15 percent increase in the Indian defence budget. The  army chief also gave the defence committee details of likely  purchase of new arms from China and other friendly countries.  It is true that no self-respecting nation can afford to place  its security interests in jeopardy, even if it is faced with the  most forbidding economic constraints. Unfortunately, the  militarisation of the sub-continent is a phenomenon that does  not mesh with new realities across the globe. Both India and  Pakistan seem to match each other's new acquisition of arms or  other military capabilities. This has naturally sent their  economies into a tailspin. India owes upwards of $98 billion to  foreign creditors; Pakistan, considering the size of its  economy, has also amassed a near-impossible figure of $30  billion in foreign debts. There is no knowing exactly how much  money is funnelled into defence, but conservative estimates put  it, in case of Pakistan, at close to $3 billion; in case of  India it could be three times more. These are colossal sums by  the third world standards; sums that could have been used for  building vital infrastructure, especially that of health and  education. The cost of a tank could be used to establish scores  of schools in the countryside. Indeed, both nations are dying  without having to fight a war.    There are few examples of unilateral disarmament in human  history; and weaker nations have invariably invited aggression.  Unless both India and Pakistan agree to a mutual reduction of  arms, peace and prosperity for both will remain an elusive  dream. The present high level of military preparedness is bound  to push them over the precipice. When we have too many people  chasing war against too few working for peace, the road to  normalisation must lie through impossible terrain. The  international community is now reacting, albeit slowly, to the  violation of human rights in Kashmir. Foreign mediation is the  only safe bet that can disengage such implacable foes as India  and Pakistan. The question is, how long can Pakistan and India  go on ignoring the cost to their societies of such immense  military expenditure.</p>

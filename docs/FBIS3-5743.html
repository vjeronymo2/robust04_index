Hosokawa made the remark in a meeting  with Gerard Longuet, the French trade and industry minister, at  the prime minister's official residence Thursday [10 March].    Longuet invited Hosokawa to France as early as possible, the  official said. Hosokawa did not make clear when he wants to  visit France, the official said.    Longuet was quoted as telling Hosokawa that France and Japan  can cooperate in helping reconstruct Cambodia from years of  civil strife and contribute to the international community  together.    He also lauded Hosokawa's courage to institute national  reforms, including the recently achieved political reform, the  official said.    Longuet arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday for talks with  Japanese  Government and business leaders and to attend an international  conference on assistance to Cambodia, which opened its two-day  session at a Tokyo hotel Thursday.</p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / People: Worldwide liaison from St Helens Pilkington's new group legal adviser, from the beginning of June, is a keep-fit fanatic - who once ran hilly marathons in under three hours and took part in an Everest expedition. He has now turned his energies to windsurfing - and to managing the legal resources of Pilkington worldwide. David Bricknell, 43, joined the UK glassmaker in 1974 from Slaughter &amp; May. He was company secretary from 1981 to 1989; and is currently manager of the group legal department and number two to Tony Hartley, 62, who retires at the end of the month after a 33-year stint at Pilkington. Bricknell explains that while he only wished to alter 'one paragraph of the job description', the emphasis of his task has changed - away from licensing, which once consumed a lot of time but is now under a separate team within technology management. He will hence be freer to concentrate on 'worldwide liaison'. 'With only 20-25 per cent of our business based in the UK, we have to rely on local (legal) advisers a lot,' says Bricknell who was closely involved in the 1980 purchase of Flachglass in Germany. 'And the scale of both costs and damages these days means this dimension of the business has to be managed in as tight and disciplined a way as any other expenditure.' While the headquarters for much of the European operation has moved to Brussels - causing a furore in St Helens - Bricknell is part of the small corporate headquarters concerned with global strategy that remains in Lancashire. ***** David Roycroft is to be appointed head of corporate affairs at Pilkington from July. He is currently director of marketing at ITN and was formerly in the diplomatic service where his appointments included three years as deputy private secretary to the Prince of Wales. ***** Timothy May has been appointed company secretary of EUROCAMP on the resignation of Martin Kinsey. ***** Tim Bowdler, md of Cape Architectural Products, is also appointed md of CAPE Building Products on the resignation of Sandy Hutchison. ***** John Kelly, at present md of Associated Leisure, has been appointed chief executive of Cashcard Systems. ***** Karen Richardson, a partner in Travers Smith Braithwaite, has been appointed solicitor and company secretary of REED INTERNATIONAL. ***** BLENHEIM GROUP has appointed Philippe Delhomme, formerly financial director of Habitat France, financial director of its French subsidiary; Paul O'Reilly, formerly group financial controller of Avis Europe, financial director of its US subsidiaries; and Mike Fletcher, formerly md of Johnson Fry, md of its UK operations. ***** Stephen Crossan and Roy Knowles have been promoted to the board of CHORLEY ENGINEERING, part of BET Plant Services. ***** Rod Taylor, human resources general manager for marketing and operations staff at British Airways, is appointed director of human resources at SEARS. David Garth, head of group personnel is to become director of human resources for Sears womenswear division.</p>

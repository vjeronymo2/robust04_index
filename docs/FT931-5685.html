			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Waiting for the Bundesbank BOTH THE dollar and sterling registered small gains against the D-Mark in European trading yesterday after the Bundesbank drained rather less liquidity from the German money market than dealers had expected, writes James Blitz. Around DM32bn of funds have been added to the market this week in the wake of the easing of minimum reserve requirements for German banks. Although some DM14.8bn was drained earlier in the week by the introduction of short-term bills to the market, the Bundesbank only withdrew a further DM2.4bn from the system yesterday in its weekly operations. This brought a slight lowering in D-Mark money market rates. The Bundesbank's accommodative stance made the comparatively low short-term rates in the US and UK look less cheap. The dollar closed  1/4 pfennig firmer in Europe at DM1.6450, while the pound continued the week's rally to end  1/2 pfennig higher at DM2.3850. In New York the US currency finished a shade higher at DM1.6453. If the moves in the dollar and sterling were muted, it was probably because dealers were waiting for the two most important events of the week: today's Bundesbank council meeting and tomorrow's non-farm payroll figure. Will the Bundesbank ease official rates today? The council's deliberations are, in the final analysis, unpredictable. But Miss Alison Cottrell of Midland Global Markets believes the council will only announce a lower fixed rate repo for next week. In her view, recent declarations by two regional council members that inflation was not beaten put the council's hawks in the ascendant. She also believes that a small cut in the discount rate might backfire on the Bundesbank, because it would suggest to the foreign exchange markets that German rates were coming down too slowly to take pressure off the French authorities - and this might bring a return to the strains in the European exchange rate mechanism. Mr Christian Dunis, an economist at Chemical Bank in London, also believes that there is insufficient pressure in the ERM to force the Bundesbank to ease policy. He said the Bundesbank could leave official rates untouched at both today's meeting and the one on March 18 because the most likely time for pressure to return will be after a right wing government is elected in France at the end of the month. However, other economists believe the economic outlook in Germany is deteriorating at such a pace that the Bundesbank will be forced to stimulate policy as soon as possible. A critical test for the pound in the remainder of this week will be whether it crosses the crucial DM2.40 barrier against the D-Mark. But Mr Ian Harnett of Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull thinks the UK currency will be sold down again whether the Bundesbank eases today or not.</p>

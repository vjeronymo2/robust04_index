			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / The Big Lie, Inside Maxwell's Empire: Sins of the father - Only a small fraction of the Pounds 933m plundered by Maxwell is likely to be recovered. He will be remembered for this. But he did not run the empire on his own. During 1991 he had decreasing influence on a day-to-day basis. He came to rely on a small core of executives, and on his sons - Kevin and Ian KEVIN MAXWELL hurried out of his office on the ninth floor of Maxwell House into its central reception lobby at 11.30am on November 5 1991. Behind him the double doors leading to Robert Maxwell's vast office were closed. He turned into his brother Ian's office and asked the secretary to leave. On her way out she overheard Kevin say: 'It's Dad.' One thousand eight hundred miles away, off the coast of Gran Canaria, a full-scale air and sea search was under way for Robert Maxwell, who had been reported missing from his yacht, the Lady Ghislaine. 'Give me 20 minutes to call the bankers,' Kevin told Ernest Burrington, then managing director of Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN), who was drafting a press release. Kevin - anticipating the urgent steps needed to save his father's empire - called Samuel Montagu, MGN's merchant bank, and Sir Michael Richardson, chairman of Smith New Court, stockbrokers to MGN and Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC). As the directors of MCC assembled at 3pm in Kevin's office for an emergency board meeting, an electronic message flashed across City dealing screens that MGN and MCC shares were suspended. A second message, 10 minutes later, told the world what the directors now knew: Robert Maxwell was missing at sea, feared lost. 'Kevin told me just before the board meeting that his father was missing,' says Basil Brookes, MCC finance director, whose own departure had been planned for that day. 'I agreed to stay and help. I didn't have the heart to say no.' The UK's clearing banks, which had financed the Maxwell empire, held emergency meetings with Kevin. 'The lad was really upset,' said one UK bank director that afternoon. 'But there was tremendous dynastic loyalty: 'We are the Maxwells and it will carry on.' ' The week after Robert Maxwell's death his sons, fielding press conferences and emergency bank syndicate meetings, attracted widespread sympathy. Bankers, initially sceptical that two young men in their early 30s could carry the huge burden, discussed bringing in a senior accountant as a father figure. But they changed their minds. 'It's an almost unimaginable weight on them, but I think they're going to make it,' said one clearing bank director in admiration. Behind the composure the problems were pressing. On Wednesday, the day after his father's death, Kevin told Swiss Bank Corporation that the private Maxwell companies were reneging on the promise he had given the week before to repay its Pounds 57.5m loan. On Friday, as the Maxwell family began leaving for the funeral on Jerusalem's Mount of Olives, half a dozen Swiss Bank executives were closeted with lawyers from the City firm Allen &amp; Overy. On Monday, 24 hours after Robert Maxwell was buried, Swiss Bank met the City of London police - and the Serious Fraud Office was called in to investigate the Maxwell empire. Kevin and Ian inherited their father's empire for less than four weeks. On December 3 they were forced by fellow directors and banks to resign as chairmen of MCC and MGN. A month after Maxwell died Headington Investments, the parent company of the Maxwell empire, was put into administration under UK insolvency laws. When the Maxwell empire collapsed it emerged that MCC, MGN and the Maxwell pension funds had been stripped of Pounds 933m in cash and assets. Only a small fraction is likely to be recovered. That is the legacy for which Robert Maxwell will be remembered. However Maxwell did not run the empire on his own. Several of his directors and bankers say that during 1991 he had increasingly little influence on a day-to-day basis. He relied on a small core of executives, and on his sons Kevin and Ian. Kevin had a particularly important role. Interviews with Maxwell directors and bankers show that he took day-to-day control of much of the financial planning and the complex treasury departments of many of the businesses for several years before his father's death. Papers obtained by the Financial Times also reveal that Kevin signed - although he may not have known the implications - some of the documents authorising transactions that led to the loss of money from the Maxwell pension funds and public companies. Part of the explanation for how Kevin appeared able to take on his father's largest companies so smoothly after the death was that he had already been carrying much of the burden. In 1988 when Robert Maxwell recruited Jean Pierre Anselmini as MCC deputy chairman, Maxwell said: 'I am 65, and I have two young sons in their early 30s. Join us and participate in their education for a few years.' The education was rapid. In early 1991 Maxwell promoted Kevin to chief executive of MCC and Ian to deputy chairman of MGN. The two were also directors of many parts of the Maxwell empire's 'private side' - a tangled web of nearly 400 different companies - and directors of Bishopsgate Investment Management (BIM), the company managing much of the Pounds 700m Maxwell pension funds. Kevin was head of the larger company, valued in May at Pounds 1.2bn compared with MGN's Pounds 500m. It had become clear that Kevin was taking on the more financially complex jobs within the empire. 'Ian is a salesman, a marketing person, very good with people,' says one MCC director. Peter Jay, the former British ambassador to the US who worked for Maxwell for three years as chief of staff, says that Ian 'is a conciliator, looking for solutions'. It seemed natural within Maxwell House that Ian would gravitate towards MGN, with the newspapers' need for marketing talent. Ian also acted as his father's negotiator and envoy on many of the eastern European 'investments' where - it has become even clearer in retrospect than it was at the time - profit was not a priority. In contrast, Kevin took on much of the responsibility of running MCC. It was a formidable challenge, straddling the Atlantic, with huge movements of foreign currency to manage and a debt burden of more than Dollars 2bn. By 1990, according to MCC directors, he had also taken effective day-to-day control of the complex treasury department, under his father's authority. Until late 1991 the treasury was shared by MCC and the private companies - although not the pension funds - and channelled much of the daily flow of millions of pounds between the Maxwell companies and their banks. 'How that young man dealt with all those issues is beyond me - he must have a brain like a Hewlett Packard,' says one of Maxwell's main UK bankers. The Maxwell House joke was that managing directors were nothing; finance directors were king. By 1991 Kevin's financial skill had made him clearly the crown prince. Kevin's importance in the organisation could not have been guessed from the nature of his office in Maxwell House. It was an unprepossessing room, only a third the size of his father's. Bare and L-shaped, it held only a desk and table and was lit by one narrow window. Kevin's style was in marked contrast to that of his father. An analyst for the Maxwell finance department says: 'He hated anyone who was excitable or who got agitated, and it was very obvious he was trying to be different from his father.' Both Maxwell sons, however, were capable of their father's customary flashes of anger and extreme rudeness. Kevin and Ian were also subject to their father's extreme disruptiveness. Les Williams, one of the office managers, remembers that Kevin, under orders from his father, once moved his wife Pandora and his children from London to New York - only to be pulled back to London after three weeks. Maxwell would also shout at both sons in public, which onlookers found deeply embarrassing. He would shout: 'You're a fool, you're such an idiot, how can you give that answer?' Many of the directors found Ian easier company; Kevin's intensity and preoccupation with the figures led one Maxwell House aide to regard him as a 'desiccated accountant'. He was distant from many of the publishing executives. Instead, Kevin was closer to the finance executives. Brookes, at 33 the same age as Kevin is now, says: 'I felt for him, the way the old man treated him. We went to football together. One day he said: 'What's your team?' I said Blackburn, so he arranged to go, arranged for parking for me. He said: 'Don't tell my father we're here - I've told him you and I are sorting out the working capital this afternoon.'' Many, however, commented on his extraordinary self-possession. 'Kevin is unbelievably cool,' says one MCC director; a bank director adds: 'Quite extraordinary sang-froid.' As Maxwell became progressively less involved in the day-to-day running of the businesses through 1990 and 1991, it was Kevin who took on the burden. He was the regular point of contact for the banks as the financial strains on the empire increased. 'The banks dealt with Robert Maxwell for signings, but real discussion was always with Kevin, both for MCC and private companies,' says one UK clearing banker. He adds: 'We could always get hold of Kevin, but given the pressure the boy was under it was hard.' Another bank's senior director confirms: 'He was not one to avoid phone calls. He would always call back, even if it was at midnight.' The banks were clear about the centrality of Kevin's role. One director comments: 'The others didn't realise the whole picture. They would say: 'We must refer this to Kevin.' ' During the summer the pressure intensified. One banker says: 'We were concerned about his (Kevin's) health. He was working seven days a week, 25 hours a day. He was being strategic director, he was being treasurer, assistant treasurer, assistant assistant treasurer.' Maxwell had kept the inner core of executives small. A finance department analyst says: 'Kevin kept trying to involve more people in running the company, but his father kept refusing to let him.' One of the administrators to the Maxwell empire, surveying a map of MCC's astonishing total of 400 subsidiaries next to the 400 private Maxwell companies, recently said in wonder: 'When you think of it, 800 companies were run by a man and a boy.' With that central a role in his father's empire, how much did Kevin know? On resigning as chairman of MCC on December 3 Kevin said: 'My father had a style based on a need-to-know basis.' It is clear his father kept ultimate authority for many of the financial decisions in the empire. It is also clear, however, from documents obtained by the Financial Times, that Kevin was closely involved in many of the transactions that are now seen to be central to the eventual removal of money from the public companies and pension funds. He was also central to some that are now the focus of the SFO's investigation. Through his day-to-day control over the treasury department and as an MCC director Kevin was closely involved in the loans made by MCC to the private Maxwell companies in 1991. Loans of cash from MCC to these private companies reached a peak of Pounds 300m in July. Kevin's signature was on at least 11 of these transfers of cash, totalling Pounds 145m. The signature was always accompanied, as required, by another director's, and the transactions were not illegal. However MCC's loans to the private Maxwell companies provoked intense rows during August between the Maxwells and the other MCC directors. One of the most controversial episodes, which some MCC directors and bankers now concede might have alerted them to the looming problems, was an extraordinary pattern of highly irregular foreign exchange dealings through the treasury in July. During three weeks MCC traded in tens of millions of pounds of foreign currency with some 20 of the world's biggest banks. In most cases it paid for the currency late; the condition for such spot deals is that they are paid within hours. The effect was to give it a three-week unofficial 'loan' of around Pounds 100m. Copies of the bank authorisations show that some of the foreign exchange deals were authorised by Robert Maxwell and the dealing conducted by Kevin; some were authorised by Kevin and dealt by junior treasury officers. One of the Serious Fraud Office's investigations focuses on an alleged scheme to support the share prices of MCC and MGN. The collapsing share price of the two companies was draining away what was left of the Maxwell empire's lifeblood. Investigators have now discovered that the private companies routed some Pounds 300m - obtained from many different routes through the empire - to secretive Liechtenstein and Swiss trusts which then bought MCC and MGN shares. A letter and a corroborating fax show that Kevin Maxwell was intimately involved in the purchase of 9m MCC shares by Yakosa, a Swiss trust, and a further 16m shares by Servex, another Swiss trust - both of which have said they are independent of the Maxwells. On May 29 last year, Kevin Maxwell sent a signed fax to Goldman Sachs, the US bank, saying that the shares would be bought by the trusts with Pounds 55.33m provided by BIT, a Maxwell private company. Goldman's lawyers say the firm acted properly. The SFO is investigating whether Robert or Kevin Maxwell breached the Companies Act by failing to disclose the purchases of the shares by the Swiss trusts; if either had a financial interest in the trusts, the purchases should have been disclosed under company law, because the Maxwells were both directors of MCC. The trusts' lawyers have said that they are independent. Documents show that Kevin Maxwell was closely involved in the management of 'stocklending' from the pension funds. Stocklending is a legal and common practice whereby pension funds lend out their assets for a few days or weeks to other financial institutions as a way of boosting their income. In retrospect, however, it is clear that stocklending from the Maxwell pension funds was highly unusual, particularly during 1991. This was partly because of the length of time for which the stocks were lent, and partly because the pension funds were not always adequately protected. The main way the Maxwell pension funds were eventually stripped of assets was through stocklending to Maxwell's private companies which could not pay them back. A memo to Kevin Maxwell from Larry Trachtenberg, a director of private Maxwell investment companies, is dated December 17 1990, nearly a year before Maxwell's death. Headed: 'Outstanding items and action for week commencing 17.12.90', it reminds Kevin to send letters to Capel Cure Myers and Invesco MIM, the investment houses which managed some of the Maxwell pension money. Trachtenberg says the letters 'request that we roll over the stock borrowing positions until 31.1.91. As we have agreed the BIM (pension management company) year end is not until April 5 so this should not cause a problem.' The significance of this is partly that it suggests that Kevin had some responsibility for dealing with the Maxwell pension money and for negotiation of stocklending arrangements with banks and investment managers. One of the most controversial actions by both Kevin and Ian emerged in the weeks immediately after their father's death; the issue of Berlitz, the international language instruction company. Berlitz was a central part of why the MCC directors turned against the Maxwell brothers. Brookes says: 'Kevin's attitude after his dad died was: 'Let's sort it out and worry about who did what later.' That's why Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte (the accountants in charge of estimating the empire's financial position) wanted to keep him on and why we could work with him, at first.' On November 7, two days after Maxwell's death, MCC announced that it had agreed to sell its 56 per cent stake in Berlitz to Fukutake, the Japanese publisher. The prospect of Dollars 265m flowing into MCC was welcomed by bankers. Just under two weeks later, however the MCC board was plunged into bewilderment and anxiety. According to Brookes, that day Kevin told the MCC board that 1.9m of MCC's total of 10.6m Berlitz shares 'were not where they should be'. It emerged that they had been already pledged to banks to raise loans for private Maxwell companies - the private companies had in effect appropriated an MCC asset. Brookes says that he had no idea that this had been done. It was an explosive issue for the MCC board because MCC had nearly Dollars 2bn of debt  -its 'jumbo loan', famous in banking circles. One of the conditions of the loan was a so-called 'negative pledge' - a promise that MCC would not sell or mortgage assets of more than Pounds 10m without the permission of the banking syndicate. Brookes asked Kevin if any other share certificates were missing. Kevin replied: 'Could you make sure there aren't?' Brookes now says: 'In fact we couldn't have checked.' Some of the shares had been transfered to a company in the heart of the Maxwell labyrinth of private companies - Bishopsgate Investment Trust. It is similarly named, but entirely distinct from Bishopsgate Investment Management, the pension management company. Brookes says: 'We had no way of tracing them once they had gone into BIT; no one else but Kevin was a director of both.' Later, it was revealed that some of the shares had been transfered to BIT a year earlier - in November 1990. The issue of whether the transfer of the Berlitz shares to BIT was improper is not clear-cut. Nor is it clear whether, when BIT later pledged the shares to banks for private Maxwell company loans, this was a breach of MCC's bank covenants. What is clear is that Kevin knew about the pledging of the shares long before his father's death and knew that, therefore, they could not immediately be sold to repay MCC's debt. The same memo from Trachtenberg to Kevin discusses - as long ago as December 1990 - whether shares in 'BTZ', believed to refer to Berlitz, could be used as security for bank loans. A signed letter from Kevin to Lehman Brothers International, the US bank, dated September 20 1991, also confirms the 'transfer of 1.37m shares in Berlitz from ourselves (BIT) to yourselves . . . by way of security for the loan of Dollars 117m United States Treasury Bills from Lehman to BIM'. On Sunday November 24 MCC's US lawyers discovered that 2.4m more Berlitz shares were missing. Documents dated November 13 1991 - eight days after Maxwell's death - were signed by Ian Maxwell and Trachtenberg, and confirm the pledge of 2.4m Berlitz shares to Swiss Volksbank in return for a Dollars 35m loan. Some of the banks which received pledges of shares are now claiming the right to keep the shares - making the sale to Fukutake impossible. The pledging of Berlitz blasted a Pounds 144m hole in MCC. On Sunday December 1, at a meeting of all the Maxwell bankers, Coopers announced that it had uncovered a hitherto undetected pattern of loans within the empire. The private companies - now effectively bankrupt - owed MCC, MGN and the pension funds hundreds of millions of pounds which would never be repaid. The next morning, MGN and MCC shares were suspended a second time on the stock market. A fax from MCC's US office slid on to Brookes' desk. It revealed Kevin's signature before Maxwell's death, arranging the pledging of Berlitz shares - and the signatures of Ian and Trachtenberg after his death. One MCC director says: 'I had thought Kevin was on our side but after this I realised what we had in our middle.' Kevin rang Anselmini at his Paris home late that night. According to Anselmini he said: 'It is being said we are responsible for hundreds of million of pounds missing. I cannot go into explanations, but I did not want you to know from the press or the other directors. Also, the banks are demanding that my brother and I quit. Could you call them and see if they can be persuaded?' Anselmini soon called Kevin back. He had discovered that it was the other directors more than the banks who wanted him out. Peter Laister told Kevin the directors wanted him out. On the morning of Tuesday 3rd December the Maxwell brothers resigned their chairmanships of MCC and MGN. That evening they moved their offices. After his father's death, Ian had moved from Maxwell House's ninth floor to the adjoining MGN building - but he now moved to an office on the south side of Maxwell House's sixth floor, one of the private Maxwell company suites. Kevin moved down from the ninth to join him, taking an office on the north side. Trachtenberg had an office between them. Maxwell House staff helped the boys move during Wednesday. The brothers took their personal possessions out of the offices, their word processors together with their electronic files, and some papers. On December 4 Brookes circulated a memo in Maxwell House prohibiting the shredding of any documents. The following day the Maxwell private companies went into administration under UK insolvency laws. MCC struggled on for 11 days, but finally on December 16 filed for administration under UK and US insolvency laws. One MCC director says: 'It was both the money loaned out of the bank account that finished us off - and Berlitz.' The SFO subsequently announced that it was launching five separate fraud investigations into the collapse of the Maxwell empire. Meanwhile Kevin Maxwell has attempted to keep trading. One of his friends commented that he is obsessed with making a comeback, as his father did. He has told friends: 'Nothing in your life prepares you for fighting for your own survival.' , The FT's team of journalists has interviewed more than 150 people in 13 countries.

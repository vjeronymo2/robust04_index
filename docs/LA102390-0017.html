			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BACKERS OF 'BETTY,' THE CURIOUS, MEDIA GATHER FOR A SHOW  </P> <P> They began showing up at 7:15 a.m., lining up in front of Department 27 on the  fourth floor of the County Courthouse. The matter that got them out of bed and  into the maw of Monday-morning rush hour was one they had waited for and read  about for months:  </P> <P> The People of the State of California vs. Elisabeth Broderick.  </P> <P> It is, as one woman put it, "San Diego's most-celebrated murder trial in ages.  I wasn't about to miss it."  </P> <P> It drew the media -- the made-for-TV-movie people, the journalist writing a  book, and Ladies' Home Journal, focusing on the "trauma" of a middle-aged  woman. Representatives from tabloid TV shows "Hard Copy" and "Current Affair"  are expected later in the week.  </P> <P> It also drew dozens of women who said they identified with "Betty" and dozens  more simply attracted to the theater of a prominent murder trial.  </P> <P> Monday's behind-the-scenes action at the trial of Elisabeth (Betty) Broderick  -- arrested on Nov. 5, 1989, and accused of murdering her ex-husband, Daniel T.  Broderick, and his second wife, Linda Kolkena Broderick -- was described by  many on the fourth floor as a "zoo."  </P> <P> The courtroom of Judge Thomas J. Whelan seats 36 observers, eight of whom are  reporters covering the trial. Several of the remaining were taken up by friends  and relatives, leaving little room for the more than 100 onlookers who gathered  outside in the hope of getting in. A TV monitor outside the courtroom gave them  some idea of what was going on inside.  </P> <P> After a morning recess and a lunchtime break, several were allowed to enter.  The wait, they said, was worth it.  </P> <P> Wearing faded jeans and black cowboy boots, a woman named Ellen was at the  front of the line. She, like many of the middle-aged to elderly women who came  to watch, said she was there "out of sympathy for Betty" and because she  "identifies so strongly with what the woman went through."  </P> <P> "This trial is a perfect illustration of how badly women are treated in  divorce," Ellen said. "I, too, went through a bitter breakup and divorce. The  man to whom I was married seems very similar to her husband. My ex-husband  would call the police and have them come to my house, telling them I was  abandoning our child, which wasn't true. He had bullies harass me. I can relate  totally to what Betty went through."  </P> <P> Betty, Ellen said, was like a refugee from a Tammy Wynette song. She "stood by  her man," Ellen said, and all it got her was an extramarital "slap in the face"  -- Daniel Broderick's relationship with his then-unmarried secretary, Linda  Kolkena. In addition, Ellen said, "the woman lost her house, custody of her  children" and a privileged place in society.  </P> <P> It didn't seem to matter to many of those in attendance whether Elizabeth  Broderick was, as Deputy Dist. Atty. Kerry Wells said, guided by "hate, revenge  and murder" or that she had pulled the trigger on a man and woman who were, at  the time they were killed, sound asleep in their own home, which she had  entered illegally.  </P> <P> "A lot of us really believe he drove her to it," said Barbara Harbin, a  resident of Chula Vista, who frequently attends celebrated trials. She listed  the Sagon Penn and Craig Peyer trials as ones she had "very much enjoyed."  </P> <P> Another woman, who asked not to be quoted by name, said she had been a legal  secretary for 30 years, until she retired, and found murder trials "the best  theater going."  </P> <P> Iris Mann was first in line Monday morning. A student at Palomar College, she's  attending the trial for credit in a criminal evidence class. She said she's  fascinated with the goings-on.  </P> <P> "I'm supposed to be like the jury and decide whether the sentence should be  lenient or harsh," Mann said of her project. "Right now, I like the defense. I  prefer a lenient sentence for Betty. I just don't think she poses a threat to  society, which should be the criteria, right? She lost her mind -- not that it  justifies what happened. . . . It doesn't justify taking away two lives. But  life in prison for Betty? I think she should be allowed to come out and start a  new life."  </P> <P> Several in attendance, willing to be interviewed, were unwilling to be quoted  by name. One woman, who attended the Oliver North "Contragate" trial, showed up  at Department 27 well ahead of time and got a seat. (Several Broderick family  members were turned down.)  </P> <P> The woman said she makes it a practice to attend celebrated court proceedings  around the country. She called the Oliver North trial "the best courtroom  experience I've ever had, by far."  </P> <P> Why?  </P> <P> "Because I believe in Ollie North," she said.  </P> <P> She wore a bright blue cardigan, pinned with a small American flag. She said  she first became a "courtroom watcher" in Honolulu and "just kept going after  that."  </P> <P> Asked her feeling about the Broderick trial, she looked startled and vaguely  offended, and replied, "I have no feelings." She then walked away.  </P> <P> Bella Stumbo, a longtime reporter for The Times who is on a leave of absence,  said she is writing a book about the Broderick case. When asked what intrigued  her about the story, Stumbo, who declined to be interviewed, answered: "All of  it."  </P> <P> Another woman, who asked not to be quoted by name, said she works for the  production company that is working with CBS to complete a made-for-TV movie  about the case. She, too, declined to be interviewed.  </P> <P> Kathleen Neumeyer, a free-lance writer on assignment for the New York-based  Ladies' Home Journal, said her editors were intrigued by the story of a  housewife who had "spent virtually her entire adult life taking care of her  children," but who then is left for another woman.  </P> <P> "Statistically, very few women commit murder," Neumeyer said. "The public is  always fascinated when it involves the upper echelon of society, as this one  does."  </P> <P> Neumeyer said people are amazed when they hear that Betty Broderick was being  paid $16,000 a month in support from her ex-husband. They don't realize, she  said, "it was just a fraction of what he was making."  </P> <P> Defense attorney Jack Earley argued the same point, saying that Daniel  Broderick, who had a medical degree as well as a law degree, and who had been  president of the San Diego County Bar Assn., was paying his ex-wife only 10% of  his monthly income. He, Earley argued, was wearing tailored suits and driving a  Jaguar even when his family was sleeping in a rat-infested apartment.  </P> <P> As the six women and six men entered the jury box Monday morning, one person in  attendance whispered, "Not a one of them has ever seen a $100 pair of shoes."  </P> <P> Neumeyer said it was the wealth of the Brodericks, their place in society and  the bitter loss of what had once seemed their American dream, that led  journalists around the country to focus on "this real-life 'War of the Roses.'  "  </P> <P> But a few onlookers were drawn by more than the money being talked about. Glenn  Adams waited patiently for a seat, clutching his copy of "Deep Cover," a story  about the Drug Enforcement Administration.  </P> <P> "I like this scene for a lot of reasons," Adams said of the Broderick trial.  "Like, it's the ultimate 'Fatal Attraction,' man."  </P> <P> Some people came to wait -- and, if they were lucky, to watch -- just for  entertainment. One nattily dressed man, who asked not to be quoted by name,  said he came for "the pure theater of it."  </P> <P> "I have my choice," he said. "I can go to New York and see a Broadway play for  $35. Or, I can come here. I'll take here. This is a much better show than  anything on Broadway."  </P></p>

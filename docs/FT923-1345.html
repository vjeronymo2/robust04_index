			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia's war on oil industry corruption - Attempts to stem the losses resulting from abuses Russian authorities have declared war on corruption in the oil industry, the country's key earner of hard currency - but their struggle is made both easier and more difficult by parallel attempts to introduce a market economy. Abuses, some new, some longstanding, range from fiddles by refinery and railway officials to state-owned producers' use of foreign partners to get money out of the country instead of handing it over to the government. Capital flight is estimated at more than Dollars 2bn a year, while bribes paid to lower level Russian officials for facilitating irregular exports of oil and oil products exceeded Dollars 100m in the first half of this year. Mr Mikhail Gurtovoi, head of the government's anti-corruption commission, says 500,000 tonnes (3.5m barrels) 'disappeared' in the second quarter of this year. The losses are seen as particularly alarming against a background of plunging output (down to 398m tonnes this year from 460m last year) and declining export revenues, a result of years of half-baked economic reforms and neglect by recent governments. More importantly, the present government needs to protect itself from accusations that market reforms begun in January have unleashed chaos and must be slowed down. 'The danger is that instead of moving forward and trying to pick up speed for change, you say let's wait and try to impose order on a non-functioning system,' explains one official. 'It takes hundreds of steps to create a new system. You can't do it overnight.' The corruption is not new: it was no accident that one of the new government's first steps last winter was to re-register all export licences  -corruption was so rife civil servants had issued licences for exports worth double the country's annual output. But the replacement of Mr Vladimir Lopukhin, the radical oil minister, by a more old-style manager, and delays in freeing the oil price show the temptation to hesitate in the no man's land between the administrative-command system and a market economy which does not yet exist. 'There is no market environment although there are market aspirations. The vacuum is filled by malpractices, corruption, and disillusionment,' says Prof Yevgeny Khartukov, head of the Moscow-based World Energy Analysis &amp; Forecasting Group.' He says that this is compounded by sheer ignorance among managers of how to behave any differently. Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the new deputy prime minister responsible for energy policy, who professes puzzlement 'about what is meant by corruption', says that 'in the past everything was so centralised that producers did not get involved in this'. But in reality, the corruption has become decentralised. Where a once monopolistic Soviet oil ministry used to get kickbacks for awarding contracts to one firm or another, now individual directors and local officials, who have the right to sell a fixed percentage of oil output, are playing by their own rules. 'Before the corruption was more systemic because of the degree of fear and supervision which used to control individuals. Now that the lid has been taken off, people are behaving in different ways,' says Mr Jules Kroll, the head of a western consultancy which has helped track down money stolen by Third World dictators. The struggle against corruption has so far yielded slim results. There have been a few arrests at oil refineries, and investigations of oil producers who sell oil cheaply to commercial businesses for kickbacks deposited in foreign bank accounts. Russian commercial companies also pay bribes to regional authorities and oil companies to sell their export quotas for them. In its work for the Russian authorities, Kroll Associates has found 'dozens and dozens of foreign bank accounts . . . where the recipients or their relatives are being rewarded for the allocation of raw materials at favourable prices or arrangements'. These include accounts in Cyprus, Germany, Greece, Switzerland, Monaco, France, Britain and the US. The amounts vary from Dollars 50,000 to others 'where we see activity in excess of Dollars 1m at any point in time . . . these amounts are not static'. Although Mr Kroll declines to name specific firms or banks which hosted the funds, Mr Gurtovoi says that even a top institution like Deutsche Bank has found itself the unwitting home to ill-gotten gains. He also says that a lot of money was stashed away in bank accounts in Houston, a city familiar to many Russian oilmen. The joint ventures set up as the main form of foreign investment since President Mikhail Gorbachev came to power are also being systematically investigated and their right to export oil freely has been suspended: they now have to use state-owned intermediaries. Although none have been prosecuted - partly because the government is anxious not to frighten off potentially bigger foreign investment for the future - authorities have evidence that some are guilty of dishonest practices. One example of abuse in collusion with the joint venture's Russian partner is deliberately underestimating an oil well's output so that a joint venture can take out more oil as a reward for increasing output. But until Russia can develop an adequate legal framework and some political stability, it will find it difficult to avoid foreign firms cutting corners as a reward for their risk in coming in the first place. And until the oil manager has the right incentives not to divert resources away from the state or his enterprise, he will go on doing so. As one official explains, a Russian oil manager 'earns as much as the stipend of a student in the West while his western counterparts make millions of dollars'. 'He thinks of what he will leave his children. His enterprise may produce more oil than say Mobil or use equipment as sophisticated as theirs. But nobody has ever heard of his enterprise outside the Soviet Union and he won't get bank loans unless he attracts a foreign partner.' The collapse of the Soviet Union in December has also played a big role in the present crime wave. While the old system limped on in a system of closed borders, it has turned out to be a catastrophe in present conditions. This is because once oil is smuggled across what Mr Chernomyrdin called Russia's 'permeable borders' to outlying republics like Ukraine and the Baltics, there are no KGB border guards to stop it going further afield. Mr Ivan Sardak, deputy chief of the Interior Ministry's economic crimes department, wants Russian criminal legislation banning the unlicensed export of oil outside Russia. The only way he can prosecute cases of unlicensed exports at present is to prove that bribes were paid to ease the transaction - 'but this is very difficult because you need to have documents showing that bribes were paid.' While a simple solution would be to seal off Russia's borders and charge world prices to other republics, this has proven politically and economically difficult because of the highly integrated nature of the former Soviet economy. Another problem remains a lack of co-ordination among various Russian authorities and their foreign colleagues in fighting the corruption. In the end, however, any struggle of this kind in a country where most people are on some kind of fiddle will fail unless it is accompanied by root and branch reform.</p>

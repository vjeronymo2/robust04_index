			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Last Nafta hurdle cleared The last remaining hurdle to implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement on January 1 has been removed with an agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico to negotiate an anti-dumping and subsidy code over the next two years. Canada's prime minister, Mr Jean Chretien, who pressed for the code to fulfil a pledge in the recent election campaign to renegotiate parts of Nafta, yesterday presented the deal as a significant improvement to the agreement hammered out by the previous Conservative government. The three governments have agreed to set up one working group on subsidies and countervailing duties, and another on anti-dumping rules. Trade minister Mr Roy MacLaren said yesterday the Canadians had been assured that the Clinton administration 'will enter into these discussions in good faith'. There is no guarantee however, that a code will be drawn up by the target date of December 31 1995. The new Liberal government in Ottawa failed to persuade Washington to reopen Nafta's energy provisions. Despite reservations expressed by Alberta oil and gas producers, the Liberals had pushed for special assurances that Canada would be able to hold back energy exports to the US in the event of shortages. In a declaration of its own, Canada said it would take any measures necessary to ensure domestic energy security, including the establishment of energy reserves or new incentives for oil and gas exploration. The Canadian parliament passed Nafta enabling legislation earlier this year, but the law has yet to be promulgated. The US sees few, if any, obstacles to Chile's accession to Nafta or a bilateral free trade accord with Washington, Mr Curtis Kamman, the US ambassador in Santiago, said yesterday, writes David Pilling in Santiago There were no specific environmental or labour issues blocking an agreement, he said. The US would, however, 'watch with interest' the passage of Chile's environmental protection bill and would hope to see swift implementation of its new regulatory framework.</p>

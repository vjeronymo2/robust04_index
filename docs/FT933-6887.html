			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Sound money man: Michael Portillo talks to Peter Norman about tough choices on spending Three months ago, Mr Michael Portillo, the youthful chief secretary to the Treasury, made an uncharacteristic error of judgment. The issue of Britain's public finances, he opined, did not get the kind of public attention that it should enjoy. It was 'too technical and arcane to evoke consistent interest from media or the public'. Since making that remark in a speech to the annual dinner of the Association of Investment Trust Companies, the state of UK's public finances has hardly been out of the headlines. Not a day goes by without some reference to the Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement expected by the government for the current financial year or its implications for the government's first unified Budget on November 30. The Tory party, hardly pausing for breath after the conclusion of the bruising Maastricht debate, is displaying new divisions over the prospect of painful spending cuts and possible additional tax increases next year. Since returning from holiday at the beginning of last week, Mr Portillo, 40, who is currently deputising at the Treasury for Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, has seemed in perpetual motion from radio car to television studio to discuss the public finances. Yesterday, looking bronzed and relaxed, he put his views to the Financial Times. The government had two tasks to achieve. The public finances had to be put onto a sound basis, which meant reducing the borrowing requirement. Indeed, 'it is essential for the Conservative government to go into the next election with a reputation for sound public finance and in a position where it can explain that it has the public finances in a state where it can plausibly show the path to a low tax economy'. The second task, he said, was to make sure that the amount of national income which is taken by the state was reduced. 'We are committed to that in the manifesto,' he said. 'In other words the proportion within gross domestic product represented by public spending must be cut. And even if we had a balanced budget today I would be looking to reduce the proportion of GDP spent by government because I believe that the state is too big, people are looking to the state to do too much, and the proportion of our GDP spent by the government imposes too great a burden on the wealth-creating sector.' But, in remarks clearly addressed to the Tory right, anyone thinking that this could be achieved easily by cutting public spending was living an illusion. Mr Portillo insisted that the discussions on public spending being conducted by senior cabinet ministers in the so-called EDX committee were going well. But the government's public spending goals, expressed in terms of its so-called control total, of Pounds 254bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 263bn in 1995-6 were 'very tough indeed'. The control totals, which exclude part but not all of the rises and falls in public spending caused by vagaries in the business cycle, were coming under pressure. 'Our present plans would indicate no real-terms increase in the control total between this year and next year, and next year and the year after,' and yet certain programmes within the totals were rising faster than inflation. These included social security, where non-cyclical payments are rising in real terms by about 3 per cent a year, health, education, legal aid and payments to the European Community's common agricultural policy. The government was therefore faced with two difficult tasks. 'One is to constrain the rate of growth of those demand-led programmes, and the other is to find offsetting savings in other programmes.' The problems of rising social security spending are the subject of one of a series of reviews by the Treasury that are expected to set guidelines for reducing the size of state activity over the medium and longer term. But this process was also informing the options available to the government this year. Mr Portillo said he 'could imagine the state disengaging or reducing its commitments to programmes in the short term'. It was no secret that it was studying the rapid growth in payments of invalidity benefit to assess whether it was going to the right people. But 'the rate at which you can alter trends in public spending is severely conditioned by the need to alter commitments and therefore to pass legislation'. For that reason the government had to look beyond spending at the rate of economic recovery and the possibility of raising more revenue when judging how it should cut borrowing. 'If we were not now to bring down our rate of borrowing by use of all three means as necessary, we would establish permanently higher rates of borrowing, permanently higher rates of interest burden to be funded and therefore permanently higher rates of taxation.' With the Budget more than three months away and the next financial year over seven months distant, Mr Portillo was careful yesterday to keep open the government's options on future tax increases. But he held out some hope that the Tory party might not succumb totally to internal strife on the issue. 'I won't deny that there is a debate in the Conservative party. But I think it is considerably less sharp than the one we had in the '80s between wets and dries. All the people debating in the Conservative party are agreed about the need to constrain public spending and the need to have sound public finances. There is a lobbying and jostling around the balance between public spending restraint and taxation increase, and indeed were there to be taxation increases, lobbying about what sort of taxes they ought to be. That seems to me just the normal political interplay.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Greg Sheridan from the "Focus" section: </F> "Australian Eyes On Asian Horizons"]    [Text] Prime Minister Keating's plan, outlined this week  in Bangkok, to create a formal fusion between Australia and New  Zealand and the six tiger economies of the Association of  South-East Asian Nations is in many ways one of his boldest  foreign ventures yet -- one full of immense possibilities as  well as risks for Australia. It represents both a departure in  Australian trade policy and a seminal commitment specifically to  South-East Asian future.    The ASEAN six -- Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore,  The Philippines, and Brunei -- represent, outside China, the  most dynamic economies in the world. Keating has proposed  joining the ASEAN Free Trade Area [AFTA] to the Closer Economic  Relations [CER] agreement that exists between Australia and New  Zealand. This could create a vast free trade area worth $1000  billion [currency not further specified] a year.    The overall size of the South-East Asian economies is still  relatively small. As Keating pointed out, their combined gross  national product roughly equals that of Australia and New  Zealand. But this statistic can be misleading for the fact that  a far higher proportion of their GNPs goes to international  trade than ours.    Singapore is the world's 18th biggest exporter, while  Australia is 21st. Indonesia and Thailand rank 26th and 27th  respectively.    Thus the symmetry between Australia-New Zealand and ASEAN is  really false. As trading economies, ASEAN combined far  outweighs Australia-New Zealand. And, despite Australia's good  growth this year (which some estimates put as high as 5 per  cent) the ASEAN economies will almost certainly grow much faster  than Australia and New Zealand over the next decade. Moreover,  we run a substantial trade surplus with all the significant  South-East Asian economies. Already, there are a bigger market  for us than either the European or North America. They have  also shown by far the most rapid growth of any region in the  world in buying our elaborately transformed manufactures.    Therefore we stand to gain far more than ASEAN do from a  fusion AFTA and the CER. Indeed, it is not clear how practical  Keating's proposal is in the short term. Its real value  probably lies in its symbolism, the signals it sends both to  South-East Asia and more widely about where Australia stands.    The reason Australia would gain far more than the ASEAN  members from an AFTA-CER link lie partly in the different stages  of development and liberalisation of Australia and the  South-East Asian economies. Under AFTA, the ASEAN economies are  pledged to reach a common preferential external tariff on  manufactured goods of 5 per cent within 15 years. There are  moves to accelerate this timetable, especially, from Thailand,  but that is the limit of the existing commitment.    Most Australian tariffs, with the exceptions of motor  vehicles and textiles, are already at or near that level now.  Certainly, they will be within 15, or even 10 years (10 years  being the proposed accelerated timetable for AFTA). Moreover,  each AFTA-country is allowed to nominate temporary exemptions  from the common tariff and Australia could nominate motor  vehicles and textiles as its exceptions. Therefore under the  provisions of the actual AFTA agreement, Australia would not  have to take any specific actions to qualify for membership.    This begs the question of what benefit would be in an  AFTA-CER link for the ASEAN economies. The answer is, in the  short term, not much. The most important likely consequence of  AFTA coming into existence will be to affect international  investment decisions. Because AFTA will provide them with a  common South-East Asian market for most manufactured goods,  multinational companies investing in South-East Asia will have  an incentive to concentrate their investments in one single  country, rather than needing to invest in several countries to  get behind local tariff walls.    Australia could be a significant loser in this process as  even relatively hightech investment could be diverted away from  Australia and towards South-East Asia. Moreover, Australia has  a poor record over the past decade of actually investing in  South-East Asia, as oppose to selling exports there. The  creation of AFTA will probably make the link between investment  and trade more important than it is now. For Australia to get  on the inside of AFTA, therefore, could be immensely valuable.    For ASEAN members, the benefit might include that when they  are selling themselves as investment sites they could more  clearly point to the bigger combined market including Australia  and New Zealand. There might also be significant non-tariff area  of co-operation which could attract members to an association  with Australia and New Zealand.    However, the moves have to be seen in the context of wider  politics of international trade. There is currently a  semi-official American proposal for a Pacific Free Trade Area  including all of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation  economies. This seems to be completely inconsistent with  ongoing American trade actions against China and Japan. There  is also an older American proposal to extend the North American  Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA] across the Pacific, possibly  starting with Singapore. This deeply worries many Asian  governments as it offers the potential for the United States to  pick off Asian countries one by one and get whatever concessions  it wants on a bilateral basis.    At the same time, Malaysia is pushing for its East Asian  Economic Caucus [EAEC]. America opposes this (rather  hypocritically, given its support of NAFTA) on the basis that it  could divide the Pacific, driving America and East Asia apart.  Australia has opposed it also, originally because we were  excluded. Recently our friends in South-East Asia have offered  to deal us in on the EAEC but we have continued to oppose it  strongly on behalf of the Americans.    All of these proposals are swirling through the Pacific at  the same time as the world is trying to bed down the final  details of the agreement to conclude the Uruguay Round of the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    There is thus great uncertainty and much exploratory  thinking  about what kind of trade arrangements are going to dominate the  Pacific. In part everyone is waiting to see which way America  jumps, and indeed, if Keating's proposal looks serious, the  Americans may well be peeved.    It may be, however, that some wise heads in South-East Asia  see the move to join AFTA and CER as a way of making good use of  Australia's standing with Washington, to use Australia partly as  a protective shield in trade politics. It has been little  reported but the US has been harassing some of the best  performing South-East Asian economies, namely Thailand, Malaysia  and Indonesia, over what Washington alleges are oppressive  labour laws. This is regarded in South-East Asia as rank  hypocrisy and simply America deciding to penalise South-East  Asia for becoming competitive. It may be that with Australia  joined fully in an AFTA-CER partnership we can be of some  assistance in fending off the more brutish American trade  impulses.    However, no one should think securing effective Australian  membership of AFTA will be easy. The ASEAN-members do not want  to be dominated by a developed, predominantly Caucasian country.  Australia's robust political style and use of English tend to  make it effective, but also quite impatient, in international  forums. ASEAN diplomacy, although involving very intensive  processes of dialogue, is much more low key, quiet,  consensus-seeking -- at times a painfully slow business. ASEAN  would not want to find itself suddenly dominated by Australia.  It is very questionable whether Australia could adapt  adequately to the ASEAN style.  txt}Singapore has said publicly it has no objections to an  AFTA-CER link. And it was the Thais who first proposed it.  Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister, Suphachai Phanitchaphak, last  November in Melbourne suggested Australia could join both AFTA  and the EAEC. Indonesia has not publicly opposed the suggestion  but has said its priority is to bed down AFTA first and it  doesn't want to move too quickly.    But Malaysia has been resolutely against the idea. Some  Australian officials travelling with Keating briefed the  travelling press to the effect that Malaysia could be  enthusiastic about Australia linking up with AFTA. This must  rate as a postwar high on preposterous wishful thinking, spin  doctoring and misleading briefing.    Malaysia's Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad, was asked last  November to respond to Suphachai's suggestion that Australia  could join AFTA. He dismissed it out of hand and said: "How  can a country outside ASEAN join AFTA... unless of course  Australia becomes a member of ASEAN. Geographically, Australia  is excluded."    There is no doubt Malaysia can exercise a veto on an  AFTA-CER  link. This demonstrates once again the foolishness of the row  Keating got himself into with Mahathir last year and equally the  foolishness of the view which Keating now seems to hold that  Australia can effectively ignore Malaysia in its regional  diplomacy. This is just not true. Certainly, while Australia  continues to actively oppose Malaysia's EAEC, there is no chance  of Malaysia allowing us in effect to join AFTA.    This is where the risk in Keating's proposal comes in. If  months and months go by and absolutely nothing happens on  Keating's initiative, it will be seen to have been mere hot air,  just more windy Australian blah. And if this happens too often,  the Prime Minister's word will be significantly devalued.    However, the trade minister, Senator Bob McMullan, will, at  the end of this month, launch a report by the East Asian  Analytical Unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade  on the effects of AFTA on Australia and the possibility of an  AFTA-CER link. It will offer a path forward which will begin  very modestly with proposals for formal dialogue mechanisms.  This is probably achievable and will allow Keating to claim  that some progress is being made.    There are two other important dimensions to Keating's  proposals. Embracing so keenly such a big preferential trading  arrangement marks a step along the road of Australia apparently  abandoning its long-held commitment to traditional open  regionalism, that is, reducing trade barriers on most favoured  nation basis to everyone whether they are inside the group or  not. As it is still hard to evaluate what real-world  consequences Keating's proposals will have, it is difficult to  know whether this is a departure in substance or just rhetoric.  The opposition's reaction yesterday was essentially to caution  against this chance.    Second, making the whole proposal in Thailand is important.  Thailand is Australia's 12th largest export market. Our exports  there last year grew by an astonishing 50 per cent to $1.2  billion. Thailand remains one of the fastest growing economies  in the world. It is a nation of nearly 60 million people. It is  pivotally placed strategically and a natural entry point to  Indochina.    Paradoxically, because we have had so few problems in our  relationship with Thailand we have tended to neglect it. It  does not have the common British colonial experience of Malaysia  and Singapore, nor is it, like them, a member of the Five Power  Defence Arrangements, after ANZUS Australia's most important  military commitment. Nor does it press on the Australian psyche  in the way the sometimes brooding presence of Indonesia does.  We have found it culturally distant. But it is an extremely  important player in ASEAN, and APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation]. It has also paid in its citizens' blood to  establish a credible democratic system of government.    Keating's visit to Thailand was made to overcome partial  Australian neglect. This is reflected in the formation of a  Thai-Australian Ministerial Council, like those we have with  Indonesia and Japan. This is designed in part to spread our  interests in ASEAN so that the relationship with Indonesia,  admittedly very good, does not have to carry the full weight of  our aspirations in South-East Asia.    At least since the publication of Garnaut report in 1989,  Australia has understood the importance of North-East Asia --  Japan, the three Chinas and Korea. In this trip Keating has  made some headway in alerting the nation to the equal importance  of South-East Asia, even if some of his more ambitious trade  proposals do not come to pass.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lilian Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 12 (CNA) -- Taiwan is seeking to boost  trade with Southeast Asian nations by signing double taxation  avoidance agreements with countries in the region, the Board of  Foreign Trade (BOFT) said Thursday [12 May].    BOFT officials said the board has held consultations on how  to avoid double taxation with Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia and  Thailand. Although differences remain, the officials expressed  hope that agreement could be signed soon.    Meanwhile, Taiwan is also expected to ask the nations to  sign  more far-reaching taxation agreements in the future.    The Finance Ministry has already evaluated the impact on  Taiwan's tax revenue and trade relations if the expanded  agreements are signed. The ministry has also mapped out a  taxation agreement draft to help speed up consultations on the  issue.</p>

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: No time to think of return to dark mornings Sir, Why should the lives of millions of us be inconvenienced for the sake of (at most) a few thousand businessmen who can't be bothered to get to work an hour earlier (or have a sandwich lunch at their desks)? Their counterparts in the US cope quite happily with five different time zones. So Europe ought to be able to manage with just two. And please let us hear no more of the other spurious argument that was trotted out last time round: you state in your leader ('Times a-changing', September 24) that the government will rely on evidence that 'lighter evenings mean fewer traffic accidents'. Fewer accidents in the evenings, perhaps - but what about darker mornings, and the corresponding increase in accidents on the way to work or school? Anyone who remembers those depressing dark winter mornings during the year-long 1970s experiment will surely not wish to suffer a permanent switch to a regime which, after having been given a fair trial, was then soundly rejected. J H M Cockayne, 23 St Paul's Square, York YO2 4BD</p>

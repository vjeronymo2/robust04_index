			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Added value should be real measure for R&amp;D Sir, Since publication of the Department of Trade and Industry's report on R&amp;D (Technology: R&amp;D Scoreboard, June 17) there has been much discussion on the subject - yet none about the fact that there is little correlation between R&amp;D and sales, on which the study was based. R&amp;D should be measured in relation to added value created - that is sales less bought-in materials and services. An up-to-date analysis of the FT-SE Non-Financial companies shows that 40 per cent of the companies disclose R&amp;D expenditure rather than the 30 per cent implied in your feature. Of the remaining 60 per cent many are in distribution and leisure which incur no significant R&amp;D expenditure. For example, Marks and Spencer does not show any R&amp;D but much is done by its suppliers. The general manufacturing sectors of the FT-SE show an average of 1.83 per cent of sales being spent on R&amp;D but 5.25 per cent of added value. One company which is greatly affected is Rolls Royce whose 7.19 per cent on sales becomes 20.62 per cent on added value. Consumer goods, including pharmaceuticals, has averages of 2.69 per cent on sales and 9.28 per cent on added value. For Glaxo the change is from 14.99 to 25.19 per cent; for Fisons, 7.14 to 21.46 per cent. This latest analysis shows that total R&amp;D expenditure has risen by only 4.5 per cent in the latest year against a 5.5 per cent increase in sales and 4.3 per cent on added value. However, the situation in the general manufacturing sector is much worse with a 7.42 per cent drop in the latest year. This has been offset by an 18.74 per cent increase in the consumer goods sector. Comparing R&amp;D with dividends makes an interesting headline, but is this really a fair basis? Do dividends not depend more on national practices? Countries with low dividend practices will always come out favourably. Having undertaken analyses of international performance, I know that it is not possible to extract added value from US, Japanese and similar accounts. Nevertheless, it can be done for all west European countries. A study using added value would then be restricted to west Europe but would be much more useful. Britain's gross domestic product creates our national wealth. Added value creates our industrial and commercial wealth. We should be using the output measurement of added value for studies such as the one on R&amp;D. J Dennis Henry, V I Consultants, 11 Clydebrae Drive, Bothwell, Glasgow G71 8SB</p>

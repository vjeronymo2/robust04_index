			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFRICAN LOCUST PLAGUE REPORTED NEARLY OVER  </P> <P> Africa's worst locust plague in 30 years is almost over, the U.N. Food and  Agriculture Organization said Thursday.  </P> <P> An FAO statement said the population of desert locusts that ravaged crops in  North and Central Africa last year has been virtually wiped out by pesticide  spraying and lack of rain. Millions of locusts also perished in an  unprecedented flight over the Atlantic last October.  </P> <P> Only Niger and Mali have been infested in the last 10 days and only small  numbers of locusts persist in West and North Africa.  </P></p>

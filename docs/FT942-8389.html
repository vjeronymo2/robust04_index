			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Ferguson International jumps 21% Strong sales of cable television products in the US, acquisitions, exchange rate movements and the absence of exceptional costs helped Ferguson International Holdings to report a 21 per cent increase in annual profits. The restructured labels, hangers, and communications components group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 11.7m in the year to February 28, up from Pounds 9.7m last time when the outcome was reduced by a Pounds 400,000 provision for reorganisation. Turnover increased by 16 per cent to Pounds 140.4m (Pounds 121.3m), including Pounds 7.58m from the Red Wing hangers acquisition in the US in the second half. Exchange rate movements accounted for six percentage points of the turnover increase. Earnings per share increased to 23.5p (19.5p) and the final dividend is unchanged at 8.25p, maintaining the total at 12.5p. Mr Denis Cassidy, chairman, described the results as 'highly respectable in the circumstances'. He said they demonstrated a strong performance in all three of the group's main activities 'despite market conditions exerting intense pressure on operating margins'. Operating profit on continuing activities increased by 10.3 per cent to Pounds 12.5m (Pounds 11.4m), including a Pounds 489,000 initial contribution from Red Wing. UK operations accounted for 57 per cent of the total, down from 64 per cent. The core labels division produced flat operating profits of Pounds 7.23m (Pounds 7.22m) on sales which increased by 3 per cent to Pounds 71.1m despite the effects of fierce competitive pressures on the division's main retail customers. Operating profits in the hangers division improved 27 per cent to Pounds 3.15m on sales up 31 per cent to Pounds 41.4m, reflecting organic growth and input from Red Wing. Excluding the acquisition, profits were ahead 8 per cent. In the communications components side, TVC, a wholesale distributor of cable television products in the US, benefited from an upturn in demand and operating profits increased by 29 per cent to Pounds 2.16m on turnover up 36 per cent at Pounds 27.9m. Net debt increased by Pounds 3.7m to Pounds 8.5m, representing gearing of 24.2 per cent.</p>

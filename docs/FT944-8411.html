			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Books: Paris, the place of imagination - Proust would have approved; AC Grayling describes a city alive with history and literature TALES OF THE NEW BABYLON by Rupert Christiansen Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 20, 416 pages PARIS INTERZONE by James Campbell Secker and Warburg Pounds 20, 305 pages One of Proust's characters reports that he was made to play in the Champs Elysees as a child, and hated it. 'If only I had first read about it in a book]' he in effect says, thus claiming that to know and appreciate Paris best, one has to approach it through literature and history. For Paris is, more than any other city, a place of imagination; it comes most vividly awake to those who know the stories told by almost every one of its stones. These two books tell such stories. They perform similar tasks on different epochs and aspects of Parisian history: Rupert Christiansen displays six tumultuous, crowded and disastrous years at the end of the Second Empire, 1869 to 1875, while James Campbell portrays 14 recent years of expatriate literary life in Paris, 1946 to 1960. It is the same Paris in each case, serving not merely as a decorative backdrop to the action, but as the theatre where the events described were alone made possible. In each case the tight time-scale and richness of detail makes for utterly absorbing reading. Christiansen's subject is the catastrophic end of Napoleon III's great imperial dream. There is something half-touching about the liberal-minded but vacillating Emperor at last beginning to institute long-promised reforms, only to make the terrible mistake of going to war against Prussia and suffering swift defeat and therefore his throne. Prussia's army besieged Paris, forcing surrender; the Parisians' sufferings helped demolish the last traces of civil order, resulting in the Commune of Paris and its bloody suppression by the forces of France's newly-born Second Republic. Napoleon III's Paris was a site of self-conscious Renaissance. Baron Haussmann flattened large tracts of the old city and constructed great boulevards and sumptuous buildings, resulting - depending upon your taste - in 'mail-order grandeur' or a boldly handsome imperial capital. Napoleon III would have liked literature and the arts to be likewise monumental, but the sheer ebullience of Parisian life, not to mention its grimness, would not oblige. This was the era of the Goncourt brothers, of Flaubert and Zola, of the can-can and syphilis. Mix in the explosions of war and revolution, and the account Christiansen brilliantly gives is of Paris as a tangle of exposed nerves thrilling mercilessly in icy gales of change. Paris became fashionable as a resort for American writers as early as the Naughty Nineties, but their heyday was the 1920s, when Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway and Henry Miller, among many others, lived there. Hemingway wrote most of The Sun Also Rises in a Montparnasse cafe and met F. Scott Fitzgerald for the first time in the Dingo bar around the corner. After 1945 aspiring writers from America and Britain made their way to Paris partly as an act of pilgrimage, but mainly in emulation of these resounding forebears. As Campbell shows, it was not always a case of lesser mortals aping the great; for some, like the black writers Richard Wright, James Baldwin and Chester Himes, it was a way of breaking free from racial intolerance at home. For others, among them Vladimir Nabokov with Lolita and William Burroughs with The Naked Lunch, it was the only place they could get published. And for them all, it was the only civilised city where their sexualities, of whatever persuasion, could be acknowledged. Campbell recounts their Paris years marvellously. In the aftermath of war they felt an urgent need to experiment. Paris was alive with ideas and literature; Jean-Paul Sartre held court at the Cafe de Flore, and Jean Genet was about to explode on the world. Expatriate writers founded magazines, among them Merlin and the Paris Review. One of the chief triumphs of the former was its rescue of Samuel Beckett from obscurity; but its editors survived chiefly by writing pseudonymous pornography for the Olympia Press. Americans were not safe from McCarthyism even in Paris. They were visited by inquisitors testing for 'loyalty'. Some of those putatively writing novels in cafe corners were CIA agents; fingers are pointed that way concerning the mysterious death in 1960 of Richard Wright, author of the controversial novel Native Son. He had once been a communist, and was permitted to leave the US for Paris in 1948 only through the combined efforts of Gertrude Stein and Sartre. After his hasty cremation rumours flew, adding to the already foetid atmosphere of expatriate literary life in Paris. Both books are net contributors to our understanding and enjoyment of Paris. Proust's character would hugely approve.</p>

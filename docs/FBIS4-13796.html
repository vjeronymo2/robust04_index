			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] Brothers: Despite the acceleration of events and  the ferocity of dispute in the arena of political negotiations  between the PLO and the Israeli enemy, our Palestinian people  are confirming, exactly like they have always confirmed, that  they are stronger than all conspiracies and attempts to  undermine their internal front.    Through their awareness and lengthy experience in  confronting  the enemy, the Palestinian people have also confirmed that they  are always vigilant and capable of replying to enemies' plots,  so there will only be room for Palestinian freedom and  independence on the liberated land of Palestine.    The Fatah-Hamas agreement on adopting dialogue as the only  way to resolve political differences as well as prohibiting the  shedding of Palestinian blood at the hands of Palestinians is  actually a national achievement by the PLO regarding the  solidification of the domestic Palestinian position in the face  of the Israeli position that has persisted in beating the drums  of Palestinian civil war when occupation ends. It seems as if  Israeli malice wants to convince the Palestinians that it is  better for them to live under occupation and relinquish the  rights to their territories and homeland.    However, the recent Fatah-Hamas agreement in the occupied  Gaza Strip came to deal a back-breaking blow to all enemy  delusions, allegations, and schemes which primarily aim at  undermining the domestic Palestinian situation against the  Palestinian national authority in order to demonstrate that this  authority lacks eligibility and credibility in administering the  areas from which the occupation withdraws, and, consequently, it  would be useless and unnecessary to implement any future  agreements on expanding both the Palestinian self-rule areas and  the Palestinian authority's responsibilities.    This agreement not only contributes to entrenching and  consolidating the Palestinian national unity--so it will be a  rock on which all enemy conspiracies founder--but it also  stresses the bright sides of the comprehensive Palestinian  struggle in confronting the enemy and its schemes. This is  based on emphasizing Palestinian national principles when  democracy is established and when the first and foremost loyalty  will be for the homeland and for the interests of its sons,  without making any room for differences in political viewpoints.  Such differences would be a loophole through which the enemy  could penetrate to achieve its objectives and destroy the  Palestinian national achievements.    Furthermore, this agreement is a qualitative step in running  the conflict with the Zionist enemy. Despite stressing  continued struggle until the occupation is expelled from all  occupied Palestinian territories, this agreement has stressed  the anxiety of the Israeli side by emphasizing both the internal  stability in the Palestinian self-rule areas and the devotion to  the social and economic tasks assigned to all sons and groups of  the people in order to lift the suffering which resulted from  occupation and its practices. This is because Palestinian  security cannot be achieved amid unemployment and strikes.    Our people, the people of heroism and martyrs, have  confirmed  that they are deservedly the people of miracles and that they  know how to fight their enemies, safeguard their national unity,  and entrench and accumulate their national achievements until  independence and great victory are realized.</p>

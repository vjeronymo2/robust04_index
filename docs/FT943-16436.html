			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Soaring ratings for shots of the orange crazies - TV coverage has pleased viewers and sponsors, but annoyed purists In a cramped television production booth at the ESPN studios deep in rural Connecticut, Dennis Deninger leans forward from his seat and says into a microphone: 'Do you think you can cut in a shot of the crowd? We haven't seen any orange crazies in a while.' Moments later, the scene on the TV monitor showing the Holland-Morocco World Cup game switches from the field of play to the stands, where thousands of face-painted, flag-draped Dutch soccer fans - 'orange crazies' - are eagerly cheering their team. Moments later the cameras return to the action, and Deninger, co-ordinating producer for ESPN, the leading US cable sports channel, sits back in his chair apparently satisfied. ESPN is broadcasting 41 of the 52 World Cup games during the month-long tournament, and it has been the job of people like Deninger to bring the World Cup to life for an American viewing public which has traditionally regarded soccer as about as much fun as an Idaho potato-picking contest. Judging by the ratings, and the comments of critics and fans, ESPN and ABC - the latter is showing 11 World Cup games - have been doing a remarkably good job so far, thanks in part to crowd shots of crazy Dutchmen, kilted Irish, robed Saudis and scantily-clad Brazilians, all of whom have brought the colour and passion of the world's biggest sporting event into America's living rooms. Millions of living rooms, in fact. The first four games shown on the ABC network averaged a 4.7 rating, which translates into 4.4m homes. That is a larger audience than often watches baseball on summer weekends - certainly larger than ABC expected. The showcase game prior to last night, the US vs Romania, earned a 6.8 rating (6.4m homes), the biggest audience ever for a soccer game on US television. On ESPN, the first 24 games broadcast averaged a 2.2 rating, or 1.4m homes, an impressive audience for a sports cable channel. Its biggest audience, for US-Colombia, was larger than for ESPN's opening baseball game of the 1994 season. If the numbers have been impressive, the quality of ESPN and ABC's coverage of the World Cup so far is best described as solid if unspectacular. There have been few mistakes, and neither broadcaster has missed a goal, an improvement on the 1990 World Cup when US viewers were unable to enjoy Italy's lone strike against Ireland because of a commercial break. (Having learned an important lesson, ABC and ESPN are showing the games without commercials). The quality of the commentaries has been patchy, although that is understandable given the inexperience of the mostly American commentators, whose unfamiliarity with soccer has been occasionally exposed, most notably in their inability to anticipate developments in the flow of play, a key element in live sports commentary. Jack Edwards, presenter of ESPN's daytime World Cup coverage and a knowledgeable soccer enthusiast, says the biggest weakness so far has been 'the announcers' failure to understand what's about to happen before it happens. Most announcers were weaned on mainstream sports in America where things happen in a grid with very defined segments of action.' But there are other flaws in the World Cup coverage that cannot be blamed on ESPN and ABC, which have been receiving the main television feed for the World Cup from the European Broadcast Union (EBU), an alliance of European broadcasters. Although ESPN and ABC supplement that feed with their own cameras and replays, the bulk of what viewers see comes direct from the EBU. The EBU feed has come in for plenty of criticism, mostly for its poorly-timed use of replays and its uninspiring selection of crowd shots. Mike Hill, the British-born soccer expert on ESPN's World Cup Today show, says of EBU: 'They've missed some good action. It's been disappointing, and not up to the standard we saw in Italy.' Richard Sandomir, the TV sports critic for the New York Times, has also been critical. 'The on-screen choices need better judgment on the time of replays and close-ups. At least three scoring chances by my count were nearly missed because of a replay.' Andreas Cantor, the commentator for Univision, the Miami-based Spanish-language network which is also broadcasting the World Cup in the US, has described the EBU feed as 'horrendous', saying: 'I knew they'd try an American-style broadcast, with a lot of close-ups, head shots and going to the crowd every three minutes.' Jose Ramon Diez, vice-president of production for the EBU, denies that they are trying to appeal to American viewers. 'We try to satisfy not only the European audience but also the full international audience. So we are working with a very tough compromise, between the European style and the South American style, with more close-ups and replays.' Ultimately, the success of the World Cup coverage depends greatly on the quality of the soccer itself, and - at least in terms of maintaining high ratings - on the performance of the home team. The US national team's passage into the second round was a bonus for the broadcasters, but they knew it would not be long-lived. The impact of the home team's departure from the tournament yesterday, however, need not be disastrous for television, says ESPN's Jack Edwards. 'I think we'll lose about a quarter of our audience. But there could be a silver lining. If the Brazilians play beautiful soccer they will have done us all - and the game - a service.' It remains to be seen whether US viewers thought Brazil's play yesterday sufficiently beautiful to keep watching.</p>

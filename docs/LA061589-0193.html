			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NIBBLES AND BITS  </P> <P> The Irvine City Council voted 5 to 0 Tuesday to put off until next week its  decision on whether to establish a municipal arts commission, as recommended by  a two-year study commission funded by the city. On Tuesday, when the council  meets to consider budget matters for the coming year, it will decide whether to  fund the new five-member commission. City officials said that the first year's  operation of the commission would cost under $50,000, although when fully set  up and staffed the body would have an annual operating cost between $300,000  and $800,000. With the vote Tuesday, said Donald Rickner, dean of outreach and  community relations at Irvine Valley College and chairman of the city's  exploratory arts committee, "I think we moved one more step down the line"  toward establishment of the commission.  </P></p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Shareholders in Mediobanca clear way for cash call Shareholders in Mediobanca, the powerful Italian merchant bank, yesterday cleared the way for a rights issue which will raise at least L1,500bn (Dollars 932m) to expand the bank's investment portfolio and broaden its ownership. Bank directors refused to take questions from investors at yesterday's meeting on the continuing investigation by Ravenna magistrates into allegations that senior bank executives were involved in reporting false 1992 accounts for the troubled Ferruzzi-Montedison industrial group. The allegations, which Mediobanca denies, have cast a shadow over preparations for the rights issue. Although a price for the new shares is unlikely to be set until next week, Mediobanca says the first tranche of 100m shares will be sold for at least L15,000 each. Warrants will give the right to buy up to 10m further shares for at least L15,500 each. Yesterday Mediobanca shares, which had recovered in recent trading, slipped back 4 per cent to close at L15,229. Mediobanca masterminded the restructuring of Ferruzzi-Montedison last year, after it came near to collapse. However, the meeting was dominated by discussion of ordinary bank operations, despite attempts by some of the 111 shareholders present to raise the subject of the judicial inquiry. The bank revealed, for example, that it had increased its stake in Paribas, the French bank, from 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent, at a cost of some L91bn. Mr Vincenzo Maranghi, managing director, also said gross operating profit had slipped by some 6.5 per cent in the first 11 months of the current financial year, which ends on June 30. However, the after-tax result is likely to be bolstered by such items as underwriting fees. In 1992-93, Mediobanca's net profits were L200.1bn, down on the previous year. The rights issue is partly intended to dilute the 50 per cent holding of the bank's traditional long-term shareholders - headed by former state-owned banks and including a roll-call of Italy's biggest and oldest companies - to about 40.6 per cent.</p>

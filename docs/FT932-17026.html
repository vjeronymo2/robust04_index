			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Intrigue and drama behind the cameras - The legal wranglings going on in the SelecTV boardroom MR Michael Buckley, the ousted chairman of SelecTV, the independent production company, is pushing for an independent legal investigation of affairs at the company, famous for hits such as Birds of a Feather and Lovejoy. The former chairman is also trying to win support from institutional investors such as JCFM, the fund management company of stockbrokers James Capel, for an extraordinary meeting of the television company to look at what he believes are irregularities in the way SelecTV has been run. The drama happening behind the cameras is every bit as intense as anything SelecTV has produced on screen. It involves intrigue, enormous egos and a plot to overthrow the managing director - a plan which backfired when one of those involved changed his mind and it was the chairman who was ousted. The small cast of characters includes Mr Buckley, chairman until he was ousted. He was a co-founder, with Mr Allan McKeown, of the modern Select, formed in 1988 through the acquisition of Witzend Productions, Mr McKeown's television production company. Before then SelecTV had mainly been involved in cable television. Then there is Mr Peter Laister, a former chairman of Thorn EMI who is a Select non-executive director because he once represented Mr Robert Maxwell's stake in the company. It was sold just before his death. Mr Laister has now assumed the chairman's role. The other two characters are Mr Michael Pilsworth, who is in charge of day-to-day management, and Mr Tony Charles, who is in charge of production. Mr Buckley was involved last week in the issuing of a writ against Mr McKeown, the SelecTV managing director, who is married to actress Tracy Ullman. The writ became public, with details published in the Sunday Times. The statement of claim alleges that Mr McKeown received Pounds 140,000 more than he was entitled to for renting a central London house he owned as offices for Witzend. An agreement drawn up in October 1988 set an annual fee for the use of the premises at Pounds 40,000. Solicitors Memery Crystal, who were asked to review SelecTV board minutes and documents by Mr Buckley with the knowledge of Mr Laister, found that the amount paid to Mr McKeown had increased first to Pounds 60,000 and then to Pounds 80,000 a year. Memery Crystal found that on the basis of the information and documents available to them this was done without notice or explanation. SelecTV raised Pounds 4.25m last month mainly to fund its share of development at Meridian Broadcasting, the new southern England ITV franchise, where it is a 15 per cent stakeholder. The rights issue document states in a note that Mr McKeown receives Pounds 80,000 a year for the house, 'a rate negotiated on an arm's length basis in April 1990.' Estate agents Hartnell Taylor Cook advised on the current rental value of the property in Derby Street last month and said that a rent of Pounds 27,250 a year was appropriate. The statement of claim also alleges that Mr McKeown did not make formal disclosure to the full board about Dollars 135,000 advanced to Witzend to enter a partnership to produce a play, The Big Love, in which Ms Ullman would star. According to the statement of claim the production of the play was not successful and no part of the sum of Dollars 135,000 was recovered. It is, however, believed the issue of the investment was raised with individual board members. The matters alleged came to light after Mr Buckley, who owns 4 per cent of the company, became concerned about the scale and cost of SelecTV's US operation, run by Mr McKeown. Memery Crystal were asked to review company minutes and documents relating to four transactions. Apart from the licence on the Derby Street house and the contribution to the play, they involved an alleged payment by the company of Pounds 17,000 for an option on a film; and an alleged payment to Mr McKeown of Dollars 33,000 salary in October and November last year, when the monthly salary authorised by the company for those months was Dollars 16,666 a month. In an assessment delivered to the board last Friday, Memery Crystal, after taking counsel's advice, said the matters appeared very serious and that the board should take immediate steps to recover 'all sums misappropriated.' If the board did not do so then each director would be personally liable. Memery Crystal advocated the dismissal of Mr McKeown because of his alleged 'gross misconduct.' The board decided that the best action was to to have the allegations fully investigated by the company's solicitors Richards Butler. On the same day (March 26) a draft circular to shareholders was drawn up by Memery Crystal on the instructions of Mr Buckley and with Mr Laister's knowledge giving notice of an extraordinary meeting of the company to be held on April 20. The proposed resolution was that Mr McKeown be removed from office as a director of the company. The termination of Mr McKeown's contract and the licence fee on the London house would save SelecTV Pounds 475,000 in the current financial year apart from travel and related expenses, the document said. The circular which was never sent also said the company would cease US operations in their present form. Later on Friday Mr Laister called the offices of Memery Crystal and agreed that the writ against Mr McKeown should be issued. 'I did not object to it being issued but I made it clear I did not want it to be served,' Mr Laister said. Yesterday, Mr Laister said he regretted his decision to go ahead with the writ which has not been served and which the board now wants to withdraw. Mr Laister appeared to change his mind over the weekend on how SelecTV's difficulties should be resolved but he said he saw his role as the company's only non-executive director as listening to everyone. 'I was given a package of papers prepared ahead of time, without my knowledge, without any input from me and without my agreement,' said Mr Laister who said his view changed as more facts became available to him. At a board meeting on Monday Mr Buckley was dismissed as chairman of the company, although he still is a director and replace by Mr Laister. Only two people voted. They were Mr Pilsworth and Mr Charles who both voted for the removal of Mr Buckley. At the board meeting it was also decided to ask Richards Butler to conduct a thorough investigation into all the issues raised. A report is expected early next week. Mr Laister said the review would be thorough and that he would make 'a very full statement' on all the matters involved. Earlier this week he suggested that the issues could be technical and administrative. He said that neither he nor Mr McKeown could talk about the issues until the review was completed. Issues have got to be sorted out as a matter of fact but I am not going to do so in the columns of the press,' said Mr Laister.</p>

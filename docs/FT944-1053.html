			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Right decision, wrong tactics The Mexican government's decision to allow the peso to devalue was correct from an economic standpoint but, as the panic in Mexico's financial markets yesterday illustrated, one it handled unnecessarily badly. All governments suffer credibility crises following devaluations, but the Mexican government's tactics before and after Tuesday's currency move have increased the damage. The message the markets are sending the new administration of President Ernesto Zedillo is that further adjustments to economic policy are necessary to ensure the gains from currency depreciation are not frittered away. It will take much more than this one step for the economy to be freed from its straitjacket of slow growth. Tactically, the government would have done better to give the peso room for a larger devaluation to make its new floor more easily defensible. More fundamentally, investors were seeking a government commitment to act forcefully to curb the current account deficit that is their central concern. Instead, they were fed a series of government statements which blamed the devaluation on 'temporary' political factors. Like other governments in Latin America, the Mexican government was forced in the late 1980s - by the complete absence of credibility in fiscal and monetary policy over many years - to use the exchange rate as its principal weapon in the battle against inflation. In the six years of the administration of President Carlos Salinas, the credibility of fiscal and monetary policy was substantially enhanced. However, he has bequeathed to his successor a substantially overvalued currency and an economy locked into a cycle of high interest rates and slow growth. The current account deficit had grown to 8 per cent of gross domestic product, which had to be financed by capital from abroad. Virility symbol With the tense stand-off between peasant rebels and the Mexican army continuing in the southern state of Chiapas, investors had been pulling their money out of the country, despite the high interest rates on offer. The strong exchange rate had become more of an economic virility symbol than a helpful policy tool. At a level of four to the dollar, the peso appears now more or less appropriately valued. The government's first task is to reassure financial markets that this is the case. It must ensure that the devaluation does not feed, via wage pressure, into inflation, which would erode the competitive gains resulting from the devaluation. The government has secured an agreement with business leaders and trade unions - under the so-called pacto - to limit wage increases to 4 per cent in the coming year. This should help to keep inflationary pressures under control during this transitional period. The government also needs to send a clear message of its intention to tackle more directly the roots of the current account deficit, which will remain uncomfortably high for some time to come despite the devaluation. Domestic savings The deficit is a reflection of the weak level of domestic savings, which entails a heavy reliance on foreign savings to sustain investment and promote growth. Because the main savers in Mexico are companies rather than private individuals, a devaluation whose consequences, over time, should increase company profit margins can help to raise the domestic savings rate. In the meantime, the government must announce credible plans to increase its own savings - by enlarging the budget surplus. The government also needs to spell out its intention to remove the many remaining obstacles to Mexican competitiveness. Economic reform in the past 10 years has been extensive, but inadequate to clear the path for adequate growth. Deregulation needs to go much further and faster. The judicial reform announced by the president must be vigorously pursued to provide business with confidence in the rule of law and the sanctity of contracts. The government also needs to move further on privatisation. The clearest signal it could offer would be to announce plans to privatise the inefficient state-run electricity and energy monopolies. Were it to do so, the markets might begin to revise their hitherto unfavourable view of this week's events.</p>

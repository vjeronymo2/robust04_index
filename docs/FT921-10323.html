			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Vodafone Vodafone has bought itself a larger share of the portable telephone markets in Sweden and Denmark. But the Pounds 21m price tag on its participation is at odds with the fact that not so long ago, cellular licences were being given away. Vodafone's strategy of building a European network is proving less simple and much more expensive than expected, not least because management has discovered how easy it is to trip over unpredictable political barriers. In the medium term, the cash flow from the UK business is easily robust enough to support competitive bids for overseas franchises. All the same, the group needs a success or two to reassure its shareholders. Indeed, the story since the demerger from Racal last year has become one of frustration for investors. The group was too quick in November to hint at an end to the recession. When evidence of better trading failed to materialise, the market took note. Vodafone's shares have underperformed by 8 per cent over the past three months. Despite the improvement in January's business figures, the shares now face an uneven two-way pull. On one side is the prospect of UK economic recovery later this year. On the other is next year's arrival of competition from the PCN companies which promise a much cheaper telecoms service. Vodafone will presumably have to come up with price cuts to persuade its existing customers not to jump ship. There is also much to be said for launching a marketing campaign before the rival is actually available. Logic says that Vodafone cannot hang on to its near-60 per cent return on capital while it is thus defending its market share.</p>

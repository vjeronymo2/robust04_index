			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Roberto Molina] </F>   [Text] The golden chimera that the world predicted would  follow the decreed end of the Cold War compares to the promise  of a bright future out there, on the horizon, that imaginary  point whose remoteness increases as we believe we are getting  closer.    These illusions, which vanish almost as soon as they are  born, constitute the basis of new worries that emerge before the  international community on the future of the world and the  danger of the so-called globalization of politics. This is a  sort of pretension establishing that everyone must act the same  in accordance with a predetermined script. Those objectives,  evidently, were always behind the phrase "the new world order."    The United Nations, with its current 184 members, could not  remain detached from this new trend in international politics,  and soon the practical results of this trend began to be applied  in the United Nations. Perhaps, the first warning signal to UN  members came from the Security Council, one of the seven main UN  bodies, whose major responsibility, according to the Charter  adopted in 1945, is to look after the preservation of  international peace and security.    The true symptoms of the practical implementation of the new  order include the lack of transparency in its endeavors, the  schematization, the routine in the reports of the General  Assembly, the unofficial consultations behind closed doors among  its 15 members, and an increase in peace-keeping operations.    The leading complaints made by most countries, especially  those in the Third World, revolve around three aspects: an  increase in the number of Council members, the elimination or  the limitation of the use of the right to veto, and a greater  transparency in its decisions and interrelation with the General  Assembly.    These grievances might appear fair and -- why not -- even  modest to anyone. A task force, however, created by the General  Assembly to analyze all aspects related to perfecting the United  Nations, is involved in a new "diplomatic" battle, as many have  labelled the situation, a battle consisting of smiling in  public, playing with words in speeches, and lobbying intensely  among those with kindred thoughts to impose ideas.    None of the five current permanent members of the Security  Council (the United States, Russia, France, China, and the  United Kingdom) is willing to relinquish their right to veto,  judging from their discussions, although the advocates of a more  democratic new world order, as they are recommending, are among  them.    There is more. While they agree with the rest of the world  on an eventual increase in the number of members, they argue  that, for the sake of the organization's efficiency, no more  than three countries should be added. They are firmly favoring  Germany and Japan.    At least, they are suggesting that the selection take place  through the so-called kindred groups, a category aimed at  eliminating the effectiveness of existing regional groups and  also at undoing the principle of equitable representation by  geographic areas at every UN specialized agency.    As for the veto, many Third World countries are proposing to  limit its use to cases related to very relevant issues only.  For instance, Mexico advocated limiting its use to the  imposition of penalties to those countries that violate  international order. There are even countries that propose  adopting a mechanism consisting of two vetoes in order to block  a resolution.    The U.S. position is clear. Karl Inderfurth, alternate  permanent representative, recently said he is convinced the  current status quo of permanent members should remain the same,  even the right to veto.    As for the suggestions to curtail or regulate this  privilege,  he emphasized that the use of two vetoes, as well as the  enhancement of procedures under which a veto is unenforceable,  are unwise solutions to nonexisting problems.    In all these discussions, two Latin American countries,  namely Mexico and Cuba, have maintained clear positions in  harmony with the opinions of the majority, which favors  democratic changes within the UN.    Ambassador Victor Flores Olea, permanent Mexican  representative, has been permanently active in the task force.  He pointed out that the original political circumstances that  created the right to veto were already surmounted; this is why  we cannot make the same mistake of granting this right to  potential new Security Council members.    Both Mexico and Cuba agree it is time to eliminate the  Council's provisional and operational guidelines in effect for  the past 50 years and support the adoption of permanent  statutes, including proposals for procedural reforms and methods  of work.    To that effect and due to the increasing number of issues  being discussed at the Council, many state-members are  questioning the ever-increasing use of the closed-door method of  dealing with unofficial issues.    This situation is leading the rest of the UN members to have  a limited knowledge of transcendental peace-keeping and  international security issues, because secrecy and covert  agreements have become the rule.    Mexico and Cuba maintain that, by opening new channels of  communication with other UN members and by devising new  mechanisms for their participation, the Council's authority will  be enhanced and the states will feel truly committed to and  responsible for the Council's decisions.    The growing trend among the Council members to adopt strong  measures -- as stipulated in Chapter VII of the UN Charter for  matters that threaten peace and international security, thus  failing to exhaust the mechanisms for peaceful solutions to  conflicts, as stipulated in Chapter VI -- is also worrisome.    This is why the United States is more inclined to deploy  troops to the four corners of the earth and to resort to  military operations -- an image very removed from the principles  upon which the United Nations was instituted, precisely as a  result of the end of the 1945 military actions.    It is still not uncommon to listen to hard-line lingo  uttered  by some representatives of large countries, even from permanent  members of the Security Council, without exhausting the arsenal  of recommendations stipulated by the Charter to seek bargained  solutions. This behavior proves we are far away from realizing  the beautifully depicted dreams of the post-Cold War world.  Seeking equality and the democratic enforcement of  international law is also a UN goal.    For the time being, it is difficult to forecast how the  Security Council will be redesigned to align itself with the  reality of our times. It is very clear, however, the path to  accomplish this goal is not exactly a bed of roses.</p>

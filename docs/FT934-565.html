			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Oxfam in Burundi refugee appeal The British charity Oxfam appealed yesterday for urgent international aid to avert 'a terrible humanitarian crisis' among 750,000 refugees from the central African state of Burundi, writes Michael Holman in London. The refugees fled to neighbouring Tanzania and Rwanda in the wake of an attempted coup in Burundi on October 21. It triggered off widespread ethnic clashes in which thousands of people died. Oxfam said that the lives of some 40,000 refugees stranded in Kitanga, north-east Tanzania, were most at risk.

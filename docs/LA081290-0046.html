			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAWAII OPINIONS  </P> <P> I know from reading his columns that Jerry Hulse is not too fond of  mega-resorts in general. I personally love them and luxury hotels of any kind.  </P> <P> As a complete surprise, I absolutely hated the Hyatt Waikoloa. For one thing,  as stated in his article, I also thought it reminded me of a cheap amusement  park. It's definitely overdone, bordering on the ridiculous.  </P> <P> The major problem is that there is a serious design flaw that made me feel  uncomfortable.  </P> <P> There is a terrible claustrophobic feeling about the resort, an awful feeling  of being trapped in a maze.  </P> <P> For the most part, whether walking, riding the stupid tram or the boat on the  canal, one doesn't feel a connection to the outside world. I felt simply stuck  among the maze of fauna and jungle growth. I heartily agree with Hulse this  time.  </P> <P> MIKE POWELL  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAVAGING REV. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.'S REPUTATION  </P> <P> It is interesting to note that Ralph David Abernathy is vice-president of the  board of directors of the American Freedom Coalition, one of the most  ferociously right-wing, allegedly Moonie-backed groups that currently exists in  the United States.  </P> <P> Is his biography of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. truly a quest for truth, or  is it one more attempt to discredit those men and women who fight for the civil  liberties of the disenfranchised?  </P> <P> VIRGINIA URIBE, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Case for global social security The richest fifth of the world's population generates - and enjoys - 85 per cent of world output. The poorest fifth produces - and struggles to survive on - just 1.4 per cent. This extraordinary maldistribution of global prosperity seems difficult to justify. But it also means that a great deal can be done for the poorest at relatively limited cost to the richest. To the credit of its authors, at least parts of the agenda put forward in this year's United Nations Human Development Report for next year's World Summit for Social Development meet that test of practicality. One of the peculiarities of 20th-century social security systems is that what might seem a universal moral obligation upon the rich to help the poor is turned into a narrower obligation to help fellow citizens. This treatment of national income as a form of private property is politically inevitable. Its moral justification is rather harder to detect. It also has very practical consequences. At present, the industrial countries allocate 15 per cent of their combined national incomes to providing social security at home, while only 0.3 per cent goes on foreign aid. The domestic social safety net helps those 100m fellow citizens who receive average incomes of less than Dollars 5,000. But the poor in developing countries number some 1.3bn, with average incomes of less than Dollars 300 a year. Yet, incredibly, the impression persists, particularly in the US, that foreign aid is a major diversion of resources from the more deserving at home to the undeserving abroad. Tricky choices The challenge of securing what the report calls 'sustainable human development' is therefore just as much to the supposedly caring left of the political spectrum of the advanced countries, as to the allegedly unfeeling right. Everyone would have to accept large changes to their normal way of looking at things. The report also shows that once wealthy countries, under the influence of their powerful environmental lobbies, have raised the standard of global sustainable development, it is they, yet again, who face the tricky moral choices. 'The north has roughly one-fifth of the world's population . . . and consumes 70 per cent of the world's energy, 75 per cent of its metals and 85 per cent of its wood.' If global resources and carrying capacity are indeed limited, as environmentalists insist, then the north's free access to these globally scarce assets cannot be justified. Yet if, for example, the environment were correctly priced and permits issued on the basis of population, as well as gross domestic product, rich nations might have to transfer 5 per cent of their combined national incomes to the poor. Human development When confronting people with choices this painful, it is wise to offer them a way out. One of the report's escapes is a specific practical proposal, justified under the label 'human security'. It argues inter alia for a compact on human development, aimed at meeting the basic needs of everyone: access to primary education and healthcare, clean drinking water and sanitation; immunisation of all children; halving of maternal mortality; access to family planning services for all who want them; halving of adult illiteracy; and elimination of severe malnutrition. Among the benefits of this programme could be a marked reduction in fertility. This programme, it argues, would cost a mere Dollars 30bn-Dollars 40bn a year, about a third of what developing countries spend on their military and 5 per cent of the global arms budget. This could be provided by devoting 20 per cent of total developing country budgets and 20 per cent of industrial country aid to these objectives. This compact is, of course, a long way from the report's more ambitious ideas for a 'global human security fund', financed by global taxation. It would not of itself halt the political and social disintegration that now threatens the survival of such countries as Afghanistan, Angola, Haiti, Iraq and Mozambique. But the merit of the report is that it does more than make readers think large thoughts about the peculiar world in which we live. It also presents such politically and organisationally practical ways of making it somewhat less peculiar.</p>

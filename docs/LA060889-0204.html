			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BEIJING HOTEL, FOCAL POINT OF VIOLENCE, CLOSES ITS DOORS  </P> <P> The Beijing Hotel, the oldest and largest in the capital and a focal point of  this week's Chinese army assault on pro-democracy demonstrators, closed today  until further notice.  </P> <P> Foreigners who tried to enter were told that it was empty, accepting no guests  and that its restaurants and shops were closed. It ran out of food two days  ago.  </P> <P> Situated on the Avenue of Eternal Peace about 400 yards east of Tian An Men  Square, the hotel provided a grandstand view of tanks and troops as they moved  to and from the square and city center.  </P> <P> Foreign journalists took over some of its 1,000 rooms when tourists beat a  hasty retreat as the brutal attack began Saturday night. But by Wednesday,  security men had covered the windows of rooms occupied by journalists to stop  them from watching military activity.  </P></p>

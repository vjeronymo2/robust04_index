			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Yeltsin arrives to wave of Japanese hostility MR Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, arrived in Tokyo late last night amid a chorus of criticism from opposition politicians and the press. Mr Yeltsin, leaving Russia for the first time since quelling last week's violent rebellion, will today meet Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, for the first of three discussions before departing tomorrow afternoon. Japanese security has called 10,000 riot police to Tokyo in anticipation of nationalist demonstrations against Mr Yeltsin's perceived intransigence over four islands north of Japan, occupied by Soviet troops at the end of the second world war, an issue the visit is not expected to resolve. About 300 loudspeaker trucks are expected to approach the Russian embassy and other parts of central Tokyo today to broadcast insults to Mr Yeltsin. Opposition to the Russian president's visit extends to the moderate right-wing Liberal Democratic party, which plans to issue a tough statement condemning Mr Yeltsin's use of the army against parliamentary rebels. Several LDP members of parliament have promised to boycott official receptions for the Russian leader. Despite these strains, both sides want to use the occasion to improve relations. However, Mr Hosokawa will express official regret at last week's bloodshed. He will also push for progress on the longstanding territorial dispute, which arouses passions among Japanese and has prevented Russia and Japan from signing a post-war peace treaty. Japanese newspaper editorials yesterday were deeply critical of the Russian situation and Mr Yeltsin. Any desire to improve relations was outweighed by 'mutual bitterness and mistrust', said The Japan Times. This will not change unless the dispute over the islands is resolved, on which no breakthrough can be expected this week, it said in an editorial. The Mainichi Daily News's editorial warned: 'We could find ourselves in a delicate position were Yeltsin to utilise his visit here for propaganda purposes to emphasise his legitimacy. 'Hosokawa will need to urge the Russian leader to return to the authentic road of democracy and check his high- handed stance.' Interfax news agency quoted Mr Yeltsin as saying before he left Moscow: 'I hope that this time the Japanese side will not raise the territorial question and spoil the visit.'</p>

			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> H. SANSBERRY; ACTRESS IN TV, MOVIES, STAGE  </P> <P> Hope Sansberry, a character actress, whose career dated to the early days of  film and stage but who will probably best be remembered for her portrayal of  the colonel's wife on the long-running TV series "The Phil Silvers Show," has  died in Laguna Hills.  </P> <P> Rose Mary Hinrichsen, a longtime friend, reported Sunday that Miss Sansberry  was 94 when she died Dec. 14 in Leisure World.  </P> <P> Generally assuming the parts of stately or professional women, Miss Sansberry  -- who also acted under the name Virginia Staunton -- was seen in either  Broadway or national touring companies of such stage classics as "I Remember  Mama," "Bittersweet" and "Oklahoma."  </P> <P> Her pictures included "The Thrill of It All," "Son of Flubber," "The Great  Waltz" and "A Crooked Ship."  </P> <P> In September, 1955, she began her most enduring role, that of Nell Hall, wife  of Col. John Hall (portrayed by Paul Ford) on Phil Silvers' outrageous satire  of military life. The program ran on CBS through September, 1959, and is still  seen in syndication.  </P></p>

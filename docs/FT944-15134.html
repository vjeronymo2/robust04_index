			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Brussels plans law to aid cross-border money transfers The European Commission yesterday overrode opposition from the banking industry and proposed legislation to make it easier, cheaper and quicker for small businesses to transfer money across borders. The decision marks the end of a long campaign to persuade European banks to improve their performance in the transfer of small-value payments - those of under Ecu10,000 (Pounds 7,894) - through self-regulation. The Commission still hopes banks will enact the measures voluntarily, although it is setting a deadline of December 1996 for EU ministers to pass the legislation. The proposals from Brussels would ban double charging - cases where banks charge customers for receiving cash as well as for sending it - and require banks to provide detailed, written information on services to customers. Money would have to be credited to the recipient's account within six working days, unless the customer and originating bank agreed it could take longer. A study this year showed 85 per cent of transfers met this target. Mr Raniero Vanni D'Archirafi, commissioner responsible for the single market, said yesterday the Commission had little choice but to legislate because banks had not done enough to reduce the costs of cross-border payments. There were 170m of these transfers a year and the number could triple by the year 2000, he said. It was vital to reduce costs for small businesses operating internationally and show the European public that the single market was working. However, the European Banking Federation said action had been taken on the basis of a 'flawed' study carried out this year for the commission. It said smaller banks were likely to stop offering services if legislation was enacted. Ms Diane Iannucci, the official responsible for payment systems at the federation, said larger banks were working on partnerships to speed up transfers and reduce costs, and these could be disrupted by legislative plans. The commission's study found that Europe's businesses and customers pay an average Ecu25.4 per Ecu100 cross-border payment, Ecu2 more than they paid a year ago. The average total time for a transaction is almost five working days. Mrs Christiane Scrivener, the commissioner who initially supported a voluntary code of conduct, hailed the proposed legislation. We could not put up with this situation for ever; at some point we had to act,' she said. Mrs Scrivener urged ministers to agree legislation as soon as possible. Internal market ministers will consider the proposal at a meeting in Luxembourg in October 31. The originating bank would be liable if a payment was not made on time, although it could shift responsibility by mutual agreement with others. Customers would be able to claim the money with interest if the deadline was not met. The Commission wants full disclosure of the costs of cross border transactions to customers; but it does not prescribe maximum charges because this could encourage cartels and run foul of competition law.

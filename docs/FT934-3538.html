			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Apollo Metals falls slightly to Pounds 1.03m Apollo Metals, the aluminium processor and distributor which gained a listing in May, turned in pre-tax profits down from Pounds 1.26m to Pounds 1.03m in the year to September 30. The outcome was struck on turnover up by 20 per cent from Pounds 23.4m to Pounds 28.2m and after an increased interest charge of Pounds 391,000 (Pounds 159,000). The directors said the proceeds of the Pounds 4.9m placing and open offer were received at the end of June - too late to have a significant impact on interest costs in the second half. As a result, and despite capital expenditure amounting to Pounds 2.1m during the year, the company now had a strong balance sheet and gearing at the year-end stood at just 7 per cent. A final dividend of 2.4p (2.3p) is proposed making a total for the year of 3.6p (3.45p). The dividend is 1.4 times covered by earnings per share of 5p (6p).</p>

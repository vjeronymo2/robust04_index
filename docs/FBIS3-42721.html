Akhundov, chairman of the board of the </F> Azerbaijan Industrial-Investment Joint-Stock Commercial Bank, by  A. Gamedov, VYSHKA economic observer; place and date not given:  "Life Generates Tactics, or Banks in the Transitional Stage"]    [Text] Today many people are dissatisfied with the  activity of the banks. Some people are inclined to think that  they are almost the main parties to blame for the production  slump. It has become a rule of good form to constantly berate  them, but the bank workers have their reasons which are based on  a deeper penetration into the economy of the transition stage.  But in fact how should correct relations be arranged between the  economic subjects and the banks so as to surmount difficulties  through joint efforts.    This was the topic of a discussion with the chairman of the  board of the Azerbaijan Industrial-Investment Joint-Stock  Commercial Bank, A.N. Akhundov. He was born in 1950 and in 1973  he graduated from the "Finance and Credit" department of the  Institute of the National Economy, after which he was sent to  work as a regular credit inspector to the republic Stroybank  [Construction Bank] office. He went in sequence through all the  steps of the service ladder. At the end of last year he was  elected chairman of the board of the joint-stock commercial  Prominvestbank, which was created on the basis of Promstroybank  [Industrial Construction Bank].    [Gamedov] Abulfaz Nuruyevich, please tell us about your  bank's place in the republic's finance-credit system. Why is it  needed, what are its functions?    [Akhundov] Azerbaijan has a two-level banking system. It is  headed by the National Bank, which is under the jurisdiction of  the republic National Assembly. The second level is occupied by  commercial banks. They too are divided into two parts: one is  made up of joint-stock commercial banks in which the government  owns controlling blocks of shares. It includes Prominvestbank,  Agroprombank, the International Bank, and Sberbank. The second  consists of a large group of purely commercial banks. There is a  total of about 160 of them. Among the aforementioned credit  institutions, Prominvestbank has the largest amount of  authorized capital--it amounts to 4 billion rubles [R].    [Gamedov] What brought about the transformation of your bank  into a joint-stock commercial bank?    [Akhundov] The demands of life, the need to reform the  economy, its shift to market principles. Among the first legal  normative acts adopted by the Milli Majlis in 1992 was the Law  "On Banks and Banking Activity in the Azerbaijan Republic." Our  bank was transferred into a joint-stock commercial one on its  basis.    Its position in our economy is determined by the fact that  90  percent of the industrial enterprises and construction  organizations, state concerns, joint-stock companies, etc., are  served by our bank. And they constitute the republic's  industrial might.    Its founders are Agroprombank, the State Fund for Social  Security of the Population, Sberbank, the state metallurgy  concerns, Azerigaz, the Ministry of Material Resources, the  Azglavenergo Production Association, the household air  conditioner plant, Glavbekstroy, Kaspar, the Khazar Joint-Stock  Company, the Aran Corporation, and others.    The volume of credit investments is R380 billion, which  amounts to more than half of the credit investments in  Azerbaijan. We render to our clients the entire complex of  banking services--accounting-cash operations, credit, and  consultation, we accept deposits from the population, etc.    [Gamedov] According to information available to the  editorial  office, the republic has no enterprises, organizations, or  institutions that are not indebted to one another. What work is  the bank doing to settle mutual debts among your clients?    [Akhundov] Indeed, the labor collectives have borrowed a  great deal from one another for the delivery of processed  materials, raw materials, finished products, work performed, and  services rendered. The sum of these debts as of 1 October was  more than R150 million.    Throughout this year in the system of Prominvestbank the  offsetting of mutual claims was carried out six times. The sum  of defaulted debts that were paid came to approximately R250  million.    The effectiveness of the offsetting depends on whether or  not  all enterprises, organizations, and institutions, and also  banks, participate in them.    To our great dismay, many enterprises and organizations did  not participate in the offsetting of claims, except in October,  and neither did all the banks. There were even cases where the  leaders of a number of branches who were accustomed to  complaining about everything and who had arranged in the  government for conducting the offsetting remained on the  sidelines as soon as the matter became a part of their practical  work. Moreover, enterprises and organizations under their  jurisdiction refused to participate in them. Enterprises of the  production association Azenergo, of the state concern  Azerkhimiya, the State Committee on Fuel and Energy, and others,  behaved irresponsibly.    [Gamedov] Did you share in the October offsetting of  accounts?    [Akhundov] Yes, I gave it a higher rating because a  relatively greater effect was achieved.    According to its results the sum of payments made on account  reached a half trillion rubles in the republic as a whole. For  this purpose the banks issued credit in the amount of R200  billion, and R300 billion was paid out of money paid by debtors  to their partners.    We shall conduct a similar offsetting of mutual claims in  December. In this connection I am conveying through VYSHKA a  request to the leaders of branches, enterprises, and  organizations that during the remaining weeks they check all the  debts against one another and provide for cashing in payment  documents.    Incidentally, the banks of Azerbaijan have created extremely  favorable conditions for the clients. The offsetting will be  accompanied not only by payment for all documents that are in  the card catalog but also payment for documents that will be due  during the period when the offsetting is conducted. That is the  first thing.    Second, in order to conduct it, credit will be granted with  a  sharp reduction of the interest rate, although this is to the  detriment of the interests of the banks, since it will reduce  their profit. The condition of the economy of Azerbaijan  prompted us to adopt this tactic. We are doing this exclusively  in the interests of the production collectives so that they will  be able to cast off their heavy financial burden more quickly,  rid themselves of debts, and put their working capital in order.  Unfortunately, not all businessmen are understanding about our  countersteps and are exerting no effort to improve the state of  affairs.    I must say that such extremely favorable conditions for  granting credit--only 5-10 percent--do not exist in any other  CIS country. Businessmen must skillfully take advantage of this  situation so as to end up this year with less financial strain.    [Gamedov] As I understand it a large number of labor  collectives are constantly experiencing strain in finances.  Because the existing constraints on funds make it impossible for  them to organize production normally.    [Akhundov] That is because the unbridled and insane  inflation  has greatly devalued the working capital of the enterprises,  organizations, and institutions and it is actually worth  nothing. They turn this working capital and bank credit into  debit indebtedness through the prepayment of accounts and they  earn foreign currency, which then lies in the bank without  moving.    It would be more correct to receive the debit indebtedness  promptly, transfer it for prepayment when selling their products  or rendering services, and put the foreign currency that is in  the account into circulation either directly or by receiving  rubles to cover it through the Baku Interbank Currency Exchange.    There are other shortcomings as well. A number of commodity  producers do not sell their final products promptly, waiting for  the next price hike. I will give some examples which provide a  general idea of the great unutilized potential. Thus R257  million worth of items have been stockpiled at the plant for  household air conditioners, the Bytmash Plant is holding  consumer goods worth 65 million, RORO [not further identified]  Mebel--R530 million, Bakvinzavod No. 2--R78 million, the Baku  textile combine imeni G.Z. Tagiyev--R91 million, and the Baku  spinning-fabric association for children's items--R31 million.    [Gamedov] In order to formulate the next question I shall  give two cases described in VYSHKA. In increasing the output of  products everything depends on the transfer of money to the  suppliers in order to acquire materials from them, but the  banking system has been spinning its wheels for a long time now,  according to the chairman of the STK [council of the labor  collective] of the leasing sewing association imeni Ala  Bayramov, F. Kafarov. "To transfer money through one bank into  another even within Baku takes many days, which impedes its  circulation," states the deputy general director of the  Azstankoprom Production Association, M. Ismaylov.    There is no transfer of money to pay for raw and processed  materials or batching items, or else this operation takes many  months--the enterprises are doomed to stand idle. Therefore, the  conclusion arises of its own accord: during the stage of  transition to the market the banks are failing to perform one of  their basic functions for prompt transfer of money on  instructions from the clients. Is this not so?    [Akhundov] These are serious accusations, and we must look  into them right now. Let us pose this question: Do the  enterprises have anything to transfer, for example, to the CIS  countries? If they do, there are no obstacles to that. In order  to facilitate the transfer of funds, Prominvestbank is working  actively to create direct ties with commercial banks of the CIS  countries. Among the measures that have been taken is the  opening of correspondent accounts in Moscow, Minsk, Almaty,  Tbilisi, Donetsk, Odessa, Makhachkala, Naberezhnyye Chelny, etc.    Let us return to the fact that very frequently the  enterprises do not have money to send to their partners in the  CIS countries. Let us consider two aspects. The first is that  they do not have this money because it is being accumulated in  enterprises and organizations of nearby foreign countries. Thus  the indebtedness on prepayment for goods and materials from our  clients amounted to R9.7 billion and the debit indebtedness was  R11 billion. Therefore they themselves are left without money.  Either it must be returned or they must receive raw materials,  processed materials, and batching items in order to load their  own production more completely.    The second aspect is that our labor collectives must make it  a point to earn currency of the country with which they have  economic ties. Then there will be no difficulties with  transferring money.    The problem can be approached from a different side. Let us  say that our client has currency from Ukraine but does not have  currency from Turkmenistan. Then the Baku Interbank Currency  Exchange comes to its assistance. It is necessary to submit an  application through the branch of our bank that serves him for  the sale of karbovantsy and the purchase of Turkmen manats. All  the other operations are conducted through the already existing  structure and there is no need to submit an application for  acquiring the currency of any other CIS country, even in cases  when the enterprises have our manats. The same existing  structure continues to operate.    Unfortunately, the Baku Interbank Currency Exchange cannot  operate normally because of the lack of enterprises wanting to  sell the necessary currency. And I already gave the reason for  this above--tardy repayment of debit indebtedness.    The negative aspects must also be mentioned. There are still  quite a few enterprises and organizations whose managers  consciously and deliberately fail to return money for products  that are delivered. At their request the money that is earned is  transferred to commercial structures, not without selfish  purposes, of course.    How do we avoid such large losses? The government is  preparing a document for monitoring exports on the basis of a  form for accounting for prepayment or presentation of letters of  credit. I think that the introduction of the new rules will make  it possible to regulate the receipt of funds in Azerbaijan for  products that are delivered.    [Gamedov] And what about the transfer of money within the  republic?    [Akhundov] The mechanism for this was developed long ago and  very precisely, and it is functioning reliably. We introduced a  special program for daily processing of payment documentation on  the computer. Therefore there are no grounds for the complaints  from certain enterprises, including the Azstankoprom Production  Association.    If when running the program the computer deducts money from  the account of one client, this necessarily must be reflected in  the form of the deposit of this money into the account of  another client. Otherwise the daily balance will not come out  right, and this is the main method for performing banking  activity. Let me emphasize especially that the money is  transferred every day.    There may be a delay, not through the bank's fault but  through the fault of the workers of the enterprises and  organizations themselves, who sometimes make mistakes when  filling out the payment documents.    Prominvestbank has 16 branches in Baku and two in Sumgait.  All the information about the operation of these branches is  received from them by the computers each day, and it is  processed and sent back within 10-15 minutes.    Our branches in Gyandzh, Mingyachevir, and other places will  be hooked up to this computer network in the near future.    [Gamedov] What is the purpose of transforming the former  state bank into a joint-stock commercial bank? How many shares  have been sold?    [Akhundov] The advantages of reorganizing it are apparent.  Previously the bank received money from Moscow in order to  exist. We are now earning it ourselves, we attract funds from  our clients, and we offer credit with interest.    We have sold R200 million worth of shares to individuals. Of  these shares, R150 million are unrestricted, so-called common  stock and R50 million are preferred stock which is sold to  workers of the founders.    For now I cannot say anything about the amounts of the  dividends from them. At the end of the year we will sum up the  results, call a stockholders meeting, consult, and decide.    Prominvestbank also has its depositors. Today there are R400  million in the accounts under extremely favorable conditions: if  a deposit is left for a year it increases by 80 percent, and  more than a year--it doubles. If anybody wants to obtain more  interest on his money we invite them to join our depositors.</p>

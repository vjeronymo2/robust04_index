			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Observer: Chile factor Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, may be one of the cabinet's Eurosceptics. But no one can accuse him of being parochial. Take the latest bee in his bonnet, about how Britain can learn a lot from Chile's private sector pension arrangements. Portillo was in Chile in July and seems to have been mightily impressed by the state's encouragement of private sector pension schemes. Not only have the funds ballooned in value, to more than Dollars 12.6bn, but they have taught the Chilean people to take an interest in privatisation and financial markets. Portillo was especially intrigued by the transparency of the operations - the funds publish the value of their portfolios each day - and the low cost of their operations. However, Chile may not provide all the answers to Portillo's quest to limit the future pension calls on Britain's welfare state. For a start, the funds have yet to start paying out pensions on a significant scale, and Portillo the politician might also have noted that Chile's pension reforms have not done anything for the presidential chances of their ambitious architect - Jose Pinera - currently trailing hopelessly in the opinion polls.</p>

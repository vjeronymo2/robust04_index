			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / US withdraws 'quit smoking' aids AMERICANS indulging in what King James VI of Scotland called the vile and evil habit of smoking tobacco will no longer have the benefit of non-prescription products to help them in their efforts to give up. The US Food and Drug Administration has decided there is no evidence that any of the existing over-the-counter (OTC) products actually work. They are to be withdrawn from December. 'These products are safe enough,' said Mr Mike Shaffer, a public affairs officer at the FDA. 'But there is no evidence that they work. We're not saying they don't work, just that we don't know if they do.' The products, supported by millions of dollars of advertising, include Cigarrest, Bantron, Tabmint and Nikoban. Tabmint, a chewing gum that contains silver acetate and which is supposed to make smoke taste unpleasant, is available in Britain. The withdrawn products do not include Nicorette gum and nicotine patches which, although available without a prescription in the UK, are not available over the counter in the US. The US move led to calls yesterday in the UK for all OTC smoking cessation products to be withdrawn, including patches and nicotine gums. Ms Sandi Wilson, director of Quit, a charity dedicated to helping smokers give up, said there was no evidence that any products worked when bought at a chemist without a prescription. These include Nicobrevin, a product containing quinine, camphor and oil of eucalyptus, and the recently launched and commercially successful nicotine patches. '(Nicotine patches) may help motivation, but there is no evidence they are more effective than a placebo' when used without counselling, she said.</p>

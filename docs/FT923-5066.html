			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Exam standards the main examination taken by 16-year-olds in England and Wales - is damning. Their report has 'little confidence that standards are being maintained' and detects a decline since the GCSE was introduced in 1988. Last week's headlines trumpeted record pass rates with more than ever before at the higher grades. Now pupils, parents and employers are left wondering about the worth of devalued GCSE certificates. Some had already warned that five successive years of improved results seemed too good to be true - especially the rise by more than a quarter in the numbers of grades A to C, which were supposed to be the equivalent of the old O-level pass. The inspectors' report therefore confirms what many teachers privately admit - that standards have slipped with the new exam. Mr Patten, the education secretary, has announced an inquiry, with a view to changes for next year's exams. However, some of the problems identified by the inspectors are already being tackled. Able pupils can now take more demanding papers, following criticisms that the GCSE was insufficiently stretching. The top grade is to be split in two to give further incentives to the most able. And the amount of course work - which is harder to monitor  -is to be restricted. The most important objective for Mr Patten's inquiry must be to ensure that the four examining boards set exacting standards which are uniformly applied between subjects and between different groups of pupils. Only if it is clear just what sort of achievement is represented by a particular grade will employers and others be able to use GCSE results as a worthwhile yardstick. The minister should, however, ignore those who want to restore the O-level exam for the brightest. The GCSE provides a single standard by which the achievements of 90 per cent of pupils can be measured - even if the measurement process needs improvement. Employers certainly do not want to return to O-levels, as this week's statement from the CBI makes clear. Indeed, there is a case for a more broadly-based examination at 18, capable of testing a much higher proportion of school-leavers than the A-level exam. Essential to such a change would be confidence that the top grades of the new exam offered similar levels of achievement to the A-level 'gold standard'. That confidence will be hard to win unless the standards of the top GCSE grades are re-established.</p>

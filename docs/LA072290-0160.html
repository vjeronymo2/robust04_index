			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> DEPOSIT TICKET HOLDS ON IN JUVENILE  </P> <P> Deposit Ticket fought off the challenge of favored Avenue of Flags in the  stretch to score a one-length victory in the $101,500 Hollywood Juvenile  Championship Saturday at Hollywood Park.  </P> <P> Racing to his first stakes victory, the son of Northern Baby took the early  lead in the six furlong race and held it until challenged by Avenue of Flags  midway down the stretch.  </P> <P> But the winner responded to the urging of jockey Gary Stevens to score the  victory in the good time of 1:09.  </P> <P> It was the fourth career start for Deposit Ticket, who scored his first victory  last month with Stevens as his rider. Avenue of Flags raced closest to the  leader, whose stablemate Iroquois Park was among the top three in the early  stages.  </P> <P> Deposit Ticket was coupled with Iroquois Park as the entry of trainer Wayne  Lukas, which was sent off as third choice in the wagering to pay $7.40, $3.20  and $2.40. Avenue of Flags paid $3.40 and $2.40 while Stone God, the third  place finisher, returned $4.20.  </P> <P> Broadway's Top Gun, unbeaten in three previous races, faded to fifth as second  choice in the wagering. The winner earned a purse of $56,600 for the stable of  Lukas and W.T. Young, of Lexington, Ky.  </P> <P> The Juvenile in the past has been won by such outstanding young performers as  Affirmed and Tomy Lee, both Kentucky Derby winners, and numerous other  outstanding performers.  </P> <P> On Sunday, Stalwart Charger, winner of his last three stakes races, seeks his  richest victory in the $200,000 Swap Stakes at one and a quarter miles. Silver  Ending heads the opposition in the field of five, which includes Jovial and  Toby Jug.  </P></p>

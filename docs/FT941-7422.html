			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Malaysia set to halt UK deals: Mahathir angry at press reports about tactics used to win contracts The Malaysian government is planning to deny further contracts to British companies because of its anger at British press reports alleging that bribes have been offered to Malaysian politicians. The contracts freeze, which could cost British companies hundreds of millions of pounds in lost business, was confirmed early today by Mrs Rafidah Aziz, Malaysia's minister of trade and industry. It was due to be announced by Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's deputy prime minister and finance minister, although a press conference set for this morning was postponed until later today. Last night, Mr John Major sent a message to Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, seeking urgent clarification of Malaysia's position. The Foreign Office was also striving to head off the breakdown in trade relations. The sanctions are similar to those imposed under Malaysia's 'Buy British Last' policy in the early 1980s after Britain withdrew subsidies for foreign students. They were lifted in the late-1980s after Lady Thatcher, as premier, worked to rebuild ties with Malaysia. UK companies, led by GEC, plan to issue a statement - in the form of national newspaper advertisements - stressing the importance of Anglo-Malaysian trade. Yesterday they secretly approached Mr Major urging him to telephone Dr Mahathir. Dr Mahathir has been angered by UK press reports of the alleged tactics used by the UK government and UK companies in winning Malaysian contracts. He was incensed by a report in last weekend's Sunday Times alleging that a British company had bribed Malaysian politicians, an adviser said. A banker who knows Dr Mahathir said he had also been bemused by criticism in the UK parliament and press that a contract to sell Pounds 1bn of arms to Malaysia was won because the UK gave Pounds 234m in aid for building the Pergau hydro-electric dam. Mr Dato Kamarudin Abu, Malaysian High Commissioner in London, said his government was 'very unhappy about the constant negative reporting'. Sir Robin Biggam, chairman of BICC, the cable and construction group involved in the Pergau project, said the ban would be 'a very regrettable and unfortunate decision for the UK. It has taken us years to build up our position in Malaysia'. Malaysia is the biggest market for UK companies in the Asia-Pacific region, apart from Hong Kong. Exports to Malaysia, most based on contracts with the Malaysian government, were Pounds 862m in the year to November. Mr Allan Gormly, chief executive of Trafalgar House, whose construction subsidiaries have won tens of millions of pounds of Malaysian business, said: 'This is not only bad for corporate UK but could affect jobs as well.' Malaysia is expected to say that it will honour existing contracts with British companies. But a banker who finances Malaysian trade said a stream of contracts, worth an estimated Pounds 2bn, would now be lost. Yesterday, the British high commissioner in Malaysia, Mr Duncan Slater, was told UK companies would receive no further work on a new Pounds 3.4bn international airport for Kuala Lumpur. An Anglo-Japanese consortium, including Trafalgar House, BICC and GEC, had signed a memorandum for development and project management of the airport. Other leading British companies, such as power groups PowerGen and National Grid, construction group John Laing and electronics conglomerate GEC, have been in negotiations with the Malaysian government.

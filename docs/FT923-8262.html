			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Building societies hold rates despite increase by Skipton LARGE building societies yester-day moved to head off a general increase in mortgage interest rates after Skipton, the 14th largest society, raised its rates for investors and borrowers. Skipton, which has assets of Pounds 2.7bn, triggered fears of a general rise in mortgages when it announced that the rate it charges existing borrowers would rise by 0.5 of a percentage point to 11.25 per cent from today. New customers will be charged 10.99 per cent. Alliance &amp; Leicester and National &amp; Provincial, the two large building societies which were thought most likely to follow Skipton, made it clear that they would not do so, reducing the immediate likelihood of a general rise. Alliance, the fourth largest society, said it did not wish to do anything that might depress the housing market still further and so would be very reluctant to raise its mortgage rate. Mr David O'Brien, chief executive of National &amp; Provincial, the sixth largest, said: 'We believe building societies should continue to encourage confidence in house-buying through attractive mortgages.' The forbearance may be only temporary, according to Mr John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the stockbroker. 'I think because of the pressures on societies, mortgage rates may rise gradually over the remainder of 1992, but they will do so in a ragged fashion as lenders withdraw special offers and discounts,' he said. Instead of raising their mortgage rates immediately, the large societies may cut their rates for savers, after two similar moves earlier this month by National Savings, which trimmed its rates to relieve pressure on the societies. Bradford &amp; Bingley, the seventh largest society, yesterday said it was cutting its rates to savers by 0.45 of a percentage point from August 15. Nationwide, the second largest, made a similar move last week. Mr Geoffrey Lister, Bradford &amp; Bingley's chief executive, said the society had decided to reduce its rates because of the fall in the inflation rate rather than widen its margins by increasing its mortgage rates. These moves will pose difficulties for smaller societies, which are thought to have been especially hard hit recently by savers' reluctance to place their money with building societies. The larger societies, however, may find it difficult to hold down their savings rates for the rest of the year. Several are already close to the ceiling on the amount they are allowed to raise in the wholesale money market. Lex, Page 18</p>

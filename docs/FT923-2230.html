			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: JSDA to study new members JAPAN'S Securities Dealers Association (JSDA) plans to establish a committee to study whether banks and financial institutions engaged in the securities business should join the JSDA, Reuter reports from Tokyo. 'We plan to establish a committee to cope with the possibility that financial institutions will want to join the association,' said Mr Sakae Kudo, chairman. At the moment, only securities houses can join the JSDA. Under the revised Securities and Exchange Act, financial institutions which engage in the securities business on their own account or sell Japanese government bonds over the counter can set up their own regulatory body or join the JSDA. The revised act is expected to take effect in April and the JSDA should work out conditions allowing new members into the association next year, officials said.</p>

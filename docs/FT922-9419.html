			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Lloyds takeover not in public interest, says Bifu - The Battle for Midland A LLOYDS takeover of Midland Bank would lead to monopoly banking in some towns and would not be in the public interest, Bifu, the banking union, will tell MPs today, writes Catherine Milton. The union is trying to increase support for a referral of the bid to the monopoly authorities because it believes 30,000 jobs and 1,100 branches are at risk if it succeeds. In a dossier sent to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, all MPs and British Euro MPs, the union explains why it believes the merger would not be in the public interest. 'Such a merger would be harmful to customers and staff and to the UK economy since it would lead to unemployment and reduce competition. A number of towns currently have only a Lloyds and a Midland branch and there would, in effect, be monopoly banking in those towns. The customer would lose a choice.' The union rejects the argument that the UK has too many bank branches, saying it ranks equal fourth with France among nine leading nations for the number of branches per head of population.</p>

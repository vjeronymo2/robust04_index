			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / UN troops halted by Khmer Rouge KHMER ROUGE guerrillas in Cambodia yesterday detained 46 more United Nations peacekeepers, only hours after releasing an earlier batch of 21, in their latest act of defiance against the UN's Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) mission to bring peace and democracy to the country, writes Victor Mallet in Bangkok. All 46 are armed Indonesian soldiers who were told by the Khmer Rouge not to leave the village of Phum O Sala, 10km east of the central town of Kompong Thom. They had gone there to discuss the seizure of the 21. Last night the Indonesians were in a stand-off with about 70 armed Khmer Rouge guerrillas. UN soldiers may fire only in self-defence, and so far none of the 16,000 UN military personnel in Cambodia has fired a shot in anger.</p>

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Corporate Sweden warns over public debt Sweden's manufacturers warned yesterday that the precarious state of the country's public finances was undermining industrial confidence and appealed to the country's politicians fighting next month's general election to tackle the issue urgently. 'The big state debt and the record budget deficit are deeply worrying and must be tackled with credible, long-term policies,' the Federation of Swedish Industries said in a pre-election list of demands circulated to all political parties. 'Proposals early in the election campaign and certainly after the election on how the political parties propose to solve our severe problem in the state finances can reduce uncertainty and contribute to higher confidence in the future,' the federation said. The election campaign has so far been dominated by a debate over how to control the budget deficit. At 13 per cent of gross national product in the last budget year, it is one of the highest in Europe and has inflated state debt to almost 100 per cent of GNP. The centre-right parties in Prime Minister Carl Bildt's coalition government emphasise cuts in Sweden's bloated public spending programme, while the opposition Social Democrats, clear favourites to win on September 18, propose a selection of tax increases. But both sides have so far avoided giving detailed plans. The industry federation, which represents 6,000 manufacturing companies, also called on the leading parties, which support Swedish membership of the European Union, to work together to ensure a hesitant electorate votes to join in a referendum due in November. 'No other issue, besides solving the state's financial crisis, is more important for Sweden's next government,' it said. Although Sweden's dominant exporting and internationally based companies are reporting resurgent profits after three years of recession, manufacturers remain concerned by weak domestic demand, high interest rates and low investment rates. The federation said industry's capital needs would total SKr600bn (Pounds 50bn) over the rest of the decade, requiring investment to grow by 20 per cent a year. It warned against raising corporate, capital, energy and environmental taxes  -a caution aimed mainly at the Social Democrats - and called for a breakdown of Sweden's system of low wage differentials.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher telephoned Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa  early Friday morning [17 Jun] to inform him in advance of U.S.  plans to issue an announcement on the North Korean nuclear  situation, Kakizawa said.    Christopher called at around 5 A.M. [2000 GMT] to report in  advance the contents of U.S. President Bill Clinton's  announcement giving a tentative go-ahead to the reopening of  diplomatic talks with North Korea, Kakizawa said at a press  conference.    Kakizawa said he told Christopher Japan welcomes Washington  seeking dialogue with Pyongyang and hopes North Korea will  respond to the U.S. offer and accept and carry out international  inspections of nuclear facilities.    Japan also hopes North Korea would offer a "sincere" reply  to  the call from the United States on Friday when former U.S.  President Jimmy Carter meets North Korean Leader Kim Il-song  again because this is an important turning point toward  sanctions, Kakizawa said.    Clinton announced U.S. willingness to open the third round  of  negotiations with Pyongyang at a press conference Thursday,  saying there was "promising development" in Carter's personal  mission in Pyongyang.    Carter, speaking on the CNN cable network from Pyongyang  after a meeting Thursday with Kim, said he has received a  personal commitment from the North Korean leader that  international inspectors will be allowed to continue monitoring  a controversial nuclear reactor in Yongbyon north of the North  Korean capital.    Kakizawa quoted Christopher as saying the U.S. can not yet  determine whether North Korea's latest overtures were "sincere"  or a strategy to procrastinate moves toward imposing sanctions  on Pyongyang.    Christopher was quoted as saying that negotiations at the  United Nations on the proposed sanctions will continue.    Kakizawa said he telephoned Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  after  the 30-minute call with Christopher.</p>

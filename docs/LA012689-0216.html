			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> COMIC PINKY LEE HAS HEART ATTACK  </P> <P> Pinky Lee, the baggy-pants vaudeville comic who starred in a children's TV show  in the 1950s, was listed in serious condition today after suffering a heart  attack backstage during a musical.  </P> <P> Lee was resting comfortably and is expected to remain hospitalized for up to 14  days, a St. Francis Medical Center spokeswoman said. Lee was stricken during a  performance of "Sugar Babies" at the Peoria Civic Center Theater. The former  burlesque comic, born Pincus Leff, starred in "The Pinky Lee Show" on NBC in  1950 and 1954-56.  </P> <P> Wearing a rolled-brim hat and a loud checkered coat, he danced, told stories  and introduced himself by singing, "Hello, it's me. My name is Pinky Lee."  Comeback attempts in the late 1950s and mid-'60s were unsuccessful.  </P></p>

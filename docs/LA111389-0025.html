			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'MAGNOLIAS' COMES UP ROSES FOR RIGHT CHARITY  </P> <P> There is rarely a direct connection between the film and the charity cause at  benefit premieres. Usually the beneficiary of the event is just the studio  executive's favorite charity. So occasionally the film's stars pull an end run  around the gala dinner, heading directly for their stretch limousines after the  screening. Tsk, tsk, tsk.  </P> <P> But the charity was right at home on Thursday night for the benefit premiere of  Tri-Star Pictures' "Steel Magnolias" at the Cineplex Odeon in Century City. The  film and the cause were so intimately related that the sold-out 1,400 guest  crowd missed not a moment of the film nor a second of the gala supper that  followed at the Los Angeles Ballroom in the Century Plaza Hotel, including  every one of the film's stars -- Sally Field, Dolly Parton, Shirley MacLaine,  Daryl Hannah, Olympia Dukakis and Tom Skerritt.  </P> <P> The story of "Steel Magnolias" revolves around a diabetic played by Julia  Roberts. In theater No. 2 (extra screens had to be added for the huge turnout),  the guests of the American Diabetes Assn. watched with nary a dry eye in the  house. Some of them sighed during the film, quietly noting how similar this  film is to their own lives.  </P> <P> As guests streamed out of the theaters for the gala across the street at the  Century Plaza, handkerchiefs attended the eyes and press agents attended the  stars. There was a great deal of chatter about probable Academy Award  nominations. Even studio heads for whom this picture represents competition  were sanguine.  </P> <P> Frank Wells, president and CEO of Walt Disney Pictures, who was also honorary  chairman of the benefit, remarked that "it's a wonderful film, truly  wonderful." That dashing duo, Jon Peters and Peter Guber, the once and future  kings of Columbia Pictures, said "great . . . great . . . great . . . yeah,  great" as they dashed over to the supper. Tri-Star President Jeff Sagansky was  all smiles. And Ray "I Really Don't Talk to the Press" Stark, whose company,  Rastar, produced the film, received congratulations from the crowd around him.  </P> <P> The stars of the picture moved around en mass. All the female stars entered and  left the screening arm in arm.  </P> <P> Sally Field, in a skinny, skinny black velvet Norma Kamali, noted that she felt  "like I had died and gone to heaven," working with this remarkable ensemble of  talent: "It was an unbelievable experience -- really joyous and lots of  laughter."  </P> <P> Director Herbert Ross, in charge of containing all the laughter, stated  categorically "that it was one of the most spectacular groups I've ever worked  with." Julia Roberts sensed that a nearly telepathic communication developed  between the cast members: "When one person was in trouble, suddenly the others  were right there, personally and professionally." Shirley MacLaine added, "We  were instant friends. Instant." But Tom Skerritt, the only male lead, had some  trouble. "I had a love affair with six women," he said, referring to the six  female stars, "and that's not easy."  </P> <P> The dinner was a quiet, personal affair where many of the film's principals  related the movie to their lives. Playwright/screenwriter Robert Harling noted  that this film was a memorial to his sister. Tom Skerritt talked about his  diabetic brother and his mother who died of diabetic complications. Dolly  Parton's grandmother also died from complications of diabetes. "I kept her on a  strict diet," Parton said. "It was hard. But then, it's hard to see suffering  of any kind. We do what we can."  </P> <P> The evening raised more than $500,000 for the American Diabetes Assn. ADA  Premiere Committee chair Brigitte Medvin was thrilled, but not surprised, at  the turnout. "We have had very successful premieres over the last 15 years,"  Medvin said. "The hard-working committees of the ADA have raised more than $4  million since we first premiered 'Towering Inferno.' "  </P> <P> The proceeds have been applied exclusively to diabetes research. According to  Tri-Star vice president Richard Fischoff, the three benefit premieres of "Steel  Magnolias" -- Los Angeles, New York and Atlanta -- have raised more than $1  million.  </P> <P> Also present were Chevy Chase, Doug Cramer, William Morris agent Ames Cushing,  Lee Radziwill, Vanity Fair magazine's Wendy Stark, Columbia Pictures President  Dawn Steel, Music Center mavens Lenore and Bernard Greenberg, Tony Thomopoulos  and Cristina Ferrare, Marcia Weisman, Fred and Joan Nicholas, and Kiefer  Sutherland.  </P></p>

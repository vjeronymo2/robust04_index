			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Peasants Will Be Satisfied. </F> Grain Procurement Prices Raised"]    [Text] In order to increase the material incentive for  producers to increase volumes of grain sales to the state and in  order to save on the expenditure of hard currency funds on the  acquisition of grain from abroad, and also taking into account  the higher costs of material and technical resources and energy  sources used on the farms, the growth of inflation, and the  higher prices on the world market, the Azerbaijan Cabinet of  Ministers considered it expedient to adopt the proposals of the  Ministry of Agriculture, the State Grain Products Company, and  the Ministry of Economics to raise prices of grain from internal  reserves.    As an AZERTADZH correspondent was told in the Ministry of  Agriculture, the average selling price of one tonne of grain  from the 1994 crop sold to the state is 50,000 manats, a  sevenfold increase over last year's prices. Taking into account  the fact that priority in raising procurement prices has been  given to hard and strong strains of wheat, the following prices  have been set: for one tonne of hard wheat meeting requirements  of class I--65,000 manats, of class II--62,000 manats, and of  class III--55,000 manats; for strong and soft strains,  regardless of class--48,000-53,000 manats; for one tonne of  barley--46,000 manats, of corn--50,000 manats, and of peas for  human consumption--94,000 manats.    The ministry has prepared additional recommendations in  order  to increase the material incentive for machine operators and  other workers to harvest the grain at optimal times and without  losses. It is stipulated that each combine operator  participating in the harvest may be issued as wages 50 manats  and 10 kilograms of grain, and their assistants, 35 manats and 7  kilograms of grain for each tonne harvested; truck drivers are  to be issued, in addition to their wages, one kilogram of grain  for each tonne that is transported. Additionally, combine  operators are to be paid bonuses in the amount of 1,500-2,500  manats, depending on the volume of grain reaped during the  season.    Ministry of Agriculture workers think that raising grain  procurement prices will have a positive effect on strengthening  the economies of the farms, will increase the material incentive  for workers, and will make it possible to achieve an increase in  the volumes of grain sold to the state.</p>

			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN;  </P> <P> MEETING CALLED ON DISPUTED BUILDING  </P> <P> The City Council asked the developer of an almost-finished apartment building  to meet Thursday with city staff members and residents angry about the project.  </P> <P> Construction on the 11-unit apartment project came to a halt about four months  ago after a battle erupted among the neighbors, the city and the developer.  </P> <P> Mayor Richard B. Edgar said he hopes a meeting will help all parties avoid a  costly legal battle.  </P> <P> Residents who live near the 2 1/2-story apartments say the project overshadows  their homes, destroys their privacy and reduces their property values.  </P> <P> Developer Feridoun Rezai obtained a permit for the apartments last year, but  neighbors who live on Myrtle and Corla avenues next to the project did not  complain until the apartments began to take shape.  </P> <P> After investigating, the city staff learned that 17 property owners never  received notices of the public hearing at which the permit was discussed. The  law requires that all property owners within 300 feet of the project receive  notices.  </P> <P> The Planning Commission on April 30 denied a permit for the project, requiring  that Rezai either modify the building or demolish it. He appealed the decision.  </P> <P> Rezai's attorney, Joel Ward, said he estimates his client is losing about  $1,000 each day while the project sits uncompleted. SHANNON SANDS  </P></p>

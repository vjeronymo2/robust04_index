			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Peru army teams up with locals to beat guerrillas: A campaign that reaches deep into the jungle WE ARE at war, reads the not-so-welcoming sign over the sand-bagged hut at the edge of Puerto Bermudez's dirt-red airstrip. 'It is everybody's war and united we shall overcome.' Here, in Peru's central jungle, unity means alliance between the Pichis valley's largely native Indian population, the Ashaninkas, and the Peruvian army. When their chief was captured and subsequently executed by the MRTA (Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement) in late 1989, Ashaninkas rose up against the guerrillas, taking bloody reprisals against any natives or settlers believed to be collaborators. Now the Ashaninkas, like civilians all over Peru, are being forced to make definitive choices in the counter-subversion war. Throughout the country's extensive 'emergency zones', the army is recruiting ordinary Peruvians for 'rondas' or civil defence patrols which serve as a supplementary army under direct military command. Those who refuse are inevitably suspected of subversive sympathies. The Fujimori government is finding itself obliged to compensate in manpower for its desperately inadequate counter-subversive equipment and munitions. A long-critical situation has been exacerbated by swingeing post-coup cuts in US financial assistance to Peruvian anti-narcotics police and military operations. In the central jungle, where one aged Russian M-17 helicopter serves as the sole troop support, the warlike Ashaninkas look to be the answer to the under-funded military's prayer. The Pichis valley standing army now comprises 500 professional Ashaninka soldiers plus 5,000 more trained reservists. Nine control posts along the 50 miles of semi-tropical valley exert rigorous documents checks and vehicle searches. Ashaninka 'vigilantes' wear T-shirts declaring 'anti-subversive commando' and work alongside the small official military detachment. Apart from some three dozen relatively modern firearms, however, most of these Ashaninka soldiers are armed only with their traditional hunting weapons, bow and arrow. With these, they are deadly accurate at up to 30 yards - and army commanders in the zone say arrows are superior for short-range combat in scrub undergrowth to the light automatic FALs or Kalashnikovs favoured by the guerrillas. But the implacable logic of employing a basically civilian population to combat well-armed guerrillas recently took three Ashaninka leaders on a first-ever visit to the capital to plead with armed forces' chiefs for more sophisticated weaponry. 'We've proved our effectiveness against terrorists,' says Ashaninka defence secretary 'Oscar', 'but now we need modern guns like they have.' Peru's Ashaninka population totals maybe 100,000 - estimates are, even by Peruvian standards, unreliable. At least a quarter of these live in the Pichis. They existed until three years ago as self-sufficient farmers, the women cultivating cassava and maize and spinning locally-grown cotton into rough but serviceable cloth while their menfolk hunted and fished. Even though Peru's two main guerrilla groups, Sendero Luminoso and MRTA, have suffered recent heavy blows, the Ashaninkas remain a target. The pro-Cuban MRTA's recent strategy has focused on peacemaking. Conciliatory bands stop vehicles on the road to Puerto Bermudez to give 'consciousness-raising' chats. The guerrillas' criticism of government economic policy and advocacy of investment in local agro-industry is generally well-received. For Sendero Luminoso, the Ashaninkas have provided a valuable fighting resource. In the past few years, Sendero columns have been entering native communities in the central jungle demanding 'quotas' of youngsters as recruits - refusal is punishable by death and, though fewer in number since the capture of guerrilla leader Abimael Guzman, massacres still occur. Some Ashaninkas are lured to join the guerrillas by promises of good pay or guns - which rarely materialise. Their captors employ them as cannon-fodder, and they fight with bow and arrow alone. Ashaninkas wives and children, often press-ganged with their men, become the guerrillas' slaves, obliged to forage and cook. Joint operations in the central jungle involving Ashaninkas and government counter-subversive troops are now commonplace. And the ensuing battles often pit Ashaninkas against members of their own tribe. One special ops major estimates that half the Sendero subversives his patrols encounter are Ashaninkas. The subversives make full use of their native collaborators' jungle lore, he says - the area is pitted with man-traps, deep holes covered with leaves and grass to conceal sharpened hardwood stakes smeared with excrement. Wounds, if not fatal, quickly fester and many patrols must return to base, mission unaccomplished, to seek medical help for unwary victims. Now the Pichis valley looks set to gain further unwanted significance in the internal Peruvian drugs-and-terrorism cycle. Coca growers are being squeezed out of the Huallaga valley by escalating violence, stepped-up government action against the illegal cocaine trade (the Peruvian air force has finally taken control over nine provincial airports in the zone) and the mystery fungus which has decimated crops around the traditional coca-trading heartland of Uchiza. Hundreds are already bringing their knowledge and coca-processing skills to the northern end of the Pichis valley. If the Pichis, abandoned like so many other areas of Peru by a bankrupt state, becomes a new cocaine-processing centre, then the Ashaninkas face the unhappy prospect of continuing to serve as pawns in a power struggle which has little relevance to their lives.</p>

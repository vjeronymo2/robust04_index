			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 22 (CTK) -- Julius Binder,  director of the construction company which built the  controversial Gabcikovo dam on the Danube, told Slovak Radio  today he did not rule out that the accidents at the gates of  Gabcikovo's two locks were the result of sabotage.    A part of the left lock's bottom gate was torn on Sunday [20  March] night due to a so far unknown reason. The resultant wave  under the dam damaged mechanisms on the bottom gate of the right  lock, which has been blocked by the wrecked Ukrainian boat  Zernograd. International ship transport in this section of the  Danube has been interrupted. It is expected to be resumed by  the end of the week.    "The commission in charge of finding the cause of the damage  has not yet disclosed its conclusions. Accident is  inconceivable, and intentional damage cannot be ruled out,"  Binder said. "Everyday efforts to block the success of the dam  are evident," he added.    He pointed out that the locks' gates have been operating for  a year, and before the wreckage of Zernograd on February 11 they  were to undergo modification to eliminate problems. Binder  stressed that any defect in the gates was unlikely.    Binder said that neither the accidents nor the spring thaw  posed a threat to the residents of the surrounding area. There  is a reserve to divert surplus water, he explained.    "It is strange that since the beginning the left lock and  the  Gabcikovo dam as a whole have been accompanied by many hazards,"  Binder said. He referred to the theft of electronic regulating  devices at the left lock, the tearing off of control cameras by  a lorry, irresponsibility of the crew of Zernograd and the slow  pace of its removal, and the unnatural substances found in wells  destined for the examination of underground water. "Enemies of  the dam exist here and are working intensively," Binder  emphasizes.    He said that the repair of the locks will not cost much,  only  millions, not tens of millions of crowns. "However, the problem  lies in the moral damage, in negativistic tendencies which will  emerge throughout the world," he pointed out.</p>

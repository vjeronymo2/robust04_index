			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHINESE GATHER TO FORM OPPOSITION IN EXILE  </P> <P> Refugees who fled the violent suppression of China's pro-democracy movement  joined fellow Chinese from around the world Friday to establish a new  opposition in exile aimed at continuing the battle begun on Tian An Men Square.  </P> <P> The three-day meeting of the Federation for Democracy in China, held at the  Sorbonne, opened with a moment of silence to honor those killed June 3-4 when  soldiers marched into Beijing to crush the student-led movement. Hundreds, and  perhaps thousands, died.  </P> <P> "Bringing democracy to China requires that we battle together, shoulder to  shoulder," said Wuer Kaixi, the 21-year-old Beijing University student who  delivered compelling speeches in Beijing's Tian An Men Square at the height of  the spring protests.  </P> <P> Among those in the crowd of about 500 were photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson,  actor Yves Montand, political leaders and human rights activists from  throughout Europe and four members of Poland's once-banned Solidarity movement.  </P> <P> "We Poles know the cost of freedom, human rights. Fighting for these things  takes a long time," Solidarity member Zbigniew Chlap told the crowd.  </P> <P> Delegates to the meeting were divided into four regional groups -- China,  Europe, Asia and North America.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> VAN DE KAMP ASKS PILL'S TESTING  </P> <P> Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, campaigning for the Democratic gubernatorial  nomination, today proposed that California health officials move to approve  testing of the so-called abortion pill used in Western Europe.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp said that California authorities, by approving testing, could  pressure federal authorities to make the drug available.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp, who according to polls is trailing former San Francisco Mayor  Dianne Feinstein in the Democratic governor's race, said that women have the  right to choose whether they want to use the French drug RU-486.  </P> <P> "I realize full well that this will be a controversial proposal. I have to say  there is nothing more personal, more private than the decision a woman takes to  give birth to a child," Van de Kamp said in Los Angeles.  </P></p>

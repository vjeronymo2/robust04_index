			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FAULTY SPRINKLERS MAY RAIN ON NEW CONVENTION CENTER'S OPENING PARADE  </P> <P> A San Diego Fire Department inspection of the San Diego Convention Center has  found a faulty sprinkler system, which could delay the center's Nov. 1 opening  until repairs are completed, convention center and fire officials said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Sprinkler heads on the meeting-room level and in the main ballroom are  obstructed by hanging lights, said Fire Marshal Jim Sewell. In the event of a  fire, water from the sprinklers in certain areas would be blocked by the  lights, Sewell said.  </P> <P> Dan Wilkens, a spokesman for the San Diego Unified Port District, said it is  not known whether the center will be finished on time. He said that, although  the Port District is concerned, it has no reason to believe that Fire  Department officials and general contractor Tutor-Saliba-Perini will not be  able to work things out. "I think we're always concerned about unforeseen  problems that come out. We'll just have to wait and see."  </P> <P> The problem must be corrected before the building can be occupied. Fire  officials are meeting with Tutor-Saliba-Perini representatives to discuss  alternatives, Sewell said. The inspection was made about two weeks ago.  </P> <P> "The lights were not in the original plans we had originally approved," Sewell  said, adding that the sprinkler heads would have to be moved.  </P> <P> Wilkens said the Port District had not received an estimate from  Tutor-Saliba-Perini on how much the repairs would cost, and he didn't know who  would pay. Bill Pence, a vice president with the contracting company, said the  alterations would cost $200,000 to $400,000.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, union laborers held a one-day sickout in protest of the hiring of  non-union workers by Tutor-Saliba-Perini to install flooring, Pence said. The  sickout was not expected to affect the center's completion deadline, and union  laborers are expected to return to work today, an insider said.  </P></p>

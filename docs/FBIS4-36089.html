			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 3 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- The  Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) meeting in Cairo has unanimously  adopted Malaysia's proposal that an international conference be  held on Bosnia-Herzegovina, Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad  Badawi said Friday [3 June].    This is the first time that a large organisation like NAM  has  formally adopted our proposal to promote and initiate the  hosting of the international conference, he said in a telephone  interview from here.    With the agreement, it means that NAM, which has 108  members,  is prepared to make efforts to hold the conference which has all  along been only proposed by several other parties.    Abdullah is happy with the support given to Malaysia by  heads  of delegation when the proposal was discussed on Wednesday.    He said that the contact group of the Islamic Conference  Organisation (IOC) had also expressed support for Malaysia's  proposal that NAM initiate the hosting of the international  conference.    The agreement was reached at the group's informal meeting  where the Bosnian delegates gave a briefing on the latest  situation in their country.    The group had also discussed matters to be included in the  NAM's final document on Bosnia-Herzegovina, he said.</p>

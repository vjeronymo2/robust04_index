			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / The FT Christmas Show Guide: A steadfast ritual Christmas concerts vary little in substance from year to year. If they did, they would scarcely qualify as Christmassy. Carols, Messiah, The Nutcracker and a small range of cantatas and orchestra bonbons such as Leroy Anderson's Sleigh Ride or Prokofiev's Troika from Lieutenant Kije are mandatory. A small amount of variation and innovation is possible, but generally a Christmas concert is as steadfast a ritual as a football match. Each of the half dozen main London concert halls is rising to the seasonal spirit and doubtless relishing the prospect of family sales. The Barbican Centre - self-styled as 'London's Christmas Venue' - has developed a tradition even though it is only 12 years old. The Barbican Hall will be resounding with such festive numbers as Puccini's Christmas Eve love duet from La Boheme and Leopold Mozart's Toy Symphony, played by the London Concert Orchestra under David Arnold on December 10; and Britten's Ceremony of Carols, Hugh Wood's Fanfare for Christmas, and Stravinsky's Circus Polka is performed there by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra under John Scott on December 16. There are two Messiahs - one to be given by the National Westminster Choir and the Rosebery Orchestra under Ian Humphris, on December 12 and an account by the City of London Sinfonia orchestra and singers conducted by Richard Hickox with excellent soloists in Nancy Argenta, Michael Chance, Martyn Hill and Stephen Roberts the following night. The night after that, Handel lovers who missed these renditions can enjoy selections from the oratorio performed by those Christmas veterans, the Choir of King's College, Cambridge, with the English Chamber under Stephen Cleobury (Haydn's St Nicolas Mass and a Vivaldi concerto for two trumpets also included). Also in Barbican Hall there is the LSO Christmas Festival running on the evenings of December 17, 18 and 19, in which Richard Hickox conducts the London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus in standard seasonal items including carols with audience participation. The King's consort and Choir of New College Oxford join to perform Christmas things by Handel and Corelli on December 22. Howard Blake's children's favourite, The Snowman, is being given by the Wren Orchestra under the composer with narrator Robert Hardy and treble Connor Burrowes on the afternoon of December 28. The South Bank Centre offers much of the same sort of fare. David Arnold directs the London Concert Orchestra on December 16 in the Festival Hall), assisted by Patrick Harrild as soloist in Kleinsinger's Tubby the Tuba, and compere Johnny Morris. Kids themselves - in the form of the two divisions of the National Children's Orchestra - perform on Sunday afternoon and evening in the Queen Elizabeth Hall with quite ambitious programmes: the first beginning festively with Gordon Jacob's A Noyse of Minstrells, and the second ending with Stravinsky's Firebird suite. Running in the Queen Elizabeth Hall for a week just after Christmas is Rossini's opera, Cinderella. Music Theatre London's irreverent version is said to be a fine entertainment. Soprano-animateur Jane Manning and her Minstrels, with the aid of the Park Lane Group, are mounting a lively-looking production of The Snow Queen involving children alongside professional singers and instrumentalists at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on December 21. Not to be missed there on the following evening is the Tallis Scholar's programme of seasonal but masterly music by Palestrina, Lassus, Victoria and others. Simultaneous with this a Christmas Jazz Gala in the Purcell Room featuring vibes player Orphy Robinson, pianist Jason Rebello and other prominent figures. The Wigmore Hall is mustering some distinguished singers and players - among them baritone Thomas Allen and Young Musician of the Year, cellist Natalie Clein - for the seasonal miscellany of The Wigmore Christmas Cracker on December 17; while virtually every night in December at St John's, Smith Square is devoted to festivity, with Messiahs conducted by John Lubbock on December 15 and 16. Most notable is the Magenta Music agency's week long International Christmas Festival, which besides two more Messiahs on December 21 and 23 offers carols from Copenhagen on December 22. Christopher Bowers-Broadbent's recital of organ music by Charles Tournemire on December 21 and a rich programme, 'Gloria in Exclesis', of 15th, 16th and 20th century polyphonic vocal music will be given by the The Sixteen, conducted by Harry Christophers, also responsible for the second of those Messiahs. Handel's setting of the Amen alone will account for hours and hours of musical time over the coming weeks.</p>

			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Pressure rises on training budgets CORPORATE training budgets are under increasing pressure because of the recession, according to a survey published today by the Industrial Society. Compared with a survey carried out by the society last September, the latest survey of 486 companies shows that fewer companies expect training budgets to rise over the next six months. The proportion is 32 per cent compared with September's 38 per cent. The society, an independent organisation which aims to foster improved industrial relations, also notes a rise from 13 per cent to 24 per cent in companies which expect budgets to decline. The survey will contribute to the political debate over whether companies should be forced to spend a fixed percentage of their payroll on training employees. The Labour party would introduce measures to ensure that each company sets aside at least 0.5 per cent of pay. The Conservatives want to encourage further spending, but would leave employers to decide the amount. Deep cuts in training budgets in the last recession are widely viewed as one of the most important contributors towards skill shortages in the late 1980s. In another survey published today, the Wyatt company of consultants and actuaries finds that a quarter of employees do not believe training in their organisations adequate for the job. More than half thought their organisation was ineffective in developing people. In spite of the expected squeeze on future budgets, the Industrial Society survey found that spending so far in the recession has held up well compared with the economic downturn of the early 1980s. It found that 40 per cent of companies spent more on training in the final six months of last year than in the same period of 1990. In explaining expected cuts in training budgets, 69 per cent cited competitive pressure on costs, 55 per cent blamed shrinking staff numbers and 41 per cent cited lower sales.

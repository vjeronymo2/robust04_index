			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: FOUNTAIN VALLEY;  </P> <P> CLERK GETS SIGNATURES ON VOSS' RECALL EFFORT  </P> <P> More than 7,000 signatures have been filed with the city clerk in a bid to  recall Councilman Fred Voss because of his conviction last year on sex  solicitation, authorities said.  </P> <P> City Clerk J.E. deSevren Jacquet said that after her office inspected the  petitions Thursday, she sent them to the Orange County registrar of voters  office for a thorough review to determine whether the signatures are valid.  </P> <P> The county has 30 days to check the signatures, she said. If elections workers  finish the job by Aug. 11, the recall issue can be added to the joint  consolidated election ballot in November. Otherwise, she said, the matter may  be decided in a special election in December.  </P> <P> A group of Fountain Valley residents launched the recall drive against Voss,  52, last March on grounds that his conviction this year for trying to solicit  sex from a Santa Ana policewoman posing as a prostitute makes him unworthy to  hold public office. Voss stepped down as mayor but has continued to serve as a  councilman. Laurann Cook is acting mayor.  </P> <P> Beverly Burnett, a leader of the drive, said 77 volunteers worked for weeks to  obtain the needed signatures. "We were very gratified to finish it up and turn  it in," she said. "It's just absolutely overwhelming."  </P> <P> DeSevren Jacquet said recall backers submitted 7,028 signatures, which exceeds  the 6,154 required to qualify a ballot item, based on 20% of the registered  voters in the city.  </P></p>

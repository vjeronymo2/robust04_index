			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / International Company News: Newbridge Networks turns in record profits NEWBRIDGE NETWORKS, an Ottawa-based data system equipment maker, posted record sales and profit for the year ended April 30. It attributed the rise mainly to large orders from international telephone companies. Sales jumped 70 per cent to CDollars 307m (USDollars 241.7m), while profit advanced to CDollars 60m, or CDollars 1.63 a share, well ahead of the CDollars 9.7m, or 28 cents a share, reported a year earlier. Fourth-quarter profit rose to CDollars 25.5m, or 65 cents, compared with CDollars 4.7m, or 13 cents, a year earlier, on revenue of CDollars 100m, against CDollars 52m. Eight-year-old Newbridge, founded by chairman Terry Matthews to specialise in multiplexers for data and computer networks, said its order book had risen steadily over eight consecutive quarters. Newbridge shares recently hit a new high of CDollars 90.75, up from a 52-week low of CDollars 17 7/8 . Laurentian Bank of Canada, the fastest-growing unit in the Laurentian financial services group, saw higher provisions reduce second-quarter net profit, to CDollars 8.3m, or 38 cents a share, from CDollars 9m, or 47 cents, a year earlier. An acquisition pushed assets up 17 per cent to CDollars 9.7bn since October 31 1992. The Montreal-based bank is still seeking to expand its 237-branch network in Quebec and Ontario. Univar, Canada's second biggest food distributor, says first-quarter sales rose 3.6 per cent to CDollars 1.4bn, mainly because of a 1992 acquisition in Quebec. Margins, however, continued to be tight and net profit slipped to CDollars 3.5m, or 2 cents a share, against CDollars 4.9m, or 5 cents, a year earlier.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] A Syrian appeal to Iran was the factor that  stopped the Hizballah Katyusha volleys last weekend, diplomatic  sources in Damascus said. The Syrians intervened after  receiving an Israeli message via the United States. [passage  omitted]    [A report on Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1 Network  in  Hebrew at 1700 GMT on 5 June adds: "The prime minister says the  calm on Israel's northern border and the absence of Katyusha  rockets had been achieved even before the Americans approached  Syria with a demand to curb Hizballah. Our political  correspondent Gadi Sukenik reports that the prime minister made  these remarks at today's cabinet meeting."]</p>

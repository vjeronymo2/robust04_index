			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Fanatical Brit eyes hat-trick - Rowing ROWING is said by physiologists to be the most demanding of sports. It makes demands on heart, lungs and muscles that are at the limits of human physical capacity. A member of the House of Lords once described it as something that 'the French reserved for convicts and the Romans for their slaves.' These factors make the 1992 record of Steve Redgrave, Olympic gold medallist in 1984 and 1988, quite remarkable. Redgrave and his partner, Mathew Pinsent, were achieving world standards even if they were not winning regattas. Then, last month, a team doctor suggested Redgrave have a check-up following weight loss during a winter illness. Specialists diagnosed colitis, sparked by salmonella contracted while training in South Africa. Redgrave was enormously relieved, having nursed secret fears about his own health for some months. But it was as an athlete that he reacted most strongly. 'We're right up with the fastest crews at way below 100 per cent fitness. Just think what we'll be able to do at Barcelona when I'm fit,' he said as he headed off for treatment with diet and drugs. At the Olympic rowing course in Banyoles, 130km from Barcelona, Redgrave will be attempting to win his third consecutive gold medal, a feat achieved only five times before in the sport. One of those greats was 'Diamond John' Kelly, father of the late Princess Grace of Monaco. Pinsent, 21, will be at his first Olympics, having not even taken up rowing when Redgrave won his first medal at Los Angeles. Those who attach importance to the well-preserved ruins of the English class system might be amused by the Redgrave-Pinsent partnership in the coxless pairs. Redgrave, son of a builder, left comprehensive school at 16 to pursue full-time sport. Pinsent, son of a Hampshire clergyman, won a double Blue at Oxford after an outstanding school career at Eton. He has twice rowed in winning Boat Race crews. This combination was unbeaten in the 1991 season. They twice defeated the previous world champions, from Germany, and won at Lucerne by a nine-second margin. At the world championships in Vienna, Redgrave-Pinsent stormed home to a further gold medal. Pinsent, who rows stroke, lists his recreations as 'golf and testing Steve on time zones and gold medal-winners.' The latter is a good-humoured dig at the degree of Redgrave's obsessiveness. Before the Tasmanian championships in 1990, the pair had been training in Canada. Hoping to avoid the body-clock problems of too many time changes, Redgrave decreed that they would row their Henley training sessions at night. Keeping up with Redgrave, physically and emotionally, is undoubtedly a problem for his partners. He denies being obsessive about rowing, but relatively few other people in a still-amateur sport train seven days a week for 49 weeks of the year. Andy Holmes, with whom he won gold in 1988, chose not to face four more years. Interim partner Simon Berrisford was sidelined by injury in 1990. It was that accident that led team managers to insert the available Pinsent into the empty seat. Coincidentally, the arrival of new coach Jurgen Grobler from the former East Germany also helped to re-energise Redgrave, who had been dabbling the previous winter with bobsleighing and stood on the verge of the national team. Grobler's biggest single contribution in the early days was to suggest that Pinsent rowed stroke. It was an audacious move, considering Redgrave's seniority in the team. But it worked, and Redgrave-Pinsent regained the gold medal at the following year's world championship. Redgrave really is a man for all oars. He won his first Olympic gold in the coxed four. But he regards his most satisfying achievement as the Commonwealth gold in the single sculls at the 1986 games. Only because he was achieving such success in the pairs did Redgrave fail to pursue his lonely excellence. It is an open secret inside sport that the administration of British rowing has been a dog's breakfast for the past decade. One of the few sports at which the country excels on the world stage has been virtually unable to find major sponsors; and atheletes such as Redgrave, without question the world's finest individual rower, earn a frugal living as sports consultants. Had Redgrave turned his commitment and physical skills to tennis, he could even now be ranked, say, 115th in the world and earning more than Dollars 100,000 a year for playing in a dozen tournaments. Tough life for the wet bobs.</p>

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: When Progress has its price GRE UNIT Managers, part of Guardian Royal Exchange, is launching a combined building society/unit trust product called Progress. But although the guaranteed income level of 7.5 per cent might look attractive, there are one or two wrinkles that investors should look out for. Forty per cent of the investment will be placed in a Nationwide building society account and the remainder in GRE's Guardhill unit trust, which invests in UK equities. But on top of the initial and annual charges on the unit trust element, GRE is making further charges on the building society portion. An initial charge of 2.4 per cent is being made on the entire investment; so if you invest the minimum of Pounds 10,000, that would eat up Pounds 240. In addition, GRE is charging 0.75 per cent a year plus VAT (deducted monthly) to manage the building society element (the annual charge on the unit trust is 1.5 per cent). In other words, if you invest Pounds 10,000 in Progress, Pounds 3,904 will go into the building society and Pounds 5,856 into the unit trusts at the offer price for the units. So with a bid-offer spread of 6.36 per cent on August 1, according to Finstat, there is an immediate capital loss of Pounds 610 on a Pounds 10,000 investment. The guaranteed income of 7.5 per cent is payable on the full investment. But the account might struggle to meet that figure if the unit trust does not produce growth. The Guardhill unit trust now yields around 3.55 per cent which means that, assuming the building society element pays 10 per cent gross, the total investment yield is around 6.1 per cent. The 'extra' 1.4 per cent will have to be met from unit trust growth. If the unit trust falls in value, the investor could find chunks of his capital being eaten up quickly to produce the income - especially as the income is scheduled to rise to 7.75 per cent in year two and 8 per cent in year three (after that, the income will be reviewed). There is no guarantee of return of capital with this account. And watch out for a further wrinkle. Even if the unit trust does well and the investor's capital grows, the income of 7.5 per cent will still be payable only on the initial investment. Thus, if the capital grows from Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 15,000, the income in year two will still be Pounds 775, not Pounds 1,162.50. An investor would still be happy with such growth. But what are the chances of a good performance from the GRE Guardhill unit trust? It has not exactly lit up the sector; its growth has been below average over one, two, three, five, seven and 10 years. Over the 10 years to July 1, it was 53rd out of 54 trusts in the sector.</p>

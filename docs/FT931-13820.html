			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: Kazakhstan bank takes 40% stake in DSB THE ALEM Bank-Kazakhstan, from the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan, has joined a group of Turkish investors to buy a 75 per cent stake in Deutsch-Schweizerische Bank (DSB), a small Frankfurt-based bank. Alem is believed to be the first financial institution from the former Soviet Union to buy a stake in a German bank. The Kazakh bank, which specialises in foreign trade finance, has taken a 40 per cent stake in DSB. A group of Turkish investors have bought the remaining 35 per cent of the stake owned by Harpener, the German industrial group which is in the throes of restructuring following a costly entanglement with Mr Werner Rey, the Swiss financier. The Turkish buyers are the London-based Plus Communications and Technology and Mr Ahmet Ozal, a son of Turkey's president. The remaining 25 per cent of DSB is owned by the Swiss Canto Bank, a Swiss foreign trade bank. No financial details were disclosed, but it is understood that the investors paid more than the DM19m (Dollars 11.9m) book value of the bank's assets. Mr Manfred Heuser, a director of the DSB, said the buyers intended to concentrate on financing trade between Kazakhstan, Germany and Turkey and developing its international banking business. The Alem Bank was founded two years ago and now finances 75 per cent of Kazakhstan's foreign trade, he added.</p>

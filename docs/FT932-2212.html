			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Markets: Kenneth Clarke's very own smokescreen - The Bottom Line FEW SPEECHES have received such an absurd degree of undeserved attention as this week's peroration in the Guildhall from Kenneth Clarke. I say this without any disrespect to the new chancellor who charmed the City dignitaries while offering no obvious hostages to fortune. The point is rather that expectations of the man, whether for good or ill, are wildly overblown. One group, with a strong anti-inflationary bias, is busy looking between the lines for evidence that Clarke will prove a worthy successor to Maudling, Barber and Lawson. It seeks to establish the precise means by which he will wreck the economy on his way to Number 10 Downing Street. A powerful sub-text is the desire for an independent Bank of England to pin the feet of this dangerous populist to the ground. At the other extreme are those who want the genial health risk from Nottingham, with his penchant for a pint and a cheap cigar, to go for growth and bring down unemployment. For them, the restoration of Britain's manufacturing base is the preferred route to recovery. One can sympathise, up to a point, with either camp. The people who worry about another inflationary dash for growth have plenty of history on their side, together with intellectual underpinning from public choice theorists. These are the academics who talk about the economics of politics and refer to people in Whitehall as rational utility maximisers - ie, a bunch of blackguards who cynically manipulate the system in their own personal and political interests. The same academics also worry about a politically engineered business cycle and throw in a good economic argument in support. While it is widely accepted that there is no long term trade-off between inflation and unemployment, there is undoubtedly a short term trade-off. This the politicians can exploit for electoral advantage at the cost of more inflation later for the same level of output. An independent central bank would help correct the in-built inflationary bias. As for the pro-growth lobby, its members can reasonably argue that global commodity inflation is no longer a pressing threat. Moreover, electorates and markets have grown wise to the ways of politicians, which makes it harder for them to debauch the currency in their pursuit of growth. The trouble with both sets of arguments is that they attribute superhuman powers to the politicians. Even if Clarke really is a blackguard, it is questionable whether he would or could do the evil deed intentionally. Each new set of ex-chancellor's memoirs unfailingly reveals a world where ministers and their officials live in a statistical fog, in which all forecasts are wrong and nobody really understands how the economy works anyway. Moreover, the central perception of public choice theory that governments create budget surpluses less readily than they create deficits is irrelevant when all the leading economies bar Japan are already substantially in deficit. How will Clarke use fiscal policy to maximise his personal utility, starting with a budget deficit equivalent to 8 per cent of GDP? As for monetary policy, the striking feature of its workings in the US, which has a huge overhang of debt, is that successive reductions in interest rates and continuing dollar weakness have failed to spring more than a modest and fragile recovery. Britain looks set for a similar experience. With 1 1/2 m or more labouring under the burden of mortgages that exceed the value of their homes, it will take much more than another point off the mortgage rate to bring back the house price spiral. Nor will last September's devaluation have much inflationary fall-out when Germany is casting a deflationary spell over Europe, the dynamic Asian economies are beginning to impose painful structural adjustment on the Community and supply is utterly elastic. As Brian Reading, of Lombard Street Research, remarked, we have the very opposite of too much money chasing too few goods. This does not mean the inflation threat has gone for ever. But it certainly looks premature. Indeed, it is hard to conceive of a worse moment to unleash an independent central bank, whatever the intrinsic merits. As for growth, it stems ultimately from the cost-conscious pursuit of productivity. Few chancellors manage to be cost-conscious, whatever their aspirations and rhetoric. None can enhance productivity directly. In short, neither conspiracy nor salvation is wholly within Clarke's gift. But he can always change the price of a pint and a cheap cigar.</p>

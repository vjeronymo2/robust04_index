			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Observer: Rich pickings It's ironic that, at a time when increased activity and rising prices have raised the profile of commodities trading organisations, thus making them attractive to people on the lookout for acquisitions, Marc Rich should finally quit. Rich, one of a handful of internationally-known Belgians, has built up his eponymous Marc Rich International since 1974 into a world-class trading business. In turnover terms it became Switzerland's second-biggest corporation after Nestle. But Rich has lost a power struggle with Willy Strothotte - now chairman and chief executive - and since March last year has been slackening his grip on the company until yesterday he sold his final 25 per cent to management and employees. Apart from being one of the most feared adversaries in the oil and aluminium trading world, Rich is also one of the best-known fugitives from the US legal system. He was charged with tax evasion and other offences by the US authorities in 1984 and so far has refused to return to answer the charges. One spot he probably won't be spending his retirement in.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Hsu Yun-teng (1776 0061 7506) and Chang Cheng </F> (1728 2973): "Zhou Zhengqing Says Hong Kong Currency and Other  Foreign Currencies Will Gradually Be Banned From Circulation on  the Mainland"]    [Text] In a special interview with these staff reporters  today, Zhou Zhengqing, executive vice governor of Mainland  China's People's Bank of China, said: The New Taiwan dollar,  the Hong Kong dollar, and other foreign currencies will  gradually be banned from circulation and use or as fiduciary  units on the mainland. These currencies must not be used on the  mainland, unless they have been changed into renminbi at  designated exchange points.    As for when foreign businesses and foreign banks can begin  the renminbi business, Zhou Zhengqing said: "It is not time  yet. I think it is impossible even by the end of this year.  This policy will not be pursued until the tax rates for  mainland banks and foreign banks are the same."    In light of the mainland's current economic situation and  inflationary pressures, he stressed: There is no such thing as  an overheated economy in mainland China, although a few real  estate markets are overheated because of speculation. However,  it is now completely under control. In particular, the new  anti-inflation measures introduced recently have worked more  effectively.    Wang Xuebing, president of the Bank of China, also told  these  reporters: The Hong Kong dollar will gradually be banned from  use and circulation in the Zhujiang Delta. Travelers from  outside China must change their Hong Kong dollars into renminbi  for use, that is to say, the Hong Kong dollar will be allowed to  be changed at exchange points in stores on a basis of "immediate  exchange and immediate use."    Wang Xuebing said that the number of these money exchange  points will gradually be increased to meet the needs of  travelers from outside the borders to reduce the inconvenience  brought about by the ban of the circulation of the Hong Kong  dollar.</p>

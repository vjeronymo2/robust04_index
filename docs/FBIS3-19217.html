			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The chairman of the Christian  Democratic Union [CDU], Chancellor Helmut Kohl, as well as the  CDU's leading bodies have decided that Christian Wulff, the  CDU's top candidate in the elections in Lower Saxony, is to take  over the role of the opposition leader in the Landtag in  Hannover. After the meeting of CDU Presidium and Executive  Committee, Kohl told journalists in Bonn on Monday [14 March]  that Wulff had conducted an excellent and dedicated election  campaign and had achieved an excellent personal election result.  In the CDU's leading bodies everyone thinks that Wulff should  consistently use his opportunities in the group leadership in  the Lower Saxony Landtag.    Kohl admitted that the decline in the number of votes for  the  CDU by 5.6 percent is a "serious loss" for his party. It "is no  consolation" that the predictions were even worse. "This is a  defeat." Concerning the results achieved by the Free Democratic  Party of Germany [FDP], Kohl said the fact that FDP land  chairman had changed his statement on the coalition a few days  before the elections was certainly one of the mistakes that  threw the FDP out of the Landtag.    In the view of the CDU chairman, the election result as a  whole refuted the "stupid talk that the Germans are all on the  point...of refusing to vote." The predictions of an attitude of  refusal were wrong. The predictions of an end of the large  people's parties are similarly incorrect. It is highly  gratifying that the Republikaner remained far below their own  expectations with only 3.7 percent, Kohl stated.</p>

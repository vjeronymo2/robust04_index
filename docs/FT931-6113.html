			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Gold and currency reserves fall Dollars 59m BRITAIN'S gold and foreign currency reserves fell by an underlying Dollars 59m in February, the Treasury reported yesterday, Emma Tucker writes. The overall rise in reserves, however, was Dollars 896m, boosted by extra borrowing. Most of the increase came from the proceeds of the fourth tender of three-year Ecu Treasury notes, which amounted to Dollars 622m. There was also a Pounds 409m difference between Ecu Treasury bills maturing and Ecu Treasury bill proceeds. These factors were excluded from the underlying change. At the end of last month the official reserves stood at Dollars 43.4bn compared with Dollars 42.55bn at the end of January.</p>

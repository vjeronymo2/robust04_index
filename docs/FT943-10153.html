			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Tesco acquires William Low - At a glance The fight between Tesco and Sainsbury, the UK's two largest supermarket to acquire William Low, the Scottish supermarket group, ended this week with Tesco victorious. Tesco, which had originally bid 225p a share three weeks ago, was obliged to increase its offer after Sainsbury stepped in, securing the deal with a final 360p a share. William Low's shares have more than doubled from the 169p they stood at before Tesco's original bid, having touched 368p before Sainsbury's withdrawal.</p>

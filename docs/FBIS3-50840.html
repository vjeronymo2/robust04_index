This was  announced by Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of the Cuban  Workers Federation [CTC], in an appearance this morning on Radio  Progreso's "First Thing" program.    [Begin Ross recording] Forty eight hours ago, the CTC  National Secretariat agreed to begin this process. We must  remember that Comrade Fidel stated in the National Assembly  [ANPP] that none of the measures we need to take can be  implemented if we do not have the understanding, consensus, and  support of the workers. This is precisely our goal, to have the  workers... [changes thought] and also the worker's opinions.  Fidel said that the measures could not have a technocratic  nature, but would be political measures grounded on technical  aspects, of course. Our workers are very wise. Their wisdom  includes the economic. What has happened is that at times they  have not been heard, nor has what they have suggested been done.  That is the reality.    We wish to fulfill that request and allow them more  participation because the workers need to be the spinal column  of everything done in the country on the economy. Everything  done in terms of the economy affects the workers. [end recording]    Ross emphasized that the forthcoming meetings are another  sign of the trust the Revolution has in the workers, adding:    [Begin Ross recording] For example, we are going to ask the  opinion of 485,000 labor leaders on how to heal national  finances. Do we change the currency or not? What to do with  those who have great amounts of money, with those who have  earned on the basis of their hard work, production efforts, and  have accumulated that money? What to do with the money of those  who, through theft, wheeling and dealing, hoarding, have  accumulated it? We must add that there are 1.5 million workers  who are paid between 100 and 121 pesos. There are 2.5 million  who are paid between 121 and 186 pesos. Those earning 100 or 121  pesos cannot have accumulated money. [end recording]    Finally, Ross pointed out that between now and 28 January,  there will be in-depth training of the labor cadres at base  level, to ensure that the process of discussing the national  financial status with the workers becomes a successful process  with practical results, ensures awareness, and particularly, is  based on national economic problems.</p>

Eight  months after his denunciation of a "Social Munich" and his call  for a "cultural revolution" in order to combat unemployment, the  president of the National Assembly yesterday issued a new  warning to the government of Edouard Balladur. "The fight  against unemployment must now carry the same weight as -- if not  more weight than -- the defense of monetary parities in the  fundamental budget choices," he stated at a colloquium on  budgetary policy organized by the Government Audit Office. For  Philippe Seguin the fight against unemployment is "the necessary  precondition not only for economic growth but also for  stabilizing the state budget." The fight against unemployment  "must lie upstream of the budgetary procedure," because "a  formidable recessionary spiral has set in whereby unemployment  and social exclusion increase government expenditure while  limiting income," the RPR [Rally for the Republic] deputy  explained. He also made a series of proposals for better  parliamentary control of public finances, suggesting in  particular that the country's social budget should be submitted  to the deputies and senators every year. He invited Pierre  Joxe, the president of the Audit Office, to submit his report on  the budget implementation to the National Assembly.    Budgetary policy, after having been ousted by liberal and  monetarist ideology in the eighties, seems to be the subject of  renewed interest, believes Jacques Spindler, professor of  economics. But the margins for maneuver are limited. The  growing interdependence of economies prevents -- or in any event  severely limits -- any budgetary stimulation of the economy at  national level. This is why the OFCE [French Economic  Observatory] is calling for a policy of recovery at European  level coupled with a sharp fall in interest rates.    The use of budgetary policy as an instrument of economic  policy suffers from a number of limitations. Firstly, there is  "great uncertainty on the economic diagnosis itself," stressed  Jean-Luc Pain, assistant director at the budget office. The  true situation is only known later, and the decisionmakers only  have fragmented information on the exact causes of the  recession. There is also the lack of budget flexibility.  Budget margins have been reduced and most European countries  are committed to policies designed to cut public expenditure.  The erosion of the debt level due to growth rates above  interest rates no longer works. "The snowball effect which  affects the public debt has a supplanting effect even within the  budget," stresses Gilbert Venet, assistant director at the  economic forecast office. Interest payments on the debt (15  percent of government expenditure) are thus made at the expense  of other expenditure.    Michel Delebarre, a former minister, has also called for a  review of the procedures for debating the budget in Parliament  and a clarification of budget orientations. "Does allowing  every minister to defend the funds of his ministry really help  to achieve a coherent budget?" he wondered.</p>

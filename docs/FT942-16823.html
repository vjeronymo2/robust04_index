			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Court action on Polly Peck administrators The administrators of Polly Peck International - accountants Mr Richard Stone, Mr Michael Jordan and Mr Christopher Morris - were yesterday served papers by the Turkish public prosecutor's office alleging improper behaviour over a Dollars 96,000 payment made by a PPI subsidiary. The public prosecutor's office said the case had been transferred to the criminal court where it is expected to be heard in two months. Mr Stone and Mr Jordan work for Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Mr Morris for Touche Ross. The move by the Turkish prosecutor prompted strong protests from other Coopers partners involved in the administration. They insisted the move was simply part of the 'ongoing harassment' by Mr Asil Nadir, the former Polly Peck chairman, in an effort to obstruct their efforts to act in the interests of creditors. Mr Chris Barlow, a Coopers insolvency partner, said: 'The idea that this will stop us is ludicrous.' The payment concerned was made by AN Graphics, a PPI subsidiary, to PPI Holdings BV, an intermediate holding company within the group. The papers served on the administrators allege it was improper and a breach of fiduciary duty. Coopers yesterday said the payment had been legitimately carried out under Turkish law. 'This action has been initiated by Asil Nadir in order to create further difficulties and delay the progress of the administration,' it said. 'The Istanbul public prosecutors office fully investigated the same complaint 14 months ago and subsequently held that no further action was necessary.' Coopers said the move had taken place at the same time as the administrators had won an appeal in Ankara to take control of AN Graphics - a move opposed by Mr Nadir.</p>

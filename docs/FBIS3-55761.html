			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>   [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk has said that Ukraine  wants close economic and political contacts with Lithuania and  other Baltic states. The Ukrainian leader believes, though,  that the development of all-round relations with the Baltics  aggravates both objective and subjective factors.    In an interview with the popular Lithuanian newspaper  LIETUVOS RYTAS Kravchuk described as an objective problem the  painful transformations in the economy in the republic. As a  result of such transformations, believes the president, it is  difficult to maintain long-standing contacts among the  republics. Kravchuk believes as subjective factors the passive  attitude of the regions, enterprises and the governments.    Kravchuk believes that the situation may start improving  following the meeting between the presidents and he invited the  head of the Lithuanian state Algirdas Brazauskas to visit  Ukraine at any time suitable for him. He is also prepared to  visit Lithuania.    Asked by the newspaper to comment on the Lithuanian official  statement to enter NATO, the Ukrainian president has favoured  the initiatives "Partnership for Peace" and added that Ukraine  would not object against Lithuania's entry to NATO, since we do  not see in it any discomfort or strategic threat.    Kravchuk said that neither the United States nor Russia are  interested to expand NATO. He explained his view by the fact  that today large states, like the United States and Russia want  to have zones of influence. Russia, believes the Ukrainian  leader, attempts to retain in its sphere of influence former  Soviet republics and the countries of the central and eastern  Europe. He said that the methods to ensure the influence  contradict those universally acknowledged.    The Ukrainian president has said that in principle he does  not approve the division along these lines and added that large  and small states should be equal partners. If so, we can rely  on stability and lasting peace, and neighbourly relations, said  Kravchuk.</p>

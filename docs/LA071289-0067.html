			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Madonna's controversial "Like a Prayer" video and Neil Young's  commercial-spoofing "This Note's for You" clip, which MTV resisted showing last  year before eventually putting it into its broadcast rotation, are among the  five finalists for the best video in the 24-hour music TV channel's 1989 Music  Video Awards. Nominees were announced Tuesday and the winners will be revealed  in a live telecast from the Universal Amphitheatre on Sept. 6, hosted by  Arsenio Hall. The other nominees in the top category are Fine Young Cannibals'  "She Drives Me Crazy," Michael Jackson's "Leave Me Alone" and Steve Winwood's  "Roll With It." Paula Abdul's "Straight Up" led the field with six nominations,  including best female performer, dance and new performer, while Jackson's  "Leave Me Alone" and "Smooth Criminal" took seven nominations combined.

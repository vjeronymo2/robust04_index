Someone of the journalists  waiting on the air field for the plane carrying the U.S.  President pointed this out to a guard--let your bosses know. The  guard replied irritably: There is a special person responsible  for the flag. And, lo and behold--the man "in charge" soon  appeared, and the flag was fixed. All of this reminded me very  much the situation of our state, which has become "entangled" in  a multitude of economic, political, and other problems. Except  that we are still waiting for the man "in charge" to fix the  situation.    It does appear, however, that an attempt was made that  evening in Borispol to deal with one of the most burning issues  of modern times--nuclear disarmament. President Clinton, for  instance, quite justifiably lists it among the problems that  came into existence because of the end of the cold war. This  knot has been tightened even more lately.    In your opinion, what is the image of the Ukrainian people  in  the eyes of the ordinary man in the West? Undoubtedly they are  seen as aggressive, trouble-making, and with double standards.  This is not surprising. Over the past few years people in the  West have heard about Ukraine almost exclusively in connection  with two conflict situations: nuclear weapons and the Black Sea  Fleet.    The West does have reason to be jittery. After all, Ukraine  has in its possession no less than the third mightiest nuclear  arsenal in the world. It is obvious why the American President's  statement that those 176 missiles and about 1,500 warheads will  be eliminated on our soil became a sensation: These missiles  were not aimed at nothing--they were aimed at the United States.  Russia conducted its propaganda quite successfully by playing up  this factor.    Still, the greatest contribution to creating this negative  image of Ukrainians in the world was... our own doing. A  Ministry of Defense officer of my acquaintance, who is closely  involved in nuclear armaments issues, once remarked bitterly:  "These days every politico wants to play the nuclear card." This  was quite noticeable when our independent state was making its  first steps. At that time, unfortunately, Ukraine's foreign  policy was being generated not by MFA ((Ministry of Foreign  Affairs] professionals but by parliament members not versed at  all in serious policy matters, let alone military ones. Having  crowed to the entire world that Ukraine would not join any bloc  and would maintain nonnuclear status, they counted on  "compensations, subsidies, and investment" flowing to us in a  steady stream. This did not happen, though. And then our state  machinery began to hurriedly put itself into reverse.    The "doves" in the Supreme Council simply could not  comprehend that Ukraine's nuclear complex could not be severed  from the rest of it (within the borders of the former USSR)  overnight. This extremely complex organism could be restructured  only gradually, and even then only on the condition of goodwill  on the part of Russia. We all remember well that everything was  developing in exactly the opposite way. As for us, we simply did  not have our own foreign policy--it was all essentially a  "response" to Russia's actions. And the United States, too, took  a very uncompromising position. Initially it offered a laughable  amount in compensation--$127,000, and proposed as a compromise  solution to temporarily store missiles on the territory of  Ukraine under international supervision (very attractive at  first glance, except that it is well known that where  international supervision begins, the real rights of a  "supervised" state end).    The terms Clinton is proposing now look quite different. For  the first time the United States has shown a serious interest in  Ukraine. This is especially underlined by Clinton's visit to  Kiev, which is absolutely meaningless from the business point of  view--what can be possibly discussed in two hours? Eduard  Lisitsin, a researcher with the Institute of World Economics and  International Relations [IMEMO] of the Ukrainian Academy of  Sciences, described the positive points of potential trilateral  agreements:    --Russia finally agreed to compensate Ukraine for the losses  incurred by having its tactical nuclear missiles taken out. We  will be given substantial economic aid. We were promised  guarantees of security. There is hope that the world will  finally understand Ukraine and its problems. The situation in  the economy and the military-industrial complex will relax;  military reform will begin.    ...Let us stop and think, however: Do our people really  crave  to get rid of nuclear weapons? Obviously not. On the other hand,  public opinion may change--depending on the results of  agreements. Besides, if there are no results, the world  community will simply come to the conclusion that the strong  United States simply "overpowered" Ukraine (were L. Kravchuk's  rather unusual and somewhat confused behavior at the press  conference, his pale face and forced smile not signs of  precisely such pressure?)    In Lisitsin's opinion, by emphasizing the special role of  the  Ukrainian president, Clinton unwittingly drove a wedge between  Kravchuk and the Supreme Council. The decisions that may be  adopted at the meeting in Moscow are capable of aggravating the  situation and leading to a crisis of presidential power or, vice  versa, to hard pressure on the parliament. Neither is needed  now. Joint efforts of both branches of power are needed (if this  is at all possible) to restore the economy destroyed by  incompetent bureaucrats and shamelessly pilfered by embezzlers.  I think it is appropriate to recall here the thesis of the  American President, who especially emphasized that in the 21st  century the best guarantee of a state's security will be its  economic might.    Let me also quote L. Kravchuk, who once uttered a sacred  truth: "A state may maintain only the kind of an army, the kind  of armed forces, that its economy permits." This probably also  is a strong argument for nuclear disarmament. Having to choose  one of the two--guns or butter--we should probably choose the  latter.    Although perhaps everything would be different had Ukraine  been capable of formulating and skillfully implementing a  farsighted foreign policy. This was not to be, however. Sergey  Vlasov, chief of the Europe department at the Ukrainian IMEMO,  believes: "Stronger states, such as the United States and  Russia, have formulated this policy for us. To make us accept it  they used a carrot-and-stick policy, where Russian played the  stick and the United States the carrot." Does this mean that  these countries are indeed those "in charge of the flag," who  are taking our state ship out of the political dead end?    And something else. Having declared our own independence a  bargaining item (and there is no other way to describe the  situation of backtracking from a pacifist course to flexing  nuclear muscles), we ourselves showed to the world how much we  "value" this independence. I think that in the near future the  real meaning of the notion "Ukrainian independence" will shrink  like shagreen leather. We will find ourselves tightly tied to  one of the poles of the United States--Russia axis. Most likely  the latter. But this is a subject for separate contemplation.</p>

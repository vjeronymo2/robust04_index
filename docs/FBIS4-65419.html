			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, May 17 (A.A.) -- President Suleyman Demirel  said today that Turkey had very intensive relations with Iran  with which it was holding cooperation on Iraq and the PKK  [Workers Party of Kurdistan] issue.    "The foreign ministers of Iran and Turkey meet from time to  time to discuss the developments in Iraq," he said.    He pointed out that there were still a number of PKK  infiltrators to Turkey from the Iranian border, even though the  two countries have an excellent cooperation.    On the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline which has been closed since  the  Gulf War because of an international embargo, Demirel said,  "Turkey is being treated unjustly. Its losses because of the  ban is 3 billion to 5 billion U.S. dollars annually. Moreover,  our pipeline is on the verge of rotting and needs to be filled  and emptied several times."    He stressed that Turkey opposed the division of Iraq and  that  Iran wanted the territorial integrity of Iraq to be maintained  too.</p>

			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Yugoslav army eyes the power vacuum: Authorities struggle to stop slide to civil war THE murder yesterday of a Yugoslav soldier in the Croatian port of Split nudges the nation closer to an imposition of a state of emergency. Authorities, apparently unable to prevent the country sliding into civil war, remain divided over the political future. Following one of the worst incidents of its kind for several years, in which 17 people were killed during clashes between the nationalist ethnic Serb minority in the republic of Croatia and Croat police last Thursday, the Yugoslav collective presidency warned at the weekend that civil war was a possibility. However, the way in which the presidency, which consists of representatives from the six republics and two provinces, has regularly used such a warning to restore stability has stripped the threat of credibility. The political inertia on the federal level has led to a political vacuum, increasingly filled by the federal army. Many Croats distrust the army. They believe it is influenced by the Serbs, in particular Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the nationalist/Communist president of the republic of Serbia. Indeed, more than 70 per cent of the officer corps within the Yugoslav army is Serb. But the way in which Mr Milosevic has manipulated Serbian politics, through his unique blend of one-party rule and nationalism, which is now directed against the Croats, has led senior officers in the army to believe their interests lie in maintaining the present status quo as opposed to siding with any one republic. The army's entire legitimacy (and financing) is based on the maintenance of federal structures. Croats also argue that Serbs, and elements in the federal army, will do everything in their power to prevent Mr Stipe Mesic, Croatia's representative on the collective presidency, from becoming president. Croatia is due from May 15 to hold the presidency for one year under a system of rotation in which representatives from each of the republics and provinces serve for a limited period. Against this background of age-old mutual suspicion and hatred, a cross-section of Croat opinion believes Serbs are determined to provoke ethnic clashes between the Serb nationalists in Croatia and the local population, in order to precipitate a state of emergency or civil war. This could pre-empt Mr Mesic's accession to the presidency. Croats claim the federal authorities and army have been slow to disabuse them of these feelings. Why, for instance, they ask, have the federal security forces been reluctant to arrest Mr Vojislav Seselj, a prominent Serb militant who spearheaded last week's shootings of the Croat policemen? Tensions between Serbs and Croats have been worsened by the latter's distrust of General Blagoje Adzic, the hardline chief of general staff and acting defence minister since General Veljko Kadejevic became ill last month. Many Croats believe General Adzic will do anything to block Mr Mesic's appointment in order to atone for the death of his parents. They were killed by the Ustasha, or Croat fascists, during the Second World War. Yesterday's meeting of the presidency, the prime minister and the army may provide a glimmer of hope for easing tensions. But a Yugoslav official said yesterday he no longer believed the present political institutions could end the cycle of violence.</p>

			<p>Consumption,   Trafficking   <F P=102> 94WD0278A La Paz PRESENCIA in Spanish 20 Feb 94 p 1 </F> <F P=103> 94WD0278A </F> <F P=104>  La Paz PRESENCIA </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Law 1008 Mainly Affects `Little Fish'"; first </F> paragraph is editorial introduction]    [Text] About 26 percent of the persons held in prison in  Bolivia have been accused of narcotics trafficking. In San Pedro  Prison about 40 percent of the minor prisoners there have been  accused of consumption of or trafficking in drugs.    About 26 percent of the prison population in Bolivia were  charged with narcotics trafficking and sent to prison under the  provisions of Law 1008, according to data from the National  Institute of Statistics [INE].    The data points out that in Bolivia a total of 4,197  prisoners were listed as being held up to the end of July 1993,  of whom 3,653 were men and 544 were women.    The data show that the incidence of the crime of narcotics  trafficking is higher among women than among men.  <H5>  Women </H5>   According to a research study conducted by the INE and the  Ministry of the Interior, about 40 percent of the prison  population has been accused of committing narcotics trafficking  crimes, while the proportion of male prisoners so charged is  lower: about 23 percent of male prisoners are being held for  this reason.    Nevertheless, the information indicates that men are far  ahead in committing this kind of crime.    Out of seven foreign nationals held in Bolivian prisons, one  is a woman.  <H5>  Small Fish </H5>   Jerjes Justiniano, a member of the Chamber of Deputies and  of  the Committee on Human Rights, an organization attempting to  amend Law 1008, has said: "Law 1008 has succeeded in sending to  prison many persons accused of narcotics trafficking. In  reality, these people are `small fish' or, as has been seen in  the case of minor prisoners, are drug consumers. They need  treatment instead of being sent to prison."    The Committee on Human Rights has evidence of arrests on the  basis of Law 1008 in which legal procedures were not fully  complied with and of prisoners who, during their detention in  jail on charges of being narcotics traffickers, were tortured.  <H5>  Minors Held for Narcotics Trafficking </H5>   The problem of narcotics trafficking among minor prisoners  held in La Paz affects a substantial percentage of them,  although this is not the most important cause of imprisonment,  according to information obtained at San Pedro Prison.    Out of a total of 128 minors under detention at that prison,  about 40 percent are there for narcotics trafficking crimes.    Law 1008, criticized by some members of the National  Congress  for its harshness, has particularly affected minors held in  prison who have no access to legal defense or any possibility of  release on bail, because they have been accused of "narcotics  trafficking."    In many cases the charge that they are "narcotics  traffickers" has been made because of the company which they  kept. However, as we showed in a report published last week, the  most serious problem facing these young people in prison is that  they live with an adult group of criminals, under crowded  conditions, learning some of their vices and exposed to sexual  abuse, violence, and labor exploitation, according to Adalid  Viscarra, director of the care of youth in San Pedro Prison.</p>

			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SAN FERNANDO MAYOR RESIGNS, CITING NEED TO CARE FOR WIFE  </P> <P> San Fernando Mayor Roy Richardson, the city's most popular politician for 11  years, resigned Monday night, saying he needs to devote more time to his ailing  wife.  </P> <P> Mayor Pro Tem Daniel Acuna was appointed by the San Fernando City Council as  his replacement.  </P> <P> Richardson, 64, a retired merchant, has been the council's top vote-getter in  the three elections held since 1978.  </P> <P> He was in his third term as mayor, a position that rotates among City Council  members. Richardson is best known for his soft-spoken manner in leading council  discussions on controversial issues.  </P> <P> "It is with a heavy heart that effective April 30, I will resign my post,"  Richardson told the City Council at its regular meeting Monday night, his voice  breaking with emotion. "I have called this city home for more than 60 years. I  can't tell you how much it hurts to leave."  </P> <P> Richardson said he and his wife, Frankie, who is recovering from a series of  operations brought on by cancer treatments, have moved to a home they bought in  Los Osos, south of Morro Bay. Richardson said they were planning to retire  there after his four-year term ended in 1990, but he is acting now so he can  look for work to pay his wife's medical bills.  </P> <P> Under state law, the City Council has until May 30 to fill his council seat by  appointment or call for a special election, said City Administrator Donald E.  Penman. In the past five years, the council has twice opted to fill vacant  seats by appointment rather than conduct an election, which would cost the  small town between $10,000 and $15,000.  </P></p>

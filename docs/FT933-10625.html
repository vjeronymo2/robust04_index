			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Midland &amp; Scottish writes off oilfield MIDLAND &amp; Scottish Resources has written off the entire value of its Emerald oilfield east of Shetland after 'conversations' with its auditors. It said the 1992 accounts, to be published shortly, had been prepared on a going concern basis assuming the group's lenders would continue their support for the Emerald Field project. The shares fell 3 1/2 p to 12p. The USM-quoted oil company published results for 1992 which included a provision of Pounds 80m (Pounds 38.9m) against the Emerald Field development, warning that audited accounts would be delayed pending a full assessment of a drilling programme. The provision has been increased to Pounds 97m, deepening 1992 pre-tax losses from Pounds 97.4m to Pounds 113.6m (Pounds 46.4m). Production in the Emerald Field was originally delayed by a protracted dispute over equipment with Davy Corporation, settled in May 1992. The company said the Emerald Field would continue to provide positive cash flow. The extent to which cash flow would service related debt depended on the total reserves recovered from drilling new wells. MSR said: 'Without such wells the projected production and the cash flows based on that production are not now expected to generate a material surplus beyond that required to meet obligations to non-banking creditors.' It added: 'The full accounts explain that the group has received confirmations from relevant lenders of their present intention to continue support for the Emerald Field project which has allowed the directors to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis.' Directors expect any shortfall to be recovered from the floating production platform, being built in Italy with Italian government backing, to be delivered in 1994. The platform is now MSR's principal asset.</p>

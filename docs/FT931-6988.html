			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Macro 4 shares jump 23p as profits rise 29% to Pounds 4.9m SHARES IN Macro 4 jumped 23p to 633p after the software group lifted profits by 29 per cent in the six months to December 31. Profits before tax went up to Pounds 4.94m, against Pounds 3.83m, on turnover ahead 27 per cent at Pounds 11.2m (Pounds 8.83m). Nearly 80 per cent of sales are overseas. Earnings per share rose to 14.8p (11.5p) and the interim dividend goes up to 6.27p (5.14p). For the last full year to June 30 the group declared a special dividend of 5p on top of a final of 12.75p. Mr Terry Kelly, chairman, said he hoped to see a final dividend 'similar' to last year, with performance for the second half expected to be 'slightly better' than last year. With 40 per cent of its business in the US, the group was helped by the depreciation of sterling. Mr Kelly said business in the US and south-east Asia was recovering but UK, Australian and Scandinavian business remained 'flat at best.' The cash position improved by Pounds 600,000, with reserves of Pounds 16.2m at the end of the period. A Spanish subsidiary established last October is expected to break even this year.</p>

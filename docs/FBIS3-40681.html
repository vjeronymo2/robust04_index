			<p>Language: <F P=105> Tamil </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Jayalalitha--We Should Not </F> Completely Reject Dunkel"]    [Text] India's complete rejection of the internationally  accepted GATT is not in the national interest, according to  Jayalalitha, the Chief Minster of Tamil Nadu. She is also the  general secretary of the ruling party, the AIADMK [All-India  Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam].    In a statement issued on behalf of AIADMK she has said:    "Declaring that India may not adopt the Dunkel proposal on  international trade, will affect Indian economy and its  export-import trade.    "Since certain clauses of these proposals are not favorable  to Indian conditions, in my opinion, we should negotiate with  the countries concerned, and work the differences out.    "We have been using foreign inventions, and production  methods extensively in our industries. The new agreement  regulates such use and will eventually necessitate paying more  tariffs on such products. This may affect our agricultural and  other sectors.    "We must study the ways in which we can alleviate any undue  burdens this might cause us since we are producing these items,  even if with foreign assistance. We must aim at keeping prices  under control."  <H3>  REQUEST TO DELHI: </H3> "Adopting these proposals has caused the central government to  rescind several grants that it was previously giving. There is  the likelihood of facing inflationary prices in fertilizers and  genetically-improved seeds. The central government should devise  ways to keep up the grants and make the new system work for the  multitudes of indigent Indian farmers.    "In the area of pharmaceuticals, it is going to be mandated  that a considerable sum of royalties be paid to foreign  countries, if their inventions and discoveries resulted in the  original manufacture. This is because of revised patent and  copyright laws and review of intellectual property rights  world-wide.    "Some life-saving drugs sell for very high price in foreign  countries. We will have to sell them at comparable prices,  should we import them. Thus either way drug prices are going to  go up in India. The central government will have to come up with  recommendations to control this situation.    "In a changing world economy, when all the countries  cooperate to come up with a general agreement, it is not prudent  for India to stay aloof, since it will affect our economy. At  the same time, we have a responsibility to our citizens and  absolutely have to study how to really adopt these rules to our  indigenous conditions and requirements.    "We have to live in harmony with the world, and safeguard  our  special interest as well. I hope that the central government  will take all the necessary steps to do the same."</p>

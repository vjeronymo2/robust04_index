			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / A rich haul from the sound of music: The illicit copying and sale of recorded music is a lucrative and damaging trade A record industry official was ambushed and shot in both knees on the streets of Taipei last year. In Cairo last month, police seized 500,000 pirate cassette tapes. Earlier in the year, 1.5m were seized in Togo. The illicit copying and sale of recorded music is a large and dangerous business. The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) estimates that pirates rack up worldwide sales of more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 578m) a year, compared with the Dollars 21.6bn earned annually by legitimate record companies. The federation believes one out of every four pre-recorded audio cassette tapes sold worldwide is a pirate copy. Record pirates occasionally react violently to attempts to curb their activities. But they have an effect which goes beyond the physical threat to IFPI representatives. Apart from taking sales away from the legitimate industry, the pirates pay no taxes and deprive aspiring musicians of their royalties. They also play havoc with the record companies' schedules for releasing new recordings, says Mr Rob Stuyt, the board member responsible for intellectual property issues at PolyGram, the music subsidiary of Philips, the Dutch electronics giant. Pirate cassettes sometimes reach the market before the genuine product, he says. Sir John Morgan, president of the IFPI, says he was invited to look at a consignment of captured pirate cassettes in the Ivory Coast in February, along with the local head of EMI Music. 'The cassettes were more up to date than the ones the EMI man had to put out legitimately,' Sir John says. Few countries are untouched by record piracy. In Nigeria, the IFPI estimates that 11.8m pirate recordings worth Dollars 18m were sold in 1989. In unit terms, pirate sales accounted for 80 per cent of the market. In Kenya, the 2.4m illicit recordings sold accounted for 68 per cent of the market. In Mexico, the IFPI estimates that 55m pirate recordings worth Dollars 75m were sold in 1989, representing 50 per cent of the total market in unit terms. In Ecuador, the 3m pirate recordings sold accounted for 69 per cent of the overall market. India's pirate revenues were worth Dollars 141m in 1989, the IFPI says. The 152.5m units sold accounted for 52 per cent of the overall market. While Third World countries are the main focus for the pirates, the European Community and the US are not immune. In Italy, Portugal and Greece, at least 20 per cent of recordings sold in 1989 were pirate copies, the federation says. In the same year, nearly 46m illegal recordings worth Dollars 418.8m were sold in the US, an estimated 6 per cent of total sales. The federation achieved some successes during the 1980s, with government and local police co-operation greatly reducing piracy in countries such as Indonesia and Singapore. Now the music industry faces two new problems: growing piracy in the newly-liberalised markets of eastern Europe and the high quality of illegal recordings available on compact disc. Sir John, who served as British ambassador in Poland, Korea and Mexico, says one of the difficulties in eastern Europe is that record pirates became heroes during the decades of communist rule. 'In countries like Poland and Czechoslovakia, the record pirate was the guy bringing culture and the latest rock music to the kids,' Sir John says. 'Now there's a need for education. We have to persuade people that the pirate is the enemy of their nascent music industry.' He says Czechoslovakia has a tough anti-piracy law, but is not yet enforcing it properly. Mr David Stockley, managing director of EMI's international operations, says that tackling record piracy does not appear a high priority for east European governments. Poland has still not enacted legislation to protect the legitimate music industry and, even when it does, there is no guarantee that piracy levels there or elsewhere in eastern Europe will drop markedly. Record piracy is international and its perpetrators can move their base of operations if conditions become too difficult in any one country, Sir John says. 'We've now heard that one of the biggest pirates in Poland has gone to the Soviet Union and set up there,' Sir John says. 'He's calculated that Polish legislation will be in place before Soviet legislation.' Sir John, however, sees some hope in the attempt by eastern European countries to forge closer relationships with the EC. 'Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary are seeking association agreements with the Community. Part of the requirement is that intellectual property rights must be protected,' he says. The record industry also faces another new problem: the manufacture of pirate compact discs. Until the advent of the CD, most pirate recordings had been on cassette. The tapes were often of low quality and were sold at a price lower than that of the legitimate item. By contrast, Mr Stuyt says that illicit CDs are being sold at the same price as his company's own products. In tracking down the compact disc pirates, the record companies are aided by the relatively small number of CD manufacturing plants. Cassette tapes can be copied in a pirate's home. The equipment necessary to manufacture a compact disc, on the other hand, costs as much as Pounds 750,000, EMI's Mr Stockley says. Setting up a CD factory costs about Pounds 1m in all. For this reason, pirate discs are usually manufactured under contract by legitimate plants. Sir John recently visited a compact disc factory near Prague and showed its management a Pink Floyd CD with an EMI label marked 'Made in West Germany'. The managers admitted that they had made the CD under contract but had not bothered to look at the small print on the label. The difficulty for the record companies is that digital recording techniques mean that pirated CDs are of comparable quality to the original products. 'Because they're almost identical to the real thing, piracy is difficult to prove in court,' Mr Stuyt says. Sir John says there are three steps to stamping out piracy. The first is the adoption of a copyright law protecting the rights of the legitimate industry. It is not only eastern European and Third World countries which do not have adequate laws. Mr Stuyt points out that the Netherlands, Belgium and Greece have also not enacted the necessary legislation. The second step , Sir John says, it to get local law enforcement authorities to take action against the pirates. The third is to secure convictions in the courts and the imposition of substantial penalties. Sir John says it is not always easy to convince courts that piracy is a serious crime. The federation and record companies admit, too, that world public opinion is not necessarily on their side. People, they concede, confuse the campaign against piracy with attempts by the record industry to stop them taping records or CDs in their homes. While the federation stresses that this widespread practice is still theft, it agrees that it is a different area of criminality. The federation concedes too that public sympathy is limited by a perception that western performers earn enough anyway. Mr Phil Collins, the British rock star, admits in a recent IFPI publicity video that piracy has not seriously undermined his lifestyle. He says, however, that it has retarded the development of the music industry in much of the developing world. Pirates do not pay royalties to performers. Deprived of the ability to support themselves through music sales, many Third World musicians are faced with the option of giving up or moving to Europe. Mr Salif Keita, a popular Malian singer, says on the IFPI video: 'Never have I been able to live from creating my music. The pirates prevent African nations from progressing. If nothing is done to stop piracy there is a great danger that African music will die.'</p>

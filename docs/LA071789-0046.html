			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> MCENROE TO MISS DAVIS CUP BECAUSE OF INJURY  </P> <P> John McEnroe pulled out of this week's Davis Cup semifinal against defending  champions West Germany because of a shoulder injury, U.S. team officials said  Sunday.  </P> <P> Brad Gilbert, ranked 15th in the world, will replace fifth-ranked McEnroe as  the other singles player on the U.S. team, U.S. Tennis Assn. spokesman Ed  Fabricius said from Munich.  </P> <P> Fabricius said McEnroe, whose shoulder pain and stiffness forced him to  withdraw from the doubles competition at the recent Wimbledon championships,  was diagnosed as having rotator cuff tendinitis. McEnroe was examined Friday by  Irving Glick, the chief physician at the U.S. Open.  </P> <P> Gilbert has a 3-1 career record against Wimbledon champion Boris Becker, who  will play singles and doubles for West Germany. Fabricius said U.S. captain Tom  Gorman talked to Tim Mayotte and French Open champion Michael Chang about  taking McEnroe's place, but both were unavailable for next weekend.  </P> <P> Chang has recently returned to the United States after a holiday in Europe and  Mayotte is still playing in Japan.  </P> <P> Andre Agassi will play the other singles as planned, with Ken Flach and Robert  Seguso teaming up in the doubles.  </P> <P> The Americans tried not to let McEnroe's absence affect their morale for the  encounter at Munich's indoor Olympic arena.  </P> <P> "We were disappointed when we heard John was out, but now we are here we have  got to pull together and do what we are here to do. That is win," Flach said.  </P> <P> West German doubles player Eric Jelen acknowledged that McEnroe's absence  increased the chances of the already-favored West Germans to win. "But it is  obviously a blow to the event as a spectacle," he said.  </P></p>

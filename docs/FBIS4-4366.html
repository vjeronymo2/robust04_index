			<p>CSO     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, 14 Feb (BERNAMA)--Plans are now being  made to fly 10 Hawk 100 planes to Malaysia at the end of this  month, a Royal Malaysian Air Force (TUDM) officer said today.  These are modern jet trainers that have been by bought by  Malaysia. TUDM pilots will fly the planes from Britain to the  TUDM air base at Butterworth. The officer said British  Aerospace (BAe) will deliver nine more Hawk 100 planes in stages  before the end of this year.    The first ten of the two-seat planes were accepted by Air  Force Commander Lieutenant General Datuk Abdul Ghani Abdul Aziz  from Kevin Smith, director of BAe Military Aircraft Division, in  a short ceremony at Wharton Aerodrome at Preston in Britain last  month.    The Hawk 100 planes were bought under a memorandum of  understanding (MOU) worth 2.4 billion ringgit signed by Malaysia  and Britain in 1988. The TUDM also ordered 18 Hawk 200 planes  under the same contract. The TUDM will be the first air force  in this region to use the British-made planes. Indonesia  reportedly will buy planes of that type, too.    Both the Hawk 100, a modern all-weather jet trainer, and the  Hawk 200, a light fighter plane with one seat, use Mk 871 Rolls  Royce Adour engines. The first Hawk 200 will be flown here in  July. Deliveries of the plane will begin in May and will be  completed in February 1995.    The MOU also provided for training facilities for TUDM  pilots  and airport staff, including technicians, under a reciprocal  program. As many as 69 TUDM technicians will attend 20 types of  courses. Four selected TUDM pilots, who have completed a  three-year training program, will be instructors in a new  squadron to be formed at Butterworth Air Base. They are now at  Wharton to accept the Hawk 100's.    In December 1990, Malaysia reached an agreement under a  similar MOU for a 400-million-ringgit reciprocal contract  involving the transfer of technology to Malaysian  defense-related industries such as the Malaysia Explosives  Company, a producer of military equipment in this country, and  Airod Sdn. Bhd. [limited corporation], a privatized facility for  overhauling aircraft.    The reciprocal program for the supply of domestic airborne  military equipment and weapons (bombs and guided missiles),  support equipment, and repair and overhaul facilities provides  Malaysia with adequate support for Hawk planes.    Meanwhile, preparations for creating support facilities at  Butterworth Air Base have been moving smoothly since the arrival  of replacement equipment for Hawks at Klang Port last July. BAe  and suppliers of other Hawk components, such as Rolls Royce and  Westinghouse (radar systems), will provide field service to the  TUDM for 24 months after the planes are received.</p>

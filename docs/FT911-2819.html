			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Gardening: Flowers with undergraduate habits - The great beauty of fritillary time in Oxfordshire IT IS time to be sowing hardy annuals directly into the garden, to be planting gladioli and be spending loads of money on the lawn. I had intended to write on the latest advice from two experts about seed-sowing, to suggest plants of the easy Agrostemma, sown now as annual pot-plants, and to remind you about hardy violas. Nature has overtaken my intention. This week marks one of those sights which does not recur often, like the exceptional flowers on the magnolias in the sunshine of the last two years. It is fritillary time in Oxfordshire. It looks as if the flowers will hold their best until Sunday, if you want to let Mother Nature bowl you over with the best sight in the country. Fritillaries have weird flowers of chequered purple which hang like bells or the diceboxes from which they take their Latin name. They are sombre, subtle and exquisitely varied. I have always believed that best fritillaries live in the heart of Oxford in Magdalen College's Addison's Meadow by the river Cherwell, where the public can visit them between 2.30 and 6.15 in the afternoon. There have been rival claims from meadows upstream on the river Thames, protests from Gloucestershire, and mutterings in Wales. From time to time, a bypass or a builder threatens one of the few old fritillary meadows somewhere else, and people then protest that it is one of the finest habitats in England. Perhaps it is, but it is not the greatest. While most other wildflowers have been uprooted or ploughed into oblivion, Magdalen's have turned round since 1980 and multiplied. They have now left the challengers standing. Admittedly, the setting is special, the central meadow of the walk where Joseph Addison reflected on landscape gardening in the early 18th century and began to rebel against the formal style. From these reflections, a new movement was to begin in English landscape gardening, which led to the natural style, Capability Brown and our greatest export, the natural English park. While Addison reflected on the natural beauty of the College's trees, there must have been fritillaries in the meadow beyond him. He never mentions them, perhaps because they were still a common sight, perhaps because he was like me. Twenty years ago, I remember walking hopefully in Addison's footsteps and being pleased to find two small clumps of fritillaries in flower by the edge of the raised walk. It never occurred to me to look sideways through the trees into the meadow where they grew in thousands. Perhaps Addison never looked closely: nowadays, he could hardly miss them. In the 1980s, Magdalen changed the meadow's management. The grass was no longer turned over to pasture in early summer: it was left to grow undisturbed until later in the calendar, when it was made available to new browsers, the College's famous herd of deer from the deer park. At the same time, the meadow was fenced off, impeding the undergraduates, who had a tradition of romantic, medieval pastimes in the long grass. Probably, the fritillaries responded more to the inclusion of the deer than to the exclusion of their younger visitors. The change of routine has led to a vivid lesson in ecology. The fritillaries could seed in peace; the deer do not harm bulbs which have died down; their manure must have helped and perhaps there is magic in their hoofprints. As a result, the fritillaries have begun to multiply, not in tens or twenties but by the 10,000. The further you walk, the thicker they become behind their protective fence of netting. Perhaps England was once like this, with a million flowers in the meadows before anyone drained them and used the plough. This weekend, this old grassland has become a pointilliste landscape of purple and white, best seen in a gentle breeze. On their grey-green stems, the fritillaries then swing sociably together, as if they are engaged in secret conversation. They like the damp, the deer, the peace of ages, and the grass which has not been disturbed for centuries. Nature, of course, is a fickle mistress. The fritillaries, which multiply in this Oxford meadow, refused stubbornly to multiply in my own Oxford patch of rough grass. Success, too, brings its own complications. It is not so much that the fritillaries have undergraduate habits and intermingle freely: the basic Magdalen type is a dark, sombre maroon, but there are whites and purples, too, and therefore some wonderful half-castes, white with purple stripes or pale mauve with marbled white backgrounds. Nurserymen would sell these variations at ever-higher prices. The problem, rather, is that something has started to eat the flowers. Like a perfect market, nature corrects her imbalance. The meadow changes its grazing; fritillaries then multiply; something (the books give no clue) then starts to eat the feast of fritillaries. Does anybody know the culprits? They cannot, I think, be famished undergraduates, reluctant to take out a student loan. They are probably not the other residents, the pheasants, which look contented in the Oxford sun. In 1629, the herbalist, John Parkinson, believed that the fritillary had entered England from France: a fellow-herbalist was supposed to have introduced it, from the fields round Orleans. Like Addison, he must have overlooked it on the Thames at home: the flowers were surely old British natives. 'The chief or only use of it,' Parkinson wisely concluded, 'is to be an ornament for the Gardens of curious lovers of delight.' Fritillaries multiply in grass or lightly shaded woodland which is damp or in an area of heavy rainfall. If they like you, they will run wild and last for centuries: they are happy with lime, heavy soil, and are even worth a gamble in a damp, shaded patch of London. If they fail, you know the answer: put away the lawn-mower and send for venison on the hoof.</p>

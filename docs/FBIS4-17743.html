			<p>BFN     [Text] "Some shifts in direction for satisfying those who  do not share the president's stand have been made in the draft  agreement on civic accord, but these changes are quite  insignificant, and they do not alter the current course  fundamentally." This statement was made in an interview with  INTERFAX by Anatoliy Lukyanov, member of the State Duma, who  belongs to the unregistered Russian Way faction.    Lukyanov commented on a televised statement by the former  vice president Aleksander Rutskoy, who said that he is willing  to lead those forces opposed to the president, which refuse to  sign the agreement on civic accord.    According to Lukyanov, "if, with the silent consent of Boris  Yeltsin, the pro-president and pro-government press begins to  harass those who refuse to sign the agreement, the authorities  themselves will push them toward Rutskoy." The Yavlinskiy  faction in the State Duma might also join the opposition bloc,  he said.    "We are open to union with all patriotic forces with which  our positions coincide to some extent," Lukyanov declared. He  referred to the fact that at the December-12 referendum not only  the Communists, the Agrarians and the Russian Pan-National  Union, but also the Yavlinskiy bloc, stood against adopting a  new constitution.</p>

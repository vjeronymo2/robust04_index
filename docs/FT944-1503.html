			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Forearmed with Foresight  -In a nutshell Durham University Business School has launched a Foresight project designed to anticipate changes in the business environment for smaller businesses and to predict trends. A quarterly publication will draw on experts from industry and academia as well as policy makers to produce 'policy-orientated research'. Issues as wide ranging as the ageing of population, and the opportunities this will generate, and the impact of regional development policy on the establishment of faster growing companies will be covered. The quarterly briefing will be available from Durham Business School and NatWest Bank, its main sponsor. Data will also be available on disc for subscribing members.

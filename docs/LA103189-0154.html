			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> WHOOPI TO BECOME GRANDMOTHER  </P> <P> Whoopi Goldberg is about to become a grandmother -- thanks to her unmarried  15-year-old daughter, Alexandria.  </P> <P> "I believe my first reaction was, 'Gee, I'm going to break your legs,' "  Goldberg said in an interview that will air on "The Joan Rivers Show" Thursday.  </P> <P> "And then she (Alexandria) said, 'Well, it really won't change anything if you  break my legs.' " Goldberg raised the possibility of abortion but changed her  attitude when Alexandria told her that she intentionally got pregnant because  she wanted to have a baby.  </P> <P> "It would not have been what I would have chosen for her, but at the same time,  I thought, 'What a great thing that she's confident enough in me to tell me,' "  Goldberg said.  </P></p>

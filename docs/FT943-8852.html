			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Just winning is not good enough: Damian Fraser says the political system, as well as the candidates, are under scrutiny in Mexico's elections Mexico's governing Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) has won 10 consecutive presidential elections since it was founded in 1929, making it the longest continuous-ruling party in the world. On Sunday, it is expected to win an 11th - extending its run in power until the next century. The opposition still cherishes hopes of a last-minute victory. But the PRI's lead is so great in national opinion polls that its supporters are more worried about the size of presidential candidate Mr Ernesto Zedillo's victory, the threat of protests over the result, and whether - once in office - Mr Zedillo, a former central bank official and budget minister committed to pro-market economic policies, can tackle Mexico's pressing political and economic problems. Ms Nancy Belden, a respected US pollster who has just completed a survey that puts the PRI 27 percentage points ahead, says: 'The lead is so commanding that it would take a rather large turn of events to see someone else come ahead.' Unless that happens in the next few days, the PRI will win more than half the seats in the House of Deputies, the lower house, and three-quarters of those in the Senate. The PRI has won popularity despite growing economic and social unrest. Ms Belden's poll shows widespread voter dissatisfaction with the economy, and a general conviction that poverty, pollution, crime and corruption are stagnant or worsening. But voters do not believe that the opposition is better placed to resolve these problems than the governing party. Such views reflect poorly on the campaigns of the main opposition parties. Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, of the centre-right National Action party (PAN), at one point looked to be seriously challenging the PRI after a strong performance in a television debate with Mr Zedillo. But soon afterwards, he almost disappeared from public view for nearly a month - the official explanation was that he was briefing himself - and his party has been criticised for not publishing a detailed platform, preferring to concentrate on a few broad themes and attacks on the government. Support for the leftwing Party of Democratic Revolution, led by Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, has remained weak. The electorate may be sticking with the PRI in part because of the political turbulence this year, which appears to be making voters more, rather than less, afraid of change. At the beginning of the year, a Zapatista peasant revolt in Chiapas, ostensibly seeking the overthrow of the current president, Mr Carlos Salinas, was controlled easily by government troops. But it highlighted the extreme poverty in which many Mexicans live and the authoritarian nature of PRI rule. In March, the assassination of PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio heightened political tensions still further and led to divisions within the ruling party over the nomination of Mr Zedillo. More significant reasons why the PRI is apparently defying political gravity are its organisation (which is far superior to rivals'), seemingly unlimited campaign resources (much of it from business) and favourable television and radio coverage (much of which is owned by PRI supporters). Although this campaign is more equitable than previous contests, the PRI is set to spend more than Dollars 200m on the presidential and congressional races - far more than all the opposition parties combined. While such advantages are expected to enable the PRI to win the election, party officials admit that victory will not be enough: the voters, and at the very least the centre-right PAN, will have to be convinced that the election is fair. Otherwise the opposition will almost certainly organise street protests as it did after the 1988 presidential elections, threatening the stability of the political system. 'We are at a turning point in Mexico's future. We either have to have democracy or there will be civil conflict,' says Mr Javier Estrada, a 34-year-old teacher and delegate at a Zapatista-organised conference on democracy in Chiapas last week. Winning legitimacy will not be easy. The memory of the 1988 election - when computers processing the results mysteriously broke down with the opposition ahead on early returns - still haunts the country. According to the Belden poll, 30 per cent of Mexicans believe there will be 'considerable' or a 'great deal' of fraud on Sunday. The PRI and many independent observers (including from the UN) counter that the electoral system has been completely reformed since 1988. The government has handed over its supervision to six independent scrutineers, approved by all the main political parties. These will be complemented by about 30,000 independent observers, including some from overseas. Exit polls and results from a representative sample of early returns will be released to reduce further the scope for fraud. Mr Enrique Calderon, a senior observer, says: 'Every step in the election process is now very explicit. We can detect if there is any rigging.' Nevertheless, problems may remain in rural areas where there is a tradition of ballot-rigging and, if previous elections are a guide, there will be much debate over whether irregularities that are found are mistakes or fraudulently intended. An election that was considered fair at home as well as internationally would, however, greatly help Mr Zedillo in his efforts to maintain political stability. He could claim, unlike President Salinas, who was elected in 1988, that he had a democratic mandate for his policies, and argue that the PRI had made a decisive step from being the electoral arm of an authoritarian state towards being a democratic party. But a clean election may not be enough to win over the growing number of dissident political organisations opposed to the PRI and, more importantly, the political system that the party dominates. As last week's Zapatista-organised convention indicated, the left wing in Mexico, though a small minority, is willing to use public protests as a weapon against the government. 'There are too many signs that the political modus operandi that maintained stability in Mexico from 1929 no longer works,' says Mr Guillermo Valdez, political analyst with the Mexico City-based consultancy, GEA. 'You have more and more political forces not controlled by the PRI that are looking for political power.' Mr Zedillo has indicated that he will respond to the new political pressures by pushing through further democratic reforms. He has promised to decentralise power to the regions, to give the judiciary more independence from the executive and to let Congress have more influence in drawing up legislation. Mr Zedillo also says he would seek to put the PRI on a par with other political parties by distancing himself from its internal affairs and encouraging it to choose candidates for elective office democratically. If implemented, such changes would open up more opportunities for Mexicans to participate in politics. But they could also weaken the power of Mr Zedillo: the predictability of Mexican politics in the past has depended on a president's commands being put into practice. Mr Zedillo could strengthen his hand, however, if he could engineer a return to strong economic growth and provide jobs for the approximately 2m Mexicans who enter the workforce every year. Over the past couple of years, Mexico's economy has been stagnant, as domestic industries have suffered from international competition and high interest rates, pushed up by recent political uncertainty. Mr Zedillo has vowed to raise infrastructure spending by 25 per cent to increase economic growth. He and his advisers are confident that capital inflows brought in by the North American Free Trade Agreement will boost growth over the long term. But the effect of Nafta is double-edged: it is leading to a process of economic restructuring, with inefficient companies closing, but the lost jobs are not yet being absorbed by new arrivals. And a continuation of pro-market economic policies is unlikely in the medium term to improve Mexico's uneven distribution of income. Mr Zedillo is likely to have a difficult task steering Mexico towards the status he covets for the country - to be a successful part of the industrialised world - even if he wins Sunday's election cleanly and legitimately.</p>

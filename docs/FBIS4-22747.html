			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S. Shandar, correspondent: "It's Already Time </F> for Sowing, But Sunflower Seeds are Still in Storage Facilities"]    [Text] The apricot trees have begun to bloom, and that is a  sure sign that it's time to sow sunflowers. But their seeds are  not being bought by collective and state agricultural  enterprises, nor by private farmers: They simply do not have the  money to do that. Approximately 60 tonnes of such seeds are in  the storage facilities of the Kholmskyy and Hlavan KSP's  [collective agricultural enterprises] in Artsyzkyy Rayon and  other farms, which have been growing the Odessa 122, Odessa 123,  and Odessa 249 hybrids from the Plant-Breeding and Genetic  Institute on a contractual basis. There are enough seeds here to  sow 12,000 hectares. On some collective and state agricultural  enterprises located in Zaporozhye, Poltava, and Lugansk oblasts  the persons in charge intend to sow their fields with random  varieties and hybrids, while keeping their own high-quality,  enhanced hybrid varieties in storage facilities. The  agricultural producers have been compelled to knowingly take the  path of a shortfall in the harvest by from four to five quintals  per hectare. That is the added amount of the yield from the  hybrids from the Plant-breeding and Genetic Institute in Odessa.    An even more alarming situation is evolving with regard to  the native forms of hybrids stored in sections here. The  Plant-Breeding and Genetic Institute has received requests to  obtain 50 tonnes of such seeds, but only about 10 tonnes have  been purchased. These will be enough to sow no more than 2,000  hectares within a total need for 10,000 hectares.    "Because of this situation," says Doctor of Biological  Sciences V. Burlov, chief of the Institute's Plant-Breeding and  Vegetable-Oil Crops Section, "as early as next year Ukraine will  not have enough high-yield, high-quality hybrid seeds for  commercial sowings."    Therefore, we could be faced with a situation  whereby--because of our present-day poverty and  short-sightedness--we will be without vegetable oil as early as  next year. In order to prevent this from happening, staffers of  the Plant-Breeding and Genetic Institute, along with its choice  seed organizations, are proposing that farms and private farmers  accept seeds on credit. This would be in exchange--on the basis  of mutually agreeable conditions--for a portion of the crop  after it is harvested. In particular, they would agree that the  agricultural producers--in exchange for the hybrids obtained  from them--would give them 100-120 kilograms of seeds from each  hectare 0f sowings. The advantages to be gained by the farmers  and private farmers from this arrangement are obvious. Because  certainly the additional yield from the Odessa hybrids is  substantial, and the oils derived from them is much higher than  that obtained from random varieties and hybrids.    The Ministry of Agriculture and Food must also pay heed and  concern itself with solving this extremely important problem.</p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Stores lose fight to stop warehouse shopping BRITAIN'S three biggest supermarket chains yesterday lost their High Court battle to stop the opening of the country's first cut-price warehouse shopping club next month. The decision clears the way for the arrival in the UK of the fastest-growing form of retailing in the US and is a setback for the supermarket chains already facing mounting competition from discount food retailers such as Germany's Aldi, Denmark's Netto and the UK's Kwik Save and Shoprite. Costco, the US warehouse club operator, plans to open the 139,000 square feet store - with about five times the selling space of typical food superstores - in Thurrock, Essex, on November 30. Warehouse clubs sell products from cans of beans to car tyres in large no-frills sheds to fee-paying members at prices 25 per cent or more lower than high street retailers. They achieved sales of Dollars 34bn (Pounds 22.5bn) in the US last year and analysts believe there could be scope for about 50 clubs in the UK, with sales of about Pounds 3bn. Costco's development at Thurrock is one of five warehouse clubs to have applied for planning permission in the UK. J. Sainsbury, Tesco and Argyll, owner of Safeway, had taken joint action to try to quash planning permission granted to Costco by Thurrock Borough Council. They denied they were afraid of competition, but argued that the club should have been treated as a retail, rather than wholesale, outlet and should therefore have been subjected to tougher planning criteria. The 'big three' said that while the majority of warehouse clubs' customers in the US were businesses, private individuals accounted for over 35 per cent of turnover, and that meant they should be considered retailers. But yesterday Mr Justice Schiemann ruled that Thurrock had been correct in treating the proposed discount store as a wholesaler. The supermarket chains yesterday put a brave face on the setback, claiming they had 'achieved their central objective'. Mr John Littman, of Rapleys, the chains' joint planning consultant, said the aim had been to 'make the secretary of state for the environment, planning authorities and the general public aware of the need to consider carefully the implications of warehouse membership club planning applications.' The retailers were refused leave to appeal against the decision, but said they had yet to decide whether to challenge that ruling. They have also not yet decided whether to pursue similar action against UK cash-and-carry operator Nurdin &amp; Peacock, which plans to build a club at Wednesbury, W Midlands. Mr Paul Moulton, managing director of Costco Europe, said he was 'particularly pleased with the ruling that we are not a retailer. We are in a different business than the superstores'. Retail analysts believe the development of warehouse clubs and discount stores in the UK is part of a shift in retailing away from the high profit margin culture of the 1980s towards increasing competition on price. Fears that such competition will make it difficult for the biggest UK grocers to maintain the rapid profits growth of the past 10 years have meant the food retail sector has underperformed the all-share index by 28 per cent since January. The big three's shares fell again yesterday, with Sainsbury off 8p at 416p, Argyll, down 5p at 304p and Tesco down 4 1/2 p to 216p. Details of High Court judgment, Page 8 London stocks, Page 52</p>

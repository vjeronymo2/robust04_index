			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Commodity price gains forecast for 1994-95 World commodity prices are forecast to rise by 6 per cent in 1994-95, regaining with interest the estimated overall fall of 2 per cent seen in 1993-94. According to a report from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, commodity prices overall reached a nadir in the first half of 1993-94, but recovered with a 6 per cent rise in the first quarter of this year and are expected to show a further 1 per cent increase in the second quarter. In the next fiscal year Abare suggests demand will strengthen as more countries move out of recession, and tighter supply conditions persist, particularly for rural products like sugar, cotton and rice. As far as specific commodities are concerned, Abare predicts that the world gold price should rise by about 7 per cent in 1994, to average USDollars 385 an ounce over the year (close to the present level). The forecasters suggest that the price rise will result from increased jewellery fabrication and investment demand, spurred by the general improvement in economic conditions. Abare also sees a firming of the wool prices in 1994-95, as strengthening demand from western Europe and, to a lesser extent, Japan outweighs some upward revisions to expected level of the Australian wool production. It suggests that the market indicator price could increase by about 9 per cent, to average ADollars 5.30 a kilogram clean. However, the average market indicator for 1993-94 is put at around Dollars 4.85, still marginally below the previous year's figure.</p>

			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Leading Article: A tale of two mice In his speech to the annual banquet of the Bankers Club at London's Guildhall on Tuesday, Federal Reserve chairman Mr Alan Greenspan warned that disturbances in one country were all too rapidly transmitted through the world economy in today's global markets. His remarks were made in the context of the risks inherent in the growing trade in derivative instruments, which were subsequently credited with pushing the FT-SE 100 index to a record highon Wednesday. But the point applies with equal force to the cash markets; and it sounded uncomfortably relevant after yesterday's news of a tightening in US monetary policy. A change in the direction of monetary policy is more often than not an indicator of a market turning point. The conventional wisdom aboutthe overblown condition of equity and bond markets worldwide has been that, once US interest rates rise, funds are likely to flow out of Europe and the Far East back to the US. This would be a natural response to a change in yield differentials and any tendency for the dollar to strengthen. Yet the bigger worry has always concerned the impact of higher US interest rates on small investors, especially the elderly, who have been taking money out of bank deposits and putting them into mutual funds without appreciating how far they are exposing themselves to market risk. Much of the buoyancy of bond and share prices outside the US has stemmed from American portfolio diversification; part of it reflects a significant spillover from the mutual fund bubble. If the unsophisticated folk panic when they discover that their capital is suddenly being eroded by falling share and bond prices, money could pour out of foreign as well as domestic markets back into the US banking system - or so the argument runs. Considerable pressure Yet all that has been mooted so far is a small increase in short-term money market rates. That falls short of the kind of grinding gear change that brings about a crash, or even a sharp correction. And as Sushil Wadhwani andMushtaq Shah of Goldman Sachs point out in a well-timed circular, past evidencesuggests that individual investors are anyway slow to react to changes in interest rates, especially when the increases are not large. Mr Greenspan, who is under considerable pressure from both Congress and the administration not to brake too hard, appears not only to have produced a mouse, but a politically correct mouse at that. Even the smallest and friendliest of rodents have been known to frighten elderly widows. But there is no real case here for panic. Mr Greenspan's move is undeniably justified by the strength of the US recovery and the near certainty that the gap between actual and potential output will disappear this year, giving rise to inflationary pressure. A more difficult questionis whether his UK counterpart, Mr Eddie George, has been right to hold back from a further fall in British interest rates. In real terms, UK rates are much higher than US rates were at the comparable stage of economic recovery. Yet fiscal policy is about to tighten abruptly in April. Sterling has been strengthening against the D-Mark and the economies of Britain's main trading partners in Europe remain depressed. Sustained growth On Tuesday Mr George offered plenty of optimism, arguing that the prospects for sustained growth in output and gradually falling unemployment were better than at any time in his professional career. This he based on the central bankerly conviction that low inflation and growth go hand in hand. Yet he did not promise an interest rate cut, despite thefavourable inflationary backdrop. There is no shortage of indicators that point to accelerating recovery, ranging from falling unemployment to December's soaring car sales. Yet many of the indicators turn out to be less substantialthan they seem - witness yesterday's bank lending figures. These showed the largest quarterly increase for three years, at Pounds 5.4bn. Yet on closer examination the greater part of that increase came from the rise in lending to the financial sector, with growth in lending to the securities industry at a remarkable Pounds 3.6bn being the largest single component. So the figures have more to do with a bubbling stock market than a booming economy. Moreover, corporate results, such as the recent poor figures from that one-time wonder J. Sainsbury, continue to fall short of expectations. And there is no shortage of anecdotal evidence that the pre-Christmas retail boomlet has more or less petered out. The British economic recovery has so far appeared to follow the pattern charted by theUS. But there is one very striking difference in store, which is that the Aprilfiscal crunch in the UK is infinitely tighter than anything proposed by the Clinton administration. The risk is that in seeking to establish his anti-inflationary credentials in an economy that may prove to be less robust than he thinks, Mr George could find himself presiding over a mouse of a recovery.</p>

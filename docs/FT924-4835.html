			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / International Company News: Arco agrees sale of 146 oil, gas sites for Dollars 362m ARCO, the large US oil and gas group, said yesterday it had agreed to sell 146 onshore US oil and gas properties for a total of Dollars 362m. The property disposals are part of Arco's previously-announced programme to reduce overall costs and to focus on core holdings by selling non-strategic assets. Arco said yesterday that the Dollars 362m of sales would be part of its plan to sell properties valued at a total of nearly Dollars 600m by year-end. Following these deals, two of which will close by year-end, Arco said it would have 'only a few more minor fields' to be sold in the western region of the US. Arco will retain about 60 large fields that have relatively high production rates and profitability in the region. The property sales are divided into three separate transactions. The biggest is a Dollars 208.9m deal to sell property with proven reserves of 28m barrels of crude oil and 57bn cubic feet of natural gas to Anadarko Petroleum of Houston. The properties, in the south-west of the US, will double Anadarko's proven US crude oil reserves and increase its 1993 production by 60 per cent. The second-largest sale is a Dollars 90m deal under which Arco will sell fields in California's San Joaquin basin to Vintage Petroleum, an independent energy company. The third is a Dollars 63m transaction, under which Arco will sell 14 fields in Wyoming and other Rocky Mountain states to Snyder Oil, another independent operator. Arco said it would maintain an overriding royalty interest in some of the 14 fields being sold to Snyder and may receive additional future payments if oil prices exceed certain levels over the next five years. On Wall Street yesterday, Arco's share price declined by Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 109 3/8.</p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Voice gets free ride on computers Teleworkers who need to communicate regularly with their headquarters, or small offices that need to communicate with their parent company, could cut the cost of their telephone bills with a California-developed device that enables telephone calls or fax messages to be sent down the same telephone line as a data call. The Sprinter does this by compressing the voice call and eliminating all the silences which punctuate the conversation. A similar technique is used to compress the fax message. They can then be sent alongside the computer-to-computer call, getting a 'free ride'. The Sprinter can also be used on internal company networks. Each Sprinter costs Pounds 1,320; two are needed to make a successful call. Micom: US, 805 583 8600; UK, 0483 451960.</p>

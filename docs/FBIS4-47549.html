The  serological structure of the delta antigen is studied at the  level of individual etiotopes. To this end, the effect of a  change in the peptide chain and amino acid replacements on the  antigen activity of the section 65-80 HDAg peptides with the  serum from hepatitis delta patients from various CIS regions is  examined by the enzyme immuno assay method (IFA). The findings  reveal that 65-80 and 69-80 peptides react in the ELISA test  with all individual preparation of anti-HDV-positive sera of  patients with acute hepatitis delta. It is speculated that delta  antigens contain a nonlinear antigen determinant or a set of  highly immunogenic etiotopes between the 69th and 80th amino  acid radicals. Thus, a special confirmation test may be  constructed on the basis of the 65-80 synthetic peptide and its  fragments for confirming the positive outcome of human serum  studies obtained with the help of standard commercial ELISA  diagnostic sets.

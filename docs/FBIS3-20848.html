Sutalo: "`Dubrovnik' in Dubrovnik"] </F>   [Text] Dubrovnik -- A few days ago the missile ship  Dubrovnik arrived for the first time in the port whose name it  bears and from which it will sail for regular monitoring of the  maritime borders of Croatia. This ship became the property of  the Croatian Navy upon the withdrawal of the Yugoslav Navy from  the repair institute in Sibenik, and, as Deputy Commander Ivan  Vukovic told us, it was given the name Dubrovnik during the  heaviest attacks on this town. Since then, this vessel  participated in battles around Sibenik and in the Maslenica  action when things were the hardest, Commander Miljenko Crljen  said. "When the former Yugoslav People's Army was still on Vis  and Lastovo islands, we used to defy it by sailing near  Korcula," Crljen added, stressing the ship's cooperation with  the Maritime Police.</p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Dollar steady The dollar maintained its firmer tone of recent days in European trading yesterday, helped by economic data which initially propped up the US bond market, writes Philip Gawith. The London market interpreted the data as showing that the US economy was slowing, with little inflationary pressures. The US currency finished one pfennig firmer in London at DM1.5558 from DM1.5457, and at Y97.9050 from Y98.28. In New York it gave up early gains to close at DM1.5531 and Y97.75, as bond prices weakened late in the day. The dollar's London performance helped sterling to hold on to recent gains. The pound finished slightly lower against the dollar, at Dollars 1.5586 from Dollars 1.566, but was 1 1/2 pfennigs up against the D-Mark at DM2.4248 from DM2.4089. In New York, sterling strengthened further to Dollars 1.56175. The currency was buoyed by foreign investors appearing to take a better view of UK assets, following the release of encouraging labour costs and average earnings figures earlier this week. Although some of yesterday's US data appeared to show signs of an economy running up against capacity constraints, analysts said most of the higher numbers were weather related. Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency strategy at JP Morgan in Europe, said they all 'added to the current view of slower growth and lower inflationary pressures.' The market focused on the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index, which dropped to 88.9 in the preliminary July index from 91.2 in the final June index. Mr Persaud said he was doubtful whether the dollar would continue its rally, since the rally in the bond market was likely to prove shortlived. He said the the sharp fall in yields - the yield on the ten year US treasury note fell to below 7.20 yesterday from 7.47 at the start of the week - was not sustainable. The improved interest rate sentiment has been reflected in the futures market. The December eurodollar contract settled yesterday at 94.25, thirty five basis points firmer than the 93.90 close on Monday ahead of producer and consumer inflation data releases. Some traders are expecting a rate rise ahead of the Humphrey Hawkins testimony next week of Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve. With inflation apparently under control, however, most observers believe the Fed will wait until its next policy meeting on August 16. In Europe the main excitement was provided by the lira which slipped to an early low of L999.25 against the D-Mark before recovering to L993.8. The market was concerned about a political row surrounding the anti-corruption probe by magistrates. The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 30m late assistance. Earlier it had provided Pounds 1.549bn after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 1.65bn, the largest for some time. Overnight money traded between 4 and 6 1/2 per cent. In the futures market meanwhile, the eurosterling contracts retraced some of their recent gains. The December contract traded 27,000 lots to finish at 93.98 from 94.00. The December euromark contract finished at 95.10 from 95.12.</p>

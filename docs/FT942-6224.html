			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Nigeria tightens direct controls on foreign exchange: Rift widens with international creditors ahead of scheduled visit by team from IMF Nigeria's military regime has increased direct control over scarce foreign exchange and export finance despite opposition from Mr Kalu I. Kalu, finance minister, and Mr Paul Ogwuma, central bank governor. Increased state regulation of the economy has also widened the rift between Nigeria and its international creditors ahead of a scheduled visit this month by an International Monetary Fund team. This week, ministers are allocating Dollars 15m (Pounds 10m) out of a fortnightly average supply of Dollars 100m, to companies for priority imports, mainly food. They say this is to prevent shortages in the shops later this year and correct distorted demand. A committee chaired by Mr Samuel Ogbemudia, labour minister, including Mr Iyorchia Ayu, education minister, and Mr Aremu Yahaya, junior transport minister, is expected to allocate most of the foreign currency for food importers to undisclosed companies. 'Something has to give soon,' said Mr Kalu in an interview in the capital Abuja. 'At the end of June I plan to hold a mid-year review of the economy. I want to review foreign exchange restrictions, the cap on interest rates and other controls, and look at ways to reduce bureaucracy and create incentives for producers. 'We need to create the minimum framework for resuming talks with the international creditors.' Other critics regard the direct allocation as creeping towards the import licence system, notorious for its corruption in the 1980s. 'In our experience, this does not solve the problem,' Mr Rasheed Gbadomosi, Nigerian Industrial Development Bank chairman, said yesterday. 'It can lead to accusations of abuse of power and is straying from the fundamental problem: the low supply of foreign exchange. While non-oil exports are depressed, they will just be rationing the misery.' Mr Kalu and Mr Ogwuma have failed to block transfer of control over the Nigerian Export-Import Bank (Neximbank) from the central bank to the ministry of commerce and tourism and the appointment of Mr Tony Adaba as its new managing director. Both decisions were authorised by the presidency. 'This is a financial institution, not a trade promotion council. It should be under the central bank,' Mr Kalu said. The cocoa industry is concerned about the security of Dollars 10m which industry operators say is owed to farmers. The sum is left over from a levy by the International Cocoa Organisation which had not been remitted by the government when the levy ceased in 1990.</p>

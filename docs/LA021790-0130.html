			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARMY EMPHASIZES URBAN WARFARE TRAINING IN WAKE OF PANAMA INVASION;  </P> <P> MILITARY: PROTECTION OF NONCOMBATANTS IS BEING STRESSED. THE ENGAGEMENT RULES  COULD BE USED ON NARCOTICS MISSIONS ALSO.  </P> <P> At first light, a volley of machine-gun fire erupts from the third-floor window  of a burned-out cinder-block building, shattering the silence of Combat Town.  </P> <P> Its target -- a company of paratroopers -- is breaking out of the nearby woods  and creeping toward the city, aiming to secure a toehold from which their  battalion can, house by house, wrest control of the settlement from a smaller  force of rebel "Cortinians."  </P> <P> The recent scene at Ft. Bragg's mock Combat Town reflects the new emphasis that  the Army is placing on urban warfare training in the wake of the U.S. invasion  of Panama. In the December operation, U.S. forces met some of their most  daunting opposition from urban guerrillas holed up in the buildings and  shantytowns of Panama City.  </P> <P> During a recent briefing for the Army's senior leadership, Army investigators  identified the need for more and different kinds of urban warfare training as  one of the principal lessons learned in Panama.  </P> <P> What makes urban warfare particularly dicey is the presence of civilian  noncombatants. In the training exercises at Combat Town, situated in the  pine-dotted hills of North Carolina, all of the "Cortinian" civilians had fled  and the invading soldiers did not have to worry about the possibility of  killing noncombatants.  </P> <P> But real life, as Panama demonstrated, is more complicated. So, later this  month, when the 82nd Airborne Division's 1st Battalion storms Combat Town again  in another round of dawn training maneuvers, it will face not just a band of  rebels but a city full of sleeping citizens as well, perhaps played by Army  dependents and out-of-uniform soldiers.  </P> <P> "The Panama situation has emphasized the need to work the civilian side of  things," including the handling of prisoners of war and bystanders, Col. Glynn  Hale, commander of the 1st Battalion, said.  </P> <P> At Ft. Bragg, where some of the nation's "first-to-fight" units are based, that  means increased training for "military operations in urban terrain," in Army  parlance. Although many Army units get to practice urban combat only once or  twice a year, the 1st Battalion has fought its way into Ft. Bragg's Combat Town  six times in recent months.  </P> <P> With the addition of noncombatants to the training exercises, units like the  82nd Airborne hope to learn how to use their firepower more discriminately,  adding risk and complexity to an already dangerous and painstaking task.  </P> <P> And there is no question that battles fought in the smoke, rubble and close  quarters of a city are deadly to soldiers and civilians alike. In last week's  training session, for example, the 700 soldiers of the 1st Battalion secured  Combat Town after nearly four hours of fighting, but at a "loss" of 22 U.S.  dead and 46 wounded.  </P> <P> The Pentagon estimated that 220 civilians were killed during the U.S. invasion  of Panama, most of them in the cities and shantytowns that provided shelter and  anonymity to Gen. Manuel A. Noriega's loyalists. The casualties were high even  though the operation's commanders placed tight limits on how, when and what  kinds of force U.S. troops might use.  </P> <P> "Operation Just Cause, like many of the counter-narcotics missions the Army may  be asked to perform in the future, involved restrictive rules of engagement,"  Maj. Blair Ross said, referring to the guidelines that dictate whether, how and  when soldiers may use deadly force.  </P> <P> "So we now have this new focus, this new need to make sure that we're familiar  with operations under those circumstances," said Ross, a brigade operations  officer in the 82nd Airborne Division who designed and oversaw last week's  Combat Town maneuvers. "It's something that we're certainly going to have to  adjust ourselves to. We haven't practiced much with restrictive rules of  engagement."  </P> <P> In fact, most of the Army's urban warfare training assumes scenarios far  different from those confronted in Panama.  </P> <P> The Army's largest mock urban combat site is a 189-acre facility in West Berlin  called Doughboy City, where Army forces practice operations against organized  tank armies that resemble Warsaw Pact forces, not Third World rebel troops.  </P> <P> According to Maj. Pete Pierce, a spokesman for the U.S. Command in Berlin, the  Doughboy City facility does not use "extras" to simulate the presence of  civilian populations.  </P> <P> "Panama brought a lot of things back into focus," said Col. Bob Harkins,  director of training and doctrine at the Army Infantry School at Ft. Benning,  Ga. "In Vietnam, we didn't really fight much in the city, and everybody after  that tended to put urban warfare training in the European context."  </P> <P> That assumption was initially questioned by the Army's top brass after the  Israelis discovered the costs associated with going into Beirut during their  invasion of Lebanon in 1982. Pentagon planners began to recognize that Third  World cities, from Tehran to Seoul to Managua, had become crucibles of unrest.  </P> <P> "Given the population trends throughout the Third World, the prospect for urban  warfare has actually increased markedly over the past several decades," said  Augustus Richard Norton, a professor at the U.S. Military Academy at West  Point, N.Y.  </P> <P> "It's easy to say we'd better be preparing for these Third World conflicts," he  said. "But it's hard to design training to prepare soldiers for this, because  it's a gut-wrenchingly hard kind of warfare to prepare for. It's not like  training to fight large tanks, where, if you have enough room and gas, you can  prepare for anything."  </P> <P> In 1986, the Army Infantry School was directed to review its urban warfare  training, which had assumed new significance with the creation in 1983 of  special light infantry divisions designed for rapid deployment to operations  like Panama.  </P> <P> By last November, amid intensive preparations for the Panama invasion, the  reassessment had borne fruit at the Army Joint Readiness Training Center at Ft.  Chaffee, Ark., where the Army pioneers new training techniques for the nation's  rapid-deployment forces.  </P> <P> For the first time, soldiers in two-week urban warfare exercises at Ft. Chaffee  began to face civilian role-players extensively and to receive daily changes in  the rules of engagement under which troops operate.  </P> <P> The new techniques -- bolstered by the U.S. experience in Panama -- already are  finding their way into the normal training routines of other Army units, such  as the 1st Battalion of the 82nd Airborne Division's 505th Brigade at Ft.  Bragg.  </P> <P> The Panama invasion has also taught the Army other lessons that will affect the  equipment it uses for training and for battle in urban areas.  </P> <P> Congressional and Pentagon sources said that the 82nd Airborne's 1960s-vintage  Sheridan tanks, which are lighter than more modern tanks, negotiated Panama  City's rubble-strewn streets better than the lightly armored wheeled vehicles  used by the Marines in Panama.  </P> <P> The Sheridan's performance is likely to affect a heated debate on Capitol Hill  over the size, shape and armor of the Army's and Marines' next fighting  vehicle.  </P> <P> "I think someone here will probably insist we have a tracked vehicle to  (succeed) the Sheridan," one Ft. Bragg officer said.  </P> <P> In addition, training experts said that, if soldiers are to practice not  killing bystanders, they must be equipped with simulated hand grenades and mock  tank and artillery rounds that will accurately show how many people --  civilians and otherwise -- are killed in a unit's efforts to secure a building.  </P> <P> Currently, only the M-16 rifle and some Army machine guns are equipped with  laser devices that allow soldiers to "shoot" without live ammunition and know  whether they have hit or missed.  </P> <P> Because hand grenades and small building-shattering rockets are among the most  commonly used urban weapons, the Army Infantry School's Harkins said, they,  too, should be equipped with devices to enable soldiers in training to show how  many people they kill when they lob such explosives into a room.  </P> <P> "We're more aware of the construction of a building," and the nature of its  occupants, since Panama, said Capt. David Woolf, commander of the 1st  Battalion's Charlie Company, during the recent exercise.  </P> <P> "It's very much easier to stand off and just plaster something," he said. "But,  in places like Panama, that just isn't an option."  </P> <P> Melissa Healy was on assignment recently at Ft. Bragg.  </P></p>

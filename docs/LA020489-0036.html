			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. TEACHERS AGREE TO BOARD PLAN FOR TALKS  </P> <P> The Los Angeles school district's most celebrated report card day went off  without a major snag Friday amid signs of potentially significant progress on  the bogged-down labor negotiations front.  </P> <P> In a step toward possible resolution of a yearlong labor dispute, the teachers'  union agreed to a school board plan for nonstop, face-to-face negotiations  beginning Sunday afternoon.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, despite some confusion, continued grumbling by students and some  apparent report card tampering by students, union and school district officials  reported no big problems Friday as hundreds of thousands of students were  presented marks for their work since last September.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pressure Tactic  </P> <P> As threatened by the 22,000-member teachers' union, which has been boycotting  certain non-teaching duties as a negotiating pressure tactic, marks were given  to the students in handwritten form on 4-by-6-inch cards prepared by the union,  rather than filed with school offices in the normal manner. The union estimated  that at least 85% of teachers withheld grades from the district. The district  said the figure appeared closer to 70%.  </P> <P> School Supt. Leonard Britton, contending that the withholding of grades could  harm some students, threatened earlier in the week to withhold paychecks,  starting next month, from teachers taking part in the grade boycott. Union  officials have threatened to strike if that occurs.  </P> <P> While student concern over the grade-withholding tactic has been partly  responsible for widespread campus demonstrations in recent weeks, most students  accepted the unofficial report cards without loud protest when the day finally  came.  </P> <P> "It went smoothly. This is acceptable," said Iiesha Howard, a college-bound  senior at Dorsey High School.  </P> <P> The key question of whether some seniors headed for college might be placed at  a disadvantage if preparation of official school transcripts is delayed could  not be conclusively answered Friday. But high school counselors appeared  confident that they could handle any difficulties that might arise.  </P> <P> "For my students, I do not anticipate any problem that is insurmountable," said  Felicie Barnes, a college counselor at Dorsey, where about 150 of the 400  seniors are headed for four-year universities.  </P> <P> College counselors at Taft and Monroe high schools in the San Fernando Valley  made copies of the grade cards belonging to students applying to college. They  will examine each report card, verify any questionable grades with teachers and  send copies to each school that requires midyear grades. They will also send a  note explaining why the grades are not sent on official transcripts.  </P> <P> "If that's what it takes to get these kids into college, I'm willing to do it,"  said Linda Zimring, Taft's college counselor.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Easy to Forge Grades  </P> <P> Some students and school administrators acknowledged that it would be  relatively easy to forge grades. Most agreed, however, that students applying  for college would not be likely to tamper with their grade cards because they  know they would eventually be caught.  </P> <P> But Taft Principal Ron Berz said students have other reasons -- such as  establishing eligibility for extracurricular activities -- for altering grades.  Berz said he knew of some that were changed.  </P> <P> "This is going on all over school," Berz said, waving two report cards he had  just confiscated from a student.  </P> <P> Both cards had the same name, but one had markedly better grades.  </P> <P> Berz said students could easily obtain an additional blank grade card and fill  it in themselves. During a locker clean-out at Taft Thursday, he said,  administrators discovered 50 or 60 blank grade cards. He said he suspected  students had found them on teachers' desks and made copies.  </P> <P> Lovell Johnson, a Monroe High School senior, said he was aware that some  students were altering their report cards and added that it was easy to get  extra cards.  </P> <P> "Say you fail first period, then you go to your next period and say you didn't  get one," he explained.  </P> <P> "You can write your own report card," confirmed Shannon McIntyre, also a Monroe  senior.  </P> <P> United Teachers-Los Angeles President Wayne Johnson agreed that forging grades  was possible, but he insisted that it was a minor problem and would succeed in  fooling parents only for a short time.  </P> <P> "Eventually, these grades will be filed," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Worry and Debate  </P> <P> For some students, the worry and debate over the unofficial report cards  continued even after they received them. At Garfield High on the Eastside,  senior Anna Gonzalez, 17, said she wants to attend a local trade school in the  fall but may not be eligible unless she can present her official report card  within two weeks.  </P> <P> "There is no way the school will accept this report card," she said. "While the  teachers and the schools are fighting, what am I supposed to do about getting  an education?"  </P> <P> But Josh Ofstein, a Monroe senior who is applying at several Ivy League  colleges, said, "Anyone who these grades really matter to knows there isn't  going to be a serious problem."  </P> <P> Throughout the day, there were many instances of confusion. At Dorsey High, for  example, senior Blanca Torres' card was missing one grade from a teacher who  was not participating in the union action. On another line of her card, the  teacher had apparently been confused about how to fill out the form, and the  information was incomplete.  </P> <P> For a third class, Torres' teacher had scribbled over a mistake and marked the  change with initials. Torres said her counselor told her "that doesn't look  good."  </P> <P> At Gardena High School, teacher Hartley Kern, the union representative, said  Gardena students applying to college were confused about where to go for  counseling.  </P> <P> "Students know they should get their grades to a counselor," Kern said. "But  we've had no directive from the principal as to what seniors are supposed to do  -- go to a college counselor or to a regular counselor. I tell students to go  to both places to make sure they've done it right."  </P> <P> Despite the grumbling and inconvenience, many students continued to show  sympathy for the teachers and support for their job action. Seventeen-year-old  Lizbeth Chavira, a Garfield High senior, said, "It's not (the teachers') fault  that they need a pay raise. They can't support their families, and they have to  do this to make things better for themselves."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, under orders from a state mediator supervising the contract  negotiations, the teachers' union accepted a school board-proposed bargaining  format it had rejected a day earlier. The Sunday session at school district  headquarters will put school board President Roberta Weintraub and union  President Johnson face-to-face, along with Britton and professional negotiators  for both sides.  </P> <P> Nearby for consultation will be the others needed to approve new offers and any  settlement -- the other six school board members and elected union officers.  </P> <P> Diana Munatones, a district spokeswoman, said officials hope the contract  dispute over wages and other issues can be quickly settled so "students can get  back to class and studies and teachers can get back" to their duties. But  Johnson warned Friday that the union will renew its demand for the presence of  all seven school board members at the talks if rapid progress is not made.  </P> <P> "I find it absolutely incredible that seven elected officials will not sit down  and meet . . . union officials on a contract dispute that has this whole city  turned upside down," he said.  </P> <P> The two sides are far apart on wage increases and other issues, including how  neighborhood schools should be managed. Teachers want a one-year contract with  a 12% pay increase, but the district is seeking a three-year contract and says  it cannot afford much more than its current pay offer of 17.4% spread over the  three years.  </P> <P> Contributing to this story were staff writers Amy Louise Kazmin, Ginger  Thompson, Sam Enriquez, John Mitchell and Adrianne Goodman.  </P></p>

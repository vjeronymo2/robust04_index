			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Pilkington hopes to put a shine on its prospects: Maggie Urry analyses reasons behind a difficult morning for Roger Leverton When Mr Roger Leverton, the new chief executive of Pilkington, the UK-based glass group, stands up before a roomful of stockbroking analysts this morning he will have some convincing to do. They have become angry, even bitter, about Pilkington. Investors too have been exasperated by the falling share price. Mr Leverton's task is unlikely to be helped by the interim results he will be announcing. Forecasts for pre-tax profits for the half-year to September range up to Pounds 25m. But many analysts admit privately their estimates are likely to be too high and a number near zero is possible. In the comparable period last year the group, which makes glass mainly for the construction and automotive industries, recorded a Pounds 50.6m profit, but even that was less than half the previous year's figure. Annual profits, shattered by recession and weighed down by rationalisation costs, have fallen from Pounds 325.2m in 1989 to Pounds 77m in the year to March 31 this year, when the dividend was finally cut. A reduction in the interim dividend is expected today. Mr Leverton's great advantage on this occasion will be that as he only joined the group in July he cannot be blamed for the company's record after it escaped a bid from BTR in January 1987, since when outsiders believe they have witnessed a series of mistakes. One says: 'Pilkington's problems are mostly its own fault.' Apart from Mr Leverton's arrival on the retirement of Mr Derek Cook, the former managing director, the top management is unchanged - notably with Sir Antony Pilkington still very much an executive chairman. So Mr Leverton will have to be a skilled diplomat as well as a good manager if he is to turn the company around. Mr Leverton is not well known to the UK investing community. Of his last three jobs only one was running a UK public company, MK Electric, which he joined in September 1984 from Black &amp; Decker, the electrical goods maker. He had joined Black &amp; Decker in 1968 rising to head the southern Europe operations. MK was taken over at the end of 1987 by RTZ after a fight which forced RTZ to pay up. Mr Leverton stayed with the mining group, moving to Canada to run Indal, its diversified industrial products business. It was from there that he was headhunted back to Pilkington. Those who remember Mr Leverton at MK are generally positive about his talents. They recall a fondness on his part for 'business school terminology' or, less charitably, 'bullshit'. But, as one put it, he is 'a marketing man to his finger tips' and he 'got a cracking price for MK'. Observers who blame Pilkington for its problems, have to admit it is working in a difficult market worldwide - with volumes and prices falling sharply during the recession - and the nature of glass making, a highly capital intensive, continuous process industry, makes it expensive to cut capacity. But they accuse the group of having preoccupations. These include an obsession with developing new technology, at great expense and without any apparent concern about what the customer wants. 'The sales force is arrogant', is a typical comment. Another follower says: 'Sixty to 70 per cent of what they produce is bog-standard flat and safety glass where they have no lead over their competitors.' Much higher margins could be obtained from the new types of glass which Pilkington has successfully developed, but 'the technology has never led to profits for shareholders', he says. Mr Leverton's marketing skills could give the group a new direction, helping it to tailor its research towards products which its customers want and adding value to products rather than letting distributors gain the benefit. Another Pilkington obsession is putting down new capacity, which because of the time it takes to build, almost inevitably comes on stream just at the wrong moment in the cycle. Two years ago a new float line, called UK 6, came into production. 'Pilkington should never have built UK 6,' says an analyst. A line in Sweden may be closed, analysts believe, at further cost. Pilkington is also criticised for diversifying into the US contact lens market following the failed BTR bid. Although encouraged by the City of London at the time to attempt to break out of its cyclicality, the purchase of Visioncare, financed through a share issue, is now perceived as a disaster. Any effort to sell at present would mean a large write-off which would make a big dent in the already strained balance sheet. But the first issue analysts want Mr Leverton to tackle is the group's finances. High levels of capital spending, research and development costs and redundancies mean 'the company is bleeding cash', according to one follower. Stockbrokers are forecasting that debt, including finance leases of about Pounds 100m, will total about Pounds 800m by the financial year-end, up from Pounds 659m excluding the finance leases in March. Although much of the debt has been refinanced over the last few months, the group's interest charge will still be poorly covered by operating profits. Pilkington has already sold many of its peripheral assets and there are few remaining saleable, non-core businesses to go. Analysts now feel that Pilkington may have to start cutting into its core. Thus Mr Leverton could face a hostile audience this morning. If he fails to make a good first impression, his task could be all the harder.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Victor Lai] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, May 13 (CNA) -- Former Justice Minister  Shigeto Nagano paid a call on Lin Chin-ching, representative of  the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in Japan,  at Lin's office Friday [13 May] to apologize for his recent  remark that the 1937 "Rape of Nanking" was a "fabrication."    He expressed his deep remorse over any trouble the remark  may  have caused to Taiwan-Japan relations.    The 71-year-old upper house member was forced to resign from  the new Japanese cabinet last week after the MAINICHI SHIMBUN  quoted him as saying the "rape of Nanking was a fabrication" and  that the Pacific war "was not an error." His remarks prompted  severe criticism at home and abroad.    In the meeting with Nagano, Lin expressed the hope that for  the the good of Sino-Japanese relations, all Japanese should be  taught the truth of Japan's militaristic expansion into Asia  before World War II.    Nagano, who once served as chief of staff of the Japan  Ground  Self-Defense Force, has been a member of the upper house for two  terms.</p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Plan for landfill levy angers waste industry A new levy that would raise sharply the cost of putting waste in landfill - licensed rubbish dumps - would be justified on environmental grounds, a report commissioned by the government suggested yesterday. A subsidy for incinerating waste might also be justified says the report, which was prepared by the Centre for Social and Economic Research on the Global Environment at London University. Some incineration schemes can be used to generate energy, reducing the role of coal-burning power stations which pollute the atmosphere. Ministers have been considering for a year whether to introduce a landfill levy to encourage more incineration and recycling of waste. But the waste management industry yesterday criticised the report's calculations and said it would add unnecessarily to industrial costs. According to the report a landfill levy of Pounds 8 a tonne - an increase on present costs of between a quarter and a half - would be needed to reflect the environmental impact fully. Government officials said yesterday this would add about Pounds 800m a year to the costs of industry and local authorities. Mr Steve Webb, policy director of the National Association of Waste Disposal Contractors, said: 'This report does not succeed in setting out the case for a landfill levy, although it would be a nice little revenue earner for the Treasury.' He added that if the government's proposals to tighten regulation of waste management, incorporated in the 1990 Environment Protection Act, were put into practice then landfill costs 'would in any case rise significantly - that is the time to see whether you want to fiddle around with the market'. Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, said yesterday that he was 'very concerned' that the government had postponed introducing the new rules twice this year - no date has yet been set. About 90 per cent of UK waste now goes to landfill, a small amount to recycling, and less than 10 per cent to incineration. The cost of landfill has remained low in the UK compared with continental Europe, partly because the UK has many unfilled quarries left from excavation of building materials.

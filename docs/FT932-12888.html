			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Increase in GDP signals an end to recession BRITAIN yesterday reported the first significant rise in gross domestic product for 2 1/2 years, confirming recent evidence that the country has emerged from one of its longest recessions since the 1940s. The Central Statistical Office said the UK economy grew by 0.2 per cent in the first quarter of 1993, compared with the previous quarter. GDP was 0.6 per cent up on the same period a year ago. Weak oil output in the first two months of 1993 meant non-oil GDP grew more strongly. Excluding oil and gas extraction - 6 per cent of total GDP - output rose by 0.6 per cent on the quarter, to stand 0.6 per cent higher than in the same period of 1992. This was the first significant rise in non-oil GDP for more than two years and the first time since the second quarter of 1990 that both measures of GDP have risen on the previous quarter. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, hailed the figures as the best evidence yet of a broad recovery. 'We are beginning to see the fruits of all the difficult decisions I and the government made over the last couple of years,' he said. 'We had to get inflation down. We have got recovery underway.' Mr John Major, the prime minister, seized on the recovery signs to renew his call to industry to make the most of the 'unparalleled opportunities' offered by the UK's low inflation and interest rates and a competitive exchange rate. The increase in GDP gave weight to other signs that the recession is over, including three consecutive monthly rises in retail sales, an increase in manufacturing output and strong narrow money growth. A survey from the Institute of Directors yesterday showed that business confidence among company directors has reached its highest level for five years. After peaking in the second quarter of 1990, GDP shrank by 3.9 per cent over eight quarters to a trough in the second quarter of 1992. For the next six months, the economy was stagnant. In the 1979-81 recession, output fell by 5.5 per cent, but over only seven quarters. Excluding oil and gas extraction, the economy shrank by 3.8 per cent over seven quarters from a peak in the second quarter of 1990, to a trough in the first quarter of last year. The preliminary figures do not give a thorough breakdown of where growth was generated during the first quarter. However, the CSO said that manufacturing output was estimated to have risen while energy production declined. Service sector output rose 0.5 per cent. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said he hoped the recession was over but added that skills shortages and an investment gap with the UK's competitors could stymie future growth.

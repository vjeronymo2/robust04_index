			<p>BFN     [Text] The enlarged standing committee meeting of the  provincial party committee was held today. Sun Weiben,  secretary of the provincial party committee, presided over the  meeting. The main topics for discussion at this meeting were to  relay the major directives of the central leading comrades for  the work of Heilongjiang Province, report on the basic situation  of the provincial party committee and government's trip to  Beijing to report the province's economic development issues,  relay the guidelines of the central rural work conference,  devise plans for several current tasks on seizing the  opportunity, deepening reform, expanding opening up, promoting  development, and maintaining stability which must be grasped  well.    Members of the standing committee of the provincial party  committee, including Shao Qihui, Ma Guoliang, Tian Fengshan,  Shan Rongfan, Yang Guanghong, Wang Xianmin, Li Qinglin, and Yu  Jingchang, attended the meeting. At the meeting, Shao Qihui,  deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and  provincial governor, relayed the directives given by the central  leading comrades on the work of Heilongjiang. Vice Governor Sun  Kuiwen relayed the guidelines of the central rural work  conference and devised plans for Heilongjiang Province's current  rural work.    Sun Weiben, secretary of the provincial party committee,  gave  an important speech. He said: From the directives of the  central leading comrades, we notice that the central authorities  have been concerned about Heilongjiang's development, fully  realized Heilongjiang's difficulty, affirmed the contributions  of the people in our province and the work ideas of the  provincial party committee and the provincial government,  supported our province to overcome difficulties, and pinned  great hopes on our province.    Sun Weiben said: The guidelines of the speeches of the  central leading comrades have defined an orientation of advance  for building and developing Heilongjiang and for revitalizing  the old industrial base. Sun Weiben pointed out: We must  promote the spirit of keeping the eyes inward, not adopting a  wait-and-see attitude, and making unremitting efforts to improve  oneself among the broad masses of party members, cadres, and the  people, and overcome the difficulties on our way of advance by  deepening reform, expanding opening up, promoting development,  and maintaining stability.    Sun Weiben said: Our province's petroleum, animal husbandry,  coal, grain, and war industries have all witnessed new economic  difficulties. In addition to the factors of improper systems  and structure, and price hike, the most prominent issue is that  we are shackled by the system of larger in size and collective  in nature and three unified managements in enterprises. We  should strive to create a good external environment for these  enterprises, guide them to make unremitting efforts to improve  themselves, deepen reform, change operational mechanism, and  enhance vitality.    Sun Weiben said: Over the past few years, border trade has  developed continuously and become an important channel for  opening the province to the outside world and an important  economic growing point. In order to give further play to this  special advantage of our province and to develop the  international market to alleviate the difficulties in our  economic life, we must further emancipate the mind, decontrol  policies, simplify procedures, and open the green light for  expanding opening up. While making continued efforts to occupy  the CIS markets, we should also implement the strategy of  establishing various markets and actively develop markets in  ROK, Northeast Asia, and east European countries.    Sun Weiben pointed out: To overcome difficulties and to  accelerate development, a task of top priority is to give  prominence to three priorities and grasp two key points. The  three priorities are to implement the guidelines of the recent  central rural work conference and strive to reap a bumper  agricultural harvest this year; exert efforts to invigorate  large and medium-sized enterprises; and promote the project of  establishing township enterprises in other counties. The two key  points are projects and funds. Party committees and governments  at all levels must further emancipate their mind, broaden their  field of vision, and have a stronger sense of drawing support  from other localities to seek development.    Sun Weiben stressed: Under such a difficult situation, we  should all the more try in every possible way to maintain  stability. At present, the key to handling the relations of  reform, development, and stability is to stabilize the market  and commodity prices and to control inflation. Principal  leaders of the party committees and governments at all levels  should personally grasp three affairs well. Prior to the end of  May, they should promote the system of carrying a price tag in  all commodities throughout the province; implement the system of  supervising and controlling the prices of 22 government-set  daily necessities that are essential to the life of residents;  and conduct an overall price inspection among all enterprises,  individual industrial and commercial traders, and scientific  research institutes rendering paid service.    Leading comrades of the provincial people's congress, the  provincial government, the provincial committee of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference, and the provincial  discipline inspection commission, and secretaries of various  prefectural and city party committees attended the meeting as  observers.</p>

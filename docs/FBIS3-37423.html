			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Svetlana Ivanova] </F>   [Text] St.Petersburg February 16 TASS -- Since Wednesday  the yield of the Leningradskaya nuclear power plant near St.  Petersburg will be reduced by 50 per cent. Three reactors are  being discharged, but even under such a fuel-saving regime the  station's fuel reserves may run out in three months.    The plant has no money to buy fuel, because power consumers  do not pay their debts. Moreover, the "Electrostal" works which  produced nuclear fuel for the plant also halted lines -- as its  debtors do not pay either.    The power plant from now on will be able to supply energy  only to St. Petersburg and its region, while other consumers  situated on a vast territory of the north-western part of Russia  are likely to face energy shortages very soon.    It is for the second time this year when the station is on  the verge of stoppage. Early in January it warned it may shut  down reactors as it had no money to buy fuel. Two days later it  received four billion roubles (about three million dollars) out  of the total 34-billion rouble debt from its clients.    The plant's administration, however, warned that the four  billion roubles would not last for long.</p>

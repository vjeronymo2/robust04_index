The Y&hyph;12 Plant, which is part of the DOE-owned Oak Ridge Reservation, located 20 miles west of Knoxville, Tennessee, has had a mission to store HEU since the World War II era. Since 1964, HEU used in the production of nuclear weapons was recycled from HEU stockpiled at the Y&hyph;12 Plant. Because the United States has now ceased production of nuclear weapons, DOE must hold its excess HEU in storage until a decision on long-term disposition is made by an interagency task force recently formed by President Clinton. The Department of Energy will also discuss its overall nuclear materials storage and disposition planning activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of this meeting is to provide the State of Tennessee and other stakeholders an opportunity to discuss the EA and the Department's long-term plans for disposition of special nuclear materials. All interested and affected individuals are invited to participate in the public meeting which will be held at the Pollard Auditorium, Oak Ridge Associated Universities, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Thursday, March 24, 1994. During the morning and afternoon sessions (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.) the Department proposes to discuss the EA and its nuclear materials disposition activities. During the evening session (6 p.m. to 9 p.m.) the morning and afternoon sessions will be summarized and the public will have further opportunity to ask questions and discuss the EA. Department of Energy officials from Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Headquarters in Washington, DC, will be present at each of the sessions to answer questions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0065 forcenewline --> 0 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Susan D.

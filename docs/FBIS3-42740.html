			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Address by Mircea Snegur on 10 January at the republic </F> conference on forthcoming parliamentary elections]    [Text] Ladies and gentlemen, my esteemed audience!    The new year of 1994 is closely associated with elections to  the new Parliament of Moldova. It was specifically this event of  historical significance in the socio-political life of the  republic that compelled me to insist on the conduct of this  conference at the start of the year. The chairman of Parliament,  the prime minister, chairman of the Supreme Court, chairman of  the Central Electoral Commission, procurator of the republic,  members of government, heads of state departments, section  chiefs, state office managers, presidential counselors, chairmen  of rayon executive committees, city mayors, Chisinau municipal  authorities, as well as representatives of the mass media were  invited and kindly agreed to attend.    Under specifics of the first parliamentary elections on a  multiple-party basis my constitutional duties as president of  the republic require a firm and clear-cut formulation of a  position with regard to the forthcoming election campaign.    The four years that passed since the previous parliamentary  elections were probably the most troubling and difficult times  in our contemporary history. Despite political instability which  evolved into an armed conflict on the Dniester, we nevertheless  managed to move along the path toward creation of a Republic of  Moldova in the world as an independent state, establish  cooperation with a number of countries of the world, begin the  realization of a strategy of economic reform which received the  endorsement and support of international forums, and institute a  reform of the political system of society within the overall  concept of democratization.    It is known that to a great extent political life in various  countries of the world consists of the struggle for power. The  electoral marathon is also a confrontation between parties and  political formations, which in the final analysis culminates  with the coming to power of those who manage to garner the votes  with the most convincing program.    The flourishing of highly developed countries is not and  cannot be the fruit of work done by a single individual, perhaps  even one who is highly intelligent. It is, first of all, based  on competitiveness, and true and free competition of ideas and  programs. It is specifically this that assures the stimulation  and liberation of the thinking and creativity and labor of the  free man. But competition as such cannot be considered in the  world of today without a clearly defined selection of principles  and laws establishing rigid rules of the game and ensuring  control over its conduct in accordance with the situation. We  find ourselves in that stage at the very start of the path. In  essence that is our first step today on the way toward election  of the new Parliament on a multiple-party basis.    The manner in which we comprehend and evaluate the  importance  of state organs ensuring equal conditions for all candidates who  take part in this competition will to a great degree determine  not only the course of the election and activity of the new  Parliament, but also the degree of faith in the government among  voters with regard to its ability to comply with democratic  principles on the whole. In the end that will shape the image of  our country in the world as a law-governed democratic state.    No matter how contradictory and sometimes even antagonistic  the various election programs and ideas and strategies are to  each other, some of which we already know and which are still to  be announced to the parties, slates of candidates, and  independent candidates, it is important not to forget that they  are promulgated and propagandized by the sons and daughters of  the people of this land, by our countrymen. It therefore follows  that they must be studied tactfully and patiently and either  adopted or rejected only by the citizens here, in our republic.  It is in our interest to have this election campaign proceed in  a worthy manner, wisely, in an atmosphere of tolerance.    I particularly wish to stress the duty of responsible  managers and state organs at all levels to prevent, interdict,  and decisively deal with all attempts to win a parliamentary  mandate through the fanning of hatred and enmity toward  brothers, as well as toward representatives of other  nationalities, regardless of which side these attempts are  coming from.    A special place during this period is allotted to the mass  media. Its persuasive powers and role in the molding of public  opinion are well known. Under certain conditions it could be  decisive. Its contributions and dedication to the illumination  of various turning points of critical significance in the past  four years, for which it deserves respect and our gratitude,  serve as convincing proof of that. I hope that during the  election campaign which has already started the journalists will  help voters separate the grain from the chaff, as Ion Drutse  said.    No great effort is required in order to distinguish the good  from the bad. Everyone does that instinctively. It is far more  complicated, particularly under our conditions, to propose  clearly and precisely what should be done and together with whom  for the common good. In that regard I would like to call on  everyone, and primarily on figures in the cultural field and  writers, to jointly think about the following question: how is  it that in the past two years we allowed ourselves to be  brazenly and hypocritically called "a republic of two  sheep-folds and three districts," "a stillborn infant," "a  spectral republic of Bolsheviks-separatists," "the CIS jungle,"  "Snegur's whim," and so on? I know that this is not just my own  pain, and that its elimination is found in the clear and  decisive position of those who stand for the statehood of the  republic, a position which must be proclaimed in a loud voice  and not in a whisper.    We have forever been not only at the cross-roads of European  geographical roads, but also in a space where the interests of  large continental powers met and clashed, because of which we  have constantly suffered. The empires established their regimes  here, one more drastic than the other. Their cruelty and greed  left a deep imprint on the soul, memory, and consciousness of  generations. The sacrifices of our ancestors placed on the altar  of our still fragile freedom are too great and abundant in order  not to learn the lesson of history on this occasion as well. Are  we going to allow the wheel of history to crush us just because  some want to accelerate the speed at which it turns, while  others wish to stop it? Perhaps it is time to roll up the  sleeves and start laying the foundation of an edifice of  integrity and prosperity, stone by stone, in a conscientious and  diligent manner, leaving to the mercy of God those who have no  other desire than to affix their name to it.    I am counting on the consciousness and sense of high civic  responsibility among representatives of the mass media, hoping  that their thoughts on the electoral marathon will include these  aspects as well.    In connection with what was said above I would like to state  the following:    First. The constitution of our country obligates the  president of the republic to involve himself in the election  campaign in the most direct manner when it takes place on the  multiple-party basis. I swore on the Bible to be the guarantor  of rights and freedoms of all citizens, which is specifically  stated in Article 113 of the constitution of the Republic of  Moldova. That is why I firmly intend to promote the conduct of  elections under the most optimal conditions, calling on the  voters to give their votes to those who firmly endorse statehood  and independence of the Republic of Moldova.    Second. I have supported, support now, and will continue to  support parties and socio-political formations which have  conducted, are now conducting, and will continue to conduct a  policy directed at the establishment of our state--the Republic  of Moldova--as a sovereign and independent state, without any  conditions or varying interpretations. Such a position clearly  corresponds with my presidential election platform, toward which  the electorate has clearly expressed its attitude.    I am for those who have supported, now support, and will  continue supporting the integrity of the republic through  concrete action. I call on the electorate to follow my example  in voting for those who offer and will prove able to implement  into life clear-cut programs and concepts that would permit us  to eliminate the economic crisis, while guaranteeing stable  progress in creative and interested work of free people.    In the new Parliament I want to see deputies who can rise  above the vestiges and political configurations, who would be  guided in their work by higher values and interests of the  people, would come up with realistic and concrete proposals so  that people who have lived for centuries in peace and harmony on  both banks of the Dniester, could finally make peace with each  other.    Third. If in the first election campaign on a multiple-party  basis we succeed in ensuring clear-cut observance of democratic  principles of equality and freedom for all parties, slates of  candidates, socio-political movements, and independent  candidates, we will thereby promote an irreversible process of  democratization of society, and that will allow us to prove to  ourselves and to the entire world that we have mastered one of  the most necessary attributes of a law-governed and democratic  state.    Four. In this period the task of organs of state executive  power at all levels consists of guaranteeing to an equal degree  to all parties, socio-political formations, slates of  candidates, and independent candidates the necessary conditions  for conduct of the electoral campaign in strict conformance with  the law on election of the Parliament of the Republic of  Moldova. These tasks are explained in detail in the edict of the  president of the republic.    Five. I am expressing confidence in the fact that residents  on the left bank of the Dniester have finally recognized who it  was that wanted, how, and for what purpose to split us up and  what must be done by everyone in order to prevent each vote in  the election of the Parliament from being blocked by those who  do not wish for us to live in peace and harmony as we have done  for centuries.    My esteemed audience! I would like for us to understand and  remember another simple truth: before saying who we are, what it  is that we want, and where we are headed, we must first of all  exist. All the other disasters in our life cannot even be  compared with the real threat hanging over us today when just a  few hundred kilometers from us in the direction of the Adriatic  Sea the merciless fires of war are raging which the whole world  is powerless to extinguish. That is a tragedy which we too had  experienced recently. It is our sacred duty not to forget that.    In conclusion I would like to appeal directly to those  beyond  the walls of this building: esteemed lady, esteemed gentleman,  all those who are listening to me right now or are reading my  speech in the newspaper, stop for a moment, rise above the  mundane and understand that to participate in the elections on  27 February and to vote for those who prove that they truly can  transform Moldova into an independent and sovereign state not  just for a day or two, first of all means assurance of the right  to life both for yourself and for your children, brothers,  sisters, and parents and the right to engage in creative labor  for the good of the people and our country--the Republic of  Moldova.    Thank you.</p>

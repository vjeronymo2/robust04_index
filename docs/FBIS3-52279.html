			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Said Saadi, secretary general of the Rally </F> for Culture and Democracy in Algeria, by correspondent Muriel  Pomponne; date and place not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] Our guest this evening in the second part of  Afrique Soir is Said Saadi, the secretary general of the Rally  for Culture and Democracy [RCD], in Algeria. Said Saadi has  recently set up a new movement, the Movement for the Republic  [Mouvement pour la Republique] in order to advocate an ideal  that is different from that of the Islamists. [passage omitted]    [Pomponne] You are a priori rather against a dialogue with  Islamists who are said to be moderate.    [Saadi] I do not know many. Those said to be moderate have  aligned themselves with the stance of the extremists; it is a  movement of extremists that falls within the framework of  violence and is a movement that necessarily tends toward  one-upmanship. Anyone who wants to be relatively moderate is  condemned by the very dynamism of this movement. Kebir, who was  said to be the soft version of the fundamentalist movement has  recently been obliged to join the stances of armed groups in  order to stay in the race. It is not I who reject the debate,  unfortunately it is the fundamentalists, who, for the moment,  slit throats and kill, and it is the only form of communication  they choose to address the people. It cuts short any form of  speculation. Dialogue is a will to respect the life of others  first and their ideas second. This has never been the intention  of fundamentalists.    [Pomponne] Is this the way you analyze, for instance, the  communique published by the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS]  recently, which advocates the continuation of the armed struggle?    [Saadi] This communique has only one interest: It is the  first time that the FIS, which was said to be a political  organization, that up to now has not followed armed action and  acts of violence in general, has ended up by advocating this  bloody demonstration that it has imposed on the country. I  personally have never believed in the slightest possibility of  an organized evolution of the FIS, even as political  authorities. I was often in prison with them, I know all their  officials, and I know exactly what they are planning to do.  [passage omitted]    [Pomponne] You said that you think that the Army could play  a  more important role. According to you, what is the role it must  and can play?    [Saadi] I have not said that the Army could play a more  important role. The Army already plays an important role and  has been doing so since 1962, the date of independence. I say  that I did not know whether the Army could now adapt to change  well, when the matter is not simply a military operation. The  Algerian crisis is not military but is above all political.  Will the Army take the positions it should in very complicated  situations? Will it handle the current situation; knowing that  up to now it has already found people who use it as a front, as  a political shop window, while keeping power. I do not think  that this scenario is now possible.    [Pomponne] What do you want it to do?    [Saadi] That the Army remains a republican institution that  shoulders completely the republican state whose institutions it  has the duty to defend and not to make.</p>

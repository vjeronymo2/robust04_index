			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Bossi in tough tussle for power Mr Umberto Bossi, the leader of the populist Northern League, looks set to place further hurdles in the path of the early formation of a new Italian government by Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate. Mr Bossi has announced he intends to hold discussions in Rome tomorrow with Mr Mario Segni, head of the referendum movement and the leader of the centrist Italian Pact. He has also hinted that these discussions could involve other parties outside Mr Berlusconi's Freedom Alliance, which won last week's general elections. 'I want to listen to what these people have to say about programmes of government: not just gossip,' he said at the weekend. In talking to the Italian Pact, which won 46 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, Mr Bossi is trying to raise the stakes with Mr Berlusconi. From starting out as conciliatory in the wake of the elections, Mr Bossi is now embarked on a collision course with Mr Berlusconi. First he snubbed Mr Berlusconi by deliberately not attending a meeting on Friday between the League and the media magnate's Forza Italia. The first Mr Berlusconi heard of Mr Bossi's absence was when he arrived at League headquarters in Milan. Then over the weekend Mr Bossi announced his intended round of meetings in Rome, from a mountain holiday retreat, and raised once again his objection to Mr Berlusconi assuming the premiership. These moves by Mr Bossi are seen as tactics to boost his bargaining position in a future Berlusconi government and head off opposition from the grassroots of his party angry over any linkage with the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance. But the League leader risks seriously embarrassing Mr Berlusconi if he continues in this vein and threatens to complicate the task of forming a new government. At the same time, there are increasing signs of irritation from Mr Gianfranco Fini, the leader of the MSI. He made clear over the weekend that Mr Berlusconi and Mr Bossi could not organise a deal to form a government without the full inclusion of the MSI, the third party to the Freedom Alliance. In particular, Mr Fini is irritated by suggestions of the League and Forza Italia accepting a rewritten constitution with a strongly federalist structure for the new Italy. Faced with these problems, Mr Berlusconi chose to adopt a low profile during the Easter holidays. He was advised by an editorial in Il Giornale, his most supportive newspaper, to move more cautiously. The paper pointed out that the first step was for the new parliament to reassemble on April 15 and only thereafter could President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro begin to consider asking him to form a government.</p>

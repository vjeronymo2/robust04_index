			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: M&amp;G's fee surprise M&amp;G is eliminating the 4.5 per cent initial charge on its Managed Income fund personal equity plan and will introduce 'back end' charges instead. It is leaving its 1.5 per cent annual fee unchanged. Peps allow investors to shelter up to Pounds 6,000 in a general plan during a tax year and a further Pounds 3,000 in a single company plan, free of income and capital gains tax. The tax benefits of a Pep have to be weighed against the charges which plan managers levy. Since M&amp;G is the largest Pep provider, the move is bound to heat up an already competitive market. Explaining the reasons for removing the initial charge, marketing director Peter Emms said: 'We believe that as well as providing good value, this move will make the Managed Income Pep a more straightforward investment and, thereby, provide an added attraction to people who have never invested in a Pep.' Those who are used to deposit-based investments can be put off when they see that their initial investment of, say, Pounds 1,000, would fall to Pounds 955 as soon as they made the Pep investment. M&amp;G is hoping to make the Pep more attractive by investing the full Pounds 1,000 and imposing early withdrawal fees instead. These are common in the US and were introduced for the first time on a UK Pep by Fidelity 18 months ago. Since equities are a long-term investment, back-end charges are a better idea than initial charges for investors; by holding on to the Pep for long enough - usually only five years - it is possible to escape the charge altogether. Those who sell their M&amp;G Managed Income fund Pep within the first year of taking it out will have to pay a 4.5 per cent charge, which falls to 4 per cent in the second year. The charge drops by 1 percentage point each successive year, so that those selling in the fifth year of investment will not face one at all. Under present rules, unit trusts cannot impose an exit fee, but this is not the case under Pep regulations. Although this is the first initial Pep charge reduction by M&amp;G, plenty of other investment houses have implemented reductions. When M&amp;G launched the fund last February, Cazenove and Fidelity also released high income funds, both with lower charges. The Cazenove Bond Utility fund had an initial charge of only 0.2 per cent and an annual fee of 0.5 per cent, although those wanting to hold the fund in Pep form paid a further initial charge of Pounds 35. The initial charge for Fidelity's High Income fund was 2 per cent, in line with the front-end reduction it had introduced several months earlier, although the annual charge remained relatively high at 1.25 per cent. The initial charge on Murray Johnstone's unit trust Pep is 1 per cent; at Gartmore, it is 2 per cent (Gartmore's UK index fund, which tracks the FT-A All-Share Index, has no initial charge and a 0.5 per cent annual charge). Scottish Equitable replaced the initial 5 per cent charge on its Peps with a flat-fee of Pounds 45 plus VAT, and introduced withdrawal charges for those who sell in the first five years. But it also imposed an annual Pep fee of 0.875 per cent on top of its annual management fee. Among investment trusts, Touche Remnant's Smaller Companies Pep has no front-end or annual fees. Martin Currie has flat-fee Peps, based on four of its investment trusts. Although cutting the initial charge does not eliminate the bid-offer spread, it will be reduced to only 0.5 per cent (the level of stamp duty) in M&amp;G's case. M&amp;G says it has not yet decided whether to remove the initial charge on Peps in its other funds. It says it chose the Managed Income fund because this has been its most popular Pep. At the end of November, 10 months after its launch, the Pep had pulled in Pounds 95m. The performance of all three income funds launched last February has been similar. In the six months to December 1, M&amp;G Managed Income and Cazenove's Utility &amp; Bond fund have grown by 13.6 per cent, while Fidelity's High Income fund has increased by 12.6 per cent (offer to offer, income re-invested; source: Hardwick Stafford Wright). In the end, performance is more important than charges. But if two fund managers are equally good, the one who runs the fund with the lower charges will provide a better return to the investor.</p>

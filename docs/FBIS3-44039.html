Our Nampula correspondent says the  withdrawal was ordered by the regional Cease-Fire Subcommission  following a decision made by the Cease-Fire Commission. [CCF]  The withdrawal was supervised by the United Nations and  monitored by government and Mozambique National Resistance  [Renamo] representatives.    The troops were deployed in Sangage by the Angoche District  Military Command. A communique issued by the regional  Cease-Fire Subcommission says the decision to deploy the troops  was designed to ensure order as Renamo moved its forces in the  area. Meanwhile, Major Mario Semo, head of the government  delegation to the CCF- Northern Region, said Sangage has never  been disputed by the government or Renamo.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "bor": "The Confederation of Trade Unions Has </F> Ceased To Be a Guarantor of Social Peace"]    [Excerpt] Bratislava--At a meeting of the Council of  Economic and Social Accord (known as the Tripartite Council)  last week, the trade unionists withdrew from the General  Agreement for 1994. Before yesterday's extraordinary Assembly  of the Confederation of Trade Unions (KOZ), it was rumored that  some trade union leaders disagree with this step.    Yesterday, KOZ changed its original statement and, in a  statement of the KOZ Assembly that was, according to KOZ Vice  President Vladimir Stevko, approved "by all chairmen of  indiviudal trade unions, with one or two exceptions," it  declared: "On the basis of the nonfulfillment of the General  Agreement by the Slovak Government in the preceding years, KOZ  of the Slovak Republic regards the continuing nonfulfillment of  the General Agreement for 1994 as a reason for KOZ to cease  being a guarantor of social peace." As KOZ representatives  specified at a subsequent news conference, the statement does  not imply any immediate organizing of strikes or demonstrations.  A decision on specific steps should be made by the next  assembly, which will be held next week. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LBOS OUT ON A LIMB, WITH CYCLICAL BREEZES BLOWING;  </P> <P> MARKETS: THIS MONTH'S PANIC WAS A STRIKE AGAINST A FINANCIAL SECTOR THAT SEEMS  TO PUSH TOO HARD FOR MORE BORROWING.  </P> <P> The 1987 stock market crash occurred while the world's central banks were busy  propping up the dollar, thereby applying tremendous pressure to push up U.S.  interest rates and cool an overheating economy.  </P> <P> This month's Friday the 13th panic was superficially a muted version of the  1987 crash, but the fundamentals were very different.  </P> <P> After April, 1988, the Federal Reserve began to withdraw some liquidity from  the U.S. banking system, resuming its attempt to slow inflation. The Fed's  effort kept interest rates at a higher level, drawing in billions of dollars of  capital from abroad. The attraction of U.S. capital markets has become so  strong that so far in 1989, central banks have spent $50 billion trying to keep  the dollar from appreciating.  </P> <P> At the end of September, frustrated by what they considered a "too strong"  dollar, finance ministers of the industrial democracies tried to engineer a  further drop in the dollar. After two weeks of concerted dollar selling, they  gave up -- and tried to underscore their determination to weaken the dollar by  raising interest rates in Europe and Japan.  </P> <P> Now comes the interesting part that precipitated the 7% stock market plunge on  Oct. 13. The U.S. stock market has for the past year been driven almost  exclusively by leveraged buyouts and rumors of leveraged buyouts. A leveraged  buyout occurs when a group of outside investors offers to buy up the stock of a  company with money raised by issuing junk bonds. Junk bonds carry high yields  because they are riskier than government bonds, which yield about two-thirds as  much. Since the interest on junk bonds is deductible, some companies find it  attractive to switch from stock or equity financing to debt financing.  </P> <P> The first firms subject to LBOs were not so vulnerable to cyclical forces and  therefore were better able to bear the risk of a constant need to pay interest  on high-yield bonds. Typically, companies dealing in food or other staples were  good candidates.  </P> <P> As the stock market was coming back after the 1987 crash, awash in liquidity  provided by central banks understandably anxious to avoid a 1929-style debacle,  the best takeover candidates were snapped up. Lately, takeover managers have  turned to riskier, cyclical companies like UAL, Resorts International, Hilton,  the Campeau retailing empire and Ramada Inns. As far as the takeover artists  were concerned, these companies had a lot of equity on their balance sheets and  therefore were good targets for leveraged buyouts financed by junk bonds.  </P> <P> But by late summer of 1989, things began to change. Signs of a weaker U.S.  economy began to appear. The Group of Seven's attempts to push down the U.S.  dollar in the foreign exchange markets eventually resulted in higher interest  rates in Europe and Japan. Leveraged buyouts began to run into difficulty late  in September. On Oct. 13, the leveraged buyout deal for UAL was put on hold by  American and Japanese banks. Stock traders decided to sell some of their  exposure, a perfectly normal response to difficulties with LBOs. However, late  on Friday afternoon, no one was willing to buy the shares of UAL, and in the  ensuing panic the stock market dropped by almost 200 points, or 7%.  </P> <P> The American and Japanese banks, with some coaching from our Federal Reserve  and Japan's Ministry of Finance, had decided that they did not want to push  aggressively on a deal that involved a sharp increase in borrowing in a highly  cyclical industry. Many felt that the U.S. economy was headed for a recession  or at least sharply lower profits. Further, it turns out that American  money-center banks now have more exposure to junk bonds than they do to Third  World debt. Memories of the painful experience with that debt no doubt prompted  top management in American banks to back away from the UAL deal and other  similarly shaky leveraged buyouts.  </P> <P> Friday the 13th provided a chilling reminder of the reason why cyclical  companies don't have much debt on their balance sheets. When the economy slows  down, they probably won't be able to make interest payments.  </P> <P> The panic was strike two against a financial sector that seems to take its turn  at bat as an opportunity to push too hard for more borrowing. The LBO wave has  performed a service by restructuring some balance sheets and keeping management  on its toes, but for now it is largely over.  </P> <P> We had better hope that, while pulling itself back together, the financial  sector does not start setting itself up for a third strike by pushing too hard  for more debt financing. If that happens, we will be headed for a global market  crash that won't be over until the financial sector of the world gets around to  reconnecting itself with the real economy.  </P></p>

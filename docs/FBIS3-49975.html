Movement orders addressed to the refugee "reservists" began  arriving by mail 10 days ago, Montenegro Social Democratic Party  official Milorad Raznjatovic said here. The call-up is being  carried out in collaboration with the rump Yugoslav army and the  Montenegro police, Raznjatovic said. Movement orders received  by one refugee, sent by the "defence ministry" of the  self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb republic, instructed him to report  to a Yugoslav army barracks in Tivat, Montenegro, "in order to  fulfil his military obligations in the Serbian republic army,"  he said.    Should the draftee fail to report, he will be "questioned,"  the orders specify. Bosnian Serb authorities are apparently  well-informed about the refugees in Montenegro, Raznjatovic  said, as the movement orders were correctly addressed to each  refugee. The head of the Montenegro Refugee Commission, Djordje  Scepanovic, denied any collaboration with Bosnian Serb  authorities. "The forced call-up of refugees by the country  they fled from is forbidden by the Geneva Convention on  refugees," Scepanovic told AFP.    The Bosnian Serb forces have often called on the refugees to  enlist, but "on a voluntary basis, not by call-up orders and  warnings," he said. The movement orders call on the refugees to  serve in Herzegovina, in southeast Bosnia-Herzegovina, where the  Bosnian Serb army is fighting to take control of Olovo, a  strategic site north of Sarajevo on the route to Tuzla  [geographical information as received].</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by A. Thomson] </F>   [Text] Durban April 7 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP]  National Chairman Dr Frank Mdlalose on Thursday called on  African National Congress President Nelson Mandela to distance  himself from what he called inflammatory remarks by former  president of the ANC Youth League, Peter Mokaba. An IFP  statement said Mr Mokaba had called IFP president Mr Mangosuthu  Buthelezi a "coward" and a "criminal" in remarks on radio on  Thursday morning.    Dr Mdlalose said: "These statements are an outrage. They  are inflammatory and defamatory and are clearly designed to  scupper tomorrow's (Friday's) summit meeting between ourselves,  the ANC and the government. We call on Mr Mandela to distance  himself and his movement from these highly offensive remarks  uttered by Mr Mokaba. He can demonstrate a commitment to peace  and success in tomorrow's talks by formally withdrawing the  remarks".</p>

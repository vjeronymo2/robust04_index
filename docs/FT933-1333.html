			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Wm Morrison Chill winds from the north blew through the food retailing sector yesterday and knocked another 5 per cent from Tesco and Sainsbury's share prices. William Morrison's interim figures showed just how pressure on margins is increasing with turnover up by almost 20 per cent and profits up by barely 5. Equally alarming was the company's acknowledgement that consumers are trading down, and that Morrison will respond with lower margins. The message for those superstore operators who have paid up to twice what Morrison has forked out on a typical site is clear. Returns on capital employed - which the grocers have long argued are not excessive - seem about to turn distinctly sour. Aggressive pricing of branded products may also intensify as manufacturers respond to weak sales with price cuts, exacerbating the deflation of superstores' turnover and profits. As share prices fall, however, the search for value starts. Morrison is particularly badly placed since its miserly 1 per cent yield offers little defence. Even with most of the profits retained in the business, there will be a cash outflow over the next year to pay for the 'unabated' store opening programme and new distribution facilities. On that basis, Tesco's 20 per cent yield premium to the market ought to offer some comfort. Yet its higher cost base and the suspicion that the fall in gross margins has only just begun will weight heavy. Even mighty Sainsbury's sub-market yield looks under threat. Sainsbury has always looked immune to the sector's troubles. But until yesterday, that was true of Morrison, too.</p>

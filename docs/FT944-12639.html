			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Companies plan policy shift over directors Listed companies plan to make more use of non-executive directors and already increasingly use them in important meetings and on powerful committees, according to a survey published yesterday. Nearly 600 big companies were asked by Pro Ned, the employment agency for non-executives, and the Board for Chartered Accountants in Business, about their attitudes to non-executives and the work they do. The survey concluded: 'Britain's major listed companies are leading a trend towards a more professional and hard-nosed approach to the selection and use of non-executive directors.' More than 80 per cent of the companies said they expected non-executives to be more active and spend more time understanding the company's business in the future. There are still some indications that the old system lives on, however. About 60 per cent of chairman admit their last non-executive appointment was made through personal connections. In contrast more than 40 per cent expect that their approach will change with their next appointment and that the search for non-executives is now more rigorous.</p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Markets: Conjuring up confidence is hard to do - London Markets / Andrew Bolger examines the City's cautious reaction to the Autumn Statement THE Chancellor of the Exchequer warned us recently he was no magician, able to pull rabbits out of the hat. The roars of approval from his backbenchers which greeted the Autumn Statement suggested relief that at least he had not produced a mouse. Yet the City's reaction to Norman Lamont's ingeniously crafted package was notably muted. True, the FTSE 100 closed 29.6 points higher on Thursday - within 12 points of its post-election high in April - but the index dropped 7.4 points from the level it reached before the Chancellor started to speak. After yesterday's 28.9 point fall, the FTSE closed 5.2 points down on a week which was meant to be make-or-break for the government's economic policy. One reason for the market's caution was that the one percentage point cut in base rates had already been factored into share prices. More fundamentally, there was little faith among equity analysts that this week's measures would make the difference between recession and recovery. There is a degree of fatalism about this: it may be that the combination of the 13 per cent devaluation since sterling left the ERM in September, and subsequent reductions in borrowing costs, will prove enough to get the British economy moving again. If not, Lamont's bag of tricks is unlikely to turn the tide. Stuart Aspinall, of Panmure Gordon, said: 'It is not a question of 'too much' or 'too little', but very much a question of 'Is it too late?'. The Chancellor produced about as much as anyone could reasonably expect. Now we have to sit back, cross our fingers and hope that descent into the second leg of recession/depression can be quickly turned round. 'All the forecasts - the Treasury's, mine, and everyone else's - are based on the wishful thinking that the debt depression of the large minority will be overcome by the increased well-being of the majority. The forecasts all assume an imminent return to growth. It may be right, but it is a brave assumption.' It is in any case easy to overstate the impact of lever-pulling by the government. The accompanying chart shows how sharply interest rates have moved in the last six years. However, following the stock market's boom and bust in 1987, the FTSE 100 has largely gone sideways over the same period, once allowance is made for inflation. Most shareholders have enjoyed a steady stream of dividend income, as well as maintained the real value of their investment, but there are clear signs that these salad days for dividends may be over. The week started with the annual conference of the Confederation of British Industry, which rivalled a Labour Party gathering for its scathing criticism of government and City attitudes towards business. Speaker after speaker said Britain must learn from competitors and retain a larger proportion of profits for re-investment. Companies have already started lowering dividends to reflect the ravages of the downturn, but the tone of the CBI gathering suggests many more will do so next year. A cut in dividend income spells bad news for pension funds, which are the leading institutional investors in the UK stock market. Companies which enjoyed pension holidays for much of the 1980s may have to resume paying pension contributions out of profits, just when those profits are under most pressure. Against this uneasy background, some of the week's best performances came not from recovery stocks but boring old utilities. Anglian and Northumbrian kicked off the reporting season by water companies, but the whole sector was lifted when a regulatory statement was judged to pose no threat to continuing dividend growth and security. British Telecommunications shares also performed well, in spite of reporting a 36 per fall in interim profits to Pounds 1.03bn. The shortfall was mainly caused by redundancy charges of Pounds 442m, reflecting a cut of 33,500 in BT's workforce since the start of the financial year. BT said 'the first signs of a slight improvement may have been perceptible.' General Accident and Royal Insurance cheered the market with figures suggesting that these two composite (general and life) insurers are at last battling through a period which has seen heavy losses from mortgage indemnity policies, motor and householders' business. Boots, the retail and pharmaceutical chain, was apparently ill-rewarded for 15 per cent growth in its interim pre-tax profits by a 2 per cent drop in its share price. The group's chemist shops continued to increase their margins, but the shares suffered from profit-taking after a good run ahead of the figures. Apart from Lamont's prediction of 1 per cent growth next year, which several analysts considered to be optimistic, most City concern focused on the government's ballooning public sector borrowing requirement. This is due to the recession both lowering tax receipts and increasing the demand for benefit payments. Government borrowing is now expected to total Pounds 37bn in 1993, compared with an estimate of Pounds 28m made as recently as the March Budget. The Treasury suggests the figure could rise to Pounds 44bn in 1993, but sceptics in the City would add about another Pounds 10bn. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said: 'The PSBR is through the roof and heading higher. Coupled with a mighty balance of payments deficit, something unpleasant is bound to happen at some stage. But the Chancellor is is no mood or position to take preventive measures.' The government faces no immediate problem in the gilts market, but next year it may have to be selling bonds at the rate of Pounds 1bn a week - which will require the buying power of international funds. That may prove difficult if this week's package proves to have been achieved at the cost of storing up long-term problems - such as the public-sector pay freeze, or the level of next spring's council tax. The accident-proneness of the government has been well established in recent months. But it would not do to underestimate the self-destructive capacity of an administration which this week yet again shot itself through the foot  -this time with embargoed equipment meant for export to Iraq.</p>

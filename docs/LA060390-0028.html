			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT BUSH RENEWS CHINA'S FAVORED-NATION TRADING STATUS  </P> <P> President Bush blew it this time! And your editorial ("Just More Champagne for  Beijing?" May 25) endorsing his decision to extend most-favored-nation status  to China demonstrates a shocking lack of understanding as to what drives  revolutionary reforms.  </P> <P> The incredible changes we see throughout the world are driven not by  ideological desires, but by the bread-and-butter economics of everyday  survival.  </P> <P> The Soviets and their former Eastern European allies are moving towards reform  because their economies are bankrupt after 40 years of pursuing the unworkable  policies of Marxist economics. The changes in South Africa are not the result  of the sudden enlightenment of President Frederik de Klerk as to the inherent  justice of racial equality and human rights, but rather, the reforms are a  recognition that his country is economically isolated and an international  pariah.  </P> <P> History shows that U.S. trade policies have little to do with the concerns of  common citizens. By extending MFN status to China, President Bush, his  statements to the contrary notwithstanding, sends the message that the U.S. is  prepared to accept the status quo and "do business" with those currently in  power. By denying the Chinese government this much-sought plum of international  trade, our government could have sped the process by which the Chinese  themselves seek to reform their nation.  </P> <P> The truest axiom in the world today is that the need for economic reform drives  political reform, not the other way around.  </P> <P> DREW J. PHILLIPS  </P> <P> Carson  </P></p>

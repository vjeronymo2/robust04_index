			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of Brazil (1): Critical year ahead on path to reform  -While government and the economy lurch from one mini-crisis to the next, underlying changes within Brazil will ensure the country's slow advance towards modernity Reforming Brazil often seems like mountaineering. Each peak that is conquered simply reveals another, bigger problem ahead. Although the country has made considerable progress in opening its economy and political system in the past five years, the scale of what remains to be done is still daunting. This year will be critical. Presidential and general elections in October offer the chance to renew the impetus for change. The government of President Itamar Franco, who took office following the resignation amid corruption charges of Mr Fernando Collor in 1992, lacks congressional support and is increasingly having to act as a caretaker regime. A package of reforms to tackle inflation, now close to 50 per cent a month, is due to lead to a new currency from July 1. Inflation is likely to fall sharply, at least to begin with. But spending pressures on the government in an election year are intense, and there are mounting fears that inflation will creep into the new currency, Brazil's fifth since 1986. Mr Collor, the first democratically elected president since the military takeover in 1964, left a mixed legacy. He is now extremely unpopular, but most Brazilians agree that his removal strengthened the political system because it showed that institutional checks and balances could work, and that public opinion is increasingly important. Likewise, although his economic policies contributed to a deep recession, his moves to open the economy forced the private sector to compete, and are now showing substantial benefits. After zero or negative growth since 1989, the economy last year grew at about 5 per cent to take gross domestic product to Dollars 432bn - slightly behind China but ahead of Russia in US dollar terms. Most of the increase came from the industrial sector, especially carmakers, where there have been marked improvements in productivity. In the first half of last year, private sector manufacturing productivity indices increased 18 per cent, reflecting the strength of companies which survived the recession, and the reductions in their payrolls. Growth this year is forecast to reach 3-4 per cent, but is extremely uncertain owing to the introduction of the new currency. Growth rates pale into insignificance, however, alongside inflation, which reached 2,500 per cent last year, and which is mainly responsible both for Brazil's very low investment rate of 16 per cent of GDP and for one of the world's worst income distributions. Mr Rubens Ricupero, finance minister, says that without economic stabilisation 'there's no salvation'. 'Stabilisation is not an end in itself, but a pre-condition for Brazil to recognise its problems and deal with them,' he says. The latest anti-inflation plan has won wide support from economists because it concentrates on the economy's main problem, a lack of confidence in the government's ability to balance its budget. Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the former finance minister who resigned in March to run for the presidency, negotiated a budget through Congress which was balanced, thanks to swingeing spending cuts, especially in investment, and optimistic estimates of tax and social security revenues. The next step will be the introduction of the new currency, the Real. Future monetary and exchange rate policy will not be announced until next month, but it seems likely the Real will be linked at parity to the US dollar, at least to begin with, and backed by Brazil's more than Dollars 30bn foreign exchange reserves. However, the country's powerful industrial lobby will squeal if the new currency becomes overvalued against the dollar, as happened in Argentina's stabilisation. If inflation continues in the Real, gradual devaluation is likely. Monetary policy will have to be kept extremely tight, especially in the first few months but there are already growing electoral pressures to increase spending. Several federal and state banks, which benefit from inflation and use the profits to cover losses from non-performing and often politically-inspired loans, would face severe problems if inflation fell. The government may not risk closing down these banks so close to elections and the far-from-independent central bank may instead be pressured to support them, thus threatening monetary policy. There is another, longer-term threat to the stabilisation plan. When the programme was launched in December, the government still hoped Congress would approve a number of constitutional changes to allow future administrations greater freedom to control spending. The widely criticised 1988 constitution imposed too many spending demands on the government and introduced social welfare provisions which were too generous. For example, female teachers can retire after just 25 years' work. At this rate, more people will soon be receiving pensions than contributing. The problem is that Congress, again fearing election repercussions, has failed to approve many of the constitutional changes the government needed. As a result, the incoming regime will face the same problems with balancing future budgets as in the past, and this year's spending cuts are not repeatable. 'The IMF didn't sign for good reasons,' says Mr Antonio Delfim Netto, former planning minister, in reference to the IMF's refusal to agree to a standby loan programme ahead of Brazil's private bank debt restructuring last month. Mr Cardoso is trailing in the opinion polls, and almost certainly needs inflation to fall sharply under the plan. If it does, he will be a strong challenger to the front runner, Mr Lus Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Workers Party (PT), usually known as Lula. Mr Cardoso's problem is that he has found it difficult to develop a rapport with poor voters. Also, he cannot complain about the government's poor performance because he was, until recently, part of it. Mr Tasso Jereissati, chairman of Mr Cardoso's PSDB political party, says: 'There is immense disillusionment in this country towards politics, and that is making Lula more appealing.' A victory for Mr da Silva would mark a big shift in Brazil, which has never elected a socialist president. But he has himself moderated many of the PT's more radical policies. He is surrounded by good, sometimes idealistic, advisers and the party is determined to concentrate on problems such as education, unemployment and land reform. These are central to Brazil's longer-term development yet have been neglected because of the economic mismanagement of the past 10 years - Brazil's so-called 'lost decade'. A PT victory would lead to considerable short-term uncertainty, especially among foreign investors. The party has said it will review an already flagging privatisation programme and demand renegotiation of Brazil's foreign debts. These threats are serious, but it seems likely that an incoming PT government will face many other more pressingproblems. It will also almost certainly lack a congressional majority and would have to compromise in order to build a governing alliance. While government and the economy lurch from one mini-crisis to the next, underlying changes within Brazil will ensure the country's slow advance towards modernity. The downfall of Mr Collor was followed early this year by a recommendation from Congress that 18 of its own members should be expelled on corruption charges although, unfortunately, some have been pardoned. The growing demand for transparency at all levels of government is leading the media and pressure groups to focus on what politicians do, individually and collectively, for Brazil - and often to demand improvements. Second, there is a growing realisation in the media and parts of the political classes of Brazil's position in the world, and its dubious distinction as the only main Latin American country yet to stabilise its economy. Reform will take time and will be erratic. Mr da Silva and Mr Cardoso will offer similar pledges of change, but both may find Brazil's traditional preference for consensus frustrates their programmes. Mr Roberto Macedo, a Sao Paulo economist, contrasts Brazil with the Asian 'tiger' economies such as South Korea. 'Brazil is a whale economy, it moves very slowly and is very difficult to turn round,' he says.</p>

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Amazon tribal 'massacre' THE Brazilian police yesterday began investigating a reported massacre of up to 19 Yanomami tribal people - the second such incident in two months. It is alleged to have been carried out by garimpeiros (itinerant goldminers), and the killings have set off new fears for the Amazon's most populous indigenous tribe. Between 14 and 19 Yanomami men, women and children were reported as decapitated by machetes at the remote settlement of Haximu in the northern state of Roraima, according to officials of the National Indian Foundation (Funai). In a similar incident in July, five or six Yanomami were murdered in the same region. The motive for the tribal killings is unknown but there has long been tension between the garimpeiros and the Yanomami, whose lands encompass what are thought to be some of the world's richest mineral deposits. Two years ago, after international pressure, the government declared a 9.4m hectare reserve to protect the estimated 9,000 remaining Yanomami and expelled the goldminers, who were bringing violence, disease and pollution into the area.</p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: CLS makes Pounds 8.37m at six months CLS Holdings, the property investment company majority-owned by Sweden's Mortstedt family, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.37m in the first half of 1994, compared with a loss of Pounds 1.49m last time. Excluding exceptional items, though, the company's first set of figures since making its stock exchange debut in May showed a profit before tax from continuing operations of Pounds 1.95m, against Pounds 575,000 before. After adjusting for transactions completed since flotation, net assets per share were 129p. The first interim dividend is 0.4p, although the Mortstedt family, who own 53 per cent of the shares, have agreed to take a scrip alternative.</p>

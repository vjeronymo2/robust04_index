			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Car industry boost forecast for base metals Rising car output, growth in the number of cars in use and higher consumption of non-ferrous metals in each car should see the industry's demand for base metals grow further in the 1990s, according to Brook Hunt and Associates, reports Reuters. But the latest report on the car industry by the metals industry analyst says that after the turn of the century use of copper and zinc will fall markedly, although aluminium, lead and nickel consumption will continue to rise. Brook Hunt estimates that between now and 2005 consumption by the passenger car industry of aluminium will rise by 83 per cent to 3.95m tonnes, of lead by 11 per cent to 1.24m tonnes and of nickel by 10 per cent to 57,000 tonnes. But usage of copper is forecast to fall by nearly 12 per cent to 480,000 tonnes and of zinc by 7.3 per cent to 457,000 tonnes by 2005. The passenger car manufacturing industry's share of western world demand for the major base metals in 1993 was 12 per cent for aluminium, 8 per cent for copper, 32 per cent for lead, 10 per cent for nickel and 13 per cent for zinc, Brook Hunt says. Aluminium's unique combination of physical and mechanical properties make it the material of choice in a wide variety of applications and will ensure it has the greatest potential for future demand growth in the car industry, the report says.</p>

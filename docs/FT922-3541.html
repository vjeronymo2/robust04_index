			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / The Earth Summit: Eleventh hour struggle over environment pacts OFFICIALS at the Earth Summit were last night struggling to put together agreements acceptable to heads of state who arrive in Rio de Janeiro today. Last-minute negotiations were under way in an effort to complete agreements on a declaration to conserve the world's forests, and financial arrangements to implement the Earth Summit's decisions. Major compromises seemed likely in both these areas where deep divisions remain between developed and developing countries. Officials said these deals would have to be struck by ministers, with the summit likely to end with a long bargaining session. Mr Michael Young, a US State Department official said: 'The goal is to complete everything by tonight. That goal is in sight.' Despite talks until 4am yesterday, officials were unable to agree a financial package to help Third World countries deal with their environmental problems. The main issues are the terms on which industrial countries should commit themselves to raising their aid budgets to 0.7 per cent of GNP, the replenishment of the International Development Association (IDA) through which the World Bank helps the poorest countries, and conditions for loans from the Global Environment Facility (GEF), a fund jointly administered by the UN and the World Bank. Mr Jamshed Marker, the Pakistani official who chairs the Group of 77 Third World countries, said the G77 had accepted the new draft, with the exception of three points which would have to go to ministers. Among the industrial countries, Japan, which has hinted that it is preparing a big financial package for the summit, has taken a tough line on refusing to commit itself to a timetable for the 0.7 per cent target, and has been insisting on GEF conditions. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, will announce to the summit how much the UK will contribute, said a UK official. Disagreements over forests centre on how far countries' sovereign rights extend, certain trade issues, and whether a treaty on forest conservation should be attempted.</p>

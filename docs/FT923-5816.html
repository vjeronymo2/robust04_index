			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / International Company News: VW improves 3% to DM445m VOLKSWAGEN, the German car concern, yesterday reported a 3 per cent increase in its net profits for the first half of 1992 to DM445m (Dollars 278m), though turnover showed much stronger growth of 11 per cent to DM43.8bn. The group said that the net figure still reflected the start-up costs of new models such as the Golf and Vento family cars. These costs had continued from last year into the first quarter. This particularly affected the parent company, where earnings were 15 per cent lower at DM282m. The second quarter was much better than the first as a result of greater availability of vehicles. At the pre-tax level, the VW group operating profit was down by 17 per cent at DM987m. But taxes were much lower, leading to the higher net result. Shares of VW moved up by DM10.50 on the result to close at DM324.50, though some analysts had expected a rather better performance. For the full year, VW repeated its forecast that sales would total some 3.5m vehicles. Last year, it increased sales by 3 per cent to 3.13m units. In the first half of this year, unit sales were 6 per cent higher at 1.8bn vehicles. But while foreign sales rose by 19 per cent to 1.14bn units, those in the domestic market were 11 per cent lower at 656,000. The company looked forward to a more positive world economic development in 1993 and hoped some of the improvement could start in the second half of this year. VW's new projects would then reduce strains on capacity and put the group in a position to meet growing demand. But it said it was not ignoring the warning signs about the domestic economy and the likelihood of a return to normal after the impact on demand of unification.</p>

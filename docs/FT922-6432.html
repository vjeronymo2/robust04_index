			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Books: Never mind the words, listen to the voice - Max Loppert on Peter Pears' biography PETER PEARS: A BIOGRAPHY by Christopher Headington Faber &amp; Faber Pounds 20, 351 pages THE BIOGRAPHIES of famous singers form, by and large, a marginal part of music-book publishing. Few, in truth, are the tales that really needed telling; few are the singers who in some way renewed or creatively altered their chosen medium, who proved themselves forces for change or sources of inspiration. And though the preservation of names, dates and places connected with a significant vocal career will always benefit the opera or concert historian, this only tends to confirm the minority-interest rating of the final product. In the ranks of shining exceptions to that rule, a first biography of Peter Pears ought to stand proud. His 40-year relationship with a composer of genius changed both men, crucially and with resounding consequences for the history of 20th-century music. In a sense, Benjamin Britten invented Pears as an artist. Without encountering the composer, as Christopher Headington's book makes clear, the tenor might well have remained no more than a minor concert singer, sensitive, attractive but unforceful, and technically unfocussed in the use of his instrument; the first flush of emotional and physical involvement between the two men marked the real onset of Pears's startling artistic development. And though it is fruitless to speculate what Britten's own compositional progress might have been without Pears, the arrival of a work as explosively significant as Peter Grimes does seem hard to imagine. In another sense, the biography of the singer becomes a notable addition to the growing quantity of biographical material published about the composer. That, too, should make a Pears biography 'important': he was not only the defining voice in all the music written for him, but an increasingly powerful influence over all of Britten's compositional ideas and ambitions. The relationship was, in Pears's own words, 'passionately devoted and close', and it therefore reverberated in innumerable fascinating ways through every one of Britten's achievements. All the sadder, then, that Headington's Pears should prove to be, on the whole, such a dogged disappointment. It is not without documentary value. The material has been marshalled with sober care and punctilious concern for detail. To excess, indeed, in the passages concerned with the minutiae of Pears's tastes and domestic life - we learn, for instance, that 'he enjoyed a cup of tea, and his and Britten's standard choice was Earl Grey mixed with Darjeeling, though they did not think the Aldeburgh water was good enough to enjoy it at its best', a not untypical example of the parish-mag tone and style. The facts are there, in plain abundance: Pears's ancestry (generations of military preceded him, which lent a specific thrust to his early pacifist convictions), the first twists and turns of his career, the early awareness of homosexuality, the early relationships and phases of friendship with Britten (they knew each other for a couple of years before falling in love), the exact stages of his development into a singer of international fame, the travels and diary entries. Headington has had access to some previously unpublished Pears material, and uses it judiciously. Much of all this carries its own inherent interest. What I badly miss, though, is the genuine biographer's instinct for not only tracing patterns but illuminating them. But perhaps one ought not to be surprised at this central weakness. The book is, we learn from the preface, the 'official biography' - a soubriquet that always sends a shudder of horror down this particular reader's spine. In some ways, that instant response is unjust. The author, a composer of some distinction who knew Britten and Pears from his student days, published a Britten biography in 1981; his feelings of friendship for both are honestly admitted at the outset. Nevertheless, the 'official biography' air - and, above all, the Aldeburgh Establishment seal of approval which the book proudly flourishes - is apparent inthe pall of biographically limiting parti pris loyalty hanging over it. Controversy is avoided. There are hints of the autocratic influence over performers that Britten and Pears increasingly exercised asthe Aldeburgh Festival took root; but these are left largely unexplored. Cases of those regulars who after some offence or misdemeanour suddenly became Aldeburgh non-persons - Charles Mackerras and Robert Tear, to name just two - are generally avoided. Headington quotes Pears on an unspecified 'two-faced Welshman', an in-group reference to Tear that ought to have been opened out and more fully examined, with investigative impartiality, as a way of coming to grips with the complexities of the singer's character. Most disappointing of all, however, is the failure to illuminate Pears's voice, his singing, his influence for good and, indeed, bad over subsequent generations of English tenors. After all, this was a voice that sharply divided opinion, a voice passionately admired and no less passionately disliked (and this through the medium of the gramophone it remains). Four pages on Pears in John Steane's The Grand Tradition say more about that voice - its unsteadiness, its lack of body, its unique ability to shade and colour, its profound feeling for the inner meaning of words and notes - than all of Headington's 351.</p>

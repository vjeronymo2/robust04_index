			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>   [Text] President Ramiro De Leon Carpio swore in the new  minister of foreign relations during a ceremony held Wednesday  morning. Marithza Ruiz de Vielman assumed the position that had  been held since June by Arturo Fajardo Maldonado.    Ruiz de Vielman is the second professional to join the  cabinet in less than 24 hours, after the president swore in Ana  Ordonez de Molina as new finance minister on Tuesday afternoon.  The changes within the cabinet correspond to the new direction  adopted by the president as part of his work agenda for the  current year, according to De Leon Carpio.    [Begin De Vielman recording] [Words indistinct] to achieve  satisfactory results. Guatemala is a country that is struggling  to consolidate its democracy, strengthen its Constitution,  attain peace, and gain openings in international trade. To that  end, we need the assistance of a team and the confidence that we  can carry out that task.    We are a country that, just as any other developing country,  has very limited economic resources. Consequently, we must  increase the effectiveness of our missions abroad and the effort  of the people who work here at the Foreign Relations Ministry to  achieve all said objectives. As I said before, these objectives  must be achieved with very limited resources, but we are hopeful  and confident because Guatemala deserves it.    In addition, I want to thank Dr. Fajardo for the cooperation  and assistance he is giving me. All persons who preceded me in  this difficult position have done a great job. Dr. Fajardo has  expressed his willingness and desire to cooperate because in  this ministers' change, there is only a change of persons.  However, the state [word indistinct] and the interest of the  country also [words indistinct]. Then I want to ask for the  cooperation of all of you and once more thank the president for  his trust in me. [applause]    I also want to announce, with the authorization of the  president of the Republic, that in the task I now assume I will  have the cooperation of two persons who are well-known and  appreciated in [word indistinct]. In the work I have done in  the area of international trade, I learned to respect their  ability and I realize that accepting the post of foreign  minister, which is in fact a difficult task, I have the  advantage of counting on very valuable staffers at the Foreign  Relations Ministry. Two of them will accompany me as deputy  ministers, but there are many more officials. The Foreign  Relations Ministry has professional personnel that I am sure  will also help me.    With the authorization of the president, I would also like  to  announce and confirm to the media that the deputy ministers who  will be appointed are Dr. Bernardo Arevalo and Carlos Ramirez  Martinez.

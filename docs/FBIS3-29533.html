The case in this trial,  which is preliminary as well as final, involves roundabout  dealings with 4,000 tons of steel designed for the construction  of the north-south 500-kilovolt powerline. These dealings  caused losses of 3.1 billion dong to the state budget. Mr. Mai  Ngoc Chinh, chief judge of the Criminal Court of the Supreme  People's Court, presided over the court session.    Today, the defendants -- including Doan Trung Thanh, Doan  Thi  Huu Nghi, Vu Ngoc Hai [former energy minister], Le Lien, Pham  Dao Khanh, Dinh Ngoc Lac, Nguyen Dinh Lam, Nguyen Duc Ai, and  Nguyen Trong Sang -- continued giving testimony in response to  examination by lawyers and a juridical council. Many witnesses  also testified before the juridical council in a bid to shed  more light on the details of the case as well as the magnitude  of the offense committed by the defendants. The court will  continue its session tomorrow.</p>

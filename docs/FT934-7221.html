			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Civil service urged to draw from private sector: Report calls for radical reform of career structure MINISTERS should consider recruiting top civil servants from the private sector as part of a radical reform of the official career structure, a government report will urge next week. The report, drawn up by the Efficiency Unit of the Cabinet Office, is the government's strongest response to date to criticism that reaching the top echelons of the civil service is based on background rather than brainpower. It urges ministers to look for more top officials from business and industry at a time when executive agencies and the private sector are being invited to tender for certain operations within the service. It also calls for regular assessments of how leading civil servants perform their tasks. A senior Whitehall official said yesterday the recommendations in the report, Career Management and Succession Planning, would 'change the blend of our senior operational structure', adding that Mr John Major, the prime minister, had welcomed its findings. The report follows nine months of research, led by Sir Peter Levene, the prime minister's efficiency adviser. But it is unlikely to satisfy calls for a management revolution in Whitehall. It falls short of setting specific quotas for how many external candidates should be recruited to top-level posts. It also claims that large private sector companies recruit most of their top managers from within the organisation  - partly to preserve the morale of junior personnel  - and that the civil service should be no different. And it is unlikely to appease Sir Peter Kemp, a former permanent secretary, who irritated ministers earlier this week by attacking Whitehall's 'old attitudes and the old guard'. According to Whitehall officials, only 10 per cent of the top 620 officials in the civil service are recruited through open competition. A few others, such as Sir Terry Burns, permanent secretary to the Treasury, were appointed after spending much of their careers outside government. The report stresses that mandarins must continue to possess home-grown expertise, such as political awareness and advisory skills. But they list other skills which come with private sector experience, such as team building and good communication. One official said: 'There used to be a culture whereby you could start at the lower grades of the civil service and work your way up to permanent secretary level. This report recommends a change of that culture.'</p>

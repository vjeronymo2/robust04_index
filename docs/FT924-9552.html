			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Saatchi &amp; Saatchi sells MSL for Pounds 3.5m Saatchi &amp; Saatchi is selling MSL Group International, its consulting and recruitment company, to Mr Garry Long, MSL's chairman, in a deal worth Pounds 3.5m. Because of the depressed state of MSL's business, Mr Long is paying only Pounds 10,000 immediately. Saatchi has also been allotted 3.5m preference shares of Pounds 1 each, redeemable at par in tranches until 1998. Mr Long said that MSL, which has operated at a loss in the current year, would redeem the shares out of future profits. If MSL could not make the payments, Saatchi would have the right to convert the shares, but would not regain control of MSL as the maximum stake obtainable would be 50 per cent. MSL has 120 employees in the UK and net tangible assets of Pounds 550,000. Founded in 1955, it merged with Hay, the US personnel consultancy in the mid-1960s to form Hay-MSL, which was acquired by Saatchi in 1984. Hay was sold to its management in 1990.</p>

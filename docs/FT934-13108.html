			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Kymmene announces bond issue KYMMENE, the Finnish forestry group, yesterday announced sharply-reduced losses for the first eight months and plans for a FM600m (Dollars 105m) convertible bond issue. Losses after financial items amounted to FM337m for the period, compared with FM849m last time. The group said productivity gains and higher sales volumes had assisted the recovery, but it acknowledged that it was lagging behind its competitors. The group's exposure to the highly-depressed fine papers market, and the volume of its production in hard currency countries, has held it in the red when its main domestic rivals have returned to profit. Sales climbed to FM10.5m from FM8.42m, while operating profits rose strongly to FM1.0bn from FM243m. The group expects a better performance in the final four months, because of productivity gains, falling interest rates and increased exports to markets outside Europe. The convertible bonds, which will be offered to shareholders and the public, have a 50-year maturity but can be called by the company at par from the year 2004. Proceeds will be used to reduce net debt, which stood at FM17.9bn at the end of August.</p>

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Stark change of style at the New York Fed: Richard Waters meets the quiet career banker charged with maintaining financial stability in the US MR William McDonough hardly seems a natural choice for the job of chief fire-fighter for the US financial system. A 59-year-old with a distinguished if unremarkable career in commercial banking, he is quiet, even hesitant. In response to questions last week he was reserved and cautious, only relaxing when explaining the shortcomings of economic data or talking about his native Chicago. Yet as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, a job he takes on today, Mr McDonough is the man most responsible for protecting the stability of the US financial system. The change in style at the top of the New York Fed could hardly be starker. Mr McDonough succeeds the man who was responsible for bringing him to the bank only 18 months ago, Mr Gerald Corrigan. After eight years as the US's second-most powerful central banker, and still only 52, Mr Corrigan has built a formidable reputation around the world. Forceful, energetic, eloquent, it was career central banker Mr Corrigan who led the efforts to patch up the financial system after the collapse of Drysdale Government Securities in 1982, and the 1987 share price crash. After 22 years at First Chicago, one of the country's largest commercial banks, Mr McDonough is new to central banking and has none of Mr Corrigan's experience of quenching financial conflagrations. He at least inherits a banking system which is in better shape than at any time since the Third World debt crisis broke in 1982. The process of recuperation after the credit binge of the late 1980s and the recession of the early 1990s has left banks far stronger, he says. 'The health of the banking system is much better than it was a number of years ago. Banks' balance sheets, and those of their corporate and personal customers, have been returned to a much greater degree of health.' When pressed on what could pose the next big threat to the stability of the US financial system, he had only one ready response: derivatives - the financial instruments such as futures and options which have become the dominant force in currency, interest rate and equity markets in the 1990s. The instruments are 'an extremely important and useful tool for the management of financial risk,' he says, but adds: 'Like all financial instruments, they have their own risks, which must be managed and controlled. We have to be careful, because they are very complicated intellectually.' As president of the New York Fed, Mr McDonough's pronouncements will be second in importance only to those of Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and head of the central banking system. He will also act as vice-chairman on the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, which guides monetary policy. Mr McDonough has already been responsible for 18 months for the day-to-day exercise of monetary policy, which is a job delegated to the New York Fed. During that time, he has won the confidence of economists on Wall Street. Mr McDonough's generally sanguine view of US banks is matched by a cautiously optimistic view of the nation's economy. Inflation, he says, is likely to stabilise at around 3 per cent for the rest of this year, a level which he thinks conducive to steady economic growth. The imprecision of the data makes it likely that hints of renewed credit growth after the contraction of recent years are likely to be premature, he warns. But he points to the shrinkage in the indebtedness of the country's households and companies as a sign of strength: 'It is creating a base on which sustained and over time somewhat faster economic growth can be achieved.' It is the faltering economies of Europe and Japan that pose the biggest threat, he says. These economies are 'probably bottoming out,' but, 'an economy can trip along the bottom for quite a period.' In another contrast to his predecessor, Mr McDonough does not expect to take a prominent role internationally, at least at first. Mr Corrigan was well-known around the world, among other things through his leadership of the Basle committee of international banking regulators and his efforts to bolster the financial system of the former Soviet states. On Friday, as his appointment emerged in an 11th-hour announcement, Mr McDonough predicted that he would spend less time abroad than his predecessor - though he claims his fluency in Spanish and near-fluency in French, as well as periods spent abroad with First Chicago, mark him out as an internationalist at heart. But, he adds, 'it is a job where that which is necessary to be done is not predictable.'</p>

			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Property: Yours for a million 'On the first day of Christmas my true love sent to me. . .' Here is a list for dreamers. Ever thought what a Pounds 1m would buy in the way of a home? Ever imagined that perfect house that you might, one day, afford if you won the lottery? You would be lucky to find someone on Christmas Eve duty in an estate agent's office . . . but you never know, Christmas is a time when wishes are sometimes made real. Here is a Pounds 1m property for each of the 12 days of Christmas. Christmas Day demands a family home big enough to hold all the relations once a year. The 1847 red brick Bell Hall at Belbroughton, Worcs, is spot on for price and size, and boasts a billiard room, a covered swimming pool, an art gallery and a 12th century chapel for family carols. (John D Wood, Oxford, 01865-311522). Boxing Day needs a hunting and shooting property. For a change from the Boxing Day meet in Bicester, Oxfordshire, try Virginia in the US. Ricochet, near Charlottesville, has 292 acres of wood, pasture, creeks and springs, stabling for eight, and views to the Blue Ridge mountains. A large log cabin, dating from 1848, has been added to the house to create a family room and new master bedroom. (Frank Hardy, Charlottesville, 001-804-296 0134, Dollars 1.25m). Day III. If the US is too distant and you want an English base, Pounds 1m would buy the 15th century Upton Farm near Guildford, Surrey, with stables, barn, fine gardens and a two-bedroom lodge with 11.5 acres, seven of them a paddock. (Browns, Guildford, 01483-31166). On Day IV your thoughts may turn to sunnier climes. A newly- built villa, at Bar sur Loup in Provence, has a spectacular view over the Gorges du Loup down to the sea, 15km away, and a pool so that you need not trek down to the coast to swim. It is set in 2.5 acres of oaks and olives. (SPA Properties, London, 071-483 0606, FFr8.5m. Day V offers a piece of traditional France, the 12th, 15th and 17th century Chateau du Belet in Perigord, beautifully restored by a Paris antiques dealer. Outbuildings include a dovecote, barn and lodge, and it has 112 acres with the calme absolu that the Guide Michelin awards a rocking chair for. An ideal base for degustation of truffles and foie gras. Some rooms are still unrestored. (Philip Hawkes, Paris, 00331-42 68 11 11, FFr10m negotiable). Day VI is for southern Africa, where a game lodge in Zimbabwe, with a 9,000-acre estate, costs precisely Pounds 1m. Elephants, lions, leopards and cheetah await you. The lodge has five chalets. (Harrison &amp; Hine, London, 071-600 6660). In many countries New Year's Eve is the night to play cards, which will tell you your fortune for the coming year. If you are devoted to racehorses, buying a stud could be a winning bet. Leading jockey Pat Eddery is selling Barrettstown, near Aylesbury, Bucks, for Pounds 1m. It must be a good sign that it is the birthplace of the first Pounds 1m yearling (Trojan Prince). The farm has two cottages, a top quality yard and 72 acres of smartly railed paddocks. There is outline planning permission for a large house. (John D Wood, as above). Celebrate New Year's Day with shopping and culture in New York. Beaney Pearce in London offers three suggestions for apartments around the magic million (sterling): 106 Central Park South, a big (2,800 sq ft) seventh-floor, three-bedroom flat for Dollars 1.6m, or a two-bedroom apartment on the 24th floor for Dollars 1.495m; and at 721 Fifth Avenue a two-bedroom (1,500 sq ft) on the 48th floor for Dollars 1.5m. (071-589 1333). On Day IX, whims may change. Your beloved may opt, instead, for a New York-type experience in London. That is not so easy to find, but the Manhattan Loft Corporation will come to the rescue, with four penthouse-lofts in its Soho Lofts development in Wardour Street, W1. Each penthouse has a curved roof on a steel frame. Prices range from Pounds 850,000 (1,850 sq ft) to Pounds 1.15m (2,400 sq ft). A Conran restaurant will take the basement and ground floor of the building. (071-495 6707). For Day X a Regency country house near the north Norfolk coast is the suggestion. Savills in Norwich offers a long lease at Pounds 1m on Sheringham Hall - a straightforward but handsome classic design by Humphry Repton, built between 1812 and 1817. Six acres of gardens come with the house, but the park and woods stay with the National Trust, which is the freeholder. (01603-612211). Day XI. Thoughts turn to a period house in the country. The Old Manor, at Aldbourne, Wiltshire, built in 1740, could be the answer. This long, symmetrical red brick house with a slate roof looks essence of Georgian. Its surprise is on the garden side, where a columned conservatory runs almost the length of the building. (Savills, London, 0171-499 8644, offers over Pounds 1m). Twelfth Night is the last day of Christmas cheer. Time to think of work again. What is on offer at around Pounds 1m in London? Two possibilities, at Pounds 1.1m each, are 1 Prince Albert Road, NW1, a Nash house overlooking Regent's Park (John D Wood, St John's Wood, 071-722 5556), or 1-2 Connaught Square, W2, interconnecting houses on the Hyde Park estate. (Parkways, 071-813 0022). Or for Pounds 995,000 consider the turn of the century red brick 49 Bedford Gardens, W8, in Kensington between Campden Hill Road and Kensington Church Street. (John D Wood, Kensington, 071-727 0705).</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary agrees that the procedure for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prorating the awards for students attending programs that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less than an academic year needs to be clarified. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary does not believe that 15 weeks of instructional time is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an adequate minimum standard for two-thirds of an academic year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the minimum standard for a full academic year is 30 weeks, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum standard for two-thirds of an academic year should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two-thirds of 30 weeks (20 weeks).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A change has been made. In &sect;668.2, the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defines two-thirds of an academic year as a period that is at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least two-thirds of an academic year as determined by an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution. At a minimum, two-thirds of an academic year must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be a period that begins on the first day of classes and ends on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the last day of classes or examinations and is a minimum of 20  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weeks of instructional time during which, for an undergraduate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> course of study, a full-time student is expected to complete at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least 16 semester or trimester hours or 24 quarter hours in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> educational program whose length is measured in credit hours or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 600 clock hours in an educational program whose length is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measured in clock hours. For an institution whose academic year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been reduced under &sect;668.3, one-third of an academic year is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the pro-rated equivalent, as measured in weeks and credit or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clock hours, of at least two-thirds of the institution's academic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;668.2, the Secretary also defines one-third of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> academic year as a period that is at least one-third of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> academic year as determined by an institution. At a minimum,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one-third of an academic year must be a period that begins on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first day of classes and ends on the last day of classes or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examinations and is a minimum of 10 weeks of instructional time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during which, for an undergraduate course of study, a full-time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student is expected to complete at least 8 semester or trimester  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hours or 12 quarter hours in an educational program whose length  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is measured in credit hours or 300 clock hours in an educational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program whose length is measured in clock hours. For an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution whose academic year has been reduced under &sect;668.3,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one-third of an academic year is the pro-rated equivalent, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measured in weeks and credit or clock hours, of at least one-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third of the institution's academic year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters suggested that the definition of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> academic year in &sect;668.2 should be amended to reflect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision in the Technical Amendments of 1993 specifying that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of academic year in section 481 of the HEA applies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only to an undergraduate course of study.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary agrees that a limitation in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of academic year needs to be included in &sect;668.2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the Secretary notes that the requirement that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> academic year require a minimum of 30 weeks of instructional time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applies to both undergraduate and graduate courses of study.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A change has been made to clarify that the amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instruction that a full-time student is required to complete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during an academic year applies only to an undergraduate course  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of study.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Full-time student. Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters believed that the Secretary should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address the potential for abuse under the definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> academic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> for educational programs that are measured in credit hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter suggested that the Secretary establish a weekly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum full-time workload for full-time students in these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs by tying quarter hours to actual quarters to prevent an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution from claiming to offer a full academic year's worth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of work over a thirty-week period by giving a full-time student a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small amount of instruction, which the institution claims to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent to 24 semester or 36 quarter hours. The commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also suggested that the Secretary eliminate the use of quarter or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> semester hours for institutions that do not have quarters or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> semesters and instead require those institutions to measure their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs in clock hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters urged the Secretary to reject any mechanism  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where the institution would be responsible for self-measuring the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantity of work required because it would be too easy for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unscrupulous institutions to evade. Instead, the commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended that only bona fide courses, related work, research,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or special studies would count toward whether a student would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full-time, and that each institution's quantification would have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be approved during the certification process set forth in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;668.13. One commenter also suggested that the Secretary change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the procedures and not permit institutions to measure workloads  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for term or semester based schools in clock hours, because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clock hour schedules permitted institutions to compress the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> course offerings into too short a time period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters advised that the clock hour/credit hour  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation would provide the protection necessary for the weekly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedules of students enrolled at institutions offering credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hours without terms, and recommended that no further action be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taken in changing the proposed definition of full-time student.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several other commenters stated that they believed the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition was sufficient to prevent abuse without further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additions to establish a minimum full-time course workload. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter suggested that no stricter definition be adopted for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full-time students enrolled at institutions offering credit hours  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without terms because this area is currently addressed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accrediting agencies, which are in a better position to evaluate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the variety of delivery systems used by postsecondary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions. One commenter also questioned whether it was fair  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to adopt a more stringent criterion for credit hour programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without academic terms rather than adopting uniform criteria and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards for full-time students for all sectors of postsecondary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> education.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter suggested that the proposed definition was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unfair because it requires the same number of credit hours for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student regardless of whether the courses are measured in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> semester hours or quarter hours, resulting in students having to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perform a greater quantity of work during a quarter calendar if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they were taking semester hours. Several other commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that the proposed definition was unfair because it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would prohibit students from taking cooperative employment for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periods that were less than eighteen weeks. These commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that shorter periods of cooperative education should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accepted in conjunction with a smaller number of credits so long  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as the workload was pro-rated to match the academic workload of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full-time student. For example, a student taking cooperative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> education for one-fourth of the credits necessary to be a full-time student would have to complete the cooperative training in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one-fourth of the time allotted to a full-time student in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eighteen week program. Two other commenters stated that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed definition would establish workloads that could not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> readily be satisfied by part-time students or students that were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taking evening or weekend classes. These commenters believed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that students in these circumstances were often making many more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sacrifices to pursue their education than full-time day students,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and that it was unfair to reduce or eliminate aid that these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students currently receive because they do not carry enough  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credits to qualify for comparable aid under the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter suggested that the in-class attendance should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be the only component of the student workload considered for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision, and that under that standard the definition for full-time student would require at least 12 hours of attendance per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> week to correspond to the 12 credit hour workload.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few other commenters suggested that the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition be clarified to show that only students taking classes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``entirely'' by correspondence would not be required to meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workload requirements set out in the proposed definition. Others  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that the language for credit hour workloads be amended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to show that trimester hours would require the equivalent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workload for semester hours for academic terms and academic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> full-time student <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is based primarily on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longstanding definition found in the Federal Pell Grant and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> campus-based program regulations. The Secretary believes this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> full-time student  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> has proved to be appropriate and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective and does not believe any substantive changes are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary. The Secretary notes that this definition is now  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable for purposes of all Title IV, HEA programs. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual Title IV, HEA program regulations will be amended at a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> later date to remove the definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> full-time student.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

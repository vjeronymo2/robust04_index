			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 3 KYODO -- Japan's electronics  industry leader said Thursday [3 March] it will continue using  the muse system for its high-definition television (HDTV) system  for the 21st century.    Tadahiro Sekimoto, chairman of the Electronic Industries  Association of Japan, said, "Japan's muse system has been  completed and we have no idea of giving up the HDTV system."    Sekimoto's comment was in response to the recent widespread  misunderstanding that the muse system may be replaced by the  "MPEG" system of the United States. The view was triggered by a  posts ministry official's remark in February discussing the  digital and analog formats for the future HDTV system in Japan.    "Analog-or-digital discussion is nonsense. That is based on  lack of technological knowledge. In the core part of the muse,  signals are digitally processed and the data can be output  digitally," Sekimoto said.    Sekimoto, also president of NEC Corp., made the remarks at a  press conference.    Even in an era of multimedia, which need to digitally  operate  data via optical networks, the muse system will be fully  applicable to the next generation high-tech world, Sekimoto said.    For instance, Japanese manufacturers have already developed  a  digital videocassette tape recorder for the muse-HDTV set,  Sekimoto said.</p>

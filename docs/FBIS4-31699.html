			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Antonin Baudys by Miloslav </F> Frydl; place and date not given: "Money Is the Determining  Factor in the Modernization of the Czech Army"]    [Text] No decision has been made yet on whether the Army  of the Czech Republic will be reequipped with the multipurpose  Lada weapons system, Defense Minister Antonin Baudys told CESKY  DENIK in an interview. According to his words, Czech firms  should be given preference in equipping the Army with modern  types of weapons. "In modernizing and reequipping the Army, we  are guided by the following basic philosophy: The final  supplier will be a Czech company. Only those components will be  imported that cannot be manufactured here or for which no one in  our country holds a production license. We will have all  modernization projects ready by the end of June. The problem  lies in disposable resources, that is, in how much money we are  going to get from the government and parliament. Money is the  absolutely determining factor in modernization. We focus on  Czech suppliers, which means that finances invested in the  modernization of the army could yield a multiple return because  they mean jobs for hundreds of thousands of people. As regards  foreign firms that will be interested in cooperating with us by  means of joint ventures, licenses, or technology transfers, we  want this cooperation to help us secure markets for our  products. To put it in simplified terms: 100 pieces will be  manufactured, of which the army will take 10 and the rest will  be sold abroad. The profit made on those 90 pieces must cover  the cost of the army's 10 pieces. This approach means, first,  that the army will be equipped with modern weapons; second, that  people will have jobs and money will flow into the state coffers  from exports; and, third, that money will be saved that would  otherwise be spent on restructuring, unemployment, and so forth."    [Frydl] Will you tell me with the weapons of which domestic  firm the Army will be reequipped?    [Baudys] I will not. A quite regular tender will have to  take place to determine this. Zbrojovka Cesky Brod is no longer  the sole company capable of manufacturing weapons for the Czech  Army although, naturally, it is a hot contender. I repeat  again: We will have the modernization projects, including  priorities, ready by the end of June. Then it will be necessary  to conduct a series of talks to determine what we can actually  count on. That will be followed by the invitation of tenders  and, subsequently, talks with foreign firms. There are areas in  which the Czech Republic is traditionally on a top level. One  is small arms, the other is aviation technology. The future  L-159 fighter plane could become a hit worldwide. Some heavier  types of weapons are another area. Here we count on the  utilization of our heavy industry, such as Skoda Plzen and  others.</p>

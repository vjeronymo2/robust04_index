			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Thrift stays firmly in fashion: Emma Tucker draws international comparisons for savings ratios THE SMALL fall in personal-sector savings in the second quarter will have provided scant comfort for Britain's hard-pressed retailers. For almost two years shop owners have watched consumers make the repayment of debt - which official figures count as savings - a priority. The result, along with the sharpest fall in consumer borrowing since the mid 1970s, is that net savings - defined as the difference between consumer income and consumption - has risen to levels not seen since 1982. In the face of the rise and complaints from retailers that the government has made saving too attractive with high interest rates and the introduction of tax-exempt savings accounts, international comparisons show that the UK remains a country with relatively low personal-sector savings. Measures of household savings can be easily distorted - for example, by the failure to standardise the measurement of public and private pension schemes  -but the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development publishes a series of harmonised international comparisons. They indicate that Japan is a country with high household savings, in the US and the UK people are disinclined to save, and France and Germany come somewhere in between. Several theories have been put forward to explain the differences between countries. They include: Demographics: Young populations tend to save while ageing populations do not. That factor is expected to exert a strong downward pressure on the level of household savings in Japan, which will move from being one of the youngest OECD populations to the second-oldest by 2025. Tax systems: The bias in Japan has been towards savings, whereas tax systems in the UK and many Scandinavian countries have traditionally favoured borrowers through tax deductions on the interest paid on loans. In the UK, that includes income tax relief on mortgage borrowing, which, although frozen in recent years, remains a strong incentive to borrow to buy a house. Monetary policy: In countries where real interest rates have been negative and inflation volatile, it has often made more sense to invest in assets, such as houses, than to save money in bonds or building societies. In Germany, where the savings ratio is high and relatively stable, buying a house is not seen as a way to wealth. Social security: The extent of state welfare provision is said to influence the level of savings. The argument runs that where social security systems are not highly developed, people save more as an insurance against misfortune. That may contribute to the high level of savings in Japan for example, and the very low, even negative savings ratio in Sweden, where the state provides extensive social security. Expectations in the UK that the savings ratio will remain at its present level are based on the assumption that burgeoning household debt and high real interest rates will continue to encourage people to pay back debt and save money rather than to borrow in order to spend. Mr Michael Saunders, an economist at Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, says: 'I think the savings ratio will come down slightly over the next couple of years, but not towards the low levels of the 1980s. Households still have too much debt and real interest rates are sufficiently high to deter people from borrowing.' Although that may not be welcome news to retailers, it may benefit the economy in the long run. One consequence of low consumer spending is that inflationary pressures will be lower. That should allow interest rates to come down faster, thereby lowering the cost of capital for industry. Another advantage of a high and stable savings rate is that it is more likely to foster stability than the high levels of borrowing in the 1980s. Those ultimately proved unsustainable and contributed to the sharp drop in economic activity at the end of the decade from which the country has yet to recover. REAL personal disposable income fell by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter compared with the first, but rose by 0.8 per cent compared with the same quarter a year ago. Central Statistical Office seasonally adjusted figures also show that the savings ratio, which measures personal savings as a percentage of total personal disposable income, dropped from 11 per cent in the first quarter to 10.3 per cent in the second quarter. The quarterly fall is not expected to be repeated as rising unemployment and the high levels of household debt probably exerted a cautionary influence over consumers in the third quarter. The fall in the ratio resulted largely from postponed spending because Easter was late this year. In the third and fourth quarters of last year the ratio was also 10.3 per cent.</p>

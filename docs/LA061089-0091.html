			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TORRES URGES USE OF ADS TO FIGHT AIDS  </P> <P> State Sen. Art Torres on Friday called on state health officials to require Los  Angeles County to spend $1 million in unused state AIDS funds immediately for  an intensive advertising campaign aimed at educating minorities about the  deadly disease.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Democrat's request was prompted by complaints from AIDS  activists that up to $10 million of the $51.5 million allocated to fight the  disease may go unspent this fiscal year, which ends June 30. In response to the  complaints, Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) last week called for an  audit of county AIDS programs.  </P> <P> "In the last year, the volume of AIDS cases in our state has risen by 77% in  the black community, 53% in the Hispanic community and 18% among Asian Pacific  Islanders," Torres said in a letter to Kenneth Kizer, state health director.  "Overall, minorities account for 22% of California adult and adolescent AIDS  cases."  </P></p>

Holst, 56, fell ill on his return from an official visit to  Madrid on December 16.    The first medical report, issued shortly after the incident,  said Holst's intellectual capabilities were not affected.    The doctor's statement said the foreign minister was  improving and that he would be transferred to a special center  outside Oslo for further rehabilitation.    Holst's doctor, Professor Rolf Nyberg-Hansen, said the  stroke  had affected his speech and the coordination of his walking and  that he would be off work for some time.    Holst was first admitted to hospital in November, suffering  from overwork and exhaustion. He had just resumed limited  duties when he suffered the stroke.    Holst last year helped broker the so-called "Oslo Treaty" on  limited Palestinian self-rule in the Jericho area and the Gaza  Strip through a series of secret meetings in Norway.    A spokesman for Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland said on  Tuesday [4 January] that she was not planning to have Holst  replaced.    Both family members and Foreign Ministry officials often  visit Holst at the National Hospital in Oslo.    On Sunday the Israeli-PLO peace negotiators Uri Savir and  Abu  Ala, who were in Oslo to receive a Royal medal of merit for  their peace efforts, paid him a visit.</p>

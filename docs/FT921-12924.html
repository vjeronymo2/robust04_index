			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Algerian economic rescue plan drawn up THE Algerian government has drawn up an emergency plan to revive the economy, channelling funds into industry, public works projects and housing. The authorities have had to draw down on precious resources and stimulate growth faster than originally intended in order to satisfy the disaffected electorate, half of whom voted for the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in the recently annulled elections. Economic recovery is regarded by senior officials as a central element in retaining social stability and drawing support away from the FIS. The FIS is credited with having drawn much of its support from cities, where youth unemployment is more than 25 per cent and the housing shortage is acute. To increase stagnant output and boost social spending, the government will raise imports from Dollars 7.6bn (Pounds 4.2bn) to Dollars 9bn. Of this, Dollars 200m will be added to last year's food import bill of Dollars 1.7bn. Imports of intermediate goods for industry will increase from Dollars 2.6bn to Dollars 3.2bn. The authorities want to streamline bureaucratic procedures blocking the use of multilateral credits, some dating from the early 1980s. The plan, expected to be announced by the weekend, is operating with tight constraints imposed by the country's heavy burden of debt service and scarce foreign reserves. The authorities are counting on a reduction in the annual cost of servicing medium- and long-term debt from Dollars 9.3bn last year to Dollars 7.6bn. Essential to this calculation is the completion of the Dollars 1.5bn refinancing package with the commercial banks, under negotiation for 18 months. The completion of this refinancing was being held up by Bankers Trust before elections in the second round of Algeria's first multi-party elections were annulled. The US bank is understood to have bought some Dollars 56m worth of Algerian paper on the secondary market and is unhappy to see the redemption date of this paper pushed back - inevitable if the refinancing package goes through. However, Algerian authorities are concerned that political uncertainties could now influence other banks and so delay the arrival of funds. The outcome of these negotiations could affect further disbursements of the EC's Ecu400m (Pounds 285.2m) loan and in turn condition the government's attitude towards Dollars 23.5bn foreign debt as a whole. Until now successive governments have been adamant in their refusal to contemplate rescheduling or default. Even with this assistance, the debt burden will account for more than 60 per cent of the Dollars 11.3bn income anticipated from 1992 sales of oil, gas, condensates and refined products. For the basket of these four items, the Finance Ministry has calculated an average price equivalent to Dollars 21 a barrel, and income from hydrocarbons sales will be down Dollars 1bn overall on 1991. Net hard currency reserves stand at Dollars 1bn, plus Dollars 2bn in gold which previous governments have refused to touch. Another key to the emergency plan will be the attitude of international oil companies to the two-month-old amendments to the 1986 hydrocarbons law which allowed foreign companies to enter joint ventures in already developed oilfields. Some 20 companies have expressed an interest and their participation would immediately inject much-needed hard cash.</p>

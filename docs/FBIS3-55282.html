Its statement, received by ITAR-TASS today, pointed  out that the absence of such control "resulted in the  self-isolation of the armed forces and the work of the military  leadership without taking into consideration the economic and  political processes in Russia." As a result of it, authors of  the statement believe, "social tension among servicemen  heightened both in the Army and the Navy."    The Military for Democracy Movement urged the Russian  president and government to "take all necessary measures for  improving the situation in the power structures of the Russian  Federation, for which the personnel policy should be shaped  directly by the Russian president."</p>

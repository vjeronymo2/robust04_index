			<p>BFN     [Text] The Second Session of the Eighth Yunnan Provincial  People's Congress held its second presidium meeting yesterday  afternoon. The meeting was presided over by Presidium Executive  Chairman Yin Jun. Attending were provincial party committee  Secretary Pu Chaozhu and Governor He Zhiqiang. The meeting  adopted the following two reports:    1. The Yunnan Provincial People's Congress Financial and  Economic Affairs Committee Report on the Implementation of the  1993 Yunnan Provincial National Economic and Social Development  Plan and on the Examination of the 1994 Yunnan Province Draft  National Economic and Social Development Plan;    2. The Yunnan Provincial People's Congress Financial and  Economic Affairs Committee Report on the Implementation of the  1993 Yunnan Provincial Financial Estimates and on the  Examination of the 1994 Yunnan Province Draft Financial  Estimates.    These two reports stated: Since both the 1994 Yunnan  Province Draft National Economic and Social Development Plan and  the 1994 Yunnan Provinc Draft Financial Estimates, which were  submitted by the Yunnan Provincial People's Government, tally  with the realities in Yunnan, it is thereby proposed that the  Second Session of the Eighth Yunnan Provincial People's Congress  adopt the two draft documents.    The meeting also adopted the following five resolutions: 1)  The Draft Resolution on the Yunnan Provincial People's  Government Work Report; 2) The Draft Resolution on the  Implementation of the 1993 Yunnan Provincial National Economic  and Social Development Plan and on the 1994 Yunnan Provincial  National Economic and Social Development Plan; 3) The Draft  Resolution on the Implementation of the 1993 Yunnan Provincial  Financial Estimates and on the 1994 Yunnan Provincial Financial  Estimates; 4) The Draft Resolution on the Work Report of the  Yunnan Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee; 5) The  Draft Resolution on the Work Report of the Yunnan Provincial  Higher People's Court and on the Work Report of the Yunnan  Provincial People's Procuratorate.    The meeting decided to print and distribute these five draft  resolutions among the delegations to the on-going congress  session for their deliberation.    The meeting also listened to the explanations made by He  Hualong, deputy director of the provincial party committee  organization department and deputy secretary general of the the  current congress session, on a draft namelist of candidates for  the relevant positions. After approving the draft namelist, the  meeting decided to submit the draft namelist in the name of the  presidium to the delegations attending the on-going congress  session for their deliberation.    The presidium meeting also solicited opinions from the  delegations to the current congress session on the above reports  submitted by the provincial people's government.    Governor He Zhiqiang delivered a speech in which he stated:  The deputies have advanced a host of proposals and views on how  improve the work of the provincial people's government. These  proposals and views are bound to contribute to the work of the  provincial people's government in 1994. We will sort out these  proposals and views; handle in a conscientious manner each and  every motion tabled by the deputies at the current congress  session according to official procedures; fully consider and  absorb their opinons on the provincial people's government work  report; and submit a revised provincial people's government work  report, together with a written explanation to all the presidium  executive chairmen for their examination.    Governor He Zhiqiang noted: The year 1994 is a crucial one  for Yunnan's reform, opening up, and economic construction. In  1994, Yunnan is to unfold a series of major reforms, as well as  large- scale, wide-ranging, and extremely difficult economic  structural readjustments. We inevitably will encounter some new  problems in this process, but we will exert our utmost efforts  to make much greater strides forward in building a socialist  market economy structure. We will continue to build projects  aimed at assisting poverty-stricken areas in accordance with the  State Council plan, as well as in light of the realities in  Yunnan. We will strengthen agricultural production in a  comprehensive way, as it is the foundation of China's national  economy. We will further expand our opening up to the outside  world and will carry out large-scale, comprehensive agricultural  exploitation across the province, with a view to developing a  high-yield, high-quality, and high-efficiency agriculture, and  to enhancing agriculture as the foundation of China's national  economy.    Governor He Zhiqiang said: This year, we are going to  observe the World Tourism Festival and the China Historical and  Cultural Tourism Festival, during which we will strive to open  up new vistas for the development of tourism in Yunnan. We also  have decided to concentrate human, material, and financial  resources on the construction of key projects. In order to push  forward reform and opening up, and to safeguard social and  political stability, the provincial people's government will  take a series of measures, and will try to achieve tangible  results in the comprehensive management of social order. While  accelerating the pace of inviting foreign capital and advanced  foreign technology, we also will try to build several large  projects with foreign capital and make new breakthroughs in  inviting foreign capital.    Governor He Zhiqiang asserted: In 1994, when confronting  arduous tasks and new difficulties, the provincial people's  government will try to absorb the proposals and views advanced  by the people's deputies at the current congress session; will  rely on the people of the whole province; will further  emancipate our minds; work harder; and score more achievements  under the leadership of the provincial party committee, and the  support and supervision of the provincial people's congress, as  well as the democratic supervision and support of the provincial  committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference. We will exert our utmost efforts to live up to the  trust placed in us by the people's deputies to the current  congress session!</p>

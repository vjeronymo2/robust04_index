			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / NHS ends nicotine patch payments THE National Health Service will no longer pay for nicotine smoking cessation patches, under proposals announced by the government yesterday. This is in spite of the government's declared policy that the number of smokers in the UK should be cut by a third by the year 2000. The proposal is part of a larger package detailing products which doctors will no longer be allowed to prescribe, part of the government's efforts to control the burgeoning NHS drugs bill which last year grew 14 per cent. The products range from Perrier, Malvern and Evian mineral waters to Ambre Solaire sun cream, aromatherapy massage oil, Johnson &amp; Johnson's prickly heat powder, Pickles' nail bite lotion, and Smith &amp; Nephew's Simple Talcum Powder. Details of the drugs to be included in the first of 10 categories on the new NHS blacklists were also given. The category, for topical anti-rheumatics, included 40 medicines. Among them were American Home Products' Algipan, SmithKline Beecham's Ralgex and its Beecham analgesic cream, Boots' Menthol and Wintergreen Embrocation, and Culpepper's Healing ointment. Companies and patient groups now have a month in which to respond. The Department of Health said the advisory committees deciding which drugs should be included in the other nine categories were due to report before the end of the year. These include oral contraceptives, anti-diarrhoeals, hypnotics and anxiolytics, and skin diseases. Dr Brian Mawhinney, minister for health, said: 'Our proposals will not disadvantage patients. A full range of other products remain available on the NHS.' Nicotine patches had a role to play in helping some people stop smoking, but people who could afford to smoke could also afford to buy products that help them give up, he said. The main smoking cessation products no longer available on prescription are were Nicabate, marketed by Marion Merrell Dow of the US, and Nicorette, sold by Kabi of Sweden. Nicotinell from Ciba in Switzerland was already not available on the NHS.</p>

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Greens want Third World debt cancelled The Green party yesterday launched its European election manifesto, urging the cancellation of most Third World debt and an end to the use of nuclear power. The manifesto combines the Green antipathy to free trade with a call for European Union membership to be open to any country in Europe. It spells out the party's opposition to the European single market and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The Greens believe the agreements 'undermine local economic initiatives and environmental standards'. They are also opposed to a single European currency. In the last European election, in 1989, the Greens gained 14.9 per cent of the vote. Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, calls in its manifesto for reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and for British acceptance of the Maastricht treaty's social chapter. Mr Dafydd Wigley, party leader, said subsidiarity was 'equally applicable to the relationship between Cardiff and London as it is to the case of London and Brussels'.

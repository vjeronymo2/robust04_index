			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC;  </P> <P> REBA'S FINE VOICE AGAINST DULL SONGS  </P> <P> Reba McEntire confirmed an old adage at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim: It's  not the singer, it's the song.  </P> <P> McEntire is a gifted, intense vocalist with soaring power and a firmly  controlled country quaver. Despite those advantages, the singer from Oklahoma  wallowed in dullness for most of Friday's 70-minute early show. That will  happen when a concert is devoted mainly to hit fodder culled from Nashville  music mills.  </P> <P> The standoff between a fine voice and uninvolving songs finally ended, but only  when McEntire reached back 20 years or more for some worthy material.  </P> <P> Singing a close-to-the-original take on Aretha Franklin's "Respect" might not  have been the height of imagination, but it was a singular achievement for a  country singer to pull it off without being overshadowed by the source.  </P> <P> McEntire also brought an edge and a some convincing role-playing to her remake  of "Fancy," Bobbie Gentry's 1969 tale of a poor country girl who climbs the  ladder of success by selling her body to rich gents. As usual, McEntire encored  with a tour-de-force,a cappella treatment of Patsy Cline's "Sweet Dreams."  </P> <P> McEntire spent far more time singing middle-of-the-road, pop-country hybrids.  It was as if she were trying to be like another brassy redhead, Bette Midler,  only with an Oklahoma twang. That wasn't the wind beneath McEntire's spurs --  it was the ersatz waft of synthesized strings and the schmaltzy, hollow  tinkling of digital keyboards, used as a cushion against intrusions of realism.  </P> <P> The only hints of traditional country style came in a Western swing dance  number inserted so McEntire could change outfits, and in a long medley of  heartbroken ballads. It was no great loss that the songs in the medley were  truncated, because few of them rose beyond a rote familiarity of sentiment and  expression.  </P> <P> McEntire could use some spare, tradition-minded country arrangements. It also  wouldn't hurt for her to get in touch with some songwriters whose material is  personal and individual. After six years as one of country music's two or three  most popular female singers, she needs to get it into her head that a  distinctive talent shouldn't be wasted on songs that sound as if they were  bought off the rack.

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Call for inquiry into Aero Hamble float A Labour MP will be writing to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, this weekend calling for a DTI inquiry into the flotation of Aerostructures Hamble, the Southampton aircraft components maker. Mr John Denham, MP for Southampton Itchen, has already tabled a Commons motion seeking an inquiry 'to establish if any relevant information which could have been disclosed in the prospectus was withheld and, if so, by whom and to whose benefit'. Aerostructures was floated at 120p a share in June. Last week it issued a second profits warning following production difficulties, and the shares fell to 24p. Yesterday the shares were 31p, off  1/2 p. The company is now seeking a new chief executive to replace Mr Andy Barr, who accepted early retirement without compensation last week. Mr Barr made Pounds 1.75m from the flotation. Yesterday the management and representatives of NM Rothschild, the company's advisers, were in Scotland, continuing this week's round of talks with shareholders who have watched the value of their investment fall by 80 per cent in just five months. Mr Denham said yesterday that he was concerned about the future of the company as many of its workers lived in his constituency. Aerostructures is sited in the neighbouring Eastleigh constituency. Mr David Chidgey, the Liberal Democrat who won the Eastleigh by-election, said yesterday he 'believed it was unconventional' that Mr Denham had not approached him before tabling the motion on Aerostructures. Mr Chidgey, who once worked for Folland - a predecessor company of Aerostructures, is due to meet the management next week. He said he had spoken to the management and Rothschild in Scotland yesterday, and had been delighted by their positive assurances and commitment to putting together a programme for 1995.</p>

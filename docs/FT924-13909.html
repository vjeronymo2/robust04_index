			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Dan-Air in talks on rescue with BA DAVIES &amp; Newman Holdings, owner of the Dan-Air airline, is in rescue talks with British Airways after abandoning negotiations with Mr Richard Branson, owner of Virgin Atlantic Airways, writes Paul Betts. British Airways yesterday refused to comment on whether it was considering the rescue of Dan-Air. It appears to have been approached by Mr David James, Davies &amp; Newman's company doctor-chairman, and may be re-examining the Gatwick carrier after ending talks last month. Airline industry analysts said BA might be put off any salvage operation if that entailed lengthy regulatory hurdles from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Last night British Midland expressed concern at a possible BA/Dan-Air link and said it would call for scrutiny by the MMC and regulators in Brussels. Mr Branson said that if his withdrawal resulted in 'letting in a big bad wolf . . . then Virgin European Airways will be born'. He believes that sufficient routes would be shed to enable him to set up a niche carrier. Hopes have faded that Dan-Air can survive as an independent entity without a substantial partner and refinancing. It is feared that this year's losses will take the pre-tax deficit for the past three years towards the Pounds 100m mark. The parent company looks certain to breach its ceiling for bank borrowings this winter. LTU, the German travel group, refused to comment on Dan-Air yesterday. After buying the Thomas Cook travel agency chain, it is looking at other areas of the holiday industry. Lex, Page 22</p>

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Computer confidence 'growing' CONFIDENCE is growing among suppliers of computers and software for UK manufacturing industry after three years of reduced spending. Exhibitors at this week's Computers in Manufacturing Show at Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre said yesterday they were looking forward to increased orders, and believe the constraints imposed on spending by finance directors are being relaxed. 'It was definitely the best show for four years,' said Mr Patrick Cockell, director of Fourth Shift, the Crawley-based supplier of software and services. Mr Cockell said he had felt the three-day show would be a good test of whether the downturn in spending had ended. 'Three years of pent-up demand are coming to the surface,' he added. Ms Sara McKinnon, marketing manager for Bracknell-based Parametric Technology (UK), said: 'People were not rushing up wanting to spend money straightaway, but at least they were building spending into next year's plans. That was not happening last year.' Parametric, which along with Fourth Shift and most of the industry is US-owned, is a supplier of Cadcam (computer-aided design and manufacturing) software. The increased optimism was underlined by attendance figures for the show - up 56 per cent from last year at 10,882, said Mr Andy Center, the show's marketing director. A survey released at the show by Benchmark Research, a market-research company, predicts that spending by UK manufacturers will rise to Pounds 1.41bn in the 12 months from this summer, up Pounds 33m from Pounds 1.37bn in 1992-93. The latest figure is still a long way short of the Pounds 1.75bn spent in 1989-90. But Mr Ian Parkes, Benchmark's managing director, said that prices for information technology had dropped sharply, and the number of UK manufacturing sites had fallen by 9 per cent since 1989. The figures show that manufacturers' spending on computers has weathered the recession better than other areas of capital equipment such as machine tools. The survey discloses clear opportunities for suppliers to expand the industrial IT market, but suggests vendors could speed up the process by improving their understanding of customers' businesses. The Benchmark figures are for computers, software and services used in manufac-turing applications, and exclude purely office-based spending such as word processors.</p>

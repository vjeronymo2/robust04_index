			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TITAN COACH BEING PROBED ABOUT CALLS;  </P> <P> FULLERTON: SOURCE TELLS UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS THAT PLAYERS HAVE USED COACH'S  OFFICE PHONE IN VIOLATION OF NCAA RULES.  </P> <P> The Cal State Fullerton athletic department is investigating allegations that  women's volleyball team members were allowed to use coach Jim Huffman's office  telephone to make long-distance calls, a violation of NCAA rules, school  officials have confirmed.  </P> <P> "We are looking into the phone questions," Athletic Director Ed Carroll said  Thursday.  </P> <P> Carroll said a complaint from "a single source" prompted the inquiry. Carroll  and Fullerton Associate Athletic Director Leanne Grotke declined to say who  made the allegation.  </P> <P> Huffman told a reporter that within the past two weeks "Leanne (Grotke) asked  me if I'd let anybody make long-distance phone calls and I said, 'No.' "  </P> <P> Huffman, who was named head coach in 1989, said the rules prohibiting  student-athletes from using their coaching staff's office telephones are "kind  of nebulous."  </P> <P> "You can't do anything . . . for an athlete that you wouldn't do for anybody  else," Huffman said. "I can't lend an athlete my car because I wouldn't lend  just anybody my car. On top of that, you can't give an advantage" to a  student-athlete.  </P> <P> "If I let kids come in and make long-distance calls that would be an  advantage," Huffman said. He added that such an advantage would be an improper  enticement in recruiting athletes from out-of-state.  </P> <P> Assistant volleyball coach Marlon Sano, who shares Huffman's small office, told  a reporter that, "Sometimes there will be calls made to home" if, for example,  a student has left something at home.  </P> <P> "(But) we never gave any permission to make long-distance calls," Sano said.  "We just flat out didn't."  </P> <P> Huffman replaced Fran Cummings, who resigned under pressure. In his first  season, Huffman's team broke a 34-match Big West Conference losing streak by  upsetting then-18th-ranked San Diego State. But the Titans finished with an  8-23 record, 1-17 in the conference.  </P> <P> Part of the rationale for hiring Huffman was his ability to raise funds for the  volleyball program. Huffman said that last year's fund-raisers accounted for  about $15,000. His goal is $30,000 this year.  </P> <P> The funds, which have been raised largely by putting on grass-court tournaments  open to the public, have increased the volleyball program's scholarships from  six the year before he was hired to 11, Huffman said.  </P></p>

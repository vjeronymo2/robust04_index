But this  catastrophical situation did not come about all at once. Our  current woes are bitter payment for entire decades of  thoughtless decisions and actions.    My career in pharmaceuticals began many years ago. In the  early 1970s I was already the director of the department of  molecular pharmacology and radiobiology at the Moscow Medical  Institute No 2. Once I had the occasion to talk with a certain  highly placed worker at the USSR Council of Ministers on the  state of medical science. I said then that in another 10-15  years our state would be completely dependent upon the West for  pharmaceuticals. Domestic medical industry was developing at a  loss, a large share of capital investments was being sent to the  GDR, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Bulgaria, while our  pharmaceutical factories were shutting down. A crisis was to be  expected. I was asked to write all of this down and take the  materials over to the Council of Ministers.    I worked daily for a month and a half on my concept of the  state of pharmaceutical science in the country. Then, after  sending the materials I began waiting for a response. But  unfortunately no one made the effort to answer me. Then I sent a  letter to the CPSU Central Committee. Once again there was no  reply.    In the heyday of perestroyka I was invited together with  Academician M. Mashkovskiy and Academician R. Glushkov to join  Gorbachev's staff, and we were asked to draft a presidential  edict on pharmaceuticals. For 3 months we conducted serious  analytical work, which culminated in a draft edict. It's not  known whose fault it was, but this edict never was signed. For  years I appeared before public health committees of the Russia  and the USSR, roamed the ministry hallways, and expended energy  trying to prove something patently obvious--people need  pharmaceuticals as much as they need bread.    In late 1991 a concrete, fully thought out Russian state  program was finally drawn up and approved. The strategic line of  development of pharmaceutical science and of provision of  medicines to the population was finally defined ``on paper.''  But alas, once again things never went farther than this.    As before, the country continues to lack a unified program  of  research in pharmacology. We have over 40 medical VUZes, and all  of them have pharmacology departments, but no one is  coordinating their work. The absence of planning and control  encourages inactivity.    On the other hand the road that must be traveled by  medicines  already in existence to the patient is infinitely complex and  long. So much coordination with numerous committees, commissions  and experts councils must be done! It takes an average of 10-12  years to create a new pharmaceutical, while the process of  introduction sometimes drags on for decades! Often an original  preparation that we could have produced for ourselves and sold  abroad grows obsolete, never getting beyond the paperwork stage.  In the meantime in developed countries it usually takes 2-3  years to introduce a high quality preparation.    Why does this happen? There's no secret here. We simply lack  a nationwide system for the synthesis and introduction of  pharmaceuticals, and we do not have a unified sector producing  them. Throughout the world, pharmaceuticals are made by huge  firms in which the processes of scientific development of  pharmaceuticals and their introduction into production are  combined. In our country we do not have a single firm of this  kind. And consequently a preparation that comes into being in  some university department also often ``dies'' there, having  been unable to make it into production. Another misfortune lies  in the fact that our pharmaceutical enterprises have fallen far  behind modern requirements in terms of their equipment.    As I see it, one of the greatest misfortunes is the absence  of state orders for medicinal resources. Consequently we also  lack a program for providing the country with pharmaceuticals,  one based on a clear idea of what we have for today, what  preparations are suitable for use, and which have become  hopelessly obsolete, what will be needed tomorrow, including the  amount that will have to be purchased abroad, and precisely what  will have to purchased there. We do not have any kind of service  that could determine the population's demand for  pharmaceuticals, draw up state orders, and distribute  pharmaceuticals in optimum fashion!    No country in the world can completely satisfy its demand  for  pharmaceuticals by its own production. Japan for example, which  has a highly developed pharmaceutical industry, imports many  more pharmaceuticals than it exports. Clearly it would be  impossible and unsuitable for Russia to do away with imports of  pharmaceuticals. But today the ratio between exports and imports  is 1:20. This is of course extremely disadvantageous to the  country, which has all of the potential to make this ratio equal  to 1:2 or 1:3.    In the last year the pharmaceutical supply situation became  even more tragic. The collapse of the economy, and the  tumultuous and inarticulate confusion in the higher echelons of  power have had a devastating effect on the supply of  pharmaceuticals to the common people. The pharmacies are empty,  while the warehouses are overfilled--they are holding  pharmaceuticals back in anticipation of new, even fantastically  higher prices. What is the Russian Ministry of Health doing in  this situation?    In the last 15-20 years--that is after it was separated out  of the Ministry of Medical and Microbiological Industry, the  Ministry of Health has done nothing about pharmaceuticals, and  for practical purposes it has even avoided drawing up state  orders.    The Extraordinary Pharmaceutical Committee was organized in  August 1991, but because of its total incompetence it didn't do  anything, and it was soon abolished.    Then Academician A. I. Vorobyev organized an expert council  on pharmaceuticals when he became minister. His work also  recalled running in place. When the council held meetings,  foreign firms always had their ears to the wall, and their  interests were defended by experts discussing the fate of a  given preparation. And in my opinion it was not until the new  minister assumed his post that we finally began fighting the  flawed system of distributing and selling pharmaceuticals, one  in which the state appropriated millions of rubles' worth of  foreign currency to acquire pharmaceuticals abroad, while  patients continued to remain without therapeutic assistance.  ``Glorious'' was the legacy left to the new minister. Western  states had given us loans for the purchase of pharmaceuticals,  but as a result of unforgivable mismanagement they were returned  unused. Large sums of foreign currency idled in safes of the  Pharmacological Committee. Its former chairman visited companies  in different countries of the world 10-15 times each year. And  even now he continues to manage international ties in the  Pharmacological Committee!    The new minister is not responding to the administration's  lead, he is trying to fight it, and this does him honor. But it  is very important for him to create a team of people around him  from different fields of pharmacological industry and  pharmacological science, a team of honest people of like mind.  It is extremely necessary to distribute orders for imported  preparations as quickly as possible--after all, thousands of  people are waiting!    And of course, we need to change the system under which all  hard currency is transferred to local public health departments.  Pharmaceutical merchants have rushed headlong to them, easily  finding a common language with people who have little  understanding of the highly complex issues of purchasing  imported preparations. The coordinating role must remain with  the Center. Otherwise this idiotic waste of state resources will  continue unavoidably. And after all, we have very few of these  resources left.</p>

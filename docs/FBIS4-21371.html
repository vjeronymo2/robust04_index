			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article from the "Environment and Development" column by </F> Lilia Duery A.]    [Text] Simple, comprehensive, integrating, realistic, and  feasible are some of the words that describe the Basic  Environment Law (No. 19300). This law that took 14 months to be  approved by Congress was implemented on 9 March after its  publication in the official gazette.    In the opinion of the law's authors, the instruments that  outline the future of Chile's environmental actions are inspired  in an integrating approach capable of granting, without going  into details, key and generic guidelines for all national  environmental problems. In other words, the easiest path was  chosen, taking into account that with rules at hand it is easier  to solve problems and progressively tackle each of the  situations the country must face in this field. This will be  done through the respective regulations that will be implemented  over time.    The basic law is divided into 94 articles in addition to  three transitory articles. It consists, basically, of a series  of definitions and principles regarding its importance, in  administration and institutional instruments that will allow its  implementation, and in a system to define responsibility for  damaging the environment.    This new law includes (discarding the idea of codifying in a  single text the various important regulations in force regarding  the environment in Chile) two main instruments that will make  its implementation feasible. National Environment Commission  (Conama) executive secretary Rafael Asenjo referred to these  instruments.  <H5>  Key Instruments </H5>   The main instrument is the System for the Assessment of the  Impact on the Environment [Sistema de Evaluacion de Impacto  Ambiental -- SEIA] that, according to Asenjo, in addition to its  preventive nature regarding Chilean production activities, deals  with the international competition demanded in sustainable  development. It includes procedures for the establishment of  standards for emissions, quality, and environmental terms,  giving the productive sector (either public or private) full  autonomy to choose its own technology to attain these goals.    It also includes prevention or decontamination plans,  whatever is needed, that can resort to market instruments such  as a "permit for negotiable emissions." Here again the law  grants business people the freedom to reach agreements among  themselves for the fulfillment of environment quality standards  for a specific area. Rafael Asenjo said: "Once rules for the  use of this mechanism have been defined, we believe it will  greatly contribute to a progressive, gradual, and sustained  reduction of pollution levels."    This chapter also includes plans for the handling of natural  resources, the improvement of the National Wild Areas System  protected by the state, and the citizenry's participation,  especially regarding their right to be kept informed on  environment-related studies.  <H5>  New Public Service </H5>   The second instrument of the law is of an institutional  nature. In fact, Conama ceases to be an advisory commission to  become a public service, with legal status and its own  patrimony. Its main role will be to integrate and coordinate  the environmental activities of all sectors of the public  administration that have any say in the matter. The executive  council formed by 10 ministers and the Conama executive director  also is created.    This organization, in turn, will operate in a d|?ntralized  manner throug?espective regional environment commissions  (Coremas) and will act as a horizontal structure at the  government level that will be supervised by the president of the  Republic through the ministry secretary general of the  presidency, a privileged interlocutor between the government and  the community. Moreover, Conama will be in charge of revising  and periodically (every five years) updating the regulations  issued regarding various subjects. In this case, surveillance  will be absolutely by sectors, except in the case of complaints,  in which case this service is in charge of making sure the law  is respected. In this regard, it should be pointed out that  people may approach the city halls authorized to hear the  complaint and channel it to the respective Corema or the main  office if necessary, under threat of a court ruling if it fails  to do so.  <H5>  Regional Model </H5>   In one way or another, this law contains and expresses the  principles "whoever contaminates pays" (in other words, whoever  contaminates must include in his costs what it will cost to  decontaminate), as well as the "gradualism" and "realism"  principles.    Rafael Asenjo said: "This is the result of having explicitly  tackled the subject from an integrative and comprehensive  viewpoint for the first time in Chilean law." Therefore, he  added, when we start to apply the law "we will take a necessary  quantitative step forward in our country's environmental  activities."    In this sense Asenjo believes there is a more optimistic  future for Chile, noting that the laws dictated during the past  years by the Latin American countries have not followed this  model. He commented that despite the huge economic and human  resources they have earmarked, their environmental problems have  not been reduced. "We believe the reason for this failure in the  region has been the attempt to solve everything at once with the  same law and having created a fully sectorial institutional  scheme that has lead nowhere and caused the various ministries  to compete with each other," Asenjo commented.    Specific regulations are necessary now to start applying the  environment law.</p>

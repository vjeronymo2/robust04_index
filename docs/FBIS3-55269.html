			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Ivanov] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 6 TASS -- Russian Deputy Prime  Minister Aleksandr Shokhin said he did not know if he would  remain in the government after a new cabinet reshuffle.    In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Thursday, Shokhin said  that  a draft decree on the reorganisation of the government has been  seen only by two people -- President Boris Yeltsin himself and  Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. "Neither I, nor other  deputy prime ministers to whom I have spoken have not been  involved in the work on a new structure of the government."    He pointed out that "this is not the best variant of  reorganisation when deputy prime ministers are excluded from  preparatory work."    Shoknin said that according to newspapers the number of  federal ministers will be reduced and some state committees will  be reorganised into ministries or other federal services.    Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said earlier  today  that the upcoming cabinet reshuffle will considerably reduce the  number of ministers in the Federal Government. He said that  "the number of ministers will be reduced sharply. There will be  not more than 30 of them" in the government. He vowed that "the  reduction will not hamper the government's work, but rather make  it more efficient."    Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Shumeyko said that "a  decree on the reorganisation of the government will be signed by  the president either today or tomorrow."    Speaking about his future, Shokhin said that if "the foreign  economic bloc of the government 'dissolves' in the economic one,  I will have to go to the State Duma" where he hopes to head its  Foreign Affairs Committee, provided it will also handle foreign  economic issues and CIS problems. "Though I have some other  variants as well," he added.    He admitted that if Boris Fedorov is chosen to handle  foreign  economic issues in the government "it will be easier for me to  express my politicised point of view on what he will be doing  from the parliament rostrum."</p>

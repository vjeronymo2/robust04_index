			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Big pay lag for women reported BRITISH women working in banking and finance earn 53 per cent of men's earnings in the same sector in an average month, according to figures from the Equal Opportunities Commission. It says that is a lower percentage than women receive in eight other European Community countries. The figures also show that Britain is second from the bottom in a league of 11 countries for average female manual industrial earnings as a proportion of men's earnings per hour. Only Luxembourg is lower. The figure for industry is the more accurate because a comparison of average monthly earnings tends to widen the difference between men's and women's earnings because women work shorter hours. The research found that more women in the UK worked part-time than elsewhere. In 1990 there were nearly 15m women part-timers in the EC - 5m of whom were in the UK. The commission argues that the tendency for part-time jobs to be low paid is an important factor in the gap between men's and women's earnings in the UK. Other factors include fragmented collective bargaining structures and the lack of a minimum wage. The research supports indications that while a higher percentage of women work in the UK, the gap between the earnings of men and women is among the widest in Europe. Earnings' comparisons are hampered by the lack of data for certain countries. Both comparison groups contained France, Germany and Denmark. Women and Men in Britain 1992.

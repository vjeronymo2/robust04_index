			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / International Company News: Commerzbank looks to expand in S Africa Commerzbank is considering buying a bank in South Africa, with a view to expanding its activities in the country, Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, chief executive, said, Reuter reports from Frankfurt. The bank is considering enlarging its financial involvement in South Africa by up to 50 per cent, he said. With an exposure of more that DM1.6bn (Dollars 1.02bn) in South Africa, Commerzbank was already more heavily involved than Germany's other big banks. Its lending covers trade and sovereign loans, as well as project financing in the steel, aluminium and power sectors. Mr Kohlhaussen said the bank planned to establish an 'operating unit' in the country, possibly before the end of this year. It would do this by either buying a bank in which it would take over management, or by setting up a branch or subsidiary. He said there were several small banks on the market which could be bought for between DM10m and DM20m.</p>

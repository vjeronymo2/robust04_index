			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 24--The summit-level dialogue  between India and Singapore today yielded three important  agreements on avoiding double taxation, shipping, and tourism,  as official circles today described the visit of the Singapore  Prime Minister, Mr. Goh Chok Tong, as one of "far-reaching  significance."    The agreements apart, the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha  Rao, and the visiting dignitary, are understood to have opened  vistas of wide-ranging economic cooperation, and even discussed  specific projects at their level at a one-to-one meeting, after  which they led their respective delegations in a 90-minute  dialogue.    The Singapore leader arrived here last evening on a  week-long  official visit and will be the Chief Guest at the Republic Day  function. He and Mrs Goh called on the President, Dr. Shankar  Dayal Sharma, and Mrs. Vimala Sharma.    Mr. Goh's high-level delegation includes his Foreign  Minister, Prof. S. Jayakumar, and the Minister for Trade and  Industry, Mr. Yeo Cheow Tong, besides a host of senior  officials, and 36 leading members of the Singapore business  community.    The President hosted a lunch in honor of the visiting  dignitary and it was attended by Mr. Rao and his Cabinet  colleagues. At the end of the day, the spokesman of the External  Affairs Ministry noted that the "atmospherics were excellent,  and the talks substantive in content which went beyond  expressions of goodwill."  <H5>  Invitation to Rao </H5>   He said the specific areas of cooperation were discussed at  the level of the Prime Ministers. The Singapore leader is  understood to have invited Mr. Rao to his country at the  earliest opportunity.    While the two leaders discussed regional issues as well as  the overall prospects for economic cooperation in their  one-to-one interaction of just over half an hour, the thrust of  the entire exercise today was undoubtedly economic.    Hosting a banquet for the visiting leader, Mr. Rao said  India  looked forward to a further expansion of relations with the  ASEAN, with which it was a sectoral dialogue partner. Singapore  is an ASEAN member.    Mr. Rao also noted that cooperation between India and  Singapore could extend to third country projects and hoped that  Mr. Goh's visit would provide a "timely and strong impetus."  Singapore's resources of capital, technology, and managerial  expertise could find excellent net- working with India's  agricultural and mineral wealth, skilled manpower and markets,  he said.    Tourism, housing, shipping, road-building and the setting up  of corridors in India from which joint India-Singapore  endeavours could thrust out to export markets, were understood  to have been some of the concrete areas of discussion between  the two countries today.    The suggestion here today was that in the area of tourism  Singapore could act as a "funnel" for India, if the necessary  infrastructure and facilities were available in this country.    In this context, it is understood, India could amend its  laws  to permit Singapore Airlines to operate at airports so far  restricted to domestic air services. It is expected this would  be to augment the tourist inflow.    Property development in the country with Singapore finance,  and low-cost middle-class housing, and private road-building, in  which Singapore is said to have considerable expertise, were  also believed to be areas of active discussion.    The broad sense available here is that Singapore could  become  a routing point of economic inflow of diverse sources if the  Governments of the two countries could reach effective mutual  understanding.    In the discussion between the two Prime Ministers, the  spokesman said, the Singapore leader suggested that the ambit of  India's dialogue with the ASEAN could be expanded. For now India  is a sectoral dialogue partner of the ASEAN. He also briefed Mr.  Rao on the November summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) at Seattle.    Mr. Goh said he was gratified to note that India's "focus"  was now "turning to the east," and it had integrated its economy  with the world economy.  <H5>  Dialogue with Pak. </H5>   For his part, Mr. Rao told his guest that India was open for  a dialogue with Pakistan and wanted good-neighbourly relations  with that country. The Prime Minister referred to the Shimla  agreement, and said India would like a dialogue with Pakistan to  get under way under this agreement.    The two leaders also discussed the role of the major Asian  economies, i.e., Japan, China and India, the spokesman noted.  Developments within the APEC were also discussed.    At the corporate level, the spokesman said, a "strategic  framework for cooperation" was signed between the Confederation  of Indian Industry (CII) and Singapore Manufacturers'  Association (SMA).    Mr. Goh is scheduled to meet the captains of Indian industry  tomorrow. The Minister for Shipping and Surface Transport, Mr.  Jagdish Tytler, and the Minister for Communications, Mr. Sukh  Ram, are to call on the Singapore leader tomorrow.    The Singapore Prime Minister is due to visit Agra on January  27, from where he is scheduled to go to Bangalore the next day  to inaugurate a Technology Park set up in cooperation with his  country. Before he flies out on January 30 from Bombay, Mr. Goh  is to launch the office in that city of the Development Bank of  Singapore.</p>

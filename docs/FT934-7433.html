			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Barratt urges Budget caution SIR LAWRIE Barratt yesterday joined the growing number of construction company chiefs to appeal to the government not to damage the housing market in the Budget. Sir Lawrie, chairman of Barratt, one of Britain's best known housebuilders, told shareholders at the company's annual meeting that speculation about measures in the Budget had dented the confidence of potential purchasers during the past two months. Construction companies and building materials suppliers are concerned that the chancellor may damage one of the few markets showing signs of recovery by further reducing the rate of mortgage tax relief. This is already planned to fall from 25 per cent to 20 per cent from next April. Sir Lawrie said that any further reduction could undermine the modest improvement in house sales achieved this year. He said that the company had increased house sale by 25 per cent since July 1 compared with the corresponding period. Comparisons, however, were against a severely disrupted trading period last year following sterling's withdrawal from the ERM and the re-introduction of stamp duty on house purchases. Nevertheless, the group expected to achieve its target of 5,750 houses in the current financial year, Sir Lawrie said. The housing market in the US was also improving. Sales since July 1 were 15 per cent higher than during the corresponding period last year. Mr Peter Parkin, chairman of Raine, the housebuilder and contractor, also reported a rise in new house sales compared with 'the exceptionally low levels of the comparative period last year.' Mr Parkin, speaking at the annual meeting, said the group had experienced its 'traditional autumn surge in interest from potential home buyers' with strong rises in visitor levels and net reservations. The southern Californian market, unlike other parts of the US, was still experiencing difficulties, said Mr Parkin. He added that if the UK housing market remained buoyant, borrowings at the end of the financial year would be only slightly higher than at end-June this year.</p>

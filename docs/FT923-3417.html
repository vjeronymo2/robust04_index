			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Letter: Turn BES property investment into something longer-term Sir, When the government decided to revive the private rented housing sector in 1999, it chose to do so by encouraging individuals to invest through the Business Expansion Scheme (BES), although the scheme was always designed to provide equity for companies for five years only. It is now considered that this period is too short for investment in the housing market and so attempts are being made to find alternative, longer-term finance, as described in John Willman's article 'A welcome mat for the rental market', (September 8). So far more than Pounds 1bn has been raised from private investors under the BES and this has cost the government about Pounds 400m in tax relief. All alternative schemes being proposed include some form of government fiscal incentive. Yet the BES is to be abolished next year and private investors putting money into publicly accountable companies are to be cut out as a funding source. However, many BES investors might welcome the opportunity of turning their five-year investment into something longer term. Such a move would prevent many properties currently owned by BES companies returning to owner occupation at the end of the period, adding to the market overhang from next year. Although additional sources of finance will be needed to increase the amount of housing available for rent, common sense dictates that the government should begin by maximising the return on its own investment by encouraging individuals to become long-term investors.

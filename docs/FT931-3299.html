			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Lopez to leave GM after all GENERAL Motors' global buying chief, Mr J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, is, after all, leaving the US carmaker, it was revealed late yesterday. His departure was announced at a GM press conference, but it was not clear where Mr Lopez would be moving to. Earlier in the day, Volkswagen's shares had fallen on the Frankfurt stock exchange as it appeared that the German carmaker had failed in its attempt to poach Mr Lopez. VW shares slipped DM7.30 to DM285.50 after the weekend's surprise announcement that Mr Lopez was to stay in Detroit. An expected fall in VW profits and a cut in the dividend from DM11 to DM5 or less, due to be confirmed at a meeting of the VW supervisory board today, had been widely discounted. GM had been expected to announce at yesterday's conference in Detroit that Mr Lopez was being promoted to executive vice-president, with much greater responsibility for the group's North American manufacturing operations. Volkswagen yesterday repeated that although the company and Mr Lopez had both signed a contract for him to join the German group within weeks, it would not come into effect 'for the time being'. The company refused to comment on speculation that Mr Lopez had been 'persuaded' to stay by a further promotion within GM or the US group's insistence on his respecting a clause in his contract preventing him from moving directly to a competitor. However, Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW's chief executive, made plain on Sunday that Mr Lopez had come under pressure through 'persistent interventions' from within GM. This pressure followed a statement last Thursday from Mr John Smith, GM president, in which he tacitly accepted that he had lost the battle to hold on to one of his most valuable executives. Mr Lopez's most important contribution had been 'the organisation of a strategy, a team and a process to achieve cost-reduction benefits throughout the corporation', he said. These are precisely the contributions Mr Piech urgently needs to restructure VW's cost-base and revive profitability.</p>

			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> TAIL WIND ROBS JUMPER OF RECORD  </P> <P> China's Li Hurong beat her own world mark for the triple jump today, but  because of a tail wind it won't go into the record books, officials said.  </P> <P> Li leaped 46 feet, 9 inches, bettering her mark by 3 1/2 inches, but was aided  by gusts of close to six m.p.h. Any wind more than 4.5 m.p.h. disqualifies a  performance from being recognized as a record.  </P> <P> The Chinese star competed at the Mikio Oda Memorial Track and Field meet in  Hiroshima. Her jump placed her ahead of American Sheila Hudson (45-11 1/2) and  Japan's Minako Isogai (41-8 3/4).  </P> <P> Kenny Harrison of the United States won the men's event, soaring 58-2 1/2, also  a wind-aided jump.  </P></p>

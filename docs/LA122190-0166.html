			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COLTS SAY MEYER WILL STAY IN '91  </P> <P> Indianapolis Colts owner Robert Irsay said today that Coach Ron Meyer will  return for the 1991 season, but other changes in the coaching staff will be  made.  </P> <P> Irsay delivered the vote of confidence in his head coach after speculation this  season that Meyer would be replaced.  </P> <P> The Colts, 6-8, still have an outside shot at the playoffs.  </P> <P> "Ron will be here next year," Irsay said. "He has a contract for next year and  we're going to keep him.  </P> <P> "We're going to make some other changes, which we won't know until after (Jan.  1)," Irsay said.  </P> <P> Meyer took over at the end of the 1986 season, leading the team to three  victories after it lost its first 13 games. The Colts won the AFC East with a  9-6 mark in the strike-shortened 1987 season, and had 9-7 and 8-8 marks the  last two seasons.  </P></p>

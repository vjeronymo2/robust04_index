ROMPRES 8/3/1994 -- Oliviu Gherman,  president of the Party of Social Democracy of Romania, told a  news conference on 8 March that the recent government reshuffle  was, "like everywhere in the world and the more so in a country  in transition, a natural and constitutional way of improving the  activity of the executive." In that context, Oliviu Gherman  stressed his party's readiness to continuously improve the  government activity by associating personalities "adjusted the  new requirements of the Romanian society."    The recent government reshuffle meant the replacement of the  ministers of defence, the interior, transport, and justice.    Ioan Solcanu, vice-president of the ruling party, said that  his party's negotiations with the Social Democratic Party, the  Christian Democratic National Peasant Party and the Democratic  Party (National Salvation Front) were not fortuitous. "Their  purpose was to probe those parties' attitude in the event that  the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] would propose a  minority, one-colour government, improved with technocrats."  Also, Ioan Solcanu said that the current government reshuffle,  tacitly accepted by the Romanian National Unity Party, completed  a first round of consultations, that with the parties of the  majority parliamentary coalition. For the time being, Ioan  Solcanu said, the formula proposed by the National Peasant  Christian Democratic Party (a government formed by the  PDSR-Democratic Convention and Democratic Party) could not be  achieved. The PDSR's intention, Ioan Solcanu recognized, was to  single out through those political dialogues the possibilities  to speed up the reform through an agreement of the parties of  the whole political arena.</p>

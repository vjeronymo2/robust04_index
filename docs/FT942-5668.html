			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Non-stick finish for textiles Textile chemists have searched hard for a treatment that prolongs the life of clothing and home furnishings, writes Neil Shuttleworth. Ciba of Switzerland and Du Pont of the US (owner of the Teflon trademark) have come up with the Teflon fabric protector, which provides lasting stain protection for rain and leisure wear. It also keeps water and stains off awnings and garden upholstery. The finish is derived from the chemical material used on non-stick pans. The fluorocarbons are linked to the textile fibre to form an invisible, odourless, colourless, durable film. 'We see the products as being alternatives to silicon- and paraffin-based products because of their superior oil and water repellent effects,' says Alan McDonald, head of marketing for textile finishing agents. Unusual applications include hot air balloons and parachutes. Ciba: UK, 0625 618585.</p>

			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Oil tanker operators endorse new code OIL TANKER operators yesterday welcomed new proposals to keep tankers farther away from sensitive UK coastlines, but warned that freight rates could rise and that it would be hard to find safe new shipping routes. The oil industry has agreed with the Department of Transport to draw up a voluntary code to ban tankers from some coastal waters including the Fair Isle Strait near the Shetland Islands, where the tanker Braer was wrecked last month. Also covered are the Scilly Isles, the Minches between Scotland's west coast and the Outer Hebrides, and the Pentland Firth between Scotland and Orkney. The new routes will be endorsed in May. One oil industry representative who attended this week's meeting with the department said 'there was not a lot of resistance to the proposals  - the industry would rather do this on a voluntary basis than have regulation slapped on it'. Waters up to 500m around the wreck of the Braer were declared a prohibited area yesterday. The department made an order under the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 designating the remains of the ship a dangerous wreck.</p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Record Pounds 3.4m awarded for injury A 37-year-old woman left paralysed after a motorway accident was yesterday awarded record compensation of Pounds 3.4m. Ms Christine Leung from Solihull, West Midlands, suffered severe spinal injuries when the car in which she was a passenger crashed after swerving to avoid luggage which fell from another vehicle on the M3 in Surrey four years ago. The Pounds 3.4m awarded by the High Court at Birmingham was said by her solicitors to be the biggest ever for a personal injury. It covers compensation, loss of earnings and the cost of employing two nurses to care for Ms Leung. The award was made against the driver of the car from which the luggage fell.</p>

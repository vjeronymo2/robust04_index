			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Orange County Performing Arts Center subscribers who bought tickets expecting  to see Sarah Brightman starring in "The Music of Andrew Lloyd Webber" will now  get what they paid for. Under the original six-day, eight-performance schedule,  alternate soloists would have taken the soprano's place at weekend matinees.  Now, Brightman will sing at 12 performances, including four added  non-subscription dates, over 12 days, Nov. 7-18. Brightman, who is married to  Lloyd Webber, premiered the role of Christine in the London and New York  productions of her husband's "The Phantom of the Opera." She and others will  sing excerpts from a number of his musicals. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Letter: Britain's march from a social market economy Sir, David Marsh ('A hard act for Britain to follow', April 15) is surely right in identifying a gulf between the German reality of a 'social market economy' and present arrangements in Britain. It is a pity that he didn't emphasise the size of that gulf. The Thatcher era has not only left us with a battlefield of broken 'social' institutions but with brigades of enterprise warriors force-marching human and capital resources in the opposite direction from the social market towards the 'free market'. For example, in the field of vocational training, David Marsh is wrong to say that Britain is already actively trying to imitate the German 'dual system'. The core of the latter is the industrial craft apprenticeships for Facharbeiter (skilled workers), as in the metal-working sectors. British training has been, and is still being, pushed away from the Facharbeiter/craft principle of training for broad-based potential capacities, towards much narrower train-as-you-need-them 'competencies'; a trend that the government's National Council for Vocational Qualifications is actively endorsing. When a British government has to turn social market rhetoric into reality - if only to keep up with the probable institutional harmonisation for common EC standards in training and other employment relations - the necessary U-turn will be on a scale to match the retreat from Moscow.

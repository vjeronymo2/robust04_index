			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Poverty survey finds gap widening Poverty in Britain's cities has become increasingly concentrated in small pockets of deprivation, two reports published today by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation say. The social research organisation says that the gap between the richest and poorest neighbourhoods in cities widened between 1981 and 1991. Most cities have areas where low incomes, unemployment and low levels of car and home ownership are becoming the norm. These are often close to more prosperous areas where people own their own homes and many households have two incomes and two cars. The areas of intense poverty are mostly in the northern cities and inner London, according to an analysis of data in the 1991 census. But less localised poverty is spread over most old industrial areas such as the south Wales valleys, northern England and central Scotland. Ethnic minorities are especially likely to live in high-poverty neighbourhoods. Pockets of wealth are found throughout Britain, with the greatest concentration of prosperous neighbourhoods in the south-east. A second report, comparing Oxford and Oldham, says that even prosperous cities like Oxford have council estates with marked levels of poverty. A quarter of the population of both towns receive means-tested benefits to top up their income. The number of low-income families grew rapidly between 1991 and 1993.

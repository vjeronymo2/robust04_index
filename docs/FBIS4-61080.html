			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "How the Leaders Saw It"] </F>   [Text] Gennadiy Zyuganov, chairman of the Communist Party  of the Russian Federation Central Executive Committee:    "There was a sense of real solidarity. Political parties and  trade unions marched side by side. With their own slogans, but  together. And this after the pomp and circumstances of the  signing of the `Treaty on Social Accord'! This year's May Day  demonstration was a demonstration by those who disagree with the  extremism of the reforms and the attempt to use the social  treaty to legitimize inequality and injustice.    "It did not work. Even the law enforcement officers were  polite. They realized that fighting and battling with your own  people is a horrible exercise and they showed restraint, despite  being urged on. Only the country's leaders showed no restraint.  Leaders congratulated working people on May Day in almost every  state; it was only our leaders -- former members and candidate  members of the Politburo -- who `forgot.'"    Viktor Anpilov, secretary of the Russian Communist Workers'  Party and leader of "Working Russia":    "This year's May Day demonstration was a worthy response to  the self-righteous `Treaty on Social Accord,' to the spread of  capitalism, and to the ransacking of the people.    "You will note that we traveled the entire 10-km route  peacefully -- if there is no violence from the authorities, then  their calls for `accord' are unnecessary.    "People are striving for unity -- Communists walked side by  side with anarchists. It is a question of rallying the `elite'  -- the leaders of political parties and movements."    Lyudmila Vartazarova, chairman of the Socialist Party of  Working People:    "I have mixed feelings about May Day. On the one hand, it is  good that people came with specific slogans. But, on the other  hand, fewer people attended than last year. Why? Were they  unhappy about the form of protest?"</p>

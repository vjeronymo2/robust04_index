			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / US to delay trade sanctions against EC THE US yesterday agreed to postpone sanctions against the European Community, due to be implemented on Monday in a public contracts dispute, until after another round of negotiations in Brussels starting on March 29. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, also said in Washington he had been assured that the Clinton administration would seek an extension of its 'fast-track' authorisation in trade negotiations 'until the end of this year'. Mr Delors said he appreciated the US 'gesture' of postponing the sanctions. Mr Hugo Paeman, the EC's chief trade negotiator, said in Brussels yesterday the US decision had greatly improved the atmosphere in which the forthcoming Brussels meeting between the two trade representatives would take place. It would also aid him in the preparatory discussions he would have in Washington next week, he said. The sanctions, over US access to the EC government procurement market, would deny European companies the right to bid on US government contracts for electric power equipment, telecommunications and other services. This could cost EC companies an estimated Dollars 40m-Dollars 50m (Pounds 28m-Pounds 35m) a year in lost business. The US is demanding a waiver of article 29 of the new Utilities Directive, which gives EC companies a 3 per cent preference on contract bids. The row is the first public face-off between the US and the EC, and may set the tone for a number of nascent disputes over issues such as Airbus subsidies and steel trade. A joint US-EC statement yesterday said Mr Delors had indicated 'the EC's desire to find a mutually satisfactory solution' when Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, visits Brussels later this month. The statement also said the US and the EC agreed to negotiate 'a significantly larger market access package in both goods and services as the first order of business in the renewed Uruguay Round negotiations'. The US administration has previously said it would seek from Congress a fast-track extension but has not said for how long. An extension to the end of the year should allow the US and its largest trading partners to launch a final drive to complete the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mr Delors apparently emphasised that he sought closer transatlantic co-operation in his discussions with US president Bill Clinton on Thursday. Editorial Comment, Page 6</p>
